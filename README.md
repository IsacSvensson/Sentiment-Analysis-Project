# Sentiment Analysis on Amazon reviews
This is my final project for the course DV2578 Machine Learning at BTH.
Sentiment analysis is performed on a small dataset of reviews from Amazon.

Different models are trained and compared with different parameters, feature extraction and algorithms.
The models are tested on different distribututions on train and test data and also tested on a dataset with tweets, to examine if the models could get accurate predictions with different test data.

Read the project report for more details.
