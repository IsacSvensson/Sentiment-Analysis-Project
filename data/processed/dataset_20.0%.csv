5.0	From the moment my son could safely have a bankie (blanket) through today, he has chosen the Aden and Anais security blankets! We have replaced them due to wash wear (babies are gross) but the quality is outstanding on all their products. They only get softer with each wash and the silky has never once on all of my son's bankie's ever lost a stitch. We used the swaddling blankets as well and they keep you just the right temperature - the patterns are fun and not overly done! I laid one over my face to test breathability and I could easily breath through multiple layers. They keep a tight swaddle and when our little houdini broke free at two months, we found they make wearable swaddle blankets and those became our nightly PJ's with a simple onesie. Legs can move but baby stays covered and arms are free to party all night in their crib! These are my go to baby shower gift - and everyone I have ever given them to - has called me asking where I got them - usually in a panic because there is a screaming little who can't fathom being without them while they get their bath and backups are needed stat!! Highly highly recommend!
5.0	This is a really cute set, my daughter is going to love playing with this in the tub!
5.0	My 4 month old has reflux and drools buckets and spits up quite a bit since he was 2 months old.  Although I go through 2-3 (sometimes 4) bibs a day (yes, it's that bad), these have been a lifesaver. They are absorbent and large enough to cover most of the front of his onesies. As others have mentioned the velcro tabs don't curl up in the wash like most other bibs do. I love that they are plain solid color bibs so that they coordinate easily with any outfit. I love these so much that I bought a second pack! Tip #1: Make sure to close the velcro tabs before throwing them into the wash so they don't stick to and ruin other clothing. Tip #2: Put the bib on with loopy scratchy part of the velcro tab facing away from baby's neck to prevent scratching.
5.0	Great!!! You can hang everything and adjust them any way you need. For every stroller. I Love them Very much
5.0	This warmer has come in handy several times.  We travel by car quite a bit to see family so we can now warm up a bottle on the road.  Just make sure you allow 20-30 minutes because that's how long it takes the bottle to warm up.
5.0	Perfect!  The height is great and the width between the bars was perfect to keep our dog in his &#34;room&#34; without him feeling closed in.  It was easy to put up and is very sturdy.  Love the way it &#34;self closes&#34; when your hands are full.  Would recommend to anyone.
5.0	We got this for Grandma's house.  Our big 7 month old loves it!  He is comfortable sitting, and enjoys being at table level.  I loved how you can pop the tray into the dishwasher.  Next time we go visit, I'll just pop the whole thing into the dishwasher to get any dust off it and be sure it's clean.  I think we will get one for home too, although we haven't yet.  I'm feeling like I need to use the big highchair we got for now - since we did spend $$ on it.  I wish I'd just skipped the big chair and gotten this.  Oh - and it stores away easily too if you want to tuck it away when company comes or you entertain.  Love this chair.
5.0	High quality - my daughter LOVES it!
5.0	We ordered this for our 9 month old for Christmas, thinking that he would grow into it.  Looks like we don't need to wait, because he LOVES this.  It's his favorite toy currently and I can see the different ways he may play with it as he gets older.<br />Now he just loves the lights and the music works well to distract him when needed.<br />The music is pretty synthetic, but the tunes are Mozart, so it takes a lot longer to get on your nerves than some other music toys. I wish there was a volume controll instead of just off and on, but it wouldn't deter me from buying this again for anyone else with a little baby/toddler.
5.0	so cute and fun my son loved this when he was a baby!
5.0	These have saved my life and sanity. My baby is only five weeks old, but he is very touch needy and wouldn't sleep in his cradle, or alone ever. I only need three of these to get him thru the night, bc i cover it in a wool cover and then put  in a sleep sack, feed him and rock him and he's so cozy he crashes out and stays down for three to four hours at a time... in his cradle, alone. This is huge for us. I was losing my mind sleeping with a baby night after night, and he hates being swaddled, but these keep him so dry and snug he has no complaints. Also when i change him the outside is about three times it's original size and filled with pee, but the two inserts feel almost dry in comparison.i guess this is y he thinks he's dry must of the night. I would say these should be a staple for all new parents, whether they cloth diaper or not.
5.0	Yes, like many I almost choked when I was told how much these receiving blankets cost. So for our third baby, I made a registry for people that asked what we would need for our newest addition and added these thinking no one would actually buy them. But two people did buy us sets and I'm in love. IN LOVE. We live in a drought area where temps soar into the mid 100's. These blankets are cool and breathable. They are soft, they are beautifully made. Worth every penny. I will definitely pay it forward for every pregnant friend I have with a registry.
5.0	I bought this over a month ago and have had a few accidents already on it. It works great. It's also really soft. I'm thinking of getting another one so that it's not always a mad rush to wash and dry it before the baby wants to take a nap.
5.0	My daughter had twin boys.Wouldn't know what to do without these pads.They hold everything no leakage.
5.0	I bought this night light for my almost 2 yr old son. He had been using his fisher price rainforest light up crib toy thing but since we are getting ready to switch him to a toddler bed I decided it was time for a regular night light.<br />The light itself is perfect - Just the right brightness. It can be switched between three solid colors (red, blue, or green) or what we call 'rainbow' where it changes from red, organge, yellow, green, blue, and purple...really pretty. The charge on it lasts a really long time since it switches itself off. SInce the light doesn't get hot I give it to my son to hold in bed with him and have taught him how to turn it back on by pushing the little black button on the bottom. We've had this light for almost a month and I've only had to charge it twice...and that is with a lot of use since he likes to play with it as well.<br />It seems to be pretty durable in my opinion. I haven't had anything break on me and like I said, my son carries it around and plays with it. I keep the charger up out of his reach.<br />I would definitely reccomend this night light over anything else I have seen on the market.
5.0	Extremely cute for a girl or boy in a child's nursery.  Would recommend to a friend or fellow co worker.
5.0	I had the boon grass drying and was looking for something different. This was perfect. Easy to clean and fits my various size bottles(Comotomo and Avent).
5.0	Then you'll love this one, too!<br /><br />We bought our Quattro Tour Duo Stroller about a month ago, just after we had our second child.  We needed something compatible with our SnugRide infant car seat, which this is, and it is now my new favorite toy.<br /><br />Pros:  Its features are very, very similar to the Quatro Tour single stroller:  the seats and basket fold down the same way, it's compatible with the SnugRide car seat, car seat(s) load the same way and it folds down the same way.  I was amazed at how well this handles once we've got our 2-1/2-year-old in the front and our baby in the car seat in the back.<br /><br />It was definitely worth the extra money to go with this model and the new folding design.  When we tested this model side-by-side with the Graco Duo Glider at the store (old folding design), we oculdn't believe what a difference the new design made.  There is no way we could have fit the old one in the trunk of our Camry!  This one folds down a little taller than our single-seater, but otherwise you probably couldn't tell the difference.<br /><br />Cons:  This stroller is kind of heavy, but if all you're doing is taking it in and out of your car, it's not bad.  Once it's up and going, its weight isn't a factor at all.  Also, if you have a car seat in the back, the front seat doesn't recline at all.  Neither of these has been a problem for us, but it's good to know.<br /><br />Over all, I think Graco did a great job with this stroller.  For us, it was worth every penny.
5.0	When we were looking for a booster seat for my 3.5yr old, I was really surprised by how little padding most booster seats had.  I wanted to make sure that the one we got was padded enough for long car rides.  This one, the Big Kid Deluxe booster, has some of the best padding I've seen (although probably not as good as a regular car cushion).  It also has nifty reading lights, which he loves, nice arm rests and cup/snack holders.  The seatbelt holder keeps the seatbelt off his neck pretty well.  If I know that he'll fall asleep in the car, I'll take the pillow off so his head nestles in the wing of the headrest.  Sure, he'll fall forward if we stop at a stoplight, but that would happen with any regular seatbelt type booster.  We will probably get another one for the other car.
5.0	My 5 month old loves this thing. She will stare at it for several minutes, and it's absolutely a godsend when she's screaming in a public place or the car. I just bring it out, and it distracts her. The musical excerpts are also of a good length, so you don't get just a few seconds of music before having to push the button again. Couldn't be happier.
5.0	Very light weight and waterproof, by far the easiest mattress to handle. High quality and from the mattres leader Sealy.
5.0	We had this in lavender for our first daughter, and just bought the sage for our second.  They are lovely and soft, and last over time, as the first one we bought is still going strong after two years of toddler love and many washings.
5.0	My son is only 2 months old and he simply loves this, if he's fussy immediately I play it he calms down. Great quality, great sound!
5.0	Arrived quickly! Fits perfect on wooden changing table. Soft and thick!
5.0	Expensive but so worth it if you're looking for a safe pacifier.
5.0	Use this everyday and take it with us when visiting people with no high chair.  folds up and very lightweight
5.0	This is an adorable bedding set. It is of good quality, great price and my child loves it. The material is a little more &#34;silky&#34; or &#34;polyester&#34; feeling than I like, but it is an overall excellent choice. I purchased two sets of these and have owned them for 6 months now, they have been very durable and are well made.
5.0	Great diapers highly recommended family & friends tell me these are the best so far so good
5.0	I ordered the Baby Confynose for my grandson after reading other reviews.  I couldn't be happier.  It truly does express mucus and makes the baby and his mother rest better.  It is a real family treasure to help relieve the blockage in the baby's nose, and keep him comfortable afterward.  It is also easy to use, and easy to clean.  I highly recommend this item!
5.0	Came early and it looks like the picture
5.0	The product was perfect for what I needed.  The size was just right and the colors matched perfectly with my scheme.
5.0	For $10, this decal made my office space extraordinary, I'm always getting compliments on it. Very sharp looking and high quality. Good for smaller spaces, though---it wasn't as large as I thought it would be.
5.0	My newborn is 3 weeks old and he will spend 30-45min at a time just lying on his back batting at the hanging toys.  This is the only gym we have, so I can't compare it to any of the other play gyms, but I can tell you that this is a perfect solution for newborn playtime.
5.0	Got this for my nephew was not disappointed
5.0	These are great for my special needs daughter.  We are able to twist and bend in all sorts of different directions.  We are not yet sure if she is right or left handed so we are able to bed either way and that is awesome too!  Wish there were more designs but ducks are very cute!
5.0	The clip that came with the carseat bit the dust.  I put this one on and am very happy.  It works even better than the original clip!
5.0	If i could give this diaper 10 stars i would! It fits great, very trim and slender through the leg area, NO bulk. It is the softest diaper i own! My son is turning 2 in 2 weeks and has plenty of room left in a large :D
5.0	I'm amazed at how often I use these things!  I actually just left one at a restaurant, so I'll be buying another pack of these.  I keep them in my diaper bag, and we use them to attach toys to restaurant high chairs, the stroller, and even to baby or mom/dad when we're at church or something.  These work great to keep toys off the floor, but also so that mom and dad don't have to continually retrieve toys from elsewhere--they're only inches away!  The smallest size on the band can be a bit big for some of our baby's toys, but I just give it an extra loop and voila!  It works great with any size of toy!
5.0	The stroller has been all that we expected; wanted something easy to handle and easy to let up and down; it has exceeded our expectations.  Thanks for making life a little easier. Our 15 month old looks forward to  getting in and strolling the neighborhood or strolling the malls. She has been walking since 11 months but keeps her secure and comfortable when it's time to kick back and relax.
5.0	I have been using this nurser system since my first (now 4) was a newborn. I am so glad to see Playtex coming out with new products as my daughter now uses the Premium nursers. We have had so much success with these bottles.... I love the newer silcone nipple, my daughter seems to latch on to it better (whereas she turned away from the latex flat top nipple that comes on the nursers with the slide up burper - however my sons both took the flat top latex nipples), the dome lids are so much easier to get off of these bottles then the slim caps that come on all the others, and I love love love the clear nurser so that I can see how much formula she has drank.<br />As far as mothers not being able to mix 8 oz of formula (powder) in a bottle... I am just not so sure what they are talking about. I prepare bottles on the go all the time and have never had any issues.<br />I also love the breast pump adapter!!! Wonderful product Playtex has come out with here... wonderful!
5.0	Easy to assemble.  Easy to open and close.  Both kids (2 and 4.5) love it.  The color is great!
5.0	With creativity I was able to fit this on my schwinn jogging stroller. It doesn't go up all the way but it's perfect I still put baby's coat on I mostly bought it because my toddler loves to kick off his shoes and after a couple of lost shoes this is an awesome shoe saver lol. And bonus keeps his little legs n feet warm.
5.0	well, thinking for putting this in the tub for my little girls toys as I cannot find a corner to fit it in at her height.  Either it is a solid wall and a wall with the closet or the solid wall with the window on it and either way the ahmmock is so large it will not fit in between.  We are moving in spring so maybe we can find a house to fit the hammock.
5.0	I bought this for my friend's little boy. It is a very cute toy and the wings flap really well.
5.0	Great quality and easy to use.  The locking arm is held strongly by the metal brace and the 'bumpers' on the sides keep it from hurting the walls.  The dogs have tried to knock it down, but failed.  The 'lattice' is small enough to prevent legs from getting caught and twisted, but the material is tough and has survived many attacks.
5.0	This year, for Christmas, I purchased gifts for my grand children that did not require any screen, to include TV's, computers, tablets, etc.  I purchased gifts that were some sort of activity.  The kids loved them.  This is for the baby.  She loved the music.  Baby Einstein is fabulous.
5.0	So cute!  I bought it for my grandson, but would be cute for a granddaughter too.
5.0	I keep this blanket in my diaper bag because it is the perfect, lightweight blanket.  I love that it is so soft, but not bulky.  It has been great to have this summer when a blanket is needed for indoors, air conditioned places.
5.0	First of all, I never write reviews, but I was so pleased with this product that I thought I'd share my experience.  The Ergo Performance carrier is simply great.  I never thought I'd find a baby carrier that would work for me, but I am so happy with this purchase. I have always had a lot of back pain and I've never been able to use another carrier for more than a few minutes before I had to give up. I was hesitant to purchase this, due to the price, but I have no regrets.  This carrier really distributes the weight evenly and it doesn't hurt my back at all.  I was so surprised...I really didn't think a supportive, comfortable baby carrier existed.  My 5 month old daughter loves it, and it is very easy to use. The materials it is made of keep the carrier relatively cool, and it does not feel constricting when I wear it. The quality is excellent and it is clearly designed and sewn very well. It is not too bulky and folds up easily. My husband likes it, too. This purchase was worth the extra money and I think we'll be getting a lot of use out of it.  I wish I had gotten it sooner!
5.0	We received this as a gift when my son was about a month old. From the first time we used it, until he was about 3 months old, he loved it. Sometimes he would entertain himself for an entire hour - great break for me to eat and shower! I would highly recommend this toy. It is well worth the money.When he was 3 months old (an learned to roll over onto his stomach) he lost interest.
5.0	The product is what is says it is.  Very easy to use.  I have bought other products where it took several steps to just put on the wall and by this time didn't go up very smooth.
5.0	I didn't know about this bottle until my third child and I so regret that. I couldn't understand how a small bottle nipple could be compared to the breast but this one I understand. They work really well (no problems with airflow and baby getting milk out) and because they're made with silicon, they're soft and easy for baby to handle and mom to clean. All of the daycare providers loved them too!  They always knew which bottles were ours. We bought 2 small ones when she was small and then bought 3 big ones as she got bigger. Hope to use them with one more baby. Well worth the money!
5.0	This product is amazing!! Every first time mom needs one!! There are so many times you need to put the baby down and don't always want to fire up the swing or get out the high chair and the podseter is perfect! My baby will take a nap in the podster anywhere! We take it everywhere with us even the beach!
5.0	Got it fast. And love the set!!
5.0	This is one of the best purchases I've made in a long time! This highchair is so lightweight and easy to fold up and store, but we are using this daily as our highchair. We are so excited to take it with us for Thanksgiving dinner at my in-laws' house. Usually when we go over there to eat we have to hold our youngest in our laps--not anymore!! I didn't want another big, bulky highchair and we got rid of ours about 3 years ago. Such a smart design and the fabric cleans so easily. How do I know? Because the second day we had it my toddler threw up all over it...I just scrubbed it with a wet towel with dish soap and it's as good as new.<br />It's funny that some reviews have complained that the tray is too small. Well, this is a TRAVEL highchair, clearly stated in the product name. It provides plenty of room for what any young child would eat. Unless you're serving them a steak dinner, you will be fine!  Also, the tray is sized smaller than a regular highchair because it's made to fit in the handy pocket in the back of the highchair so that you can have everything together when you zip it up and take it with you. They have thought of everything, and we couldn't be happier!
5.0	This is the third double stroller that I have owned, and is without a doubt the last!  My Graco double was so heavy that I had a hard time pushing it, and it took up every inch of space in the back of my minivan.  Next I tried the Peg Perego Aria Twin and loved how lightweight and compact folding it was - but that was it!  It was the flimsiest piece of junk I've ever seen.  The stroller felt like it would snap in two every time we pushed it with two kids in there.  Not to it was impossible to steer without some serious muscle power, and it took 5 minutes to get it to close properly.  We were hesitant to spend the money on the Twin Traveller, but are very happy we did!  It is durable and sturdy, it is amazingly easy to push and get up curbs, the handles are positioned just perfectly for a comfortable hold, and it folds down to the size of a bag of golf clubs.  I have five kids, and have become quite the stroller critic over the years.  The only bad things I see with this model are that the baskets are a little small, and there is no child/parent cupholder.  When compared to the other drawbacks of the other doubles I've owned, these issues are very tolerable!  I highly recommend this stroller!
5.0	I bought another bath toy organizer on here a while ago, it's fish-shaped and really cheap. Don't waste your time/money on other organizers. The Skip Hop Tubby is the best, and even though it's more money than a lot of the other organizers, there's a reason for that. This organizer actually sticks to the bathtub wall and stays there (I can't stress this enough), and it dries quickly, and holds a lot of toys for the size. Don't think, just buy it!
5.0	sturdy; bought for a person who had twins - wonderful way to separate time for each child
5.0	This seems to be just the right balance between firm and comfy, the ONLY place where my baby has slept through the night starting at 5 weeks, and had to wake her up after she slept 9 1/2 hours 3 nights in a row!! Would highly recommend this mattress.
5.0	Very cute little bath toys. My daughter is 7 months old and love to chew on them and throw them around in the tub. Great quality product. Great price.
5.0	I love this blanket...it is just the right size and so soft. My 7-month old loves to run his hands over the fabric. It has held up wonderfully for 7-months and still looks brand new. We used it all winter when we were going out. I would definetly recommend this blanket to anyone...I would even like another one!
5.0	LOVE this diaper!! no problems and it held up very well.Plus my son isn't skinny,so it works great on him.
5.0	I think this is the best bottle out there!!! My daughter is very picky when it comes to bottles! When I first introduce this bottle to her along with warm breast milk I put a little breast milk all over the nipple and boom she drinking it right away!!!!! :) I was so happy that we finally found the right bottle for her:) (6months) I can now pump whatever I want so I have breast milk stored :)
5.0	We absolutely LOVE these. I have 6 kids and have used them consistently. Right now I have a 2 1/2 y/o (lol yes we are potty training but with a new sibling you know how that is going!) and a 4 month old so these are great. They are perfect sized for a BIG mess or for 2-4 smaller messes and with the tie handles you can close and open as needed. Also we use them for messed clothes whether it be from diaper explosions or just down right dirty. We even use them for older kids clothes (shirts, socks, undies, bathing suits...a pair of my older kids pants wouldn't fit but the rest does, and I'm talking older like 10, 11 and 17!) These are great for sooo many things I don't have the time or space to list them all and for every one I can tell you I'm sure someone else can think of 5 more :-)<br /><br /> So I'm going to give a few of you a very simple and logical answers to a two of your problems<br />1) The smell is too strong.<br />  Ok. So I can't completely disagree with this BUT of course when something is scented and is contained the smell is going to be stronger when you first open it and keep it in the same packaging. I have a quart sized Ziploc type bag in the diaper bag and that makes them portable and the smell isn't as strong but still you smell the scent not the poop (WHICH just a IMO, these work so great and even when the scent is really faded I would still rate these better then the others I have tried because they really keep the scent in and the scent of the bag I think is more for parents to think it makes it work better)<br /><br /> Also for those of us that use them at home I put the in a used wipes box and feed them through this helps lessen the smell AND bring me two the 2nd problem some people have had trouble with<br />2) The are hard to use (get out of box)<br />  So I have a solution for this... when I get a new box I open it completely and then separate it in thirds. Don't separate the bags  just put them in a empty pop up wipes box then carefully feed one through the pop up area and then gently pull up and use, the others will follow as long as you don't yank them out too hard or pull too fast. Easy, simple and you are re-purposing something :-)
5.0	Great organic comforter. I did not have any problems with washing or shrinking like the previous reviewers. My 2 year old loves this comforter.
5.0	These are the best ever! I have rather large breast so for me these were a great side and fit comfortable in my bra. I put them in upside down so the point of the heart faces up. I have found they stay in place better this way. They stop leaks and I have not leaked through them! Highly recommend!
5.0	I bought the North States Superyard 3-in-1 Metal Gate and then got two of these extension packs.  It works great as a kiddie corral for my 8 month son who crawls.  I can put him down and take care of other things without worrying about him getting into something.  My only small comment is that it was a little tricky to figure out how to link the gates together at first, but once I did figure it out, it was simple to do the rest.
5.0	This seat protector is AWESOME. It is much sturdier than the others we looked at and they protect the entire seat for a fraction of the price. They are very thick and once they have been removed from the original packaging, they regain their form. The raised area of the protector is a little small for the alpha elite car seat, but they still perform very well. Best part is that there are no more marks left on the seat in any of the vehicles that we have these in.
5.0	These bottles are GREAT-the only bottle and nipple my baby would use-  The only place I can purchase them is on-line at Amazon.com
5.0	These are the best and everyone should have them. Waited forever for them to come back in stock and ordered the day they did for a great price!  My daiper bag is so organized and it will be easy to keep it that way!
5.0	So tiny, & it has a great case. This will be easy to travel with when we go on vacation with the kiddos, as our old thermometer we used to travel with was several times the size. Easy to use, too.
5.0	Absolutely LOVE THIS!!
5.0	We went to Santa Cruz CA to adopt a baby a few years ago. He was in the NICU and was detoxing from Methadone. The doctors were using Morphine Sulphate orally every 3 hours. The timer on this was beyond useful since we used it to wake up for the midnight, 3 am and 6 am doses. Also it helped to remind us during the day but we were on high alert since he was the only baby we've adopted. After 8 weeks he was detoxed and we used it infrequently but when we needed it was a Godsend.
5.0	"Sophie is a great teether.  Her head squeaks when chewed, which is apparently very satisfying, and she has a second squeaker in her tummy.  Her legs are the perfect length/size for those \\""hard to reach spots\\"" on the side gums. My 12 month old little boy has loved Sophie since he was about 5 months old.  He doesn't like most teething toys, but he wants her!  In fact, we have 2.  One lives in his crib, and the other moves around our house.  Sophie is very sturdy, so I don't worry about him biting anything off.  And she is BPA free, which is comforting.  I also like that Sophie has been made exactly the same for generations in France.  She has stood the test of time- she is a classic.  I can't recommend this toy enough!"
5.0	Good quality seat. Much less expensive than most out there. Folds up really flat- great for tossing in the car and easy to manage- even with a bulky car seat and a diaper bag in tow! The little sun & moon toys are a bit annoying- they are attached to a pocket in the front of the seat and they get under the baby's feet and bug the heck out of him. I will probably just snip them off with scissors, so no big deal. This seat is totally worth the money!! <br />
5.0	Our first child had chewed on the spout so much that it couldn't be called &#34;no spill&#34; anymore, but the rest of the cup was still in great shape. So, when our second child came along this was the perfect solution to give new life to the old sippy cups. I'm sure we'll order more when child #3 needs them in a few months!
5.0	After using the Carter's brand sleeping blankets for awhile, my daughter started outgrowing them & I went on the hunt for something lightweight to replace them. This is perfect! I would highly recommend it.<br /><br />The size is a little larger than I was expecting, but it was actually a pleasant surprise. I think we'll get a lot longer use out of it. It's very soft & like other double gauze products, it softens up more with each wash. Having a zipper on the bottom as well as the top is a huge convenience. I love that I don't have to completely take this off to check or change her diaper. I'm tempted to get another just to have as a backup, we use this nearly every day.
5.0	Nice quality, shipped fast. Went to their website and ordered more!! This review is making me write more words.. Don't know what else to say about leggings
5.0	Very good for my daughter , she like it , it's colorful good for kids bathroom training and comfy for sitting on it
5.0	This is a must have for a toddler that has a hard time going to sleep. Choice of sounds, volume and length of time. Worked wonders.
5.0	Love this bib! They usually last me about 2 years and then the rubber(?) wears off quite a bit, but that's a pretty good run! They are so easy to clean (just wipe!) and they catch everything even liquid really well, and I like that they have the open pocket but are soft, not like the formed silicone ones. If you don't clean them immediately then food will dry on and you will have to soak a bit, if you scrub too hard you'll damage the covering. In a perfect world you'll always clean in right after eating, but in a toddler world...It's best to have two of these because if you do forget to clean one right away it might be really wet, so good to have a back-up. Two is all you'll need though, I swear!<br /><br />These do supposedly have a lifetime warranty, you can return them to be refreshed, but really that doesn't seem worth the cost/effort to me. With a two year run you'll probably only replace it once. I just bought what will probably be my last one, pretty sure by the time it's ready to wear out my 2.5 year old will be long out of bibs!
5.0	I first start to use it when my baby is 6 months. and now she is 15 months. we use this everyday. very easy to smash and wash.
5.0	I love these products. My 3 month old just was able to transition to this from the Halo swaddle and it's wonderful for the warm summer nights and he has plenty of room to grow into it :)
5.0	my girls loving playing with these but mostly out of the bath.  but they do work fine in the bath as well! they stick to the bathtub walls. and i ordered the &#34;boy&#34; set for my girls....i'm not really sure why a duck, a kite, a soccer ball, an apple, etc....are considered &#34;boys&#34;. they should re-label these as for all kids!!
5.0	The mat was what we expected it to be. My 3 yr old can easily roll it up by himself and put it away. The material is soft and washes well.
5.0	I am super in love with this carrier! My son instantly falls asleep when I wrap him in this! Great price too!!
5.0	Perfect for my new baby, Love Dr. Brown but the price was unbeatable and this will help get us by for a few weeks ounce our son is born.
5.0	This worked wonders in clearing up my grandsons nose. With one push of a button and a little wiggling, he was able to breath again.<br /><br />There is a trick to it… You have to hold the opposite nostril while you are sucking out the mucus or the suction will be weak. It was super easy to clean. I just rinsed out the collection cup under hot water in the sink and that was it.<br /><br />The one nice thing is that it came with 2 tips that can fit different size noses, and they’re not disposable. Yeah!<br /><br />This was a solid purchase that I'm glad I made. It's durable, easy to use and does the job quickly.
5.0	I bought two of these to tie back the curtains in the nursery. They look just like the picture - they are adorable and fit right in with my bumble bee theme! They were definitely worth the money.
5.0	I LOVE THEM!!! My Daughter is now 19 months old.  When we brought her home from the hospital, I bought these.  She had a very hard time latching on to the breast (the flap of skin under her tounge is longer than average), and had a hard time latching onto the advent bottles that I already had.  This playtex nurser was a god sent.  She latched on great from day one, I almost never had to burp her (from the begining)  She only spit up a handful of times, and I am positive that it is because of the collapsable liner.  Why would you use a bottle that is filled half with air?  And when they are done feeding, and continue to suck they are still not getting any air!
5.0	High quality, hand-made, wooden infant toys. My 4 month old loves these toys, especially the teething ring. I love that I know he isn't mouthing on plastics or chemicals. These toys will last for a very long time!
5.0	Graco has it down, just pop your base in & your child carrier & ready to go. All from just the car to stroll. Ease of use great and sturdy construction. Excellent investment!!
5.0	Bought this for my 11 year old daughter, who loves hello kitty, and she just loves it! Wish there were more colors.
5.0	After a lot of research I settled on this stroller and it was a great buy. Made and very sturdy. I have put quite a few miles on this and have no doubts this will last me a long time. Easy to assemble and quick to fold up and place it in the car. Be warned,  it does not fold up to be super small,  I have to lower the back seat in my Subaru Forester to get it to fit. Other than size,  I would recommend this to and runner/walker out there looking for a good stroller. Make sure and get the handle bar console as well. It helps a lot with bottles and snacks.
5.0	I bought this for myself. I used it everyday until my baby started moving more. She took her naps there and was cozy. I occasionally used it to sit on or as a pillow when I was in the floor with my baby.
5.0	I received the hand-me-down crib bedding set for my second child. The bedding set didn't come with a valance nor a crib mobile so I opted out of a mobile due to the individual price and found the matching valance. It's prettier in person and I bought it for a steal. Cheaper than the clearance rack in a baby store! I'm very happy with it and have been complemented on the pretty pattern. It's beautiful against pale blue walls.
5.0	My son managed to break my other gate, which was a very pretty free-standing wood one. This gate is metal and very heavy duty. It was easy to install-- I have it pressure mounted in a doorway that has no wood frame. We use it to keep our border collie confined to the family room, and she was terrified of it at first-- it makes a nice clanging noise when it closes. I'm not sure how it would be with a toddler, I used the standard wood pressure mounts when my kids were little. This is heavy, so I think I would use the wall mounts if I were using it for a tot who might grab on and pull it, possibly down on them. Extra protection is always best.
5.0	After reading mixed reviews for the Baby Brezza I debated whether we should get it, but I am totally glad we did! We have not had any issues at all- the bottles are consistent and our baby is happy. Yes, minor maintenance is necessary, but this amounts to wiping the dispensing hole with a dry cloth or paper towel daily to keep formula powder from gumming it up (I do it a few times a day-not a hassle), and washing the spout to keep it clean. In all I find that maintaining the Brezza is much simpler than hand measuring scoops and spilling formula everywhere. Plus, I never felt the hand-measured scoops were very consistent anyway. It is pricey and definitely a luxury, but if it is one you can afford I say go for it!
5.0	Fits the avent natural bottles.
5.0	I think we received every single play center offered in this website, but this one is by far the best!  My baby loves it.  He will not get tired of playing with it.  The music chimes, sold separately are also a must.  I suggest that if you want to registed for the best one, this is it.  It is good for tummy time and for playing on their backs.
5.0	It 's good .I love it .
5.0	Rubber, attaches around neck and difficult for baby to pull off.  Has a nice dip in the bottom to catch all the food that misses the mouth!  Easy to wipe off and clean.  I have two grandchildren under the age of 3, one is a boy, the other a girl so these colors of green & pink worked out great.  Would make a great shower gift and I love that I'll be able to use for quite some time.
5.0	Works just as I suspected. Like a crust cutter.  But actually I use it more to cut out my homemade bread.  Wonderful.
5.0	This costume was the perfect costume for our little boy's first Halloween. It was easy for him to crawl around in, super soft, and it was warm. The only thing that makes me sad, is that he only got to wear it a few times. He looks so cute in it, and now it is packed away because Halloween is over.
5.0	"My daughter is 6 months old and we love this travel system.  We can put a cooler with 12 sodas/waters in the storage basket for trips out.  It is super light to lift in the car.  We always use the 3 cup holders.  It pushes easily for me (5'6\\"") and my husband (6'4\\"").  It's easy tp clean. We bought it because it was super light and couldn't be happier."
5.0	Perfect size for newborn's or young baby's first basketball and rattle!  It is very soft and plush.  We love it!
5.0	Great product. Well made, functional, and cute. Love that it's reversible!  Bought this because a fellow mother said it was a must have.
5.0	LOVE this - even prettier in person.  Super soft and so absorbent.  Have purchased other bibs from this vendor - tons of cute styles!!
5.0	Great product!<br /> Super easy to use and effective.<br />My 2 year old loves to seat in her seat when we were in lines<br />It is a most have if you want to travel with you car seat
5.0	I'm 6'1&#34; and have found this stroller very easy to push. I do not kick the back of the stroller seat, nor do I step on the bar that is  attached to the two back wheels, because the bar curves away, and I don't have to hunch over to push it. It's very easy to push and glides very well, almost too well.  It also feels very lightweight and easy to pop up on curbs and some stairs. To collapse I push a button and pull teh strap in the middle of the seat. To open, I press the lever and it release and pops back open. Doesn't get much easier than this. My child appears comfortable.<br /><br />My spouse is 6'8&#34;...he does have to bend over to push the stroller, however he has to do this w/ the majority of the strollers out there.<br /><br />I wish the basket underneith was bigger to hold all of my junk.
5.0	Great activity and keepsake!
5.0	"I have so much appreciation for this product, that I am actually writing a review, which I never do.  Our 3-month-old has RSV and is really struggling with the mucus...to the point of throwing up due to gagging on it. I desperately tried to give her relief with the bulb nose aspirator and saline spray, but that hardly did anything.  I purchased BabyComfyNose and it did an amazing job of pulling out all the gunk!  Also, the comfortable wide tip had our baby much less upset compared to the bulb nose aspirator.  While I know there are a few concerns posted about risking your own lungs to illness with this product, I've been doing just fine so far and we decided to only have one parent use this as a precaution.  I also ran the idea by a friend of mine who is a biologist...her response was, \\""if my son had RSV again and this would help, I would do it.  I would do anything.\\"""
5.0	Easily fits Medela breast pumps at a fraction of the cost!
5.0	My daughter never took any other type of pacfiers other than the hospital one, so I looked for the same brand but different color (other than green )) ), pink and purple works for a girl. I got blue ones for my little boy.
5.0	I found this at Target and have completely fallen in love with this portable placemat. It is so easy to carry, fits beautifully into a smaller size diaper bag, it's washable and it has a built in food catcher! We've so many people stop us while we are eatting to ask where we got it from! It's a must have for any parent of a young toddler, and it's so much better and gives us parents a safe feeling to know your child's food is on clean surface! This will be a definate gift for any family and friends that have new babies. 1 thing I will caution you about is when you roll it up and store it, don't roll it up super tight, because the next time it will be harder for the suction cups to stick. This only happened once to me and then the next time I rolled it up much looser and it stuck down!
5.0	we used this all over Disney World last year.  Tons of people stopped us to ask about them on the strollers.
5.0	These cups at first took me a bit to figure out the &#34;locking&#34;. You really have to place the lid just right so you get the lid and cup to match up and click to &#34;lock&#34;. Once thats out of the way they are great. No spills or anything. My 4yo and 1yo both use these and toss them all around while full and the lids dont come off.
5.0	We were blessed to receive many of our baby items from family and friends at baby showers. This was a good thing as I had NO idea what items were the best. I was thrilled when I opened the Zo-li Bot Sippy Cup ----interestingly, my husband and I had heard about it while watching an episode of shark tank.<br /><br />In appearance it really looks pretty much like a normal sippy cup; however, it has some pretty great features:<br /><br />  Weighted Straw: The straw is actually weighted - this is the best feature. What this means is that as your child gets to the bottom of the drink - the straw slides to the bottom of the cup and helps prevent your child from sucking up air - which means less gas and stomach issues :)<br />  Easy Hold Handles: Second - the hands are SUPER easy for kids to hang on to.<br />  Tiny/Flexible Straw: Third, the straw is tiny - and in my opinion the easiest for a baby first using a sippy cup to learn to use. We had a few sippy cups - and my son got the hang of this one literally in about 10 seconds, while the other ones he still is struggling to use.<br />  Safe Material: It's BPA and Phthalate Free Plastic<br /><br />The cup $12 and comes in a larger size (for $15), you can also order replacement straws - which is nice. Also -- this sippy comes in many fun colors. It makes a really good shower gift or bday present for a 1 year old bday:
5.0	My son loved to stare at the black and white images and as he got bigger, we would flip the animal faces ontheblack and white side so he could look at them.  He also like to play with the book and look at the colored side.
5.0	I had found one of these years ago in a military commissary and loved it and was most surprised to find it on Amazon.This is perfect for someone who eats breakfast at work!
5.0	Purchased this product back in August and have now been using it for over 3 months since our little one arrived.  The product is fabulous:<br />- easy to use<br />- easy to set up<br />- great for heating up frozen bags as well as bottles from the fridge<br />- and most importantly, does its job<br /><br />Set your timer and come back to milk that is warm, but not scalding.  If you place a high value on the quality of the products you use and the performance it delivers, this really is the best of the best.<br /><br />We recently ran into a small issue and contacted Kiinde via email for help.  Within a hour, we received a response with an offer to fully take care of the issue.  At the end of the day, I fully believe that you get what you pay for and if you are willing to pay a little more, you get a top notch product with superior customer service giving you real peace of mind.
5.0	Have had this seat for over a year now for my granddaughter when she visits.  Has held up very well and she seems to like it just fine. She still fits in it and is just over 2 years old now.
5.0	Fit perfectly, works well
5.0	Pieces fit my Medela perfectly.<br />Unlike my Medela, the tubes fit into the upper side of the breast shields, decreasing the moisture entering the tubing.  Additionally, the breast shields are all one piece.  This is slightly harder to clean but eliminates the problem of the breast shield falling apart and spilling milk all over.
5.0	After buying the newborn size, I bought these.  Same thing, just bigger. I use them as a prefold, folded into thirds inside of a FLIP diaper cover.  They are very absorbant, wash well, and are pretty soft for cotton.
5.0	These are amazing for those babies who hate the carseat and get their hands working while they are freaking out! My daughter grabbed onto them for dear life while driving!  Saved us from constant screams!
5.0	"I got these award winning popbeads for my son for his first birthday. At first his interest was limited to getting me to take off the lid and then he would intently shake the container making a huge racket and the beads would start flying out. Great fun for him!!!!  He still adores this \\""game\\"".  At about 15 m my mother was watching him for the day and she taught him how to pull the beads apart - POP! - and push them back together - SNAP!.  They must have spent three hours plus doing this and they had a blast.  And he continues to enjoy it - very proud of himself when he pulls them apart.  Lots of clapping is always involved.   Pulling apart the beads and putting them together (even with help) are definitely developing his fine motor skills.  I really think the suggested age for these is a bit young - an infant could fill and dump but not much else.  It takes a bit of strength and coordination to even pull them apart and putting them together is much more challenging and so far has required a little help from an adult.  With some shapes being more challenging then others.  (I do wonder if we got a particularly stiff bunch as the popbeads that came with our Alex Jr. builder set seem a lot easier.)  I also wanted to note that the plastic these are made of feels on the cheaper side - but so far has held up to a lot of toddler abuse with only a few dents.  I was concerned that my son would chew on them and break off and swallow an end but again so far no problems and my son puts everything in his mouth and has a full set of baby teeth.  But I do think that if an adult wearing shoes stepped down on one straight on it could be squashed.  These popbeads continue to be a favorite of my son and I think he'll enjoy for many more months particularly with the addition of the Alex Jr. building set we just got for Christmas. The colors are bright and cheerful and the shapes fun. I definitely recommend this toy for older babies and young todders (9m - 24m) and maybe older."
5.0	This pad is a lifesaver because all of those cute and soft changing pad covers you got at your baby shower just aren't going to get the job done when your little bundle of joy decides to pee all over himself once you take off the diaper.<br /><br />This pad is the perfect size to cover most of the changing pad, and it's soft enough to still provide some comfort. The alternatives at the baby stores are just too thin, this one has some substance. Machine washable and so far it's held up to several washes.
5.0	I like it. Very fast delivery
5.0	This is my son's car toy, we take it everytime we go somewhere. I feel safe knowing that it is organic (safe for him to chew/suck on) and also soft (in case we were ever in an accident.) I thought it was expensive for a stuffed animal but it is bigger than I expected and a good size for him to hold on to by himself. I love the colors - VERY CUTE!! I would buy again!
5.0	Cute little device that has all the sounds a baby could want and perfect for any baby seat.
5.0	These are perfect for cleaning bottles.  I love the nipple brush that's incorporated in the handle.  I change these out once they start breaking down, but they last much longer than any other bottle brush that we've used.
5.0	The cradle is super easy to assemble - it only took us 30 minutes to put together. It's pretty and the wood, although not solid, seems durable and scratch resistant. The mattress that comes with it is about an inch thick. I purchased a mattress pad to accompany it so that it is more comfortable. The cradle does not match the DaVinci crib - which is what we had expected. This product is made by Million Dollar Baby which apparently manufactures the DaVinci line.
5.0	I almost gave this four stars because the directions were a little unclear; however, some common sense made them understandable (for instance, they show the crib sides being attached to the back via the top holes, but in actuality the bottom holes should be used, but you would figure this out when the other screws needed in the same step don't line up); it took the two of us about 30 minutes to put it together. Otherwise, the crib is great. It arrived without major flaws (some paint was scuffed but it was super minor so not a problem). Unlike some reviews said, there wasn't a strong smell. Also, it came with the toddler rail, which saves some money in the long run. It came in only one day through Amazon Prime.<br /><br />Also, it does sit pretty low, but we are very tall, so we just adjusted the springs to a higher position. It will work for nearly every sized parent/caretaker.
5.0	These are super soft and luxurious for your lil ones bumb. great quantity and serves as a multipurpose item! although they say they are reusable wipes, I've also used them for burp cloths and a wash cloth for baths! Win win! Comes in two colors pink and blue
5.0	Super cute pink color and sturdy.
5.0	These sheets are great and at such a price! They are very soft. I use them for my granddaughter's cot at daycare. I bought 2 of them - 1 blue and 1 yellow - and the colors are vibrant. I bought them based on the reviews and I'm glad I did.
5.0	My daughter started making large marks in her crib rails with her teeth. This cover has been wonderful.  I also bought the long one that goes across the front of the crib. These are worth every penny. I wish I had gotten them earlier ... like before she had teeth!
5.0	Actually, I bought this scale so I can weigh my two cats without having to take them to the vet each month as they both are aging and having some health problems.  It's much too stressful for all of us to have to catch them, put them in a carrier, drive to the vet, and pull them out of the carrier just to take the few seconds to get their weight.  The scale is very easy to use and very easy to read.  If it can weigh squirming cats without any issues, I can't imagine you'd have any issues weighing a squirming baby.  I'm very glad I invested my money to purchase this product.
5.0	I have tried at least 4 other booster seats for the third row of my minivan.  I have 2 Greco Nautilus’ that have to fit back there as well and nothing would work!!  This seat fits perfectly.  Easy to set up and my extra kid said it was comfortable.  Love it
5.0	My daughteris 10 months old and when she was born, she was 6 weeks premature and was extremely colic.  The first week I did not know what to do.  There was no way to make her comfortable. Then one night I took out the bouncer seat, put my daughter in it and amazingly she was comfortable and was able to digest her bottle without sever pain and crying.  Then from that day on after every bottle, instead of laying her down during the day to sleep and rest I would put her in the seat and she loved it. She would laugh and was a whole differnt baby. As she got older I would put her in it to play with her toys and again she loved it. When she out grew it I was so said, because she really did love to relax in it and play.  I would recommend this product to every mom to be.  It helped my daughter though rough days and nights, which made everyone happier.  This is a must buy product.
5.0	This is a great quality diaper.  I was very happy that it included inserts in it as well.  The elastic is nice and tight and the hook and loop is great.  It is very easily adjusted for size.
5.0	Love this product! I bought this for my 4 month old daughter. She would lay there and kick away or lay on her belly and hit the key board with her hands for 30 minutes at a time. All the while, smiling and laughing. Even at 13 months, she still enjoys playing with it. I would definitely suggest this product.
5.0	Easy to install, great quality as expected, and fit nicely while providing storage space.  Also seems to be a good price in my opinion.
5.0	I really like the idea behind these swaddle wraps. My daughter tends to pull her Incredible Hulk move at night and can break free from traditional blankets no matter how tight you swaddle her. Sadly, I was unable to use them for long because she likes her legs tucked up tight against her body. She was born 6pounds and is quite small but I was able to use the smaller size then attempting to but a premie size which she will outgrow quickly. My only suggestion is when washing make sure the Velcro is secure on the wrap or it will wreak havoc on the rest of your laundry. Color and material are light to which is important considering l we live in Florida. Overall, a good purchase.
5.0	Bought these for my infant son and I think these are the best plates I've found! The tray is a good size and the divided sections are the perfect proportion. They are nice and heavy- not going to bend or warp or break. They are dishwasher safe (top rack) but not microwave safe, which is still ok. I am just really really pleased with them- I highly recommend them!
5.0	This was a gift for my Great niece, and when it came I thought it was so cute, soft, and just right for her. She is now 5 months old and holding it and playing with it. I am glad I bought it and think it was a good choice.
5.0	This pad was great when we were going through potty training and for spills in the car seat.  I also loved the look and style of it.
5.0	I love this mat!  It was quick and easy to install.  But most importantly, the car seat does not move anymore on my leather seats.  Overall the car seat fits better with this mat - and when my son falls asleep his head doesn't fall forward anymore.  He looks much more comfortable now.
5.0	Love the pattern and looks great on my Granddaughter's crib.  Everyone says how cute it looks with the soft pink bumpers I bought.
5.0	Bought for my 8 month old, but had to buy a 2nd set for my 2yr old since he liked it so much.
5.0	I love these bibs because it keeps my toddlers clothes clean. They also catch the food from falling on the floor. I keep one in my purse at all times so we can use it while eating at restaurants. Easy to clean and also great for art projects!
5.0	This is a very nice car seat. My granddaughter will be very comfortable and safe while being driven around so that she falls asleep !
5.0	Cute way to tie back curtains in a nursery ! They are colorful and can be played with as a stuffed toy.
5.0	Like others here our daughter out-peed the super-duper extra extra absorbent overnight diapers. These keep her dry enough to sleep through the night (hallelujah) and the only time we have problems are when we don't position the pad properly or it moves in her diaper. I recommend fastening the diaper tightly to prevent shifting and making sure the front of the pad comes up close to the top of the front of the diaper (for a tummy sleeper). This may be the best product ever.
5.0	Our son is a little fussy at night time, this swing is PERFECT! Our friend had one and said her son loved it so we figured we would give it a shot. Our son has slept in this pretty much every night from 1 month - 5 months old (current), my wife loves that it is small enough to put by the side of our bed so she can check on him if he wakes up at night. The battery life is also impressive, great overall quality and light weight.
5.0	With my first child nursing was literally painful and so when I found out I was pregnant I knew I had to find something to help soothe.  My baby is not due until February so I can tell you how it feels after nursing but I love using them for the soreness I get from pregnancy.  I've tried it both hot and cold and I'm excited because they seem like they are really going to help soothe me this go round.  Wish I had bought this with my first child!
5.0	Let me tell you I'm a full time pumper so I use it 5 or 6 times a day. And when you clean the valves you have to take membranes out because if you don't milk will dry out in between. So when you keep taking them in and out the part that holds it to the valve will rip and you have to replace them...ALOT!!! In 3 months I replaced 3 sets already. So when I saw this in bulk for cheap I ordered it and soo happy that I did.
5.0	Grandson loves it!  Just what we wanted and shipping was fast too.
5.0	Keeps my baby happy.  Only animal she likes. Easy to clean and great for infants.
5.0	My youngest grandbaby has all hand-me-down toys; this is her first NEW one.  She can chew; she can see herself, this is just a great toy for her age group!  I'm glad I got it for her!
5.0	It's a hit with the baby. She is already eating things that I would never try. Easy to clean too.
5.0	Good quality! Thanks!
5.0	Great quality and price.  These are HARD to find in England for this cheap.
5.0	our five month old son took right to it! he immediately began pushing himself around and within an hour he figured out how to direct it to where he wanted to go.  this is a great product!!   this is injection moulded plastic so there is no paint to flake off. perhaps he is reviewing the wrong item.
5.0	I hate the drop-in liners so when I found standard liners i was so happy!! They fit any bottle, you don't have to have a specific cap or nipple or anything. it's awesome. plus a box of 125 lasts me like 3 months :) way better value than the drop-in liners.
5.0	AS this product is currently not available in this part of Asia I am in, I cannot describe how grateful I am to my brother who carried this saucer with him (well, he didn't really carried it physically but put it on the airplane cargo space) from the US.  Not only has it kept my baby occupied for the longest period of time (nothing has done that prior to this), 30+ minutes, but it is also a great and safe alternative to a walker (which my in-laws kept insisting on buying despite my objections until they see how happy Elliot is in this one!)  Thank you Evenflo!  And please, make it available in Taiwan and other Asian countries, you will have lots of moms's gratitude.
5.0	I have a new grandbaby coming and this was perfect for her home coming from the hospital
5.0	Arrived quickly, works well and much better than its rivals as the leash connection is at the top - we feel that connections at the bottom could lead to the toddler falling flat on their face if they lose their footing.
5.0	Granddaughter ADORES it! I believe it is her favorite to have! Well worth the cost for a child to enjoy so much!
5.0	My daughter loves these balls.  I got them when she was about 8 months and she immediately started playing catch with me.  Now that she crawls, she likes to chase them.  Great toy.
5.0	These Cloud B nightlights are wonderful.  Not only are they cute, but also they offer many different color choices as well as showing several constellations.  There is an automatic shut off after 40 minutes so you don't have to worry about running out the batterues.<br />They have withstood several drops by our two boys and do not show the worse for wear!<br /><br />Finally, they were less expensive than the ones advertised on television.
5.0	I bought this for my son to wear on his first birthday and it was perfect! Soft, durable and fit him great! A year later we were even able use it as part of his Halloween costume (Max from Where the Wild Things Are) and it fit great. He loves it and asks to wear it all the time. I especially love the detail of the shiny gold thread near the points of the crown. Perfect in every way!
5.0	Finally a cup that is glass and has a straw!  I love this cup and while there weren't that many reviews on them when I bought them, I took the chance and purchased them.  I am so glad that I did!  My son has no trouble sipping water from the straw and I love that I can remove the handles.  The handles would have been useful early on, but now that he is 14 months old, he prefers not to use them.  There are many parts to this cup but I am thrilled to have found something that finally works!  I am recommending them to everyone!
5.0	New product arrived quickly in original packaging and worked as described.
5.0	Daughter in law loves it!
5.0	This seat is great!<br />What I love:<br />It puts my child's food beneath him. Our Chicco highchair made it hard to learn to self-feed because the tray is so high that learning to use utensils was next to impossible.<br />It's incredible easy to clean. The tray fits in our sink! Hallelujah! It's one piece so it wipes clean VERY easily. Our Chicco highchair had become a mess because all the places food can get trapped it was very difficult to clean.<br /><br />What I don't love<br />Our kid is a big boy. He is 28lbs at 13 months. I bought this chair thinking we could use it up to the recommended age - 3 years BUT it turns out that the WEIGHT LIMIT is 33lbs. womp womp wompp... So it turns out that we won't be getting all that usage. We will be lucky if it lasts us to 2 years.<br /><br />I'm not stressing it too hard because this will teach him to eat at the table and then once he outgrows this one I'm planning to get an Oxo Nest booster seat. Which I was going to do down the road anyway - it just turns out that now we will have to do it sooner :\<br /><br />TL;DR : This is a very well made seat. Excellent quality materials. Easy to clean. Weight limit of 33lbs. Color slightly darker than it appears in Amazon images.<br /><br />10/10 would buy again
5.0	I only have good things to say:<br />First off, this is just the cutest diaper pattern ever! I'm in love.<br />Secondly, it is very soft - both the outside cover and the inner insert. I really like how the insert is attached to the diaper, which makes stuffing much quicker.<br />Most importantly, we've had absolutely no leaks, even when our daughter was technically too small for the diaper.<br />And I'm thrilled that this diaper will grow with her, so she can keep wearing it at different sizes over several years.
5.0	This pump is just great!  I own the Medela Pump-in-Style which I use in the mornings for my freezer supply of milk, but it's a bit loud and bulky to bring to grad school, so I &quot;invested&quot; in the tiny Avent for discreet bathroom pumping if I needed it.  I find that I am able to express equal amounts of milk in equal time with both pumps-- and as you know, the P-I-S is quite a bit more expensive.  If you are unsure about whether you will be pumping or not, and want to giveit a try, definitely buy this pump.  And don't be discouraged if it takes a minute or two for you milk to start coming out-- my let-down is a little slow with this, but then it's great!  Enjoy nursing your baby!!
5.0	haven't used it yet waiting for new arrival in a few months bought early for new one have to wait for actual likeness of toy
5.0	I received these in a different color as a gift for my twins, and they are so awesome that I had to order more!  I have a set for the carseat, and a set for at home.  Super cute, keeps pacifiers from falling on the floor, and this particular brand fits any pacifier!!  Definitely recommended, and I may buy even more!
5.0	My 9 month old loves these!  We use them in the bath and for regular play.  I love that they have holes in the bottom, which is what makes them fun bath toys.  He also loves to stack them and put things inside the cups.  What a great little simple toy.
5.0	My wife is happy whit the size and quality
5.0	This is an outstanding gait.  It's sturdy, attractive.  Glad I bought it.
5.0	I ordered these for my twins. It does a great job keeping them warm and dry/protected. I would definitely recommend!
5.0	These rings are perfect to secure toys, teethers, etc to baby's stroller, jumper, exersaucer. They also come in handy as a teething toy. Perfect for a baby shower gift basket
5.0	"This weather shield is just what you need. Stable material (used it a couple of times already and I do not have the impression as if it would tear easily). Can get folded back into the provided bag. Is long enough to cover the legs (not quite the feet though) and is generously sized so it should fit any \\""standard\\"" stroller. The only thing that I do not like that much is that the sides (for the ventilation) open easily. They are just attached by two push-buttons that open up too easily."
5.0	This turned out so cool.... I got this for a home made hair bow... and it looks so cool in her princess room
5.0	My 7 mo neice loves this toy. She spend lots of time trying to catch the little fish. Now she loves tummy time.
5.0	These are great I've bought others before that you had to throw away once the bag was gross, but these you just toss the little bag and keep the holder and reuse.  Also easier to clean than other brands.  I highly recommend.
5.0	This is a cute umbrella stroller and it is light weight.  I leave it in my car and simply unfold it and use it at will.
5.0	granddaughters loved the cow, the 2 yr old wanted to take it to the grocery store w her. It's sturdy. Hold a 90 lb child.
5.0	I bought this to corral my son's many bath toys.  This does the trick perfectly.  One thing I had noticed but not fully appreciated when deciding what to purchase was the cut-out handle.  The scoop feature is what really makes this item perfect.  Rather than having to individually place each item in the basket, I can just sweep it once around the tub, which grabs all the toys, and then the excess water drains through the holes at the bottom.  I also like the looks of it, and it blends in nicely with our neutral but mostly white bathroom.  Overall, highly functional and one of the best organizational items I've bought.
5.0	This product was way more expensive than I would have liked, but we are getting lots of use out of it!<br />We use it for my 2 year-old to reach the sink to wash hands and brush teeth and I bring it into the kitchen so he can reach the counter top to &#34;help&#34; me cook. It's the perfect height for both and I'm more confident than if he were on a chair.
5.0	Great and comfortable blanket! Perfect for the 4th of July picnic we had. Very large!
5.0	I got these to keep my daughter's blanket tucked in so now how matter how hard she kicks she's still covered and warm, Oh and they didn't leave holes in her blanket.
5.0	I have the Moby wrap and my little one loves it!  I started looking for something that would be faster to put on, for quick trips into stores, or to keep in the stroller for when we are out walking and my daughter is no longer content with sitting in her stroller.  I found this sling and read through customer reviews, which convinced me to order it through Amazon.  The first time I used the Maya warp, I got frustrated and thought I wasn't going to like it.  I googled some tips for wearing the sling, followed those (I wasn't pulling the wrap the correct way when tightening it) and absolutely LOVE this wrap.  It is a cinch to put on, takes mere seconds (which are crucial when the little one is crying), and she loves being in the wrap (she is 11 weeks old).  The Moby is our must have for longer periods of time that I am going to wear her, and the Maya is perfect for shorter periods of time, or for times that I want to pop her in the sling quickly.<br />I like the fabric the Maya is made with, and it is constructed well, too.
5.0	A great toy for the price to keep the little ones busy.  With the suction cup, it will stick to walkers, tables, high chairs, etc., which makes it portable to take with you.
5.0	Great quality seat. My daughter recently moved to this seat from her carrier carseat. The material is great quality and easily cleaned. The chair makes me feel as if she is safe, lots of cushion and sturdy.
5.0	Very good bag. I can place everything what I need - diapers, light blanket, clothes change, wipes, hats and socks, purse... This bag is great for me, it is not oversized though. Perfect for park walk and travelling.<br />I do not keep baby food with me, may be in this case you need a bigger bag with cooler.
5.0	This seat is easy to clean and light enough for my 3 year old to put in herself.  I found that by placing a hook on the wall next to the toilet (I had to hang it pictures facing the wall for it to actually sit on a hook), it was easy for her to store and take down all by herself.
5.0	It is a good buy. The best part, it doesn't hurt my back or shoulders. My little one is 3 months and weighted 13 lbs. I thought about Baby Bjorn but it only carries up to 26 lbs which means soon enough, I need to look for another one. Ergo baby can carries up to 40 lbs which makes sense to me. I can easily rock my little boy to sleep and put him down without waking him up. He loves it.
5.0	Love this stroller. Super easy to maneuver, easy to open and close, very stylish and plenty of room for my two boys 2 mo and a year and a half. They will have this stroller for a few times with no problem, it's spacious enough and fits through any door. Excellent product.
5.0	This is by far the easiest and most convenient way to store my kids bath toys. People seem to have trouble with it staying up but my husband put it on and the next day we were using it. It actually holds quite a lot of toys and the hanger does just fine holding them. I'm soooo glad we bought this!
5.0	This snack holder is AWESOME! We had tried the Munchkin snack holder which, if turned upside down, allows everything to fall out. So then we were using regular small food containers with lids but if we turned away our baby would turn the container upside down and all the cheerios would end up on the floor. The design of the Munchie Mug is such a great idea! The little cloth opening is soft for little hands to poke through but it has enough stretch that it snaps right back into place when you pull out your hand.  You can turn it upside down and nothing comes out. I agree it is expensive but nothing else works as well and I'd rather have one container that actually works than a bunch that are basically lousy.<br /><br />*Update*<br />Still using this snack container over 2 years later. Have run it through the dishwasher many times, still looks and works good as new. Initial expense seems a little high or a snack container, but has ABSOLUTELY paid for itself. FAR superior to any rinky dink snack containers you see in the stores. Awesome!
5.0	Everything I expected!!
5.0	Confession time:  I<br />ALWAYS cut the corner too tightly near my king size bed and end up with horrible bruises on my calf.....So I put these on the 2 lower corners, and &#34;voila&#34;!!  no more bruises!  Bet they are great for toddlers too...
5.0	Great bedding. Just as described. Even came with a baby bag and socks, which I wasn't expecting. All this was good considering I bought two sets because I'm having twins. The price was also better than that of walmart or other places I looked.
5.0	My granddaughter went crazy over the Monkey dinnerware set!  Dishwasher safe and well made but lightweight and sized right!
5.0	Great size, I love that it has two layers instead of one like most Aden and Anais swaddled. Works great to cover up baby in playpen or in her car seat. Plus it gets softer after every wash.
5.0	I am one of those people who used to think horrible things about people who put their kids on leashes.  Then I became mom to a very busy and independent little girl who started walking at 9 months.  I bought the Harness Buddy for a cruise we were taking when my daughter was 16 months.  I couldn't imagine trying to keep up with her on the ship and she will not sit in a stroller for an extended period of time.  The first time we used it I started having images of her reacting like what happens when you put a cat on a leash, but she loved it.  She enjoys her freedom even if it is limited by the leash.  I cannot tell you how many people have commented on how cute it is!  It is so soft and cuddly.  We now use it in the mall and have seen more and more people with the same Harness Buddy.  Oh, and I think the fact that she is getting exercise instead of sitting in the stroller is fantastic.  We love it!!
5.0	I first purchased a multi-colored necklace and did not see any improvement. I contacted the seller and she was very helpful and explained that the raw form and lighter in color necklaces have been known to be more effective.  My son has been wearing this necklace for 3 months now.  He has had several teeth and molars come through that I found in his mouth!  We have not had to use Motrin or Tylenol for teething since he has been wearing this necklace.  The only complaint I have is it is a little too long, so he tends to play with it and put it in his mouth (when measured it was 13.5 inches).  I have taken the necklace off 3 times to see if it made a difference and every time he became fussy.  I was skeptical at first, but am now convinced!
5.0	This seat has really been a God Sent! It's offered us one more thing to entertain our fussy 4 month old. I got this when she was 11 weeks and would not give it back for ANYTHING. We take it everywhere we go.    We use it a least 4 to 5 times a day and it gets me an extra 10-15 minutes in the kitchen, bathroom, and at the table with our family. We have several kids and each has a job. The baby's job is to be with the family during dinner. She sits in her Bumbo on top of the dinner table and is face to face with all of us. It is not recommended that you use it on an elevated surface, but our family feels it safe in certain circumstances.
5.0	These are great for toddlers who no longer need a sippy cup with the longer spout. This is more like  a cup, without the worry or liquids spilling all over the place.
5.0	Excellent stroller. Highly recommended. Lightweight and feels like you aren't even pushing anything.
5.0	This is the greatest little bag ever!  When used for baby stuff it fits several diapers, a travel case of wipes, pacifier, a bottle of Ibuprofen and a snack baggie.  It's wonderful to be able to just carry this as a wristlet or throw it in your purse...if you cary a big purse like I do!  The material is great and cleans up easily and dries quickly. I like it so much I am ordering another one to use as a make up bag when I travel.
5.0	Great price, good stuff
5.0	Used it for top of a diaper cake, worked perfectly looked adorable.
5.0	I am potty training my 19 month old daughter. She is my 6th child and I have owned a league of potties over the years. The problem with so many potties that I find is that there are too many bells and whistles that make potty time more of playtime than getting down to business. This potty is super simple to clean which is a BIG bonus over other potties. You simply pick up the insert, dump it into the toilet and rinse out the insert. I usually just use a clorox wipe to clean it out. The shield is high enough that a boy will not pee all over himself, but short enough that a little girl will not jab herself while trying to sit down. My daughter is 19 months and 24 lbs and this seat is the perfect height for her. As said, my twin 3 year old sons have used this a few times (when both just gotta go at the same time and one is already on the big potty)and had absolutely no issues with it at all. I wish I would have bought this the first time instead of spending hundreds on other potties over the past decade.
5.0	Fun designs, super practical, good price point.
5.0	This thermometer is really neat and best of all, accurate! I wasn't so sure about it at first, so I compared it to a few other thermometers we own and it lived up to the test. I'm having to hide it from our 5 year old to keep him from playing with it. It's that easy to use! It will come in very handy (hopefully not often) for our new baby arriving any day now! Great purchase and would recommend it to all moms!
5.0	I bought this as a gift for someone and they are totally in love with it
5.0	I bought this toothpaste based on good reviews and good price. My 10 month old son like it and we use it daily.
5.0	"I agree with all the positive reviews. We bought the pink/purple model a year ago and used it all last year for my daughter's lunch pasta, which is served hot. I do not put it in the dishwasher. The bottom got loose toward the end of the year from the torquing when my daughter would open it. Also, I once tried to pry off the rubber ring/gasket and that was a mistake as it ripped a little. Since the ring doesn't come off, I'm always wondering whether my efforts to wash it in place are effective. My daughter says that her pasta is \\""warm\\"" at lunchtime but not hot. Following the directions (long gone now), I fill the thermos with boiling water, put the top on, and leave it to heat for 10 minutes. Then I fill with hot food. I just bought a second one because of the aforementioned problems with the broken gasket and loose bottom."
5.0	Love, Love, Love this baby gym. The lights and toys are perfect for babies who aren't yet mobile. My 3 month old loves to bat at the toys and talk to herself in the mirror. It's a perfect distraction when I need a few minutes to fix dinner, do laundry, clean the room, etc. I recommend this 100 percent! It was easy to assemble, has different settings for different &#34;skill levels,&#34; and has 2 different volume settings. The attached toys are adorable, and can be used even after baby has outgrown the gym. I hesitated getting a gym; what does a baby need a &#34;gym&#34; for? But I am glad I splurged on this. My baby loves it! It has been worth every penny!
5.0	Nice quality and good looking!
5.0	I purchased these Stove Knobs in order to protect our two year old inquisitive grandson from turning on our electric elements on our kitchen stove. They work perfectly and bravo to their inventor.  They are made of clear see through hardened plastic. Directions in using them:  You open the Safety 1st knob cover, pull the control knob off of your stove, place one side of the open cover over the control knob attachment of your stove, replace your stoves control knob bu pushing it back into place and then snap the Safety 1st clear view Stove knob shut.  Easy. Highly recommend this product.
5.0	Great toy!!!<br />One of our favorite toys..<br />More expensive than other similar toys but this has has multiple activities on the shapes including  ie colours,  and numbers, and obviously the shapes..
5.0	These are great, came fast and fit my son perfectly!
5.0	This is very useful very portable potty for on the go. We keep it in the car, if our girl needs to go when we are on the road.
5.0	I already received my high chair. It's very comfortable - my baby can play there, eat there and I think she can sleep there :)) She loves it )))<br /><br />Thank you!
5.0	I can't praise Boba enough.<br /><br />I've been babywearing for about 5 years now - and the BOBA never ceases to amaze me.<br /><br />It is very comfortable.<br /><br />It fits not only myself (5 foot 2 - 115lbs) -  but also my husband (6 foot - 210lbs).<br /><br />We currently use this with our 21 month old son on the back & love it.<br /><br />Its great for trips to places like the aquarium where its to crowded for a stroller...<br /><br />I look forward to using it with a few more kids!
5.0	Just what we needed for the drawers.  And the locks aren't complicated so my older kids can still access drawers.
5.0	safe and east love this
5.0	great for a child currently recommend.
5.0	Fits my Dream on Me 3&#34; Spring coil portable crib mattress perfectly. Loved the design and nice and soft for baby. Just what I was looking for.
5.0	what's not to like, you pull it back and watch it go popping along. It works great on carpet and always make my little one giggle. As an add-on item it was a bargain.
5.0	I love the ducky potty its unique plus its different it was a catch i just know my angel will love this
5.0	Love it! Its larger then what I expected by perfect for 7 yrs old.
5.0	Good quality product, my 18 months old baby likes it very much. No complaints.<br />I would highly recommend this product.
5.0	Bought this for my 5 yr old daughter who no longer wants to use a leakproof sippy cup.  Works great, no leaks.  The very small sqeaky noise when you drink doesn't bother us at all because the leakproof sippies do the same thing.  It is possible to eliminate the squeaky noise by pushing down the little valve in the top while drinking, if you need to.  Nice and sturdy, fits in the cupholder pocket of my diaper bag and in the cupholder pocket of her school backpack and lunchbox.  Nice color pink, not obnoxious.
5.0	First of all the KIDS love them! That is important at their age. They fit well, are lightweight and easy to move to other vehicles. Easy to put together. They will also be easy to clean.
5.0	so glad there is finally a good quality product like twingo on the market. jealous mom?
5.0	We bought these locks a year ago when our wonderful little ferrets figured out how to open the cabinets and wreak havoc.  For those of you who own these little critters, you know that ferret-proofing is sometimes harder than child-proofing.  Unlike other types of locks, the doors don't open at all until you use the magnetic key.  This is important so little heads and paws can't wriggle their way in.  They worked beautifully for us.
5.0	Even the thought of car seat installation fills me with so much rage that my family and pets fear for their safety. I was intrigued by the SureLATCH and am so glad that I did. Installation was just as easy as advertised. In my Mazda CX5 it took 3 minutes total, including undoing it and adding a towel under the base to adjust the angle.
5.0	These are great! Our little on took to these immediately.  Easier than I thought to clean.  Fooling them can be a little messy but a funnel would work perfect.
5.0	Worth every nickel. (pennies are gone soon) Buy today if you got one on the way! Loved ones at very young ages are hard to keep entertained! Let this do it for you!
5.0	This was the camera I purchased for my first baby, based largely off of reading reviews on Amazon.<br /><br />I will be short.<br /><br />Had it for 13 months.<br /><br />Battery still lasts 5-6 hours a day while on.<br /><br />Screen is just as bright as first day and the microphone is incredibly sensitive to any of the babies movements.<br /><br />Through many drops, absolutely no performance issues.<br /><br />Would but for any of my close friends for their children.
5.0	I just bought a new car with leather seats. I have  2 boys, 4 and 10 months, and these really have saved my seats.  My son's (4) feet hit the back of the seat and before I got them I was constantly cleaning the back of the seats. These are perfect, inexpensive and easy to get on. Shipped very quickly.  I would recommend them.
5.0	excellent quality product. Recommended 100% to the entire community. The product is as described. Therefore I give it 5 stars.
5.0	Great activity centre. I bought this for my 4 month old baby. Ensure that your baby has soft shoes on, so that when he/she jumps it's not hard on his/her feet that can result in a broken toe. But overall, great buy.
5.0	I absolutely LOVE this product-- just make sure you have back seat thingies to strap it to!  otherwise it will be useless (one of my cars is a sedan and another is an old mercedes, which dont have headrests)
5.0	Works as described. My son loves to chew on it. It's a very soft cushiony guard rail. Don't put it in the drier or it will shrink :/
5.0	spunky has got to be the perfect stufffed animal.  it is easy for little ones to hang on to, soft and has no parts to come off and be swallowed.  and best of all he is machine washable.
5.0	Whenever we use our Bjorn in the winter I don't have to worry about bundling up our son or having to wear a jacket for me that's big enough to wrap around him: this is perfect!  I love it!  In Tacoma, it rains: A LOT!  And I've gotten a lot of complements on it too!  The Baby Bjorn Carrier Cover is lightweight and super simple to attach, plus, it's so cozy and warm, I never worry about our baby being too hot or cold: it's perfect!  I love it!!!  *Excellent gift idea for baby-showers too!!
5.0	Very cute, great gift for first Father's Day!
5.0	These are the best bears. My 9 year old still carries the one he received as a baby and my 2 year old took to them as well. They are the perfect size and feel great.
5.0	This is the best thing for my little girl. and I feel that she actually sleeps faster and better in the swing.    The batteries could be expensive if you use it more often. It only runs on batteries.
5.0	Helps with nursing 100%. My wife used it every day, until she got the hang of nursing. I highly recommend this product to anyone.
5.0	I love the size, perfect for an infant to swaddle in!
5.0	My daughter-in-law LOVED it! She had been looking for this because she hadn't received it as a gift.
5.0	This gate is easy to install and works great for keeping our toddler granddaughter within the designated play area (family room). It also works great for keeping our dogs confined when we don't want them roaming around the house during our absence. The nice thing about the latch on this gate is that it latches securely for being &#34;kid proof&#34;, but for pets, it can latch without locking, so that it's very quick and easy to open pass through the gate, and close.
5.0	Everything as advertised. Shipping on time.
5.0	These cups were exactly what i was looking for and they came right on time and were exactly how they were described.<br /><br />I would recommend these cups to anyone with kids.
5.0	Works great.  My daughter, who is 20 months, uses it well.
5.0	Grandchild loves this set!
5.0	Love this! Love to color and zoom feature!
5.0	Perfect waterproof mattes pad. It isn't loud and crinkly like others.
5.0	Bright colors and lights! Finally found a play mat that entertains the little guy! :-)
5.0	My sister loves all things sugar skull so I know she will love these. Really well made and super cute!
5.0	Great for toddlers who only need a spare diaper or two, wipes, and a sippy cup for a quick trip.  My son loves it and so do I.
5.0	We love these Babiators.  They fit on my baby well and stay on better than most. They are durable (because they certainly get tossed around often) and don't break when sat on. Perfect for the pool or just playing outside.
5.0	love it...buy this one!!!
5.0	Bought for my grandchildren to take on a trip.  So far I love it.  Have used for shopping trips, folds easily and is much easier to handle than our old one. Thanks
5.0	THE BABY JUST LOVED THIS AND DISHWASHER SAFE, DID NOT DISCOLOR. IT ALSO CAN TAKE A DROP TO THE FLOOR WITHOUT BREAKING.
5.0	My wife and I would frequently find our freezer door open and our goods semi-thawed.  That is, until we bought this little guy.  It's a simple latch, but it's effective.  We put it on the freezer door, and we haven't had a problem since.  There are no problems with the adhesives used on this latch as there are with some other products.  The press mechanism used to release the latch is not difficult or annoying to use either.  When we close the freezer door, it latches into place and stays closed until we open it again.  This thing is great!
5.0	My son wears these almost everyday. He is a very thing boy and its a great product for making his pants fit.
5.0	Not light and cheap feeling...looked everywhere for baby daughters lamp...its perfect and the price is great. I would recommend highly
5.0	I looked at every type of stove knob cover out there.. I didn't like the look of the clear plastic ones that pop open in the front, and as knew as soon as my 17 mo old saw me open one, she would figure it out. I hadn't even seen this style of knob until I ran into them at a hardware store of all places! Simple design, and very effective. Yes, you can still turn on the stove with them behind the knob, but it is too tough for a kid to do and figure it out. And personally, I like how I don't have to take it off every time I want to use the stove, which can be several times a day. My little one messes with them on a daily basis and can't figure them out so moves on very quickly. This was a good buy for us.
5.0	This hands free bra makes pumping easier and allows me to relax. It's made of durable material being that I wash it very often.
5.0	this is such a great product, I wish that when my children were young I had one of these.  They can be used in so many ways.... every new mother must have one, and grandma's too!
5.0	a little bit wide but good quality & really pretty pink
5.0	This playpen works great for my little chihuahuas and miniature dachshund.  There is plenty of room for all of them and is certainly sturdy enough.  We usually keep the play pen folded in a closet until we want it.  It goes up easily and quickly in a multitude of possible configurations.  Sometimes we use it to block off a large area, but mostly as a play pen.  We take it with us to the park as well.  The play pen was well worth the money and is certainly sturdy.  I would highly recommend it for other pet owners.
5.0	My 6 month old son loves it. you cant put it on a high chair tray or you can detach it from the suction part and baby can play with it. Lots of bright colors and fun Lil toys inside the ball. For the money it is so worth it! would buy again
5.0	Super light and easy to carry. Great for grandparents that can't lift heavy car seats. As soon as your child can fit in this GET IT. Seat cover is super easy to clean. Awesome price.
5.0	Perfect solution for turning a crib to a toddler bed!
5.0	Tricky to put together but great for infant to toddler. It will grow with baby good quality and price done
5.0	Bought this for our 10 year old son who needed a little extra boost in our van and this worked out great.  It's very low key and you wouldn't give a second thought if you saw it in the car.  He is pleased that he isn't embarrassed about using a booster seat and we are pleased that he's able to sit in the car with the belt positioned where it needs to be.  Excellent item for the bigger kids who still need some help but are embarrassed with having to use a booster seat.
5.0	We bought 2, one for each car. Love it. Son loves it. Recommended to a co-worker, she bought 2 as well and has no complaints.
5.0	These are awesome<br />Water proof, Velcro sticks well, and dries super fast.
5.0	I bought a single mipump, and I really love it. I've been using it for almost 2 months now and it's been great. I've compared it to other brands that are more popular and I like the mipump better!
5.0	Arrived exactly as described.
5.0	I love this spoon, it is very easy to use!!  It was delivered on time a great buy!!  I have bought more since this one!!
5.0	This is everything I need aka Dad proof. Keeps all the important stuff close by and secure enough for daddy and baby. This is the product that any hands on daddy needs. Awesome product
5.0	I'm satisfied with this product. It is my personal rating.  So far it works well.<br />Thank you very much.
5.0	sturdy, light. my son sits in it but we're not ready for potty training yet.
5.0	After Medela's so called &#34;slow flow&#34; nipples kept choking my baby due to the gushing flow and the constant nipple collapse, I looked around for the best bottles for my reflux baby.  I was not disappointed by these bottles!  As soon as we switched over, these really provided the slow flow my baby needed as well as minimized gas.  These have two additional parts to clean compared to other bottles which can be a pain but it was worth the hassle.  We preferred the natural shape over the regular ones since the baby seemed to latch a little better with these.<br /><br />One negative thing for us was that our baby went past this bottle very quickly.  The level 1 nipple for these bottles are supposed to last until 3 months, but our baby started getting very frustrated with the slow flow around week 4 and the strain of sucking on these started causing distress and she started getting more air.  Since she was also drinking more quantity as well, so we ended up switching over to Avent bottles instead.  So for us, at most these bottles lasted a month although if there were more intermediate nipples between level 1 and 2, we could probably have used them longer.  YMMV for your baby but I was glad that I only bought a few of these.
5.0	I bought this item and absolutely love it.  The material is very soft and perfect for a new baby. The design is very adultish and works great for a person who is looking for something more elegant.
5.0	Very good product, works just as advertised. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a great deal.  Delivered on time and without any damage.
5.0	great value for money
5.0	They don't absorb pee At all, but I was expecting that. Other than that I love them.  Were always in the pool so it saves us money using these rather then disposable ones.
5.0	she uses the net for all her toys...not all fit but she tries...would recommend it to family and friends good value
5.0	The Yochi Yochi is a fantastic idea and design. So far I've only used it as a portable high chair and it works brilliantly for that. The harness is secure, comfortable, dries quickly and it really stays on the chair securely. We have also used it in the wooden restaurant high chairs that no longer have straps or functional buckles-- it works great for keeping our 18 month old wild man in the chair safely for that too. I have not yet used it as a harness/leash, but I think it will also be quite useful for that in crowded public places.
5.0	Got this as a baby shower gift and couldn't be more thrilled. Our daughter is 6 months old and we have used it virtually from day one. She loves lying on it and grabbing for the toys; she loves it for tummy time; she loves being propped in a sitting position and playing with the toys; now that she is learning to crawl, I'm sure she is going to love crawling through the tunnel...only weeks away I'm sure.
5.0	Great baby toy for restaurants! We attach to table tops and he will sit in his highchair and knock this thing around. As it is a suction cup, it will not stick to all table tops but it's easy enough to hold and let them play with. It's not super loud or obnoxious for tables around you either.
5.0	My son has been using gumdrop pacifiers from birth.  He loves them.  I love that there is no hard plastic pieces.
5.0	We went through a few different gates before settling on this one, and we could not be happier.<br />Luckily we live in a rental apartment because the wall where this gate is mounted has close to a dozen holes on each side from screwing in so many useless gates.<br />What drew me to this gate was the fact that it can be pressure mounted.  No screwing involved.  Whenever screwing in a gate, it is very very difficult to get the screws to line up exactly evenly on the two ends and I often ended up with a gate slightly off.  With this gate that is not a concern at all.  Just place the gate in the spot where you want it, pull out the pressure pieces, twist the knobs to tighten, and wallah! it is secure.<br />It is so easy that I bought a gate for my parents house to put on the bottom of the stairs for whenever we come over.  It takes about 2 minutes or less to put up when we get there, and I take it down before we leave.<br /><br />The double locking mechanism is incredibly easy FOR AN ADULT to open with ONE hand, yet no toddler would be able to figure out how to open it. Even if a toddler knew how, I don't think they have the dexterity to be able to open it.<br /><br />Note that because it is pressure mounted and not screwed into the wall, it is not designed to be used at the top of stairs as a hard enough push MAY knock it down.  Despite the issues, a screw gate is the only way to go for the top of stairs
5.0	Exactly what I was looking for!
5.0	Microwavable is a huge plus, and the higher edge keeps food on even when the 2 yr old is struggling to use her fork - other plates that just have a slanted edge result in food on the table or floor instead.
5.0	My little girl loved these keys.  I never actually put the keys in the fridge/freezer, but they were one of the first toys she grabbed and a must have for the diaper bag.  I attached a toy ring/link thing so I could hook the keys to her stroller or high chair seat when we were out or in restaurants.
5.0	Great seat. My only complaint is the fabric has become a little discolored on the seat and no amount of oxiclean has restored it to its original look.  Does not affect the function at all.
5.0	Rubber pants....Just like the old days when I used cloth diapers on my babies (or training pants),great to contain the moisture.<br />  One of my elastic bands is ripping already though...<br />Step up on the quality in future?
5.0	I was looking for something cheap as we all know how fast they grow out of things.  Over all Great item for a great price.  I like it
5.0	I bought 2 of these sayings for each of my daughters rooms. I just love the saying as it is so hard to stay original in this world today. The quality is fantastic, and so easy to apply. It took me about 5 mins., none of it ripped or tore or bubbled. You simply just peel off the back a little bit and apply a small portion at a time. They were such a big hit that everyone that comes over wants one too.
5.0	it was a gift i was told it is a great camera i did not set it up but was told they love it
5.0	My daughter was terrified of baths until we got her this. The first time using it (6mo old), we let her play with some new bath toys and slowly added water in. By the end of it she was splashing and giggling!
5.0	We bought this carseat to replace an Evenflo Triumph because we had a third child and I couldn't fit the Triumph, a booster, and an infant carseat base in the backseat of my 2005 Honda Accord.  This seat is narrow enough that I can fit all three children across but it's still comfortable for my two year old (26 lbs) and seems very safe. I plan to buy another of these when my infant reaches 20 lbs and is too big for his infant carrier.
5.0	This changing pad is beautiful. The color is very true to the picture (paradise pink). It's super soft and fits well. Very happy with my purchase :)
5.0	I purchased this to see if it would really help a fussy baby calm down to sleep.  According to her dad it works wonderfully.  She likes to watch and listen, and has fallen asleep before it ends it's cycle.
5.0	I have read all the reviews of this product and I can't believe some of the negative comments... especially the review referring to its usage in a bottle warmer. I love this bottle. And I DO use it in a bottle warmer. It works fantastic. AND I've never had a problem mixing the formula right in the bottles. As for the comments about this bottle dripping the hot water from the warmer - it's really very simple - just make sure that when you shake up the formula in the bottle that you shake all the water off the bottom of the bottle. NOT A BIG DEAL AT ALL! And Ive NEVER had any milk leaking out of this bottle. You just have to assemble the bottle correctly. It's really very easy. I would highly recommend this bottle. My daughter went back and forth from breastfeeding to the VentAire bottle with ease, and she has minimal gas. It's always very simple to get a burp out of her afterwards. GREAT BOTTLE!!
5.0	I purchased this table for my 2 year old son. I looked at a LOT of arts and craft tables. Everything seemed so large and bulky, made from heavy plastics. Not to mention they hold every art supply under the sun. All I wanted was a place where my boy could sit and color. I was THRILLED to have found this<br /><br />Having the roll of paper attached to the desk is a GREAT idea! It's simple for my son to get a fresh piece of paper! Just pull, and when he's finished, it's easy to tear off. It gives him a much larger drawing surface than a regular piece of printer paper, and a single roll holds a ton of paper! The table itself is a great size for him, and will continue to be for a few years.<br /><br />Overall, if you're interested in this, I say go for it! It's a very simple little table...there's no cubby holes or a million drawers (it looks like there's a drawer in the middle, but it's not. It's a little pull-down compartment that will hold a few crayons or pencils, but not much else), so if your looking for a craft table, this probably isn't for you. My son loves this, and I am VERY happy with this purchase!
5.0	Funny how more basic toys are often more fun. My 18 month old has plenty of flashy toys, but this is one of her favorites. It's great for placing on her high chair tray, and she especially likes when I stick it to the dishwasher door. A great toy at a great price.
5.0	I'm a big fan of the Ergo.  My son is almost 8 months and he's been in a stroller exactly four times - not that I'm a super militant baby wearer; I just find wearing baby more convenient than strollers.  I live in a rainy city so some kind of cover is a must.  I bought a cheaper brand, too (Infantino) and this Ergo one is better quality and fit.  The Infantino one is like a thin sweatshirt whereas this one is like a thin fleece (think North Face).  I use the fleece liner with the rain cover when it's cold and my boy stays so snuggly; I use the rain cover alone when the weather's more mild but wet.  Figuring out the snaps is takes a few minutes, but the fit is so nice and I've walked in downpours and the boy stays totally warm and dry and he seems to like it.
5.0	Replacement battery was purchased for Summer Infant video monitor originally bought in 2011 - works great!  Easy to install, and works perfectly.
5.0	my picky baby girl was taking only these nipples. no fuss, no gas, no colic from these. She didn't spit up when i used these nipples.
5.0	This is a great product!! First off it's absolutely adorable/ cool and it does the job!! I use this product for my daughter for daycare. They don't heat food up there so this keeps it hot up until her lunch time!! Thanks a bunch!!
5.0	Cute gift for baby shower or Easter gift for child!
5.0	Its very useful and softy, my baby really loves it !
5.0	At the request of our pediatrician we began sippy cup training at about 10 months. Our son took to a standard sippy cup easily and would drink from a sippy cup if we handed it to him. He would not however go to it and drink from it of his own accord, meaning many days reverting back to the bottle to prevent constipation or hovering over him with the sippy cup all day long, reminding him to drink from it.<br /><br />I know he loved drinking from my straw when we went to restaurants (just water), so I thought, hey a sippy with a straw... why not? Best investment I've made. The pediatrician was thrilled, straw actually comes after sippy cup anyhow. So A+ there. And the toddler loves drinking from a big boy straw-cup so much that he will hunt it down if it's not readily accessible and ask me to fill it for him. What a change! We said goodbye to the bottle for good. No fuss, no muss.<br /><br />I would recommend this to anyone trying to get their baby off the bottle, or anyone who worries their baby may not be drinking enough without direct intervention. It's been marvelous.
5.0	I Love it! Just like what I expected.
5.0	It was easy to put it together and it is very cute.  The baby loves it and it fits in the space perfectly!
5.0	Perfect fit for the Baby Jogger City Mini Double Stroller! Took the stroller and carry bag on our last vacation and this bag worked well to protect the stroller. We gate checked the bag and got the bag and stroller back in perfect condition.
5.0	We got this for my son after trying the Aden & Anais and Halo sleep sacks--this is the best! The shoulder snaps mean that you don't have to struggle to get the baby's arms in, and it has a fluffy warmth that is just great. I also love the khaki/green combo for boys.
5.0	These work well for my daughter. I've used all the  different nipples by 5 phases up to this point.  Faster flow for this nipple hole can get a little tricky & messy if she takes the bottle out of her mouth mid feeding. Other than that I have no complaints.
5.0	Aside from receiving the item late I am happy with it
5.0	My pediatrician recommended this concentrated version for my newborn since I only need to give my baby 1 drop a day.  It's very easy to administer and will last a very long time.
5.0	Great for my grandchild. The gripe water worked so good. What a difference it makes !  Her Mom is ordering more !
5.0	I'm not sure what the other buyer was complaining about.  Yes, the stars come in one sheet.  But the sheet is dense! There really are hundreds of stars on the sheet.  Plus, the 'filler' between the stars are perfect diamonds which you can also use.  It looked nice to mix them up.  They 'charge' quickly by leaving the room light on for few minutes and glow very brightly.  Doesn't glow all night but really, it's not a night light folks.  The only downside was thinking about peeling them all off when we eventually repaint but that's not something the product should be dinged for! :)  For now, my son loved them.  Actually volunteered to nap, he loved it so much.
5.0	works good but the back needs to be a bit taller
5.0	This is my second time using these. We are doing our daughter's handprint each year for ourselves and the grandparents. Easy to use. I recommend using a fine sandpaper to smooth it out after it dries. We have painted them as well and they turned out great!
5.0	I bought this to get my son excited about using the potty. Worked well. Cute design. Very lightweight if you need to bring it with you somewhere and most importantly easy to clean!!!
5.0	Super cute design and very,very soft! Arrived on time. My daughter loves this for her new son. They soften even more when washed. She loves them!
5.0	We use a high chair that does not have a tray, and place mats are a must since our baby shares the table with us. These mats are great because they can't be slid around by a curious/hungry baby. I also like that they can be rolled up so small and placed in a diaper bag for use in restaurants and friends' houses.
5.0	Favorite cloth diaper. Love the bamboo insert as well!
5.0	Baby loves this, she's been using it since she was 6 months old and still wants to bounce in it, even though she is getting too old for it at 13 months! Definitely one of the best baby items we have - worth every penny. There are so many useless baby items, this isn't one of them.
5.0	My 3.5 yr old has outgrown his Britax Esprit and Graco Metrolite both of which I loved.  I knew Maclaren had a higher weight limit so I decided to try it.  We actually have it in orange so not the one available at Target.  We used it the 1st time today and absolutely LOVE it.  I am 5'10 and never once kicked the wheels.  It is very comfortable to push and I am also pleased with the included raincover.  I do wish it reclined but I don't think that feature is worth upgrading to the next model for us.  The stroller is a little tricky to fold and I'm still trying to figure it out.  However, I still would definitely recommend this stroller to anyone.
5.0	I love it and my small 10 lbs Chorkie loves this to sit at the snack bar and join us when we are snacking or just on the computer.  She used to sit in our laps so she didn't feel left out.  Now she has her own chair; loves it, and has even taken a nap in the chair.  Great material; wipes off so easy.  Also sets up very securely and easy; can carry anywhere!  Have a new grandchild due any day - may share the seat with her LOL :)
5.0	the snugglewool bassinet pad was the only size pad that would fit my odd-sized changing table which came with a paper-thin vinyl cushion. My baby LOVED being put on this pad from birth. We use a bassinet sheet over it - I now want one for the crib. It is so comfy!
5.0	awesome bib...exactly what i have been looking for.  it is soft big enough and water proof.  the built in pocket and teether was ingenious.  i wish there are more bibs available in the stores.
5.0	Bought for a baby shower gift. Mom loved!
5.0	Love it! Just what I wanted for my grandson's nautical theme nursery. Perfect size and gives off soft light.
5.0	Great lids to store milk on your Avent bottles. Can easily be inserted and removed. I hand washed them and throw them in the sterilizer. They are very sturdy.
5.0	Love the feel and weight of it. It makes carrying my 30lb 14 month old so much easier for this short mom! I am still trying to get the hang of settling him in on my back without help, but there is a great instruction manual with pictures that comes with the set.
5.0	I was a little hesitant to spend extra money on a strap when I wasn't sure it would hold up against my daughter - but this was definitely worth it!  My almost 2 year old can unstrap, unclip, and remove all the other types of straps not only from her clothes but from the pacifier.  This strap stays put on her clothes (as long as I put it somewhere it can grip) and she definitely can't get it off the pacifier.  I got the brown and pink striped one just to avoid any possible dot issues so I cannot speak to that but I can say that I am VERY happy with this purchase!
5.0	Great baby gift for the Winnie the Pooh fan.  Although I am returning this item because it is just like what I already purchased it is extremely cute.
5.0	We love the elephant bank. It's very cute twist at the traditional bank. It seems well made. However there was no personalization form nor stickers included with mine. Child to Cherish website offers personalization but there was nothing in the box to indicate that. Either way we like it and will treasure it. I'm planning on personalizing myself with some type of permanent marker.
5.0	My 2 yo loves this!!! She was bored with other bath toys, but loves to scoop up whatever she can in the net.
5.0	Always makes me feel so much better after use. Highly recommended.
5.0	Super practico, de facil uso, facilita la elaboracion de otras tareas mientras el bebe se entretiene de forma segura y relajada
5.0	We were given the shark toothbrush as a gift.  That week, we realized our son was teething.  He was chewing on the shark for hours every day.  We quickly bought the octopus and bananas.  That was a month ago.  These are possibly the best toys, in my opinion, of all my son's toys.  One of the biggest benefits is that I don't worry about him hurting himself, which makes this the ideal crib toy.  Every time we put him in the crib, we put one of these in with him.  It is not stimulating enough visually to keep him awake, AND he can chew on it if his teething pain wakes him during the night.  None of the pieces are big enough that he could choke or gag.  If we lose one of these, we will buy more the same day.  I feel so much  more relieved and not anxious when I set him down and give him one of these - ZERO safety worries.  I am a terrible, compulsive worrier, so that is a big deal to me.<br /><br />In fact, my dad just walked into the room.  I told him I was writing a review for these, and he said, &#34;I hope you're writing a good one!&#34;  Yes, I am.  I had the thought to review these and didn't want to forget to do this, so I immediately started typing hunt-and-peck, which is painfully glacial compared to my usual 90+ words per minute typing speed.  I love these THAT MUCH.<br /><br />My son is 6 months and has just grown out of his colic (the worst colic that any of my 200+ relatives have ever seen), but he liked these even then.  My sister just had a baby, and I am sure we will be getting him all of these products.  My family loves them; they are our go-to toy.
5.0	I ordered this for my baby to wear with his 1st birthday smash cake. It arrived on time & is good quality. It fit perfect & washed well.
5.0	This Graco Size4Me 65 Convertible Car Seat is excellent! The biggest benefit is that this car seat works from infancy to 65lbs. I mean, if you are a parent you know buying one seat that works for this long is a huge bonus. It's super soft and comfortable, and the supports are perfect for the really small babies. The safety rating is fantastic as well. My daughter loves it and never fusses when we put her in it. I certainly recommend this seat. This price is reasonable for the nice product you get. You save money in the long run since this seat will work up to 65lbs!
5.0	A friend gave use an older version of the SpaceSaver High Chair. The original seat pad was not in great shape. This new one fit perfectly and now the chair looks brand new.
5.0	bought it for a baby shower, the bear was packaged in a plastic bag so it was sterile and the fur is very soft. the eyes were stitched so the baby will not be in danger of swallowing eye parts. The parents were very happy about the bear
5.0	The bottle labels work great for any baby that has to go to daycare.  When I went to daycare orientation and saw all the other babies' bottles were labeled with painters tape and a magic marker I was a little disgusted!  I am so glad I found these.  The fit my small 4 oz Dr Browns bottles great so I'm sure they will fit most bottles just fine.  They could do without the ugly little owl picture on each on though!  Regardless, I will purchase again.
5.0	We bought this mattress for our first daughter.  We didn't really think too much about it.  We went to the baby furniture store and ordered the crib and nursery furniture that we liked.  When we asked about mattresses we were directed to this one.  It is awesome.  It is very firm, but our daughter (now 19 months) loves it and sleep well.  She sleeps for 1 2hours straight at night and takes a 2 hour nap during the day.  She had a lot of issues with reflux and throwing up, so the waterproof covering and the fact the smell didn't stay was great.  Clean up was easy - I can get her out of bed, clean the crib, and get her & the sheets changed in 7 mintues!  I would not say he mattres is light and we might get the Colgate Classica 1 (lightweight foam) for baby number 2.  But it's firm and the square corners are very important for a good fit and safety.  We used it in the Creations Baby April crib 2010. We added a great mattress pad  (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001KZH69C/ref=oh_o01_s00_i01_details) for a little more comfort after she was 18 months, but I don't think she really needed it.  She was comfortable already.  5 stars easily, thank you Colgate!
5.0	Keeps my 100 pound rottweiler in his room where he stays all day until I get home. I have had it for over a year and it works great. If you really want it to be strong - you will have to drill 4 small holes in the door frame.
5.0	I've owned and used countless diaper bags (everything from Kate Spade to OiOi to Skip Hop to Vera Bradley) and I can, with confidence, say that this bag is the best for so many reasons.  I have a four year old, a two year old, and a ten month old and this bag makes my life easier.  Here are the benefits to this bag:<br /><br />*the strap length is perfect and the straps are very comfortable, and pretty<br />*the bag comes with stroller straps, a messenger strap, a changing pad, a bottle cooler, a beautiful clutch that can double as a wallet (perfect for grabbing when that is all you need)<br />*it isn't bulky when full so it lays nicely while carrying it<br />*it has a key clip so there is no digging for keys<br />*the two outside, side pockets are handy<br />*there are a lot of inside pockets to keep you organized, including two bottle/sippy cup pockets to prevent leaks<br />*the bag holds a TON without looking too big<br />*the bag has such a beautiful look and sheen to it, it almost shimmers in the sun<br />*this bag can be used when out with friends without kids and long after diapers, so it doubles as a purse and diaper bag, getting more for your money<br />*the interior and exterior are wipe able making it easy to clean<br />*the tops opens really wide so it is really easy to find what you are looking for and it also makes it really easy to throw items inside when you are in a hurry, and you can do so one handed<br />*the top closes with a magnetic closure so you don't need to hassle with a zipper, a zipper closure isn't necessary on this bag due to the shape (I've never had problems with items falling out)<br />*the company, Timi and Leslie, provide a one year warranty and are a very customer friendly company (I've had no problems with this bag, but when dealing with the company with other Timi and Leslie bags I've owned they've been incredible)<br />*Lastly, but most important, this bag is LIGHTWEIGHT, without comprising on the look of the bag.<br /><br />Asyou can see, I highly recommend this bag.  You will not be disappointed in this purchase!
5.0	We've been using this in our son's room for a year, and it hasn't let us down. The battery option is great in case the power goes out, or we are going on a short trip and can't find a convenient outlet, but i leave it plugged in most of the time. The battery life lasts about a week used full time during naps and nights.
5.0	first time dad here, installation is easy using the latch system.  definitely glad we got the infant car seat - can't imagine trying to take the baby out of the car seat every time we got out of the car.
5.0	I received this stroller for free in order to try it out and provide an honest, unbiased review. This was my first experience with a Graco product and I must say that the Relay Click Connect Travel System far exceeded my expectations. I truly did not expect for a travel system in this MSRP price range to be such high quality, so I was blown away then I opened the box. It is FANTASTIC! Sturdy, thoughtfully designed, extremely easy to assemble (you literally just snap on the wheels and shade and you're ready to go). With my firstborn, I had a much more expensive stroller that was ridiculously complicated to assemble, and it didn't have nearly as many features included- I had to spend a ton of extra money to buy the belly bar, cupholders, parent consoles, etc. separately. Graco included all of these things!<br /><br />As far as performance, the stroller is wonderful. Easy to fold, not too terribly heavy to lift (I can manage to lug it into the back of my car one-handed), and is fairly compact as far as jogging strollers go. The two side wheels easily pop off for even more compact storage. I have used it both for regular errands and light jogging. For everyday use, it's awesome. Extremely easy to maneuver through stores and around town. For jogging, you simply click the front swivel wheel into place and are on your way. The suspension allows for a smooth ride, the five-point harness keeps my daughter secure, and there is a wrist strap available for extra peace of mind. Personally, I don't run fast enough for it to be much of an issue, but it's nice to have the option! It does not have any sort of braking system, which is certainly something to consider if you live in an area with lots of hills. I live in a flat college town, so it is a non-issue for us. The sun shade is generous, which I really appreciate. The fabric is also reflective and extremely easy to clean. I wiped up a spilled smoothie with a damp cloth, no biggie. The basket below is generously sized, which, after having a &#34;luxury&#34; stroller with an obnoxiously small basket, is something I really appreciate. The parent console and cup holders are also adequately sized to hold regular water bottles and drinks.<br /><br />The SnugRide infant seat is also lovely! My daughter is 22lbs. and is plenty comfortable riding in it. I imagine she'll grow out of it height-wise before she'll meet the maximum weight. The seat uses the same fabric, so it's easy to clean, and it is really lightweight compared to other carriers I've looked at. The base is easy to correctly install, and the seat snaps in and out like a breeze. It's easy to snap onto the stroller as well, although my daughter is beginning to prefer facing forward.<br /><br />Overall, this is an excellent and versatile product at a very reasonable price point. If there's a chance you might want to jog with your child, do yourself a huge favor and kill two birds with one stone by considering the Relay Click Connect Travel System!
5.0	I love it! So pleased with this purchase. This lunch box was exactly what I was looking for :) Unique, adorable, not too big and easy to carry around. Absolutely love and will more then likely order from this buyer in the future!
5.0	These planes add a fun touch to the baby's room.  The colours are bright and cheerful.  When I ordered them, (and many other items) I received excellent service. The items were shipped promptly and they made me aware of how important my order was every step of the way.  I would trust them with my business again.  Thank you!!!!
5.0	We still use this with our 2.5 year old and it's perfect. It's currently in the high-chair configuration, but we also break it apart for snack time or activities like drawing on the table. Great quality, great price. We plan to use it for quite some time.
5.0	My little guy is now 11mo. We got this about Christmas in 2013 and he was 4 mo old. I'm writing this review so that you can assess for yourself whether to purchase this item or if you are like me to pass it off as some gimmick money making appliance.<br />I did not want to buy this, my wife asked for it for Christmas. I thought it was silly, and a waste of money.<br />I was wrong !  = This appliance is used as much as our microwave now.<br />We set this up Christmas day and I was immensely skeptical and saved the box to return it. My wife diligently read all the instruction and chose the correct wheel that matches the baby formula we were using and after a through washing before we ever used it we filled it up and plugged it in .... and the angels sang.<br />We are able to make a bottle in less than 30 seconds, and it is perfect mix, perfect temperature and all ready to go.<br />You can quickly select your ounces for the morning feeding vs the ounces for the mid day or night feedings, the mixing wheel in the &#34;formula hopper&#34; on top spins when you push the button mixing the formula with the water and producing the perfect temperature perfect mixture , perfect bottle for the baby.<br /><br />Our little guy had troubles with constipation because of the formula so before we ever bought this machine we discovered that we had to put an ounce of baby apple juice in the microwave for 17 sec and then dump it in the bottle for each of his feedings.<br />With this machine I can multitask and have my ounce of apple juice coming out of the microwave within 2 sec of the bottle being ready to go... I would add the apple juice to the bottle mixture and put the top on it and give it a couple shakes ( Not too many as it would tend to foam up in the bottle) and my little guy was ready for his meal.<br /><br />Advise - Yes I have some for you -<br />1. ALWAYS clean it every night before bed. Pop out the 2 pieces on the front (2sec) and then wash it with hot water and dish detergent and let it dry thoroughly. (we air dry on a clean dish towel in front of the machine)<br />2. Use a clean paper towel and run that around the inside the lip where the mix comes out each night making sure to get any formula that may have splattered back on the machine throughout the day. ( this is normal and really not that big of deal ) takes 10 seconds and you're done.<br />Finally once a month follow your instructions and give it a good cleaning by removing the hopper and washing the machine down.<br /><br />We LOVE LOVE LOVE this machine... it's perfect for us.<br />I have only once ever had a bottle come out mixed wrong and I caught it quickly and when I checked the spout that you clean with a paper towel I found a clump of formula. I wiped it out and reran the bottle and it was perfect.<br /><br />Bottom line - This is an awesome machine. You should always follow the cleaning routine religiously to keep your little one healthy.  Our little guy loves it, we love it and I'm sure his little sister who arrives in another month will love it too. :)<br /><br />WARNING !!! - using this machine will make you forget how to mix a bottle by hand, as I'm writing this review I honestly can't remember the measurements to mix the baby's bottle ... other than the apple juice. :)
5.0	Bum Genius is a good diaper, but only if you buy the Snap version. I have a 2 year old and 2 month old exclusively in cloth diapers and have been using Bum Genius 2 years. I originally bought 26 with velcro closure and they are totally falling apart and the velcro is so fatigued they hardly stay closed. The 2 snap diapers I have that are 2 years old are still going strong. I ordered 7 more snap diapers when the second baby was born so we'd have enough.<br /><br />Cloth diapers in general take some practice, especially for newborns. But once you figure them out, they NEVER leak poop and only have pee leaks if they are saturated.
5.0	Perfect frame to display baby's first year - comes looking just as shown on the listing! Easy to put pictures in & looks great up on the wall. It's bright white, not off white.
5.0	This bushel of vegetables is a lot of fun! My daughter feeds her toy bunny the carrots and other veggies, and likes to play mealtime. I wish the bushel or basket was a bit more structured as the vegetables tend to flop out of it, but this isn't an issue for my daughter; and we store all her toy foods in a tupperware anyway.
5.0	I've had this for almost two years now, and we have used the mess out of it! Everywhere we go, we get comments from someone about how cool it is. And that complement is very true! It's sturdy, it's washable, and it is portable! Perfect for my always-on-the-go fam!
5.0	I love my sea lagoon nursery set!!!! What a deal! It came with absoulutely Everthing u need for ur babys crib. U will save time and money with this purchase. The characters in the blanket are so cute and its silky and soft to the touch. I love the soft and safe baby pillow, and my most favorite utem was the stylish baby bag that even came with a little diaper changer pad! This is truely one of the smartest purchases I made for my baby and I cant wait to put him in his sea lagoon bed for the 1st time. 5hanks Amazon!
5.0	Best baby gift ever, perfect for newborns to learn to hold and when they hit themselves unintentionally with a toy it doesn't hurt like all the other hard plastic toys do.  All my babies love this and my toddler loves showing it off to the baby.
5.0	My second week into breastfeeding, I was in SO MUCH PAIN! Terrible, cry out loud pain. It was almost torture to feed my son. But it was so important to me, so I went and bought everything imaginable to fix it. These were all I needed. If you are planning to breastfeed, BUY THESE! Have them in your house before you even bring home your baby. You'll be glad you did. A few days with these and I was fine.
5.0	The Giggle Gang toys are so cute. When they start giggling you can't help but smile and laugh with them Each has a different giggle. My grandbaby loves them. Fun for everyone!
5.0	Super cute nuby monster cup. NO SPILL. Bottom piece is a little hard to separate from the cup to wash but it does come apart. Daughter loves it and I love it too because its too cute.
5.0	Started using this even though baby couldn't quite sit up on her own.  She had so much fun the first time in the shopping cart and the pillows were perfect if she happened to lean over a little.
5.0	LOVE this support cushion.  I have a bouncy swing that we hang from the doorway for my 4 month old and the seat isn't adjustable so it is too wide for such a little guy just learning to sit up.  I saw this cushion in a catalog and went on Amazon to see if they had it too and to my luck they did!  Free shipping and all!  Definitely one of the best things I've purchased for my son.  He used to fall over in his swing and get annoyed and now he loves it!  I would highly recommend this to all parents who have a bouncy, a walker, or something similar.  It even works in the playground swings!  Washes well too.  I just chucked it right in the washing machine by itself.  GREAT invention for babies!!!
5.0	Love the different devices
5.0	This Turtle thermometer is perfect for helping me set the right bath temperature. Those ducks that let you know when the water is too hot suck, too hot is so vague it doesn't tell you what temp the water is at, its always either too hot or cold to the touch. I'm a first time parent with a 3 month old boy and since getting the turtle he has responded to bath time in a much more positive way. He really seems to enjoy it now.<br /><br />Its super easy to use, there is no on off button you just place in the bath as you fill it up. It will display what temp the water is and all you have to do is adjust as you fill it up to get the temp you want. The directions instruct to stir the water as you fill up so you even the temperature out and reduce hot and cold spots. If too hot or cold the red light will blink.<br /><br />The only con I see is that the battery is not replaceable, but the turtle should last 2-3 years which is fine with me for the price.
5.0	My niece LOVES this book...it's attached to her car seat and it's her favorite to play with,  It's a great spin on a classic storybook!
5.0	This is for a Christmas present, so I don't know if she likes it yet.  But I am sure that she will.  They are very, very cute.
5.0	Our son loves this and it has helped bedtime tremendously. The fact that it is portable makes it so easy to put right his bed and help him fall asleep.
5.0	This worked wonderfully for our nearly 4 year old daughter who had been biting her nails for 2 years. Nothing worked: nagging, reminding, yucky tasting nail polish, etc. When she wasn't biting her nails, she was chewing her shirt. Both have pretty much stopped with this. Some tips:We did put tape on her fingers for 2 or 3 days to remind her not to bite her nails and use the necklace instead. Also many people said they never use the bracelet. We have our daughter wear it in bed since the necklace would be a hazard and she bites often when she is tired. Our girl loves this so much that she asked for a &#34;necklace birthday cake&#34; for her upcoming birthday. She got it for Christmas and says &#34;Santa helped me stop biting my nails.&#34;
5.0	Absolutely love this diaper bag! Very roomy, always get compliments and stays clean!
5.0	Good product, fit in my car. Organize all my little things in the bag.
5.0	My son still uses a pacifier when he naps and the shape of these are better for older kids. Happy with this product so far.
5.0	My son love it. It doesn't fall off easily when your baby lay down in the crib. I totally recommend this pacifier.
5.0	Loved this!!! We had a hard time finding clip binky holders!!! These clip on and stay on all day and are stinking cute!!!!
5.0	Adequately packaged and good quality expected of a Hallmark product.<br />Colors were vibrant and well painted. Value for money and adds novelty to the party.
5.0	Awesome seat saver, well made and long enough to provide protection for both my Britax Frontier seats.  Don't hesitate to purchase, extra money is well worth it.  I have the one-step and prince kind as well...these are so much better.
5.0	I got this for my son when he was about 2 months old and he liked looking at the colors and feeling the body.  He's almost 5 months now and this is the first toy he reaches for everytime.  The antlers and rings make it easy for him to hold, and he loves to grab and squeeze the feet.  Very well made and even though I thought it was a bit pricey when I bought it, it has been well worth the money.  I would recommend this to friends.
5.0	Very welll made, however, it was too stuffed for my little one. I tried it out during a nap, and he just slide right off.  I was really hopeful this would work out. Customer service has been wonderful. They are sending us a pillow that is less stuffed. You can't ask for anything more. American made, excellent quality and amazing customer service. We received the replacement pillow and it is perfect. I highly recommend.
5.0	I wonder why this diaper bag is 149.99 - I bought for $20. For $20 it is nice, colorful diaper bag but it is not worth $149.99
5.0	I hate to say it, but I did not actually purchase this breast pump.  I thought breast feeding was going to be a cinch.  Then I actaully did it.  I was not very good at getting used to the pain.  When I came home from the hospital, a friend of mine had this pump in her attic from her child.  So I borrowed it and purchased my own accessories.  It was amazing.  I could pump and watch TV, balance the checkbook or read a book.  Then, I could still give my daughter breast milk.  Anytime my breasts began to swell, I would just turn the pump on.  Since it is electric, it is a little noisey, but not that bad at all.  I could pump while my daughter slept and it wouldn't wake her.  If my husband and I decide to have another baby, I am definitely buying this product for myself.  Compared to the pain from latching on, the price is nothing.
5.0	I have had these bottles for a few months now and they are great.  My son is seven months old now.  The nipples flow works for different ages, which is great not to keep upgrading on the flow sizes.  They don't leak! Which is great because it is always falling over and he is now starting to hold it on his own.  But when he pushes the nipples sideways it will flow out then.  He is teething (on his 5th tooth) so he likes to chew on it.  I have always put them in the dishwasher and have had no problems, and they are bpa free.  The numbers are hard to read on the side though.  But you can make a small mark with a perm. marker.  The not leaking is a huge seller point for me, I am getting more.
5.0	Very easy to assemble, only one scratch on it.  I saw a lot of people were having issues with damage upon arrival, but not an issue with mine.  It looks great with the matching changing table.
5.0	excellent aspirator ,it is the best in the market.
5.0	I love these washcloths since they aren't rough like most baby towels.  I use it to wash my baby's face during bath time and also put one over his stomach and diaper area so the area would stay warm during his bath.  The size is perfect since it isn't too big.
5.0	My 2 year old loves this pillow.  It is small, about half the size of a standard pillow case, however with a quick snip and a few stitches, you could easily turn one standard pillowcase into 2 small ones for this pillow.  I was looking for a pillow for my sons transition from crib to twin bed.  As this would be his first pillow, I didn't want anything that was going to be too big or fluffy or uncomfortable for him.  He seems to like this one very much and has no problems sleeping with it every night.  Some may consider it slightly overpriced for such a small pillow, but I'm not one to put a price on a good nights sleep for my son or myself.
5.0	This was a great purchase for my toddler. He was close to the weight limit of most of the lightweight strollers and way to tall. That and I was constantly kicking (and cussing at) the cheapy one we'd grabbed when we couldn't fit the big all terrain in the rental car. After reading all the reviews I ordered this one and have not been dissapointed. he fits with room to grow and finally his feet aren't in danger of dragging. It's easy to push with all the wheels being remarkably cooperative. The frame if nice and sturdy and the wheels snapped on easily and securely. Despite the comments about the canopy I rather like it. I may add a bub shield but for now it shades him well and has a nice hinge to keep it taut.<br />It really is a nice stroller with great features for the money.
5.0	This is one of those items that makes travel and dining out easier with a small child. I bought this cover because we were going on vacation and I didn't want to drag the extra plush and bulky cart cover with us but wanted something smaller to cover the high chairs on the cruise.  This cover zips up into a small pouch making it very compact and travel-friendly. The material is soft and the way it sits on the chair, it covers the lap of the child as well. I washed it in a washing machine after a week's use and it looks like new, all stains gone!  If you take your baby out to eat and use their chairs, this is a must have. I will make this as a standard baby shower gift.
5.0	I purchased 2 of these tablets for my nieces the tablet arrived undamaged and in good condition the kids love them and what a great buy
5.0	I bought this for a baby shower gift and it was a hit! :-)
5.0	Awesome wrap! Comfortable and very handy.
5.0	This swings is a complete life saver.  Everytime our little one gets fussy and we can't calm him....we put him in the swing and he calms right down.  We also used it to put him to sleep the first few weeks!  He doesn't really care about the ligths or anything but we still use them. We always use the swing on the fastest setting!  I love that you can plug this in so we don't have to worry about the batteries running out.  I would recommend this swing to EVERYONE!
5.0	I LOVE this hamper. It's stylish, light to carry to the laundry room, and has handles. This is in my son's room, and we are getting another for my daughter's room soon! We have both the dark grey and the light grey bigger ones in our master bathroom to separate whites and darks too!
5.0	Works great! So happy I bought this
5.0	Excellent and practical.  Love it.
5.0	As described in other reviews. Colors vibrant yet pattern not busy. Sweet addition to crib set as has matching accessories.
5.0	Cute and sturdy! It's a great addition to my daughters room.
5.0	My son has reflux.  And he spits up a lot.  When I say a lot, I mean A LOT.  I mean like he spits up when I lay him down.  He spits up when I pick him up.  He pretty much spits up any time that I move him.  Before he was born, I bought one set of these.  Once he was born I discovered how great they are. They are big.  The shape is just right for over your shoulder, for one baby's chest when he is in a position where spit up will go forward, for under his head when he is laying down or for around his neck.  Since he spits up so much, I have more than 14 of these.  I need that many to get through the day.  With my daughter, who did not spit up at nearly the same rate as this little guy, four or six probably would have been sufficient.
5.0	Very nice. I really wanted a cherry finish bookshelf to go wIth the furniture in my daughter's nursery but couldn't find what I wanted in cherry.  All the bookcases were too small or just didn't have the look I wanted. I Finally settled on this one,  thanks in part to a review complaining there was a red tint to this.  Close enough . ...so I ordered it.  It's a bit darker than I'd have liked but goes surprisingly well with all the wood in the nursery.  Hubs assembled this with little fanfare or swearing and it's beatifu in the room.  It comes with a thing to secure it to the wall so it can't be tipped,  and there is plenty of room to fill with all the books we will have for our little one.  There was a bit of slight damage on one side but nothing all that noticeable and I only found it because I searched for it.
5.0	My 4 months old grandson loves it. He feels very safe in there, we don't even have to support his head while he is in the bath, its very safe for him and he can move his hands and feet to feel water. I'm very happy with this purchase, because the previous bath he had was too small for him after he turned 3 months.[[ASIN:B00078RVT8 PRIMO EuroBath Pearl Mint Green]]
5.0	When our little boy hit 8 months old, taking a bath went from a pleasurable experience to a nightmare.  He wanted to stand up and wiggle and wouldn't stay in his baby bathtub.  The big bathtub was just a little too scary with him constantly trying to stand up and crawl out.  It got to the point that we needed two people to bathe him every time.  This chair immediately solved our bathtime dilemma.  It's easy to use and once he's sitting in it, he's calm and just plays with his toys til the bath is over.  We couldn't be happier or more satisfied. The seat is a little slippery so we just put a washcloth on it before we sit him down.  Problem solved.  Our little boy is now 10 months old and we still use it daily.  Great product!!!
5.0	Very nice standard changing pad. It is easy to clean and a variety of covers fit this pad. My baby and I are very happy with this purchase.
5.0	Great mirror and easy to install.
5.0	We didn't want a video monitor and, after reading reviews, this seemed to be one that was the best value and WORKED.  I wanted to use it for a while before I wrote a review.  It's going on two years now and we've never had any problems.  The range is great and is ALWAYS clear.  I like that you can adjust the sensitivity and it does pick up sound really well. We usually keep the sensitivity level at 3 and the volume at 5.  Using anything higher than 3 would pick up the (quiet!) fan in the nursery and it the monitor would just run.  The first time this happened it took me a min. to realize I needed to cut back the sensitivity.<br /><br />When we first started using it, once fully charged, we got about three days of use (we'd turn it off when didn't need) before it would need to be recharged.  I then got into a habit of just charging it at night, every night, and it doesn't take long.  Most times I'll finish reading part of a book and look over to see the light's green again and could be taken off the charger.  We always keep the main unit plugged in and on at all times in the baby's room.  We found that we'd forget to turn it back on before we'd leave the room and have to go back in, sometimes disturbing the baby.<br /><br />We managed to misplace the parent unit once and the alert feature came in handy.<br /><br />I'd purchase this again in a heartbeat and I'll come back and update if I run into problems.<br /><br />EDIT 9-26-17 Still working great!
5.0	These are so pretty and so stylish, very soft too. They were small enough to fit my 5 month old yet will be roomy for at least another year or more!
5.0	This is my second order and I love it.  We have both teenagers and toddlers in our household and this works wonderfully to keep the younger children from constantly going into the teenagers' rooms.  Also, it's ready to put on the door right out of the package.
5.0	Love this you can hook additional toys to it as well. Love how it folds up to save space. Purchased this pink for my niece and will be purchasing the blue for my nephew!
5.0	This has been so helpful for my newborn. It was easy to put together and my daughter loves it!  Great price  too!
5.0	Most fun my one year old has had in the bath! We bring it to the pool too!!
5.0	Bought this as part of a Christmas present/baby shower gift. The mother-to-be is expecting her first child soon. She loves the &#34;yee haw&#34; feeding set.
5.0	"My son loves his panda backpack, and he asks to wear it even around the house.  We purchased this panda backpack for travel purposes, so our toddler could walk with us in airports and other areas without fear of him getting lost in the crowds or snatched up by strangers.  Even though he was always right next to us, the peace of mind of knowing that he couldn't go far made me feel better.<br /><br />The product itself is very cute, and I love how panda \\""peeks\\"" over his shoulder.  The pocket in the back is not very functional for anything other than tucking the panda \\""tail\\"" when not in use.  It would have been neat to see a zipper in the panda body open up to more storage space (for binkies or a sippy cup) but oh well.  The panda \\""tail\\"" can hook onto the back or the side, depending on what is more comfortable.  The chest straps looked like they were in good positions on my son's body, and he didn't fuss at all when wearing it.<br /><br />I did have him wear it for some time in the home before traveling to get him used to it, so I would recommend that to other parents.  He saw it as his toy and something special to him, so it was not a big deal to put it on in the airport when we were there.<br /><br />The body of the panda is very soft, like a stuffed animal, so he snuggled with it and used it as a pillow sometimes."
5.0	It is great!  Does not spill.  My granddaughter loves it.
5.0	I love this! I keep it in my diaper bag always, but I can easily take it out and shove a diaper in it for quick changes so that I don't have to bring the entire bag in. It's cute and stylish to boot! Love it!
5.0	I just bought this chair and I love it. It is easy to use and very convenient. I feel very secure having my 15 month old daughter in this chair. She enjoys being with the grown ups. It fits our table and our countertop breakfast bar. I wish we had bought this instead of buying the bulky high chair. We will definitely take it to restaurants when we go out to eat. I am a happy customer!!
5.0	My one-year-old great-niece has a pink &#34;Dolly&#34; that she absolutely LOVES . . . she patty cakes with Dolly, shares food, washes her face, takes her for stroller rides, etc . . . thus the reason I purchased a Lil' Darlin' doll for a baby shower gift.
5.0	My favorite!  Worth the price.
5.0	Our baby was the type of baby that would fight sleep. She hated being put into her dark room at night. She could be asleep and you set her in the crib in the dark and she would wake up screaming. We got the twilight turtle for a shower gift and we love it! It's perfect to turn on right before we put her down. We also really like that it has a timer...we don't have to worry about turning it off and it lasts long enough for her to fall into a deep sleep. A great product!!!
5.0	Love our lovey....gives me peace of mind knowing that when she chews on it it is chemical free!
5.0	Thick, easy to use, and a MUST HAVE to save your poor car from the horrors that only years of car seat abuse can bring.
5.0	After finding out that my son could not be exclusively breastfed because of a medical condition, we tried several different kinds of bottles searching for one that he would take.  After hours and hours of screaming, purple faces, and nonstop gas we had settled on Dr. Browns.  They helped a little bit but didn't stop the screaming and stressful feeding times.  My son loves the MAM pacifiers, so I thought I would try these; thank goodness I did!  From the first time we used these bottles, feeding time was quick, quiet, and gas free!!!  So grateful that we found the MAM bottles!
5.0	It's great so far. My 2.5 year old can reach the table when she sits on it. It seems comfortable and it doesn't slide on the seat. I'm happy with it.
5.0	I purchased this swing for my niece's new baby boy.  My son's baby boy got one and they love it.  The baby is cuddled in the swing and goes right to sleep and calms.  The swing not only swings forward and backwards, but from side to side.  I would recommend the swing for a newborn.
5.0	I use Spry gel for all my babies, and my older kids love it to. We don't like fluoride so this is a great option, as it also free of harsh abrasive ingredients, or glycerin, and it includes beneficial ingredients like xylitol and GSE.
5.0	Love these cups.  I have an18 month old who insists on taking her drinks with her while she runs and plays around the house, so you can imagine the amount of spilling and leaking that takes place.  These cups really do not leak (unless she's running with it upside down...which does happen but you can't really blame the cup in that case).  The cups themselves are a 5 star.<br /><br />I would give Amazon fulfillment a 1 star (but my review doesn't reflect this, since I didn't want to punish the product itself).  I initially bought these cups at a Target, and was ecstatic when I saw on Amazon that they have different colors/designs.  Note the little line in the description that says &#34;colors may vary&#34;.  What is pictured is not necessarily what you will get, and in my case, they sent me the exact same colors I already have.  Amazon fail.
5.0	I got this as a hand-me-down, and I looove it. I have two kids (4yrs, 1yr), and carry diapers, wipes, nursing cover, various snacks, toys, and changes of clothing, and this bag has more than enough room for all that kid crap PLUS convenient pockets for my own stuff! I have used at least three other bags, and this is my fave by far. Love the magnetic closures, multitude of pockets, fancy stroller strap, cushy shoulder pad, external phone pocket, and wipeable unisex stain-hiding print. Ths bag is my spirit animal.
5.0	The grandparents gifted this seat to us when our second child was born (now 9 months old).  We used the seat for his big brother for about 5 months before putting the newbie in it at about 7 months.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Fits from birth (we opted for a bucket seat for convenience sake, but he did fit in this)<br />Has an amazing height range<br />Takes up as much length rear facing as our bucket seat did<br />Easy raising of shoulder height - no rethreading (woohoo!)<br />Cover is easy to remove<br />Installation is easy with instructions on the seat<br />Headwings give great coverage<br /><br />Con:<br />Quite wide, would be hard (maybe impossible?) to use in a 3 across configuration with other seats.  I have a little car and I have this and a turbobooster on the sides, with a small basket of books in between.  A person cannot fit between the two seats.<br /><br />I would buy it again and I have recommended it to multiple friends :)  Great investment!
5.0	This baby carrier has been great so far for short hikes and even for use at home while trying to get things done around the house.
5.0	I love this car seat. When I first got it, I had difficulties putting it in. All that can be solved by having your local fire department install it or watching the you tube videos. I feel good about my daughter using this sear. She has used it since she was 8 months old, we rear faced until she was about 20 months. She is almost 3 now and we still love it.
5.0	This pillow is absolutely amazing!! I just received it in the mail and my baby loves it! Keeps him quiet, and comfortable. Great for breastfeeding as well. He can sit up in it and watch some tv. The pillow is very comfortable and convent would definitely recommend it to anyone!:)
5.0	My 4 month old loves to chew on her RaZ. It's a great combo teether/pacifier. She can grab it on her own and turn it around to chew on different textures.  The sucker part is a little big for her mouth, but she will grow into it.
5.0	Very pleased with the quality. Easy to setup and after a month, its as sturdy as ever. I shopped around for the best bang for your buck, and Thos was it. Its made of heavy duty material and us not flimsy. I'd buy another one when we need it .
5.0	It was an ok price and it holds a good enough amount of things to remember , a very nice keepsake
5.0	This is by far the best way I've found to freeze baby food. Once your purée is frozen, everything pops out easily.<br /><br />I have twins so I make a lot of food at once to freeze. These are the perfect size  - they hold more servings than any other freezer tray I've found and they stack really neatly in the freezer.<br /><br />I can't stress enough how easily the frozen purées just pop out.
5.0	Since toddlers have a tendency to chew these straws - it's great that they make a replacement.  They are easy to pop into place and use for the next grandkid!
5.0	Product was shipped quickly and exactly as advertised. We use it to hang the iPad on the outside of the crib. We use an app to record feelings and diaper changes, and this makes it very convenient. We also play music for the little one on the iPad. In the future we hope to use it for video calls with the long distance grandparents, although the case will need a hole cut in it for the camera. I expect this to be a simple job though.<br /><br />Excellent product!
5.0	Super cute! Gave it to my friends daughter who's 3. Of course she loves pink and also loves horses and rainbows. Needless to say it was a win!
5.0	I found this to be the best baby carrier out there, I tried a great number of them. This one is comfortable both for me and for my baby.
5.0	From the moment I first tried on a friends, I knew I would love ts carrier.  I barely even feel like I am carring my baby - it is SO comfortable!  I wore my other carrier briefly the other day and what a difference.  I had to take it off after just a few minutes - it was so uncomfortable.  I love that my baby can nurse and sleep easily with the hood up, and that she can look around with it down.  I look forward to being able to carry her on my back when sheis a little bigger.
5.0	This is a great gate! Super easy to install and not terribly difficult to open.  The handle pushes down then slides over so you can open it with one hand but my two year old can't.
5.0	This is a good mattress at the right price. Fits the standard toddler bed like a glove. My 3 year old seems to find it comfortable. It has waterproof material to deal with the accidents. My son hasn't had one yet, so can't say how effective it is.
5.0	My 10.5 old son was to travel with us from Texas to Michigan (yeah, crazy long drive for that age!!) We ordered the product, received it on time, and it was amazing to be able to prop his forehead up when he fell asleep while driving.
5.0	We purchased this monitor as a replacement to a Fisher Price baby monitor. Our old one had so much interference with electronics. This baby monitor hasn't had any interference and is crystal clear! Love it!! And the small parent unit is so much nicer than our old large bulky Fisher Price unit. It's loud enough to hear from anywhere in the house and has worked wonderfully outside. I highly recommend this product!
5.0	You definitely need an extra one of these keys if you buy the system. If you have a kid around - which you do :) - he/she will run off with your other one - so buy this and keep it safe!
5.0	My little guy is 11 weeks and he loves this activity gym.  I love how you can attach different toys and make it more or less stimulating.  It cleans up easily with a wet towel.  colors are brighter than the picture online, which makes this item work well for a boy or a girl.  The price is great for the quality as well.  I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for an activity gym.
5.0	I bought this Munchkin Gate to replace a Position & Lock gate that my dogs had nearly destroyed and I wanted the ease of use a gate would provide. The width I had to cover was nearly 36&#34;, almost an inch more than the advertised 35&#34; maximum width, so I used the included extension and made up the difference with the length of the adjusting screws. The gate tightened without any problems. No instructions of any kind were provided. The installation was simple enough, but would have been easier with at least a few photos. The gate works well, looks great, and I couldn't be more pleased. 5 stars even without instructions.
5.0	I needed extra storage for my First Years Ignite umbrella stroller.  This straps on easily and the the stretchy mesh bag securely holds plenty of stuff while we're on the go.  No tip-over issues with our stroller either.  Simple design and works well!
5.0	Love this aspirator and have no idea how I would survive without it! Great product! Highly recommend specially for little kids under 1
5.0	my 2 year old is quite the ninja and he hasn't broken these yet. highly recommend.
5.0	I used this carrier with my kids from their second week of life through about their third birthday(s). It can be worn on the belly (infant-toddler) and on the back (toddler). For infants without neck control (pre-three months) the insert should be used as well in the front position. The material is a high quality cotton and the shoulder pads/straps are thick foam which stand up to serious wear.
5.0	must have and music is not annoying at all.
5.0	"My son has had a time in this seat.  I'm in tears right now because I just put him in it and notived that the batteries for the vibrating seat are dead!  This is only because we use the heck out of it!!  It's a great product....giving me endless \\""free time\\""  to start dinner, take a shower, write this review, ect!  Great product!!"
5.0	Perfect fit.  Beautiful colors. No leaks so far.
5.0	Base installs really easily, especially if the car has latch system. Product is well priced too especially if you don't want to buy another car seat.
5.0	Product is easy to assemble (although I did put on the doors out of order, because it was simpler that way).  Love the cherry finish--exactly what I had wanted.  Changer is sturdy, but light and easy to move around.  I was able to put it together when 7 months pregnant.  Love the height--nice and tall so I won't have to bend down too much.  I am getting a different changing pad, but I knew what to expect from previous reviews, so I was not surprised by how thin it was.  Overall, I am extremely satisfied.
5.0	I love Skip Hop products. I bought the blanket that matches this, and I would def recommend it. It also has a whole playtime set and nursery bedding set that would be worth purchasing as well.
5.0	Ordered two products of same kind for my two best friends little toddler as a gift. Its overall a very nice product with beautiful sound quality. The sounds dont heart your ears nor the kids. Over all a quality product for the price. You wont be disappointed.
5.0	This is a wonderful, comforting classic musical toy lamb.  Great construction and material.  Super soft and cuddly and good musical quality as well.
5.0	Great quality! Got this for our sons nursery.
5.0	This product arrived and was easy to assemble but the easiest part has actually been using it.  It's easy to strap in my daughter, remove the table with one hand, and clean.  The only cons I have seen with this product is its a bit heavy and the wheels don't maneuver well but the overall product quality outweighs the cons.
5.0	I never liked the original high chair I bought for my child. It was too big and I was forced to put towels behind her every time. This chair is the PERFECT size. And I love its portability. We bring it to friends' houses and holidays - so much easier than chasing my toddler around trying to feed her.
5.0	Good quality, good price in Peru are expensive this bags and are useful for moms who work all day far from home
5.0	my baby loves this pacifier its the only one she will take. she is now 4months old and cant live with out it. she already knows how to latch her hands around the toy and keep it in her mouth. when i cant find the pacifier she cry's so much and when i find it and give it back to her its like she is in heaven with it she is super quiet and will not let go of it. if ever i lost it i would jump back on amazon and buy a new one and express ship it to me for her. i love this pacifier and we cant live without it.
5.0	I found these cloth diaper inserts online and was very excited to try them out!  I had tried prefolds in diaper covers and they were just too bulky and kept too much moisture near my dear daughter's sensitive bottom.  What I love about these inserts is that they wick away the moisture and hold it in well.  Also, I think it is awesome that they are grey, why do we need to battle to keep things so white?!  Although it is too soon to notice, I appreciate that they are made with the odor resistance of charcoal.  AND the service that I have received is awesome.  They arrived in just a few days when the order had said it would take more than a week.  I needed them in a hurry and they came!!  Karissa, the business owner, has been quick to respond to any questions I have.  She is great to work with.  Thank you!
5.0	When my son was 2 months old i had to stop breastfeeding because he always wanted to eat, I think he just liked the comfort of sucking. I tried dozens of paci's and this one was the first he took too! He loved them and I couldn't leave home without them! he's one now and still has his two (They got lost in the move and luckily i found them!) They were perfect for his mouth and really helps him alot when he was fussy! I now have a new baby and like his brother he wont take to any pacifiers besides these. I think its due to the shape and how easy it is even for the smaller mouths to shape to! AND its more natural shape! Only thing is after i got them I couldn't find them anymore in stores! So looks like Amazon is my new best friend lol. I just bought a 2 pack for my youngest since his brother (who's one) wont give his up lol
5.0	They certainly have come a long way with these since my kids were little. This is a very well designed one piece seat which fits securely on my existing toilet seat. No crevices for germs to hide, no seams to pinch. Does not slide around. Just about perfect in my book!<br /><br />I don't have any little ones in the house except for my cat and dog. This seat happens to belong to my Savannah cat who started training himself to use the toilet at five months old. I bought him this seat to help avoid having him fall in. The dog just stands there and looks at him like why are you pee-ing in my water bowl?<br /><br />Ok, insert crazy cat lady jokes here....
5.0	A year ago, i had a chance to use the elctric one for my oldest and this year, i bought this microwave sterilizer from amazon for my youngest one. You don't need to compare any more. Both works good and microwave one even cheap and easy to carry(Light weight).
5.0	Very handy and convenient when cutting baby nails. I buy 2 for my 2 babies for safety design.
5.0	This does't say waterPROOF, it says waterRESISTANT. And that it is. I love mine and it is easy to fold and put back in its carrier. I carry a lot of stuff around and this slings right over my shoulder. I use it at the beach and at the park. I keep it in my car. Unfortunately, I paid $49.99 from TUFFO.com and luckily, you can get it here for less! I recommend this. My family and I lead a very active lifestyle and this is always around and being used and washed over and over again and it still holds up. I have had it about a year or more, now. Hope this helps.
5.0	"I have recently purchased this The Potty Stool for my 2.5 year old daughter that has achondroplasia (the most common form of dwarfism). At 28.5\\"" tall we needed something that would make it that she could get onto the potty independently if she chooses, plus be safe while sitting on the toilet since she refuses to use a potty chair. After a ton of research and measuring and even considering a child size toilet this was the best option. The child size toilets are at least 10\\"" from the floor. The Potty Stool puts her bottom 8.5\\"" from our toilet seat  :)...  This stool is big but very sturdy and well made... We love it so much I am going to purchase another for my upstairs bathroom when she is a little older!!"
5.0	This is the best purchase I have made for my baby.  As a first time mom I was very nervous about bring my baby home from the hospital and worried about putting him down to sleep, so we tried the Swaddle.  He has been sleeping in a Halo Swaddle Sleepsack since we brought him home from the hospital.  He wiggles a lot when he sleeps and the swaddle helps him to sleep better because he doesn't startle himself awake when his arms and legs move.  It is easy to change diapers in the middle of the night because it unzips from the bottom and I don't always have to remove the swaddle part so there is less of a chance of him waking up.  They also have great customer service.  I contacted the company to find a product that I was unable to find in the stores and they were able to locate the item and get it to me quickly.  I love the Swaddle so much that I have been buying them for my friends who are having babies.  I hope they continue to make great products!  I will be a lifelong customer!
5.0	Easy to assemble. Handy and safe. Very Strong. Durable product. My 3 yr old who is pretty tough and sleeps all over the place was unable to deter this safeguard and end up on the floor.
5.0	This potty I got for my 15 month old and she loves it!  It fits perfect for her and she thinks she is such a big girl using it.  It has a white basin that is able to lift out for easy cleaning, which is very nice.  The back support is perfect, as my daughter can sit back without turning around the whole time.  Fits perfect!
5.0	I bought these to go in my 21 month old's diaper at night. She sleeps in the &#34;stink bug&#34; position and she was soaking herself and her bedding at night because the front of her diaper doesn't hold very much liquid. This was causing her to wake nearly every night needing a diaper, clothing and bedding change. After some research on nighttime diapers I came across these. They have worked perfectly! They are very very absorbent. She hasn't woken up wet once since. They do exactly what I was hoping for them to do and I definitely recommend them!
5.0	The Medela breast pump works with Dr. Brown's bottles (you can pump directly into the bottle)!  Just an added benefit to an already great product.  I've been using mine almost daily for 11 months and have had NO problems.  It's worth the money if you plan on breastfeeding/pumping for more than a couple of months!
5.0	Had it for several months and it is wonderful.  Let me just say that I have had Godchildren throughout the years before finally having my own and it really makes me laugh when people post about the rocking sound.  This is the quietest of all the swings I have heard and seen.  But they all make that sound.  There are degrees but only slight.  As I said before this is the quietest.  My daughter loves everything about it.  It and her Rock a bye is the sleeping area's of choice.  If you don't have air conditioning and are looking to buy this in the summer I do not recommend it.  The fluffy warm area is quite cozy and where babies can't keep themselves warm like us we hadn't put in our window unit and there was a very humid day that she wanted nothing to do with it and I couldn't blame her.  The mobile is adorable.  At three weeks she went from falling asleep being rocked to appreciating the mobile and the mirror in the center.  She is even more amused with the music now.  I've put the camera on action and gotten some wonderful photo's of her in this.  I haven't put the play center in it yet.  She is just now interacting with her play gym but not grabbing to hold anything yet so once she is there I will add that on.  Wonderful purchase!
5.0	Initially I tried these on with the heart shape up, but that was a poor fit for me. Once I turned them heart shape down the fit was great! The fit paired with the thinness is perfect since I wasn't getting the obvious outlines that are the downfall of most nursing pads. That being my biggest concern is the reason I give 5 stars. The bamboo inner layer is super soft. I'm very excited to use these when my new baby arrives. Given that I've worked a lot with bamboo, hemp and cotton fabrics I have no concerns with regards to absorbency.
5.0	Easy to attach to Cruz or vista. Very useful. Exactly as described. Not sure why the manufacturer doesn't just include this with the stroller.    Update: I've been using this product for a couple of months and have removed it temporarily. It makes the carriage way too wide and gets caught on a lot of things. I've opted for an after market stroller organizer for now and will put this back on in the spring for outdoor use.
5.0	I was so hoping this would work with the drop ins bottles so I could pump right into the drop ins, but no.  It was a waste of money for me but I'm sure a dandy product.
5.0	Works great, inexpensive with nothing fancy. It is hard to get out as an adult, but that's what you want.
5.0	I am in the process of moving and have Easter baskets I have been using since my children's first Easter but they are in storage only god knows where. These worked great, they are a decent size and will look great on a shelve. They are very sturdy as my kids have been testing their integrity by setting on and in them. They are holding up quite well.
5.0	Bought this for my toddler when I was pregnant with my infant. Toddler wiggled it a little but never really showed an interest. Luckily my infant loves it.
5.0	My granddaughter loves it!
5.0	It is exactly what I was looking for.  I needed a replacement booster with a high back that can convert into a seat only booster later.  The compact size, basic cup holders and color were exactly what I expected.  The padding is not substantial but it is enough to make it comfortable and it is not so big that all three children (2 in child seats and 1 without) fit without being crowded.  The description and pricing were what I was looking to pay.
5.0	Received it quicker than expecetd and was super aorable and cant wait to gift it at a baby shower. Great product.
5.0	great product love the construction of this bed. i feel this is a very safe bed for my god daughter
5.0	Love it so light weight.
5.0	This is a fantastic idea for any kid who has trouble falling asleep or needs some help relaxing at bedtime. The twilight turtle is great because it gives kids something to look at rather than just being a standard nightlight. You get to choose from 3 colors, personally I think the blue is the most soothing. I love the little book that comes with it to help kids learn the different constellations. Here's a video to give a bit of an idea of how it looks when on and the narrator is kind of awesome.
5.0	Gets my point across but people still read end me
5.0	When I first used the cup, I didn't tighten the lid to where the arrow image (on the lid) lined up with the lock image (on the cup), and I was annoyed at the leaking. But once I tried again, really making sure I tightened it so the images were aligned the cup was great! No leaking, and the little darling loves knocking it down over and over. At 6 mo, she's also much better at using a straw then a zippy cup and feels really proud of herself holding and drinking on her own. I recommend these cups, just make sure you tighten accordingly!
5.0	Will never use another product after trying this one!
5.0	My daughter was so happy. Loved it,so cute
5.0	These do exactly what they are supposed to do, they keep my kids lunches cold. They are also adorable and sturdy. The only complaint we have is that the designs are &#34;a little girlish&#34; according to my 8 year old son. Other than that I have been completely satisfied with this product.
5.0	My niece love it She immediately thought it was for her to play but she knows exactly for what purpose its for and has been successful now just watch when she gets to understand that it is normal to go to big bathroom and she is a quick learner.
5.0	I recommend this item and its a great deal.  everything was fine and the seler its ok,  best regards thanks
5.0	I have a 21 month old daughter who is at that stage where she does not want to eat much of anything.  She does like those squeeze things you can get at the grocery store that has fruits in it. (Those things are expensive) Well, here is your alternative.....buy one of these and fill it with baby food and let them suck it out of here.  Pure genius!  Wish I would of bought this sooner!  Thanks for such a great product.
5.0	I was hesitant to spend so much on a stroller, but I am so glad that I did.  My other friends with kids all have stroller envy.  This is so easy to fold up, practically pushes itself, turns easily, and really isn't as big and bulky as many of the other joggers.  I almost gave them only four stars because the cup holder should come with it instead of being extra, but it's such a great stroller I had to give it five stars anyway.
5.0	great toy, we love it.
5.0	This was the quickest delivery ever!! Thank you so much! This was the 1st peice of the bedding I got to put up because it was the 1st peice that arrived out of like 4 things I've ordered from other places including the actual bedding. Thank you again.
5.0	my 2 yo daughter loves this, she runs to get this after each bath time to be independent and combs her hair.
5.0	When I had a kidney transplant, they sent me home with 2 drains that they attached to my clothing with regular safety pins.  Any stress placed on them would make them pop open and poke me.  I sent for the diaper pins which worked beautifully and saved me from unexpected pokes.
5.0	This is really great for cold weather. Stays in place, keeps baby warm, and reasonably priced.
5.0	Thank you for making such a great product.  My son completely loves his pillow.<br />Even though it is a toddler size, he moves around so much at night that I wish<br />it was a bit wider.  He likes to have his head on it and then tuck it under his<br />chest at the same time.<br /><br />I am considering getting a second one if your company doesn't make larger sized<br />pillows.<br /><br />Again, we are very satisfied with the purchase. :-)
5.0	This chair is great, easy to put together and useful for several ages. I would recomend it to anyone...
5.0	This doll is really cute
5.0	I love these bibs! We are practicing baby lead weaning and started giving our LO whole pieces of food from the start instead of using purees. These bibs catch all the pieces he drops and have really reduced clean-up time. They wash off real quick in the sink and look like new after each use. I love that the fastener around the neck is adjustable to ensure a snug (but not too tight) fit around his neck and can grow as he grows.
5.0	I purchased this mirror for when my son was born and what can I say other than it's genius. It's so clear and the fact that I can move it around to adjust the positioning for me to look at him it's genius.
5.0	These are great!  They protect against leaks and spills.  I used them several times on my daughter with prefolds.  I would highly recommend.
5.0	Can't say enough good things. It looks amaaazing. It certainly took a while to put together, but I didn't mind. Our bottom drawer came with two right panels instead of a right and a left, so I contacted Babyletto on their website. They have a very handy replacement parts section of the website, and WOW! I wish all customer service were that awesome. They're shipping a new piece free of charge now!
5.0	I use this daily in the shower on my back and chest to keep my pityrosporum folliculitis under control. It is the best I have found yet. I used to get those annoying bumps on my back and chest constantly until I found this product. I will definitely be using this for life!
5.0	This is an amazing stroller.  The instructions were easy to understand making it easy to put together.  I love the fact that you can add on to it to customize it to your every need.  It handles well and fold up easily. The only draw back for me was that it seemed heavy to lift in and out of the car.  Other than that I love it!
5.0	When I first received it, it seemed WAY too tight at the largest button. But, I soon realized that it was the perfect tightness so that water doesn't make it slip off. It's worked wonders for my 2 (now almost 3 year old) and I think it'll work for a while to come. I wish I had found this when he was smaller. Bath time would have been MUCH less traumatic for both of us!<br /><br />I would waste my money on a more expensive one. This has worked wonderfully.
5.0	I bought this gym because I thought the space theme was fun and different. My son loves it! We started putting him under the gym when he was only a few weeks old. He loved it and immediately began kicking around. The music has two settings- one that's calm and zen. The second is a cute, catchy tune. I washed the mat in the washing machine and it came through unchanged. Watch the video for help on how to set it up.
5.0	I searched all over the web for dog 'refuse' pick-up bags of reasonable size and strength. I spent hours and hours looking for something that would approximate the bags I get at the local pharmacy and food store. All of the products reviewed that were specifically for dog 'refuse', in my opinion, were either were too thin and would tear, or did not have sack handles like this biodegradable product, or were too thick and not flexible.  I have now used the Green N Pack product for 3 months or so and they truly do 'the job' for another use besides baby diapers.  I keep the neighborhood clean.
5.0	My wife wanted this and I was skeptical.  It has turned out to be remarkably useful.  We take our 8 month old with us everywhere.  We have been to several restaurants and cafes and we use this everytime.  It is quick and easy to set up.  It secures very well to the table and I have never been concerned it would slip.  The rubber grips protect even the nicest table without leaving a mark.  The seat can be adjustable up and down to accomodate him as he grows.  The seat can also be reclined the same as in the stroller.  The whole device folds up and comes with its own shoulder bag for easy carry and storage.  I wouldn't be without this if you have a Baby Jogger seat.  Worth every penny.
5.0	I tried the orginal VentAires to help my baby with gas, but he didn't seem to like those nipples at all, so when I found these I bought them right away.  He loves these and does so much better with the nipples.  He also gets less gas.  I find them easier to put together and clean then the regular VentAires also.
5.0	I saw the ad for this car seat in a parents magazine about a year ago.  I saved it and knew I would get it for my daughter when it became available.  She is small for her age, but on the tall side, so she was outgrowing her Fisher-Price Safe Embrace car seat in height.  We tried other seats out that were about a third of the price, but she said they were uncomfortable and they seemed flimsy compared to this one.  She can really see out of our van now because it sits up high.  It is very easy to use, and she will be able to stay in this seat until she is 6-years-old!  The fabric looks and feels good, the harness height is incredibly easy to adjust, and the seat can recline too!
5.0	I love this adorable owl taggie blanket! It is not only cute but it is soft and I can't wait to see if you little one will use it! It matches her theme to her bedroom perfectly and it was a great price.
5.0	Great item with every thing you need and great price.
5.0	Fits our daughters crib perfectly many other sheets did not fit as nicely. The fabric feels nice and soft!
5.0	I was sick of my child chewing my hair etc while I'd be holding her. So this was a great find!  She lived them!
5.0	Watching my baby jump in this is funny and adorable. He loves all of the goodies!
5.0	I have purchased several Britax car seats for my grandchildren and we always love them!!! They are tall children and are able to stay in these seats until they graduate into boosters!!  Highly recommend !!!
5.0	Used this for both my children, works great, love love love this!
5.0	Holds my 15 pound baby boy comfortably, he adores the toys and the lions, and I adore that he can't climb out of it like get could in his last bouncer.<br />Bouncer was easy to assemble, I put it together in 2 minutes, and I LOVE how I can just unbuckle The seat cover In the back and toss it in the wash. Really makes it easy when he has a massive diper catastrophe!
5.0	Great! Exactly what we were looking for. Good quality.
5.0	So soft and cozy! Washes up wonderfully!
5.0	Perfect toys for the bath! Love the way you can squeeze them and fill with water to squirt. Great size for little ones that put everything in their mouth. Large enough so she can't swallow them. Long lasting and really cute.
5.0	Great toddler seat.  A bit heavy and awkward to carry, especially with two siamese kittens strapped to the seat.  Easy to manage with a human child.  I mean, if you make the child carry it.<br /><br />Well made, with a slight increase in &#34;play&#34; versus the infant seat, when the seat dock is used.  Orbit assures me this is normal.  I mean, I'm still impressed that a gum company makes such a fine array of baby gear.
5.0	Everyone loved this realistic pof of vibrant color that this decal gave to our very tiny bathroom. Its almost spa like in the look and colors. A+ HYUNDAE!
5.0	"I just bought this quilt for a new great nephew.  His mom says it is a perfrect size (not so big) and is great for the car seat.  She says as he gets older, the bright colors will make a good \\""quilt time\\"" learning tool with all the bright colors and planes, trains, and automobiles."
5.0	Love the fabric, first of all.  Our son is currently 20-ish pounds and this fits nicely over all of his nighttime garb: diaper, fleece liner, disposable liner.  For that reason, I use it mostly at night.  So far we haven't had any major blowouts with this cover, but my son doesn't often poop at night and his BMs are more solid now.  I was slightly worried given that it's white and I only use non-chlorine bleach, but it has held up fine.  Also, in a pinch, I have dried this in the dryer as opposed to line drying, and it's holding up well.
5.0	Very nice quality toy here. Two years old and going strong. Still a hit! The baby learned very easily with this product! Thanks
5.0	This is the best high chair for any situation! Takes up so little space. We have one in our dining room and one at our kitchen table. I bought one for a month-long trip to visit friends and left it in my friend's cabin in the mountains. You won't believe how small the box is when it arrives! Perfect for car and even plane travel.
5.0	I am a first time mom who travels quite frequently both for work and to visit relatives up and down the eastern seaboard.  I am nursing and making bottles on the go for baby (who is now 12 weeks old).  I originally purchased just a travel brush but found this from Amazon's &#34;other products you might like&#34; section when buying other baby gear so thought to try it out.  So far - it has worked out very well. I like that it folds in half and the brush fits inside nicely (with idiot proof pegs so you know which direction to put the bottle brush and the nipple brush).  The size is about that of a large wallet - which for me is fine and it fits inside my diaper bag and my pump bag no problem. The brush also works much better than the standard non-travel brush for cleaning my pump parts even though it feels like it is not that much smaller than the standard size brush.<br /><br />The reason that I gave this product 5 stars is because we just returned from a memorial day trip with family where my niece had a nasty stomach bug.  When I went to wash my bottles and pump parts, I saw the kitchen sponge had been used to clean up where my niece had gotten sick...needless to say that it smelled rancid and was definitely not something I wanted to use for my precious little one. Nor did I want to keep my baby's bottles close to the scene of the crime and was able to move it further away to reduce any possible contamination (I also boiled everything I used for the baby just to be sure).  This is one of those things I didn't realize I needed it until I needed it (I've used this drying rack on a few different occasions but after this last trip - I will never leave home without it).
5.0	I have been using this base for 15 months with only wonderful things to say. This is used for our second child. This base is installed in less than a minute. I have had it reviewed by a state police safety seat inspector with only wonderful comments. Even after being installed in the same vehicle for long periods of time, it continues to be secure. It is easily adapted in many vehicles for perfect fit. I have worked in emergency medicine for over 20 years and have seen the results of children who were not properly restrained. I have complete confidence in this car seat base.
5.0	this product was excellent and practical gift, If I have another opportunity to buy again, I will do it. I love it.
5.0	she's still in the newborn setting (watch some youtube vids on how to get her into it!), but i love this already. she goes right to sleep and i can get some things done. can't wait to be able to put her on my back.  it washed well, tho it does collect lint.  love that it's organic, as i imagine she might start chewing on it at some point.
5.0	This stuff kicks the snot out of borax, oxyclean and bleach/ chlorine free bleach. Gets construction site grime out, gets 5 year old white towels looking new and my cloth diapers still look new. Doesn't do anything for smells, just looks. If you need to get smells and deodorant/sweat grime out you need sport wash. This stuff works best if you are not using the cheap junky detergent in the first place.
5.0	Very nice and colorful gym for my little doll. Highly recommended
5.0	My home is so quiet at night, apart from random outside noise and my cats going nuts at various hours.  In order to help my daughter sleep through this crazy times, this item helps create the soothing white noise that will help her stay asleep when I put her in her crib.
5.0	The patterns are clever and cute, and the fabric is so soft. The look of Aden and Anais is so unique- you can spot a baby in one across the room! I have given several as gifts and I have seen them get a lot of use!!!
5.0	My 14 month old daughter loves Sophie.  Is is very light and has lots of differnt things to chew on, from the legs to the head.  It is made of all natural rubber and paint which is great.  Definitely worth the price!
5.0	This item is great.  Holds every size bottle, plus my breast pump.  It's easy to clean.  Meets all my needs.
5.0	I love these bath toys. The animals are cute and soft and there is no chance of developing mold or dirrt inside the toys. They come with a great plastic bag, if I want to tuck them in the cabinet out of  the way, and a mesh bag to keep the toys together near the bath or if I want to throw them in the wash for a really deep cleaning.<br />My daughter loves these toys, she says they are cute and fun. She spent a good,long time in the bath creating her own little action with the toys. She was making animals sounds, and splashing around until she was wrinkled. She complained when she had to leave the tub but a promise of more bath time with these great bath toys, was enough to calm the drama.
5.0	Haven't used this yet, but we set it up a few weeks ago in preparation for baby's arrival. It was easy to set up. The picture quality is good both in the light and dark. Seems like it'll work nicely.
5.0	This is great!  We've been using it for a few months and is really helpful when we are trying to find the right temperature for baby's bath.
5.0	These bibs are adorable. Hold up well to multiple washings and wearings. They don't stain and keep food off my baby! What more could I ask for in a bib?
5.0	I bought this seat for my 3 month-old. She loves it! The expression on her face was priceless the first time she sat in it and realized she was sitting independently. She likes to watch her Baby Einstein shows and play, and loves the increased participation. She can easily move her arms and legs, and gets very excited every time I put her in it. She likes it better than her bouncer. Very lightweight and portable, and I plan to use it at restaurants instead of high chairs. Her bottom sits below her feet, so she can't get out. I highly recommend this for any baby.
5.0	I love our Joovy Kooper.  I am the type of person that obsessively researches before I purchase something.  I needed a stroller that was not such a pain to keep in my car and use for every day stuff.  My giant Graco and jogging stroller are too much of a pain to haul around for everyday use.  I finally narrowed it down to the Kooper and the Baby Jogger City Mini.  After testing both in a store, and reading tons and tons of reviews, I decided on the Kooper and couldn't be happier.  It folds compact, but does not at all give that flimsy umbrella stroller feeling when in use. It is really sturdy and seems very well made.  Also, the storage bin on the bottom is much larger and more accessible the bin on either of our Gracos, the jogging stroller, or even our double jogger.  I can fit my purse and diaper bag in it with no problem.  My husband was not too happy to see another stroller come into the house, but now will only use the Kooper and loves it.
5.0	Perfect and Cute for my newborn granddaughter as a keepsake.
5.0	This is a great invention. The only suction that ever really worked was the one from the hospital and that was just ok. This works great, after you get over the fact that you are sucking junk out of your kids nose with your mouth. There is really no way (even with the filter removed) you could get anything in your mouth. You would have to really try very very hard. Be sure to read instruction and be careful not to shove it up tight into their nose. There needs to be space to allow air to pull inside the nose, due to the power of the suction.  You don't want to do any damage to your beautiful child so take it easy at first and get to know it. A little hassle to clean, but I know it is clean.
5.0	After buying the gerber nasal aspirated, this one hits the number one list. Most nasal aspirators do NOT come apart for cleaning. This one is a pricer, but worth it!! I use it every day, about twice a day (morning and eve).  I love to keep my son's nasal passages clean and clear so that he can breathe better. He doesn't mind because it's not so intrusive and a breeze to use. I LOVE the fact that it all comes apart for cleaning!! that is a plus and a bonus! If you care about your babies hygiene, you must purchase this product!
5.0	"Had no idea this existed until one of my friends suggested this to me the other week. I'd complain so much about how my toddler daughter would have wet snots clogging her nasal passages, all the time. I used to try and pick her nose, since she couldn't do it herself. But after I started using this \\""booger bong\\"", it helped tremendously! Only if I had known about this when she was born..."
5.0	Very nice for a small Baptism gift.
5.0	Great product. Has kept the little guy out of the laundry room. We have &#34;lever&#34; style doorknobs, and he can now open them with ease. This poses a problem for us, as you may guess! Here are my pros and cons:<br /><br />Pros:<br />SO EASY to install. I was looking at major work to install a lever-style doorknob locking mechanism. This took 2 seconds - clip and it's on.<br />Effective. Works over and over again.<br />Easy to open and get through the door for an adult with one hand and one motion.<br />Automatic - when you go through the door, there is no extra step to &#34;lock&#34; the door. It closes on its own.<br />No damage to the door whatsoever.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Does seem kind of flimsy. It hasn't broken or seemed in danger of breaking - time will tell. I don't anticipate this being a problem, but it doesn't seem very tough at the outset.<br />High priced. For the small thing that you get, it is a little pricey. For the ease of use, though, and no major install, I am happy to pay.
5.0	The joke is that Mosquitos in Alaska are so big, it's the state bird :( So when I say this shade kicks butt as a bug shield, I mean it! I have tried many different car seat screens for bug protection but this one really is a winner. I love that the shade is propped up and gives my baby room to kick and swing her arms. It's super easy to put on and you can still use the car seat carry handle while it's up. It fits my Britax b Safe perfectly. I am not sure why some previous posters have trouble putting the shade back in its case, there are picture directions printed right on it. Buy it! You will not regret it!
5.0	We purchased this for our 1 year old granddaughter.  It has a great look, is very sturdy and has plenty of room.  Our daughter said it was very easy for her to set up and that she did it in about 3 minutes.  My husband could not believe that she did it herself and didn't have to wait for her husband to get home to do it.  The pad that comes with it is good but we also purchased the 3&#34; crib mattress to go with it.<br /><br />We were leery about purchasing this item without seeing on in person but it turned out to be an excellent purchase.
5.0	Absolutely lovely and very good quality! I have been using one of this for six months and still look good.
5.0	I love these wall decals. Very pretty & easy to use. My daughter loves her new room! Thanks for your business!
5.0	My almost 6 months old and breast-fed exclusively baby didn't want to take any bottle. We tried so many different bottles and nipples and she was just biting the nipple instead of sucking it. It was frustrating until I tried the Adiri bottle. She is drinking from it! It is the best bottle for breast to bottle transition. Also, it has very good quality materials and design and does NOT leaks. I ordered the medium flow because this one seems to be very fast for her. NOTE: The Water Geeks Company redesigned it and now they are selling the bottle with an improved cap and a warming plate to use with bottle warmers and prevent any leaking.     Definitely recommend it for breast-fed babies! Hope this helps :)
5.0	Baby and I fit perfectly in an ergonomic manor that supports both her head and my back.
5.0	Comes in handy and is able to put some usual gear inside the bag while taking the baby out.
5.0	a must have, if you are going to spend the big $ for the bob, then get this, it makes it much more comfortable to use, quality made, no problems
5.0	overall this high chair is easy to move around.  My daughter is not old enough to finger food, but tray are very easy to detach for wash.
5.0	This was the perfect gift for our grandson's First Christmas! He is only 9 weeks old but his mom and dad really liked it.
5.0	I highly recommend an extra base if you have two cars. My husband and I switch cars routinely so it makes our day easier when we don't have to install the base over and over again.
5.0	Great fit, will keep the mattress dry and clean
5.0	Excellent product.  This is like a life saver for parents and babies.  They feel safe and secure when they're placed in it.  It rocks them to sleep.  I would recommend and buy again.  This is also a lovely design.  Very delicate.  Lots of music choices and swing levels.  I love this product because you can use it for quite a long time.  I used this till my children were 1 1/2.
5.0	Works like a charm when installed correctly. Took awhile to get the 1st lock installed since you want it to be perfect the first time. Once you know what you're doing, it's a breeze. The only thing is to get used to using the magnetic key. Place it in one permanent spot so the rest of the family knows where it is. Other than that, I highly recommend it.
5.0	My daughter would roll off of a mattress placed on the floor when we would go visit my inlaws.  This has a sling like effect that keeps her from rolling and in her bed.  Love this.  I put it and a small sleeping bag in a rolling duffel and now have a bed in a bag.
5.0	My 5 month old son has really started to hold this and loves to chew on the &#34;spikes&#34; on the top or the yellow bar with beads on the front.  The silicon body of the ball has perfect holes for my little one to grip.
5.0	It helped our ten month old granddaughter learn to walk. She's more content to play in it for a while than the type that stays in one place.
5.0	Adorable sleep sack.  Still fits my 11 month old and probably will for a few months.  Warm, but not too warm.
5.0	I use this to block the front entrance so my dogs can't run out the front door.  It looks nice and is easy to open and close.
5.0	I love this carrier more than anything. my daughter hates her car seat so when we go into a store i just put her in here and she will just sit in it for the whole shopping trip and she loves it. she is almost to the point where i can turn her around and face out and i cant wait. i get so many people asking me about it and i tell them where i got it and what kind it is..
5.0	If you are in the market for a swing this is definitly the one to buy. My daughter loves the fishes and the music. We received this as a baby shower gift.  When ever someone asks what they should register for I always say this.  It is worth every penny.  Actually ALL the aquarium items are - we have the high chair and the play mate.
5.0	My daughter is exclusively breastfed, but needs to take a bottle (of expressed milk) occasionally when I have other obligations. Around 4 months she started refusing bottles out of the blue. Even first thing in the morning (after sleeping through the night) she wouldn't take one. I bought this bottle hoping that it would feel more similar to the breast for her. It worked! She took this bottle right away with no problems. She even lets me feed her with it. My husband and I are very happy with it. Also, it is easy to clean and doesn't leak.
5.0	My daughter has a Lamb that has stood the test of love and the washer and dryer many times in it's short 2 year life.  She uses it as a lovey and carries it everywhere! We couldn't do without ours!
5.0	Love this car seat.  Baby loves it.  I'm not having the issues others complained about.  Super comfortable.
5.0	easy, secure car seat base!
5.0	This is a very nice toy and keep my 2 month old busy for a while. It can be easily clipped to a car seat, swing, etc. Overall I like this toy.
5.0	The JJ Cole cover is so helpful.  It takes away the need for a blanket, which always falls off and doesn't have the option of opening.  The cover is stylish and easy to use.  You have the option of opening it partially or all the way.  It's great for protecting your baby from the wind, sun, rain, or germy people!
5.0	"I hated to support \\""Fisher Price\\"" because of their recent toy recalls, but couldn't resist this item.  It has made meal time so much easier.  I have limited space in my dining room and this works perfectly.  I do have big wooden chairs so the seat is very secure and my grandson seems to love it. The fact that it leans back has made his transition to solid food a breeze.  I would highly recommend this product."
5.0	These are great for protecting my carrier, which used to get chewed on constantly. Now I can also  just remove these and wash them without having to wash the whole carrier.
5.0	Great developmental toy
5.0	this thing is the best for the baby to sleep in. it is easy to clean and easy to put on
5.0	This didn't work the first few times even though I have the gassiest baby! BUT once I learned how to rub his tummy better talk about a MIRACLE. Sometimes we need to have &#34;farty parties&#34; where massaging and this product will help him toot 20 times, not kidding. Talk about a chance in attitude once it's all out! LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE
5.0	My grandson enjoys it very much.  At just 4 months, he cannot make it move yet, but likes to sit in the walker and spin the toys.
5.0	Nice size, very cute design, soft. Perfect baby towel.
5.0	Bought this for my 4 year old grandson. He absolutely loves it. it's generous in size and very warm.  I would buy again.
5.0	The Item arrived on time.  Received 3 two-packs that were beat up.  Could not give as a gift as intended.
5.0	As it turns out, my wife loves this thing more than she loves me.<br /><br />Pity me, faithful Amazon shopper.  Pity me.
5.0	Early delivered, perfect colour, very warm and cute
5.0	I love this stroller!! I'm 5 foot and can lift and fold it in half.. It goes through every doorway I've tried and I love the visors on it!!
5.0	I am a mother of twins and this carrier has given me so much freedom!  When I go to the store, I am able to put one baby on my back and the other can sit in the front of the shopping cart.  Before this, I was only able to take them in the twin stroller and I couldn't use a shopping cart- and so, couldn't get many items.  The pack is VERY comfortable, for both me and the babies.  They love getting in and never complain about being in too long.  If they need to, they fall asleep in it!  My twins are now 21 and 23 lbs, I will be able to use this carrier up until they are 40lbs!  One of the best purchases I have made by far.  I highly recommend this.  PS- I am always out and about alone and I am able to get the baby in and onto my back by myself.  I usually use the back of the car, but I can do it from the ground if necessary.
5.0	the size is great (my 4 month old still sleeps best when swaddled)<br />quality is great. we wash these several times a week, and they are still as good as new.<br />our daughter doesn't get too hot in them, even in Hawaii.<br />definitely one of our best baby purchases and would recommend without reservation.
5.0	I am a new mom and I love this product.<br />After reading the mixed reviews online, I thought its best to try for myself.  I am glad I did.  Easy to use and clean.<br /><br />I recommend this product to any mother!
5.0	Really cute and easy to use. I've used this for two babies now and it still looks brand new.
5.0	We bought the cube for our son when he was 2 months old.  He would be fascinated by the flashing lights and the music.  We would avoid putting it to close to him since the volume is not adjustable.  Now he is almost seven months... and he has played with it everyday.  Now he uses his feet to make it sound, and he changes the tunes.<br />We also use it to teach him colors (well, at least we tried) and the names of the different instruments.  We are planning to buy at least three more as gift for family and friends.<br />I really recommend it for every parent.
5.0	I love this thing. I wish I had it with my first baby. The baby sleeps comfortably in it for naps and all night. He is currently 8 weeks old. If you place it next to your bed you can easily reach over to touch the baby or put a binky in his mouth, or just roll over to look at him.  I plan to use it for travel, as well. I think it's better than a pack n play.
5.0	I ordered this bag for my niece that had been looking at it in Baby-R-Us. I surprised her with it for my great nephew. She LOVES&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62; it.
5.0	love it<br />fast shipping<br />would recommend
5.0	Great product, good quality!
5.0	These fit my sons mouth perfectly. We also tried the kind you can put your finger in, but he could grip them as well.
5.0	Durable. Effective. Totally worth it. I know a lot of women repurpose their plastic bags and use pads in them but that just wasn't practical for us. The price point is nice and the bags are sturdy with no holes.
5.0	These are super cute in person. They are nice and thick I'm excited to put them on baby.
5.0	Easy to clean.  Attaches to all chairs.  Easy to transport.
5.0	Easy to set up, looks great. I would not lift it by handles when it is full, it may rip. Instead load clothes into another laundry basket to wash. Fair price too, cost more at Walmart.
5.0	Great choice - good durability, comfort, and ease of use. Good value for the price. I got a Britax stroller organizer to use with it and I think that is key. The stroller organizer gives me a place for my keys, small toys, pacifiers, phone, etc. The stroller is easy to fold up and not too heavy so it's easy to transport in the car.
5.0	The sweaters and socks that would cling to each other coming out of the dryer did not.  All socks, for once, paired up!  My sweaters came out static free.  Beautiful.
5.0	What a great idea. My little grandchildren are sure to get excited with these bags and the monsters ... increasing the likelihood to eat the nutritional snacks inside.
5.0	Best product I have purchased for my baby
5.0	I gave it as a gift to one of my close coworker friend's as a late baby shower present and she LOVED IT!!! Said it was the best present she had gotten😀
5.0	Pros:<br />* The bib is big enough to cover just about everything<br />* The elastic at the cuffs helps keep food from going up the sleeves or dragging in the food<br />* There is a pocket at the bottom that helps catch food<br />* This will also make a good arts & crafts cover-up later<br />* It's easy to clean and dries quickly<br />* The Dr. Seuss motifs are really cute<br /><br />Cons:<br />* One of the sleeves on one of my bibs has torn at the seam. This hasn't happened on the other one<br />* The sleeve openings/elastic are a little too big for smaller babies (my twins are now 11 months and around 18 pounds)<br />* The neck ties, rather than snaps, so it's adjustable, but even at the tightest the neck opening is way too big for my guys and I have to secure it with a clothespin<br /><br />I bought these bibs when the twins were about 8 months old, after discovering that the typical eating bibs did very little to prevent their clothes from becoming covered in food at every meal. They self feed, so I needed a bib that would really provide good coverage.<br /><br />Although the seam on one arm of one of the bibs has come open a bit, they seem pretty sturdy. I've been using the same two bibs for 3 meals a day for over four months now and they've held up well.<br />The bibs haven't become stained except on the bit of elastic at the cuffs, and even that isn't too bad. They wipe up easily, and when I feel they need a more thorough cleaning I've just thrown them into the wash with whatever load I'm doing that day and then I hang them to dry.<br /><br />The size of the neck opening is my biggest complaint, because the whole bib becomes pretty useless if food can just fall through. I've solved the problem by securing it with a clothespin, but it's a little annoying to do that. I understand that this bib is designed to fit a very wide range of sizes but perhaps it would be better to have small/medium/large sizes to choose from.<br /><br />I chose the Dr. Seuss prints and they are really adorable.<br /><br />All in all, I like these bibs very much and am ordering several more to have in rotation.<br /><br />I also have the [[ASIN:B003XDB91U Ikea Baby Bib Set with Sleaves-kladd Prickar]] and like them as well, but they don't seem quite as sturdy. The are very lightweight though, and are a very similar design to the Bumkins. I keep a set of them in my diaper bag and they are perfect for that.they are really adorable.<br /><br />All in all, I like these bibs very much and am ordering several more to have in rotation.<br /><br />I also have the [[ASIN:B003XDB91U Ikea Baby Bib Set with Sleaves-kladd Prickar]] and like them as well, but they don't seem quite as sturdy.

5.0	I have twin grand babies 11mos. They need a little help with walking and this does support them for that.
5.0	I bought this bed for my 13 month old who has been getting up in the middle of the night every night since December. Even her mid day nap shrank from 2 hr to 1 hr. I tried humidifier, baby monitor and other things but there wasn't much change. I bought this on a whim when I skimmed through lightening deals. And I think this works. My daughter gets up only every other night (quite a relief) also her naps can be 1.30 hrs if we are really silent. I think it could be because of the mattress pad. It transformed her bouncy hard bed into plush comfort.<br />I was worried about the photos posted of torn edges but I didn't mind giving it a shot since Amazon returns are so easy. The sides are quite delicate actually. I was worried I was going to tear it while installing cos it was a tight/snug fit. But it made sense because the top was soft and it would move alot if it weren't that snug, also we wouldn't remove and install it that often.<br />I had a problem with the shipping  (lost inventory maybe - from 3rd party) so Amazon sent me a new one in overnight shipping and matched my deal price. I'm happy with Amazon's prompt service but crossed about my item getting lost in shipping.<br />It's been a few days since I'm using this product. So far so good. Will keep you guys posted if anything comes up.
5.0	I bought this for my great granddaughter (baby shower gift). It seems to be durable and well made. New mommy was overjoyed with it!
5.0	I am so pleased with this mat! I was going to buy the more expensive brand from the store but decided to see if I could find anything cheaper and this is by far the best for the money. I bought two sets, they look great and are tough. My kids, [...] year old twins, can't tear them up! Yet, they are softer than the hardwood floor in their bedroom. Now, they spend all of their time on these mats, playing. Only problem I found is that the borders do not match up in the corners. We tried and tried and eventually gave up and threw them away. Good thing is, the mat still looks great without them. I'm just so glad it doesn't have those letters and numbers that come out of the tile! With my children, that would have been a terrible idea!
5.0	The body suit was longer in comparison to the fit of the pant.  This product do wash well and colors hold very well.  I am happy with the Product.
5.0	We purchased the Chicco Liteway Plus months ago.  While I LOVE the stroller, it lacks a little in the storage department.  This product is great.  I can avoid carrying a diaper bag most of the time.  The pockets are super handy for wallets and cell phones, etc.  The clip handles also make this product easy to snap on grocery cart handles.  Great product!  Worth every penny.
5.0	Works well for my son.  The bottom has a non-slide rim so it doesn't move around on the toilet seat.  Our seat is elongated and it seems to fit just fine.
5.0	Best spoons ever! Not only the spoon holds the right amount of food, but the baby also enjoys playing with it, especially when teething. Looks stylish too.
5.0	This really works! It catches all the drips and the child can set it down when he needs a break. I'm so happy with this, I bought and sent them to all the grandkids. We even use them as adults, in the car or on a hot day. Great buy!
5.0	Omg my nephew cant stop looking at himself and just smile, great buy for new born to 1.5 years old.
5.0	This jumper keeps her busy and there is so much for her to do!  She loves it and so do her parents
5.0	My sister let me borrow this for my child...my first and only child. She has slept in this every night, and she's now 3 months old.  The battery life reads &#34;3 hours.&#34; I had this thing moving all night long, for almost 2 full weeks before I had to even think it was slowing down. If it were really 3 hours, I wouldn't find this worth it. Recently, the motor seemed to not work correctly, and it's barely moving anymore...but I feel this is my fault...due to how I might have carried it when I moved it quickly at one point.  The chair moves 360 degrees, and often I'll turn her around when I'm getting ready in the morning, so she can see me, and know where I am. I didn't use the music until the last month, when she finally decided she didn't want it so quiet during sleep.  I'm buying another one via Amazon due to the great price and free shipping with PRIME. The closest store to me, otherwise, is 60+ miles away. I love this, and hope she still wants to be in it for several more months, and then I'll hand mine down to some new nieces and nephews. I think everyone has to find what works for their baby, and this definitely worked for my girl. :)
5.0	It's a bit heavy but it is extremely sturdy. I love this stroller. We use it with a graco click connect car seat and the connecting and disconnection is seamless and easy. Folds and unfolds easily but like I said, it is on the heavier side.
5.0	This is  life saver! Yes, its a lot of fabric but once you get the hang of wrapping it its not that big of a deal. I am able to get it on and off very easily now. Baby loves it, I love the flexibility of it. I can nurse easily and discreetly in it too. I like it so much I have ordered a second so I can keep one in the car and one at home.
5.0	much bigger than i ever expected. very cute!
5.0	Bought about 4 packs of these. They are simple: flannel fabric with surged edges.<br />My infant son didn't like to sleep on the cotton bassinet sheet - so I used these as sheets (just tucked them in around the edges of the bassinet mattress). They worked great. Super soft, wash up great. They also work great as burp cloths.
5.0	I loved how soft and cute this blanket is, very pretty baby blue color.
5.0	Love this seat and its affordable price.  We have had great success with it over the last 7+ months.  Great design and easy to install both forward and backwards.
5.0	I like this washcloth a lot and that matches the crib bed setting I bought. I would´ve love to know how soft it was before buying, although I found it to be of good quality but you never know until you use it! Great buy!
5.0	"My previous review is at the bottom of this review.  I have since changed my thoughts.<br /><br />The video monitor, for whatever reason, began working fine. Randomly one day.  I couldn't tell you why.  I think perhaps we were confused by the sound \\""cutting in and out\\"" (which it still does, slightly annoying) when there is noise.  It is silent, and then \\""kicks on\\"" when there's a noise in the room  I think it was not kicking on, whether that's because there really was NO noise, or because it wasn't picking up the sound, I don't know.<br />It works great, clear picture, good sound, etc.<br />No interference with our wireless.  I would now recommend this product.<br /><br />(Previous Review)<br />The sound on this monitor doesn't work unless our wireless internet is off, and sometimes not even then.  Meaning that we can never use the internet or watch movies/tv (we use netflix, not cable) when the baby is asleep. Not exactly practical.  The video works great, but a picture of my baby crying isn't going to get my attention if the sound isn't with it!<br /><br />For what we paid, I find it ridiculous that this product doesn't work.  Sorely disappointed."
5.0	We have tried a ton of differant sippy cups for my 13 month old and these are the only ones he will use. Great for transitioning from bottle or breast.
5.0	My son love very much
5.0	I love these wipes. I pump exclusively and it's so nice to have a nice fresh feeling wipe to just clean up after I finish. They smell great too. The wipes are a bit bigger than necessary, so I do rip them in half, which makes them last longer. I think the size is the only thing I'd change - smaller wipes, double the amount, in a shorter package that fits better in a pump bag.
5.0	Every kid should have one of these. This is the only object my son attaches to. It makes him so happy whenever he sees it!
5.0	These are great for keeping grocery bags in place.
5.0	Love it!  Great quality.  Perfect Christening gift
5.0	This was a great mattress for the value. I agree that it's a good firmness and fairly lightweight. Our daughter has slept on it for two years now and it's held up fine. I don't know what anyone else is doing to have it buckle or sag, that doesn't even really seem possible. It has resisted stains and smells from baby leaks and will surely last long through the toddler bed phase.
5.0	It's a gate. That you can walk through.
5.0	"Shortly after the birth of our second son, our cheap bassinet was recalled.  At the same time, our son was ready to progress to a crib, but wasn't quite ready to share a room with his older brother.  We wanted to continue to keep our baby in our room until he could sleep through the night, but needed an item with a small foot print.    This crib is compact, assembles, collapses and sets up easily (I, a 5'3\\"" woman assembled it and then carried it up three floors by myself).    The crib bottom can be set at two heights, has a drop-side, collapses in half, and holds up to 45lbs.  One thing to note, the crib does not have locking wheels and our 23 month old can easily pull his 7 month old brother around the room with ease.We're presently working on solution to this issue. Most likely we will remove wheels & cover leg ends with felt.    The crib is classical in styling and is sturdily built.  We love this crib and kick ourselves for not registering for this instead of the bassinet.    Oh forgot to mention that when the crib is in its highest setting (bassinet), with the drop-side down, the crib can also be used as a changing table."
5.0	Very nice frame and a good size.  Will match any decor.  Why more words when you have said it all?
5.0	Adorable, perfect for our precious new granddaughter and works so well with brother's jungle crib bedding.
5.0	My 2 year old loves it!
5.0	Have given these as presents... It is a great way to introduce babies to food. They love them! Highly recommend.
5.0	it's nice to be able to have a base in my car and my daughter's car so we don't have to move the bases everytime.
5.0	I chose this rating because it's a good and cute bottle pretty durable, I bought a different nipple for it cause I didn't like the one that was on it.
5.0	This little suitcase is ABSOLUTELY adorable, and great quality at a great price. We fit almost all of my 10-month old's wardrobe in it for our vacation. And I LOVE the little touches like the inner pockets & banana zippers! So cute!
5.0	Great value, would make a great baby shower gift.  Love the hidden nipple brush.  Stands up great even without the nipple brush inside (since I leave it out to dry).  No complaints.
5.0	i bought 2 of this for me and my friend.<br />my friend told me this was one of &#34;must have&#34; and I agree with it now.<br />babies love this small little simple toy
5.0	This is an awesome car seat. It is nicely padded and the latch system is great and very easy to use. My son has used it for 2 years now and even though it only goes to 40 pounds it was worth every penny. I hope the britax booster seat is just as wonderful.
5.0	My son constantly throws his food over his highchair when he doesn't want to eat it, which is pretty much everything, so this is a  must have.  Clear material so it doesn't stand out on the floor, good size to catch most of his throws, easy to wipe off
5.0	My grand baby didn't like the swing her mommy had for her so I thought I would try this one it is more open and is soooo smooth running. Mommy loves it that it is also electric so she don't go through so many batteries....
5.0	I now have several of these, and I am without a doubt that they are the best thing ever when it comes to feeding your kids. I have a 7 month old and she loves chewing on all parts of it and then feeding herself when she is done playing. I fill one up and put it in the play pen and one on the table for when she's walking around and getting into the tall things. I got several of the 3.5 oz and one 6 oz so far and everything goes in these. Oatmeal, applesause, jarred baby food, to homemade. No more fights for the spoon and flung mess everywhere. I have only had one mess and it was dad's fault for stepping on it. They are so easy to clean. Nothing sticks and no hard to reach corners. Heck even a bottle brush fits perfect. I think this will be used until she several grades into school. Maybe even longer. If not I won't mind having a yummy treat for myself.
5.0	This booster seat is great!  My son started using it when he was six months old.  I would place him in the booster on the floor with toys on the tray.  We would sit and play together.  Now we use it in restuarants and at home.  It's sturdy and easy to use.  It's easy to clean too.  No small pockets for food to collect in.  If you are considering another booster, I highly recommend reading the reviews.
5.0	This is my second frame, now both of my grandsons have their pictures in them.  A friend of ours is having a baby hope to purchase another frame shortly.
5.0	My grandson loves the texture of these spiral handles.  They him with his grip so he doesn't drop the utensils.  Best set of the bunch I ordered.
5.0	My son absolutely loved this teether from about 3 months to 8 months.  We had to buy 2 because if we lost it somewhere he would have a meltdown.  It is easy for them to hold, it's soft, and makes a little noise when you squeeze it. It's easy to clean and small enough to pack in the diaper bag, etc. I would recommend every parent have one of these in there house.  Even now, over 8 months he loves it when his teeth come in.  He doesn't play with it all the time like when he was younger but it's still a must when teething.
5.0	I love this mini crib. We bought two, one for our tiny home nursery and one for Nana's house. It's compact which is great if you are tight on space. My daughter is 6 months old and still has plenty of room. Could it be more solid- sure, but you're only spending 140 some dollars here. Given the price point I think it's good quality. It won't last forever, but I figure it will last for this little one and a second. So for the price- I think its perfect. The only downside to mini cribs is finding bedding but there are several internet sites that sell mini crib bedding- you just have to search for awhile.<br /><br />**Update** My daughter is turning one in 1 week and still has ample room in this crib.
5.0	Awesome for the money. Great video. Can zoom in, rotate, and it shows the temp.  Also loves that it shuts off after no noise and turns back on when it hears sound.
5.0	A million times better than the white crappy ones you can get at the store.
5.0	what's not to like? the price is very cheap.<br />these are useful and practical for crawling babies.<br />i would buy from this seller again.
5.0	Its too cute, excelent product
5.0	My 3 month old baby girl loves the lights! She's not quite pressing buttons yet, but I just have to press a buton or roll the rattle and she's transfixed!
5.0	Love this! It is so comfy!
5.0	Really helped with sleep.
5.0	Bought these for my prefolds and they work easy and great as expected. These size 1 should last me awhile without having to buy a bigger size.
5.0	Great product. I dry it in the drier and the sheet still fits the co-sleeper mattress.
5.0	The baby boy is due in June.  All the gr-grands, grands, etc., are all excited and pooling our shopping skills.  I really scored with these flannel crib pad.  They are excellent quality.  The expectant parents were so pleased with this purchase/gift.  I will continue to look on Amazon for &#34;finds.&#34;
5.0	These tubes work better & stay in place better than the medela brand.
5.0	I bought this for my 18 month old and he loves it. The spout is durable enough for someone who has a full set of teeth and isn't shy to use them. The handles are great too, he can get a firm grip on the bottle. The spout however does leak, if he turns the bottle upside down, which he shouldn't be doing in the first place I might add :) Anyways, I'm really happy with this bottle! I purchased extra spouts, since he has a track record of breaking the spouts on other brands, but haven't needed them yet.
5.0	We bought these at a housewares store the other day (my son discovered them and I couldn't say no).  He showed them to every single person we walked by on the way home.  Since then they haven't left his sight.  He has eaten with them, bathed with them, slept with them.  We had an enormous tantrum over needing to put them in the dishwasher.  He has always been a good eater but at almost 3 sometimes is reluctant to eat what we are eating (even when he loves it usually).  These give him that extra push to be excited about meals again!
5.0	Great Father's Day gift
5.0	I received a TwinGo as a Christmas gift when my baby girls were already 11 months old. Truthfully, I couldn't imagine using it much. I had spent the previous year learning how to &#34;wear&#34; my babies in slings and wraps, and I thought they would be outgrowing babywearing soon. I couldn't have been more wrong!<br /><br />Wearing the TwinGo is faster and easier than setting up a double stroller, and my babies love the snuggles. I use it simply to get my kids to and from the car (we park on the street). I wear the babies in it when I grocery shop, while I push my 2 1/2 year-old in the cart. It makes trips to the doctor's office SO much easier. I use it to transport the babies from the car into friends' houses for playdates. I wear it every Saturday morning to buy my produce at the farmers' market. I wear it on Sundays to get my kids in and out of church. In short, I use my TwinGo multiple times a day, every day.
5.0	We love this carseat! It weighs a lot, which seems to be a good thing if we ever get into a crash, but it's portable. It receives top safety marks from Consumer Reports, which is the reason we bought it, and tested very well at the hospital.
5.0	"My husband and I stood in front of all the strollers and car seats for a good 30 minutes, overwhelmed by all the choices. A woman walking by with her baby tried to talk us into buying the Snap n' go.  My husband was convinced and wanted to register for it, but I thought it was a horrible idea.  \\""No way!\\"", I said to my husband, as soon as she walked away.  \\""That thing looks so cheap!  Absolutely not.\\""  I wanted to have THE travel system of all systems.  So, that's what we registered for.  After all the baby gifts came rushing though, it was clear that we would have to purchase a car seat and stroller on our own.  My in-laws purchased the Britax convertible car seat that I wanted (which I highly recommend, by the way!), but we still needed another car seat for our other car.  My husband was still sold on the Snap 'n Go, so he went ahead and purchased one.  All I can say now is, BEST DECISION EVER!! I can't imagine lugging around a travel system!  The Snap 'n Go is SO easy to lift out of the SUV, takes up less room in the back, and is SO convenient!  PLEASE, do yourself a huge favor...forget the fancy strollers and travel systems and buy the Snap 'n Go...you'll learn fast that a lighter-weight, more convenient, and easier product (especially in the winter time and rainy season!) makes much more sense than something frilly and fancy!  <br /> <br />P.S.- Once my husband bought the Snap 'n Go, I bought a second base, so I could use it, too!!"
5.0	Great little device for the price! Every day I drink a &#34;green&#34; health drink made from a powder sold here on Amazon. This little mixer mixes the class of it up totally with no problems. It's fast, it's simple, it just works! I'll but another one if this one wears out!
5.0	This might be good for a travel seat but it is pretty cheap overall.  I wanted something a little more substantial for protection.
5.0	Great. It is highly recommended.
5.0	Fit nicely for large nipples. No more pain when pumping. But a bit pricey. It'd be good to have special price for purchase of two.
5.0	My husband is a die hard Red Sox fan. Being from New England we just had to have these on our registry. I had my doubts about them since they weren't one of the big brands, but my baby loves them! He has a very deep palate and need something a bit longer than the average pacifier to trigger his suck reflex, and these worked great!
5.0	I have not used this yet but it looks like it will fit a very small newborn.  This is very soft and looks easy to use .  I like the cross over snap option and the fact that it is adjusted by button hole elastics
5.0	Love this! Easy to put in and take out.
5.0	I have one on my 40in tv to keep it from tipping over on my son. I purchased this one to put on my parents flat screen tv to protect all the grandchildren. One grandchild nearly tipped over the tv but strapped help the tv up and prevented the child from getting hurt. The strap are easy to disconnect for cleaning and reconnecting afterwards.
5.0	I love this sunscreen! I've been searching for the perfect water resistant sunscreen for two years now. I've tried everything with a low EWG rating and haven't been pleased with any of it.  My number one requirement for a family sunscreen is a 1 rating on the EWG site. I'd almost resigned myself to the idea that all 1's are thick, greasy, difficult to rub in, and leave you looking white. Badger Balm was the best I found previously to Sun'N'Fun but it was sooooo greasy that I dreaded putting it on myself. It took way too long to rub it into my toddler's skin and anyone with a toddler knows time is of the essence when applying sunscreen to a squirming, sunscreen resistant child.  This month I found Sun'N'Fun and my search is over. It's not the least bit greasy! It's thicker than your non mineral sunscreens but rubs in easily and leaves almost no white. It smells wonderful.  I bought 3 tubes before I even ran out of my first because I knew I'd found my new sunscreen. I highly recommend this sunscreen.  My only wish is that they made larger tubes. We live in Texas and swim nine months of the year so we go through a tube a month fort the two of us. Still you get a 10% discount when you order three tubes so that's my plan.
5.0	we love our baby bjorn and we also love this cover. it totally covers the baby and even has a little hood you can use too. we got caught in the rain once and it kept him cozy and dry. it does generate a lot of heat, so you have to dress the baby accordingly. i would highly recommend this product.
5.0	Very good easy to use and safe
5.0	We love this toy. It crinkles, squeaks and rattles. Has a mirror and there are different textures on the one feather. Keeps my 3 month old enamored in his car seat for upwards of a half hour. SO CUTE. back is black and white with yellow center. great look at toy for baby too :)
5.0	This is an amazing stroller! I have not regretted this purchase. Even if you are not jogging, this stroller can go on any trail and road. It goes over rough ground because the wheels and it goes over curbs so much easier! It has a nice place to put your phone, ipod, or other items. I love that it has two cup holders for you and two for your kid. The back adjusts and the baby trend car seat snaps right in. I would definitely recommend this stroller and buy it again.
5.0	I ordered this Bath Pad when my daughter was born almost six years ago and used it for the first few months. It's an excellent product to use from birth onwards. I never had to worry about water going in her eyes or mouth as the pad keeps the head elevated. Now I bought another one for my second child and have been using it everyday. Highly Recommended!
5.0	This is a great cover. It has a perfect balance between being thin enough to allow airflow, but thick enough that it keeps things nice and discrete. I really love the scoop - it stops everyone else from being able to see whats going on, but allows me to look at bub. Disclosure: I was given one of these for free from the manufacturer in exchange for my honest review on Amazon. After having used the product however, it would be straight on the shopping list!
5.0	Love these bottles!!! Got them in just a few days :-)
5.0	The perfect tool for new parents! Expertly demonstrates all the things not to do while changing baby. 1. Positioning of a Caregiver. This device will ensure that you position yourself directly in the line of fire. Both #1 and #2 will definitely hit your clothes, and if you are lucky, your face! 2. Positioning of Baby. This device holds baby's legs together, to create maximum smear. Holding baby's legs wide apart will only mean that the poop stays in the diaper!!! This device endures spread up at least one, if not both legs!!! 3. Diapering Speed. This device is guaranteed to at least double your changing time. Not only will you have to wiggle baby's feet into this thing while it's attempting to crawl away- you have to take it off before you can take on or off their pants. 4. Breast Pain. All new mums should experience the maximum amount of pain. Not only are your breasts sore from bad latch p, cracking and that bout if thrush, now, with this amazing device, you can get your baby to accurately and repeatedly kick you in the breast. Especially good when baby is crying, and you're already leaking!
5.0	I love this booster!  I needed a highchair for my mom's house because we are there so much, niether of us wanted to buy an actual chair so I just got the cheapest seat I saw.  Little did I know it was the best purchase I could have made.  It's very lightweight.  My 2 y.o. daughter can take it to the table herself.  We don't use the tray though we just pull it right up to the table.  Great booster!
5.0	The wife says it's smoother than her hybrid. Packs small and is built to last.
5.0	This thing is super heavy, like really heavy.  BUT worth it for peace of mind and knowing your child is safe.  It fits great in the car (especially with the angle adjuster), and is so narrow it's easy to see that 3 would fit across the back seat. Setup was simple, installing in the car was easy, and getting my son in and out is a breeze.  My son especially loves it.
5.0	This item was a life saver. It made transporting the car seat around so much easier. I would recommend this item to anyone.
5.0	These are a great size and have great absorbency. The only downside is that they are a little thick and show through certain fabric and are visible under your clothes. But if staying around the house looking like a bum these are great for going long periods of time without leaking and they absorb well and keep you feeling dry.
5.0	I really wanted my boy to train with just the toilet insert, but it was not working. I'm grateful I finally caved and bought this. This smaller kid friendly toilet makes potty training a more manageable task for kids. My son even started pouring his own waste into the regular toilet. He only used this for about three to four weeks. Once he mastered his little potty he was able to go straight to the big one (no inserts).
5.0	We have really enjoyed this bouncer.  We had another one as a gift, but our daughter would not play in it. We have two of these bouncers-one at my mother's house in S.C. and one in N.Y.  We feed our daughter in this awesome seat.  I purchased this seat when she was five months old.  I recommend this bouncy seat as early as 2 months old. A must have! If you need to keep the baby busy DEFINATELY try this. Good luck!
5.0	My baby is a big fan of the MAM pacifiers!
5.0	Ultra-cute little fellow. So soft and huggable. You just have to love it! Fun for my little to play with, she loves it so much and will not put it down.
5.0	I got this necklace for my grandson because he was busy cutting so many teeth.  When we put it on him, he was a little cranky and within a few minutes he seemed to quite down some.  I think his pain tolerance is helped with this necklace.  It would be a great baby shower gift or for after the baby is born.  I wish I had known of this back in the day.  ;)  We all want to help our baby - and grandbaby.....so give this a try for them.
5.0	This saved our breastfeeding relationship-- hands down!! The hard side helped my little one stay up higher to help with latching and I love that it's taller because I have a longer torso. Seriously, I was hours away from quitting when I decided to try this pillow since we were having such latching issues (even with lots of LC help). I love telling new nursing moms about this pillow and anytime i lend it out the mom tosses her current pillow and goes for this one!
5.0	My daughter did not like the noisy electronic Furby that I got her first. She enjoys the plush (silent) one better.
5.0	This seat is a lifesaver!  It is soft, light, easy to carry, and easy to clean. My daughter uses it at home and I like being able to take it along when we leave the house so she is more comfortable using the potty away from home.  I highly recommend this product!
5.0	This Sleep Sheep is so cute and cuddly. I love that is has four different sounds and they are all soothing. I use it for his naps and bedtime. It attaches nicely to his pack n play. It has two time settings (23 and 45 minutes) and volume control. He is usually asleep before the 23 minute setting stops. I'll confess, I have even fallen asleep to the rhythmic heartbeat. Definitely worth every penny.
5.0	My first impression of this was that the base was not stable and I couldn't be more wrong.  This item is very stable and the seat is perfect for the age of the babies that it recommends.  I had tried another item by Baby Einstein and the seat was so roomy that my little boy kept having his head flung back when he jumped.  This item has been his most favorite toy and he is hard to please.  He jumps and exercises his legs all of the time and loves it.  During his jumping, this gives him the support he needs while exercising his legs.  He also has the ability to turn in his seat to play with the different toys around the seat on each side.  I highly recommend this item to anyone that wants to help their children develop their mind and their legs.  The instructions also made it VERY easy to assemble and very detailed.
5.0	They actually stick! I both safety first corners initially but my 12 month old was soon able to get those off. These actually have stayed on. Well done!
5.0	Getting this was such a great decision! We use cloth diapers for most of the day, and disposables if we travel or at night. We can keep the diapers separate from the other laundry, and not smell them throughout the house - the charcoal air filter helps. We chose the larger pail because we only wash them every other day. Our brand's guideline are to only wash them every two days, but we just can't let them sit for that long! I definitely recommend this!
5.0	Pro's... Easy to wash and inserts can be added if you have heavy pee'ers.<br /><br />Con's are that they are bulky.<br /><br />I only used them for training my daughter at night.  Used them for about a year.  She is now 4 and fully trained at night and that is great coming from a little girl with Autism.
5.0	I purchased this item from this seller as well as the laundry basket and the bedskirt. It is absolutely beautiful! It looks just as pictured. There is no opening it and the browns are darker or the pinks are lighter, it is just as pictured and beautiful! The sheets are so soft my husband wanted to cuddle up in the bed first! The pillow case has a safety zipper on the open end so that it is not open or able to slip off when the child is sleeping. And the laundry basket is alot bigger than it looks! I was amazed when I put it together (consists of opening it and velcroing a few flaps - very simple!) it also has an inner bag that slips right out for you to take to the laundry without having to move the whole hamper. The throw pillow is also much larger than I thought it would be but its still cute and she will like it later on! This set is just amazing and I am completely in love with it! I think we will stick with JoJo Designs for all of our baby bedding!<br /><br />My only complaint is that the seller does not ship to FPO/APO addresses. If you are in this situation, you will have to find another method of shipping such as a mail forwarding service. Made shipping very high to go that route, but in the end the set was completely worth it!
5.0	Have just tried this brand and really like it.<br />This toy has a lovely gentle bell in it. Would recommend.
5.0	We bought this for my toddler, hoping she would be encouraged to leave our comfy king sized bed! While that has not happened yet, she still loves it! The bed is much sturdier than I expected and was not too difficult to assemble (although we did somehow manage to put the footboard on backwards). It uses a crib sized mattress and bedding. I liked this one over some of the other designs because the footboard is a lower profile.
5.0	Works as expected -- you do need to put something heavy in the bottom during windy days.  B ut it does what it is supposed to do...when it is out in the street cars actually finally slow down.
5.0	These r the bottle I give my kids when they were younger so I wanted to do it for the last one...
5.0	perfect size for my kids!
5.0	Avent makes the best bottles around in my opinion; great high quality products, widely available parts, and easy to use. I have the full array of the last generation of parts. They have since changed the bottle shape and all accessories, and while they are for the most part interchangeable. This manual pump is the most greatly improved item since the change.<br /><br />I never thought I would use a manual but I almost prefer it because it can be more gentle and portable. This set includes everything you need to pump, and is easy to use at or away from home. All the parts are dishwasher safe, and mine have fared just fine on the numerous occasions they have accidentally been washed on the bottom rack.<br /><br />The biggest advancement of this one over the last version is that there is more of a slant in the neck of the pump, allowing you to sit in a more relaxed position. The other one has a straighter neck so you have to sit really propped up to avoid milk collecting in the neck. This one lets the gravity do the work for you while giving your tired back a break. Also, five stars for still making them in England!!
5.0	Love that I can check on my little man,  especially when he's upset or very quiet.  Though I have a middle headrest in my Hyundai Elantra, this mirror would block my rear window view if I used that one.  So I put it on the passenger side headrest.
5.0	my kids will fall asleep on  anything.
5.0	My daughter love her tooth brush!!!  I went and bought 2 more!!  Helps with her teething, I throw it in the fridge get's nice and cold.  My OL doesn't like a binky so this work great!
5.0	This is the cutest set for the price and the colors could be eaither or a girl or boy however one thing I wasent overly excited about was you dident know what color you were going to get and that would have been ok for a girl but not for a boy the shipping was fast product is good quality for the price I am happy with it .
5.0	As expected.Quick service. Perfect condition.  Who can be excited about a crib pad?
5.0	I love the Thirty-one brand totes! They are so versatile and hold up well. I have purchased some of the Thirty-one purses and have not been thrilled with them. But I LOVE my totes and thermals!
5.0	I love it.  I haven't given it to my son yet.  I will be giving it to him at his wife's baby shower.
5.0	2 day shipping took 3 days and seller refunded shipping. Excellent customer service. They finally arrived today and they fit perfect. I have a 4 month old boy with giant feet who wears 6-9 mo clothes and yes they are a little hard to get on but that's only so baby can't pull them off! Excellent product & seller. A+
5.0	"this is a great tub.  the \\""baby stopper\\"" is wonderful - it allows my 2 month old son to sit comfortably by himself without me having to constantly prop him up.  and when he gets bigger, i can just remove it.  i haven't had any problems with mold.  when i'm done, i rinse it out with water and stand it up so it will thoroughly air dry.  i also bought the [[ASIN:B0000798L0 First Years Sit and Store Parent Bathing Seat]] since it was hurting my back and knees to bend over or kneel.  now when i bathe him in my tub, i can just sit with him and let him enjoy his bath time :)"
5.0	Green toys makes great old-fashioned toys that are extremely well made and easy to clean.  We have given these as gifts and the kids love them.  I am sure they will last a long time.
5.0	I have a couple of these in ecru, and one with the ducks (yellow and green). My ecru ones are fabulous! Perfect for lining the changing pad and for using as a changing pad on the go, large, nice size. I pretty much use them  whenever i put my baby down most anywhere because she has acid reflux and she cannot be trusted to keep any surface clean! These absorb well without leaking through, they are also soft, so sensitive baby skin will not be irritated on these. As I stated my ecru ones are perfect, they wash well and maintain their shape, very little pilling and very little shrinkage (they are washed every other day). HOWEVER, the duck and frog (yellow and green) pad I have appeared the same when new but washed VERY differently... I would rate that one a 2 stars, still works well but it pilled and shriveled up, it looks very old a worn out already.
5.0	We rec'd today and I am quite pleased with the quality of this item. Great value for a $10 toy! Looks like a high-end boutique toy, wonderful choice of color combo and fabrics/patterns used. I think I like this toy as much as my 6 month old son does! Beautiful and a 'smart' toy!
5.0	Love the quality and thickness of this towel. Much better than those cheap ones at the baby stores.Looking forward to giving baby her first bath!
5.0	My daughter is almost one, she received this when she was about three months old and has not grown tired of it.  We hang it on her car seat and her stroller.  She loves to squeeze and pull it, and chew on the plastic bug which seems to give teething relief.
5.0	This necklace is very light weight and has really helped my daughter through her teething spells. Less drool and less crankiness makes for a happy baby and a happy mom!
5.0	amazingly soft, generous size, both mommy and baby love these soft blankets. I have purchased several of these in different prints, and I would definitely recommend these blankets.
5.0	a little bit smell but after several days you can't smell it<br />great price, a little bit thick, but it was ok
5.0	Great sippy cups. I have used these multiple times and through the dishwasher - they have held up just fine and I do not have any issues.
5.0	Exactly as advertised.  One hammock and chain, the hardware to install them and plenty of clips to hang your smaller stuffed animals on the chain.  Love the all-in-one package.  Simple, easy and great use of this product.  I like it!
5.0	Good for you newborn you mut have it if you want your baby happy
5.0	One of the concerns that entered my mind before buying this lock was having to take the toilet seat off before installing. Off the top of your head who really knows how much of a pain that is, or is not, if you haven't done it before. The answer is, it takes about 60 seconds with a screwdriver and (optionally for me) an adjustable wrench. It's absolutely simple.<br /><br />There are spacers included with this unit to ensure that the stopper remains flush with your toilet seat lid when it is closed and locked, so that any prying hands can't find enough space to get in at all.<br /><br />My wife was more concerned with appearance of the lock than I was, but you win on both fronts with this model. It looks better than the units that attach without removing the toilet seat and it functions better - mainly in so far as its not being as easily broken.<br /><br />Before installing this unit I installed one of the locks that required no toilet seat removal and could tell that it would be very easily snapped off so I removed it and replaced it with this lock. I am glad I did.<br /><br />It may not fit every toilet seat on the planet but it fit all three of mine.
5.0	couldn't imagine dining out without it!  I keep it in my dipaer bag all the time.  My one year old will throw plates, so it is the perfect, sanitary way to feed him in restaurants.  I have bought them as shower gifts for all of my friends.
5.0	These Organic Cotton Nursing pads are awesome. So soft and are made with quality. I have some other cheap cotton reusable pads that are not as comfortable as these. It's important that what we put near our breast for so many hours a day is non toxic so these make me feel comfortable. I have tried the bamboobies disposable nursing pads but do not like them as they bunch up easily and don't stay put. These stay much better.
5.0	I bought this for my 5 week old son who hates to lay down flat. I have used this head support in everything from his bassinet to his rock n' play to his car seat. He is so much more comfortable now and his head is much better supported that it was using any other head support we owned. Also, its size is great because he will grow with it. All in all, great purchase!
5.0	I breastfed my baby and I started introducing water when he was 3 months old, at the beginning I tried Avent bottles but it did not work. My baby never complaing with Dr. Browns bottle. He is now 6 months old and I started giving him formula and the only bottle that he likes is Dr. Brown's bottle. I compared Avent and Dr. Brown's system and I found that regardless of the anti-colic system of both, Dr. Brown's nipples are softer than Avent, in fact I think are very close to a real nipple, I guess that is why my baby never refunsed them. Give them a try I strongly recommend it.
5.0	Awesome sleeper. Fits perfectly with our bed. Love having baby right there.
5.0	works really great for my little one.
5.0	We have purchased a number of travel bags for our Britax car seats, but this is the only one that I would recommend.  It is large enough to fit even our Britax Boulevard 70, and it is very sturdy!  Also, the very first bag that actually straps the car seat inside the bag. Very roomy, and it can accommodate a car seat and additional items; e.g. clothes, diapers, bottles, etc.
5.0	We have given this blanket for baby gift several times.  it is well loved and frequently used, making us look like knowldgable givers.
5.0	These are .05 Tog, so cool and great for summer.  Excellent in length, with quality that is expected from Halo.
5.0	Super easy to figure out and use - can't say that about all baby gates!
5.0	Love these cute stickers that help me keep track of my little one as she grows!
5.0	I had a hard time finding fitted oval bassinet sheets. These ones are made of a pretty thick material, are very soft and fit great.
5.0	So soft! My baby loves to snuggle into her Bamboo blanket!
5.0	exactly what I wanted!
5.0	I bought the long and two short guard rail covers and am very happy with my purchase.  It is a great buy, fits well and my baby is putting it to the test with his teeth and the covers are holding up well!
5.0	These little sandwich cutters work so well and the kids love them. They work for other things too like pancakes and some fruits even. They make kids want to eat so thats always a plus!!
5.0	Very pleased with this. Excellent service.
5.0	I am very satisfied with this product. If you are looking for something hands free..this is the product for you. I was however hesitant on the size because I'm small frame with a big bust. Pre-pregnancy I was 34DD and during pregnancy I was a 3DDD. After reading many reviews I decided to go with the S/M/L. This size allows so much room that it's not necessary to purchase the bigger size. I love that it provided straps for better support and it's super comfy!
5.0	For those toddlers that haven't transitioned to a big bed yet, this is a great blanket option!<br />I just bought this for my 2.5 years old.  She has not transitioned to a big bed yet and after 6 months of waking up all the time just to put a blanket on her, I couldn't WAIT to buy this!<br /><br />Product: Just like a traditional sleep sack but now has feet openings for more mobilty for walkers!  It's very easy to put on and zips up really well.  (Wish they made an adult size!)<br /><br />Fabric: The fabric is SUPER SOFT and keeps my daughter warm all night.<br /><br />Uses: Sometimes when my daughter goes to sleep she's too hot after her bath so we don't put this on till later.  I actually can easily put this on her while she's sleeping and she doesn't wake up!<br />The arm holes are big so her arms slip in quick and the legs are easy too.<br /><br />We have two of them!  (I might try to squeeze into one of them and take a nap!)
5.0	Baby loves to suck and chew all over this thing.
5.0	These covers are amazing. My son seems to really think the comfortable and they have not leaked yet. They easily fit the cloth I use which is nice cause then I don't have to go buy new ones.
5.0	We love it. Very convenient.
5.0	Love this, great quality
5.0	"I have 2 of these on baskets that are 15\\""x9\\"" - got the baskets at BRU (I think).  One note - I have them on so the applique is on one of the short sides, so that might make a difference if people have trouble fitting them on baskets."
5.0	These are SUPER cute. We love them! They come fully assembled which is freakin awesome! My girls love lounging on them and climbing them. They are very cute colors, and very sturdy. We love them!
5.0	I bought this for the great price and the best design of all the cart covers. It is pretty fluffy to give the baby padding and it has loops to hook on toys. And it helps keep away germs!
5.0	aden + anais has never disappointed me. I probably own over 40 various products including swaddles, issies, regular bibs, burpy bibs, crib sheets, and changing pad covers. such quality and such beautiful products!
5.0	Is a good toy for kids!The turtle include the batteries.The LSD display correctly!Is a great toy and very nice.And safe to use.
5.0	After looking at brand after brand I chose the Britax Marathon ClicktTight and I am so happy with my purchase.  This seat is extremely secure.  No movement any direction when installed.  The padding is super soft and comfortable.  The pads around the straps and the rubber guards on the straps make a very tight and secure fit without it being uncomfortable.  This seat is very heavy and would not be ideal if swapping between vehicles. I really do not think there is another seat that could offer any better protection than this one.
5.0	conferrable light wight easy to move around and change sheets best  one i have ever gotten will never get any other kind
5.0	I bought this for my grandson, it is very easy to get him into it, and he is comfortable. I think the cup holder might present more spills than its worth, but you don't have to mount it, so that's not a problem.  What a great price, and it is rated well for safety.
5.0	Totally works and helps a ton! I was able to pump more with the added comfort the Flexshield provided. Would def recommend.
5.0	I bought this product on a whim for my 6 month old.  I didn't think much of it at first, but my daughter loves them.  It's nice to have a teether that is easy to clean (it's dishwasher safe), easy to carry, and it works.
5.0	The Strollometer has been very helpful for getting me back into shape without leaving my 4 month old with a babysitter. I set it up on my Uppa - - very easy and the instructions were excellent. The data I receive on my strolls motivate me to stroll longer and increase my pace.Customer service is excellent, too. I called because I just bought a Schwinn jogger. The rep was extremely helpful and forwarded pictures on how to attach the sensor onto my jogger. I highly recommend it.
5.0	My wife was 5 months pregnant when I surprised her with this pillow. It is rather expensive but the relief my wife found while pregnant made it worth it. She still uses it post partum. Only complaint is it takes up 75%+ of our queen size bed.
5.0	I'm using this since my son was 7 month, now he is 11 month..Good for our small space and easy to carry if need. We carried this to restaurant several times, and he was sitting there nicely. Better than restaurant high chair. But once baby grows, then you have to be very careful because baby can push table using legs and chair can be fallen.  We always keep some space between table and chair.
5.0	Silicone material so they are safe in terms of no transfer of chemicals into food (Unlike plastic, even BPA free and PVC free is not reliable regardles of temperature). Good price and great for taking food to the daycare! It is a little hard to label (permanent marker / labelmaker) so you'll haveto do it everytime after washing.
5.0	These are the only cups we have found that really don't leak.  We wash them daily in the dishwasher and they hold up great.  LOVE THEM!!!!
5.0	this gate is very nice....much better than those ugle plastic gates. it fits well with my decor and is very sturdy
5.0	This came quick and we are very satisfied.  It holds a lot of stuffed animals securely.  Would definitely buy from Kidde Time again.
5.0	Such a cute bunny, I bought it for my 15 month old daughter and she loves it, I say it was a great buy, she carries her bunny everywhere :)
5.0	my husband n I r very pleased with the necklace. it really does seem to help easing our sons teething pains.
5.0	This was purchased as a baby shower gift, and they LOVE it!  Baby isn't here yet so can't rate item in that regard.
5.0	Ottoman showed up a little cracked but still works great
5.0	I place this under my son's high chair and it catches all the messes he makes from feeding himself. Also, its great that it's disposable for the really bad stuff like macaroni and spagetti.
5.0	Just like in the store at 30% off!!!! This was a great find for the price! We installed it the same day and love it! Keeps baby out of trouble!
5.0	this is a great product in order to save your baby's teeth and the crib. I originally bought the front rail cover from babies r us...but could not find the side ones to match...until I found it on Amazon.
5.0	I loved this pump.  It was very easy to maneuver, clean and put back together.  No need to spend lots of money on others, this one works great.
5.0	Super easy to fit over the GoCrib, and has easy velcro access on top. Comes in its own carry bag, but also fits into the backpack. Great addition to the GoCrib.
5.0	All new Mothers need this item.  It is sturdy, looks great.  Very satisfied with it.
5.0	Outstanding stroller that has held up well despite putting it through the ringer. This thing quickly became our main stroller. The full rubber tires are a huge improvement over the plastic wheels on most strollers. My daughter loves this stroller so much she begs to be put in it. And when she falls asleep it is really easy to lower the back to a laying down position.
5.0	The official I want, it can match my breast pump to milk, feeding the children eat, also can be used to store milk.
5.0	Absolutely love this product. The colors are so much more vivid and better in person. It also has some old charm to it with gingham and stripes. I love the combination of vivid bright colors as well as the baby pink, green, & yellow.
5.0	Sturdy and easy to install
5.0	After our son was hospitalized for SIDS evaluations, we were not allowed to bring him home without this monitor. It is wonderful! This monitor is so sensitive, we can hear our other children in the next room playing as well. Well worth the extra money to save your child's life.
5.0	A friend of mine told me about the A+A blankets. I seriously was in doubt because of the cost. However, these are truly the best blankets for baby. They even make a nice play mat if you are out somewhere.
5.0	These look great in our Seuss nursery.  They are not heavy.
5.0	My daughter will NOT sleep with out her elephant and when went to the store to buy a back up and they stopped selllng them. I found it on her and it is wonderful. perfect for and baby.
5.0	Decals were great and look awesome in my daughters room. They were easy to install.
5.0	My husband really is very happy with the pillow -- he wanted something small so it would be easier to deal with as he has Parkinson's, and it's difficult for him to deal with a regular size pillow. This one is also very well made and has just the right amount of loft. Thanks for a great product!
5.0	By far the greatest customer service of any company I have ever bought from online. The company has contacted me multiple time to make sure I was happy with the product and that it attached correctly to my walls. They worked with me to find the perfect solution for my tile which was slightly porous and would not hold with just the suction cup. If you are interested in an organizer, buy this one. You will get a very good size organizer with incredible customer service to make sure it works perfectly for you.
5.0	This is  perfect for holding car cleaning supplies. I keep tire shine, interior shine and towels in here. Doesn't move around at all. Highly recommend
5.0	My son loves Sophie and her squeaker.  He's sleeping with her right in his arms now.  The only caution I would give is that if you have a dog that likes squeakers, this might not be the right choice.
5.0	This was a lifesaver. Some of the reviews made me worry about the size, but it has been great over the pack 'n play napper, over his crib, and over his swing when attached to the back of a dining room chair. It attaches to everything and the contrast on the animals really keeps bubs attention. The songs are also more quiet and much less annoying and repetitive than any of our other singing devices. More classical music than the twinkle twinkle/abc's/baa baa black sheep song. I also like that you can use the arm to hang other things from if you want to get creative!
5.0	Great Vendor! Exactly as Described. I will use again!
5.0	I ordered these items and they arrived over a week early. The order was filled perfectly and the product looks to be very good quality. I can not wait to try them. I would definitely recommend ordering these.
5.0	These are fantastic. They stay where you put them and are super convenient if you are a shopper or out and about in the stroller a lot. I've been surprised how much I've used them. I also have a diaper bag with stroller straps and it has been really convenient for that, too.
5.0	Was a great purchase. My seats in my car are grey so they show everything. My little guy loves to make a mess with his snacks so this has really helped keeping my seat clean. I would highy recommend this product to anyone with a car seat.
5.0	I am not crazy about these type of chairs but our twins seem to love it. We needed something extra portable. They crawl all over them, stand it them, turn upside down in them and they dont budge. Our girls are 14 months. The only thing is the feet supports stick out far and we stump our toes on them often as do our girls. The plastic is good quality as is the fabric. The colors are cheerful. The chairs fold up nicely and remain under the spare bed when not in use. Our girls will go get them when they want them which is often. When we have play dates, most kids plop right down into them so they must be good. Our twins are playing on them now. I think they are eye sores ( I like old fashioned looking stuff  i.e. Wood)but rather that then one of our girls getting a black eye from it tipping over. Not the kind of eye sore I want :).
5.0	We have our second son and my wife asked me to buy them again, why? She has a relief when feeding the new born!  So, buyin the product again is because really works!!!
5.0	Idk why playtex stopped making them but they need to start again.
5.0	Love these bibs. A whole range of colors and you get a lot. You'll need them! Especially when teething is in full swing. I would replace every couple of hours when they soaked through.<br /><br />Still fits nicely on my 17 month old.
5.0	Great car seat, so much better than many other car seats.
5.0	My 3  yr old Grandson loves it,it was his pick for to start pre-school
5.0	This is exactly what I needed for my granddaughter. It is well made and fits her perfectly. It also restrains her properly since she loves to move around and try to get into trouble. I'm glad that I read the reviews and to the person that said to use a towel behind the seat ... THANK YOU ... I noticed that the rear plastic that would be against my leather seats was not really smooth in parts so the towel will save my seats and it doesn't interfere with the tethering of the seat to the car. This is a much lighter weight seat than the car seat it replaced so taking it in and out of my car when it's not needed will be a lot easier.
5.0	We love this bed--it is our second one from this maker. The first lasted through two kids and five years of beatings. We only got rid of it because we did not know we'd have a third. This one is living up to the quality of the first so far.
5.0	As an auto enthusiast, I know Recaro is a well-respected brand with regards to quality and safety, so when it came down to buying a child seat for my baby, I stuck with the brand that I know.<br />I did consider the Britax Marathon, but after doing research (and some biases), I bought two ProRIDEs from Amazon.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Easy to install with anchors<br />-Quality/brand,<br />-Easy to put child in to seat and buckle in,and to take out<br />-Price.<br /><br />Cons:<br />-None that I can think of.<br /><br />MISC:<br />-I had to use a Towel in both my cars to get the seat level<br />-Fits fine in our Lexus RX350 and is very easy to get my kid in and out.<br />-Fits fine in our Toyota Camry Hybrid, but it is a little challenging to get my kid in and out, you will get used to it, and I am able to install the seat behind me (driver's side) and adjust my seat to sit comfortably.
5.0	My grandson loves this. Easy to clean and store.
5.0	Product was delivered quickly, and is every inch as tall as they advertise. Great quality!
5.0	We use this pad as the changing pad in our house downstairs when we don't want to go all the way upstairs to the nursery's changing table.  It is the nicest portable changing pad I've seen b/c it is thick and plush unlike the changing pad that came in my diaper bag which is thin and means my baby's head will lay on a hard surface.  I will probably get another one for the diaper bag to replace that thin one.
5.0	my granddaughter LOVES this toy!!!!! I would highly recommend this toy
5.0	I bought this for my daughter's room and we love it! Quality is excellent and it really brings the room together. Well about 4 months ago our string snapped :( I called Haba up and they sent out a replacement right away. I have to say their customer service was the BEST I've ever dealt with and I highly recommend their products and service to everyone!
5.0	I was a little concerned that my 3 month old would not have the strength to suck her formula up through the &#34;straw&#34; or that she woudl be sucking too much air. Neither is true. I LOVE this product and will be buying another. There shoudl be one in every car and one in the diaper bag for travelling. This is so perfect for when you are driving and your infant is too young to hold the bottle, but not only for travel...I used it while in church too. Held baby on my lap, bottle between her legs, and I still had both my hands free while she was eating.
5.0	Only downfall is stepping on these blocks--they're great. Kid learns abc's, stacks blocks, uses them like Legos. Makes words--the pics are fun too. I remember these from when I was a kid.
5.0	It's a great grandma thing to have on hand
5.0	All the different dangling parts are great. Our baby loves pulling on all of the different sections, and it's nice that even if she is trying to get one part in her mouth and it's too far away, usually a different piece will be close enough to gum.<br /><br />This was too big to hang on our car seat though. It kept hitting our daughter in the head!
5.0	Super cute monthly stickers for your baby boy!  I purchased both the girl and boy stickers because I'm not sure what our next baby will be and I plan to gift the extra set.  I was lucky enough to purchase during a promotional period.  These are great for recording your babies age and milestones.  There is a sticker for every month until a year and then some additional milestone stickers too.  These make for great keepsake photos and they also help me organize all my baby pictures in between the monthly photos.<br /><br />The stickers are circles, not flowers as they appear in the pictures.  There is a white background/outline around the flower.  The stickers are good quality too, not easy for the baby to tear or crumple.<br /><br />The height chart is cute and I love the tree design but it is only 24&#34; so it won't last very long for most babies.  It is cute to at least record birth height though.
5.0	Our 5mo. old boy just loves it.  Thank you, it is great!  Would recommend it to any one with little ones to entertain.
5.0	These work great to help shade my car. I park in the lot of a public transportation station, and the sun comes in the side of my car. I have a shade for the windshield, but that wasn't enough. I use these clings on the side windows that face the sun, and my car is much less hot in the late afternoon. They also help keep the seats cool.
5.0	So, so, so good!  These plates are so sturdy.  Completely microwave and dishwasher safe.  The portion sizes are perfect for a toddler.  Wish there was an option to get plates with no sections too.
5.0	My little guy loves these. Bath time fun 😀
5.0	I bought two of these jars for my son's school lunches. He is in kindergarten and I have recieved no complaints from him about the food being cold at lunch and no spills in his lunch bag. I like the wide mouth and the shape of these as they are perfect for soup and fruit. His small hands have no problem grasping them.
5.0	adorable and good quality
5.0	This high chair is great.  Even if you don't need to save space, it is so convenient.  It beats moving around one of the full size high chairs.  And this one does everything a full size on can do.  It reclines, the tray can go in the dishwasher, and is very sturdy.  It slides right up to our table which is very nice.  When our daughter is older, we can remove the tray and it becomes a booster seat and she can eat at the table with us.  So far, there's nothing we don't like about it and would recommend it highly.
5.0	I have horrible knees and wanted something with a lot of cushion, fairly washable, and not huge... this is perfect.  It folds in half and has a loop to hang for storage, wipes clean easily, and totally saves my knees for tubby time.
5.0	Great bibs! We had stopped using bibs, which left a horrible mess as you can imagine, because our 15 month old would constantly pull at the velcro. She has never gotten one of these bibs off due to the snaps. Great at absorbing liquids too. Highly recommend.
5.0	Perfect night lights, we have them illuminating our hallway and the bathroom.
5.0	This is a must for a bathroom with little space. Easy clean up!!  My son goes on it and he is 2 1/2 years old.
5.0	great gift for my visiting toddler grandson. He loved them!
5.0	Yes, sometimes if you do not fit it snugly on the diaper, there are false alarms.<br /><br />Yes, using with cloth diapers can be difficult for this reason.<br /><br />HOWEVER...<br /><br />If it false alarms at me attaching it incorrectly, it gives me greater peace of mind knowing that it will most assuredly alarm if something is actually wrong as well.  This is a very sensitive little gizmo and my wife and I would be a wreck without it after a scare at the hospital in which our little girl stopped breathing and we would not have known about it if we had not been standing right over her at the time (we should have been sleeping.)<br /><br />I would HIGHLY recommend this to any new parents.
5.0	This was Wabbanubb number two the first one was eaten by the dog. My son does not leave the house without it. Love this product!
5.0	I love this item! I was looking for a simple solution for my almost 2 year old because she wasnt wanting to sit in her high chair anymore and kept wanting to sit at the big table with my husband and I. This enabled us to simply lift the chair and allowing her to sit normally at the table rather than deal with a booster. She loves it and is always wanting to sit in it to eat! Its very sturdy and I havent had any problems with it. I love how it adjust for as she gets taller, I simply flip it out and it shortens it a little.   I was a little disappointed because I thought a carrying bag was coming with it from the pictures but no big deal ,I didnt read the info very thoroughly!   Its great though!
5.0	Wonderful. Highly recommend. We are on our second one. First one lasted 6 yr.
5.0	These spoons are very good with little hands.  My kids don't like the forks as they don't like the shape edges.  We only use the spoons.
5.0	Bought this for our little one and we love it! Good size play mat with plenty of padding. Comes with 3 removable toys and 2 attached sensory toys. Our cat even loves it!
5.0	it was a gift for the Childrens day . it was so loveliness, i believe that childrens will like it.
5.0	Great product!  Easy to use and it's very practical
5.0	I have read a lot of these reviews that say they got a fake, or their baby has choked on this. I can see where a baby can easily gag on this toy but for me that is not much of a concern. I don't generally give my daughter toys to chew on when she's on her belly and she gags on her own fingers/hands more than anything. As far as this being a counterfeit product....the Sophie I received was the real deal. My 4 month old daughter is just working on being able to chew on this herself but seems to love it!
5.0	This is a great cup that never leaks. You have to be careful that the straw doesn't move out of place as you tighten it though because that will cause a leak. but when used properly it's perfect.
5.0	after trying the reflo cup and was thoroughly disappointed, i did extensive research and discovered this cup. it's a very durable plastic and my son does well with it. The lip is a little thick, but i also like that, because my son also like to bite the lip of his cups. this has worked really well for us so far. would recommend to others for purchase.
5.0	These are so handy!! A definite must have for bottles these days. There are so many little intricate pieces  to bottles and baby feeding products and these little cleaning brushes get all the little crevices you did not even think you would need to clean.<br /><br />Recommend these to everyone they work great and are very affordable!
5.0	Cute ! I Use them to decorate my son bedroom .It's very easy to use and he like it vey much .thank you
5.0	Baby gear must have!  Keeps sun out of the baby's faec but more importantly, keeps dirty fingers and hands out of the carseat.  Seriously, strangers will totally pet your baby.  It's flu season, people!
5.0	To all the parents that are looking for a gym set to keep their baby busy...this is the one. This gym set is not only fun but educational too. My daughter received this when she was two months and loves it. She enjoys who she sees when she looks in the mirror and the crinkling noise that the parrot makes. When I pull the elephant she starts kicking her legs and batting at it.........it's a beautiful sight to see. The music also soothes her,what else could I say besides I am very happy with this product.
5.0	I love these. They fit my 13lb baby very well. I have a lot of other types of diaper, and prefolds are all I would ever use for a newborn again.
5.0	At just a few weeks old, I found that my son loves to rub his face up close to the edge of the crib and the bumper that came with my crib set was dangerous in my opinion because I was afraid that he would suffocate.  I bought this breathable bumper from Amazon and we have loved it since!  It gives me peace of mind knowing that even if he gets up against the crib, he will still be able to breathe.  He's now 8 months old and moves all around in the crib and this bumper now helps to prevent his arms/legs from getting stuck in between the crib rails.  This crib bumper is a must have for all parents!  I HIGHLY recommend it!
5.0	These booties are the most adorable baby shoes I've seen. They don't come off like all the socks we own and I appreciate that they are made of organic materials. The velcro is strong, you can buckle it tight or loose and it's easy to put it on.<br />I got the small/medium and it's too long on the newborn (as expected) but looks very cool, almost like high-top sneakers. I'll definitely get one in the larger size (15-20lbs) when my son gets older.
5.0	I am breastfeeding and we only use a bottle occasionally - so it was important that the bottle be a similar experience for our son.  He took to this bottle immediately (unlike several other brands) and it has never leaked.  We love it and recommend it to everyone looking for a great BPA free bottle!
5.0	These have a baby powder scent to them and work fantastic in holding #2 diapers! They are a great deal for 200 count (you can compare them to others that come in a roll and these are by far much, much better). I would only use these when baby had a soiled diaper, but am now learning that they can hold 4-5 diapers at once, so I dispose of #1 diapers in these as well then tie up the sack and throw it in the garbage. I can really tell a difference with the way the bathroom smells now! For getting so much use out of each one, I think the price is unbeatable. I keep a stash of these in the diaper bag as well for use on the go :) So glad I found these on Amazon! I would definitely recommend them.
5.0	The color is great, it's very sturdy, and very roomy. It's much bigger than your typical pack and plays but it's perfect for laying down activity mats. It is very easy to assemble and put back in its storage bag but its probably not the best option for carting around outside of the house. I love it because our daughter will be able to play on her large activity mat or nap on it without the cat trying to take it over. It's perfect for our needs.
5.0	My 4 year old still sleeps with his froggy lovey every night and has since he was a baby.  We absolutely love him and will be buying another for his little brother.
5.0	Great blanket.  I bought this based on the positive reviews and was not disappointed.<br /><br />Our blanket didn't smell odd or anything (one reviewer at least noted that).  We used it right away and loved it.<br /><br />The pocket is pretty handy.  I often carry this several blocks, it is pretty convenient to sling over the shoulder with the strap.  Given how durable and waterproof it is, I think it is a reasonable weight.<br /><br />We are a family of 3 and this is more than big enough for us.
5.0	I NEVER would have selected this for my son because compared to other toys (Exersaucers and jumpers) this didn't look too exciting to me.  However, we took my 3.5month son to the store to test drive and he LOVED this car.  His grandma ordered him the blue one from Amazon and had it shipped.  Our son has reflux issues and has to be upright for at least 30 minutes after feedings, so this little car has been a lifesaver!  Most of the other toys required baby to be able to sit up on their own or else they would be slouched/hunched over.  The higher back on this makes it easier for a younger baby.  Also, the wheels turn 360 degrees which means he can gain leg control and experiment without getting frustrated by the purely forward and back walkers.  I like that the front pops off to be a tray for snacking later!
5.0	Shipped quick and easy. I love this bib! It is very cute and looks exactly like it does in the picture.
5.0	Just adorable!  My son loves to watch these cute monsters and listen to the music.  I highly recommend the monster theme!
5.0	I loved these :)  So cute, easy to use and look great in the pictures.  I'm keeping them to see if they are re-usable, but we'll see
5.0	Gave this as a baby shower gift to a mom-to-be in my French Class.  It was a cute, affordable gift that she loved.
5.0	My baby had to go through more than a couple of different bottles brands and all of them fit onto this drying rack easily.  Even when I used bottle systems that had a multitude of pieces, this rack was able to keep them all organized!  Wonderful product!
5.0	We haven't had a single problem with the monitor or receivers.  We've been using them for 11 months and they been great.
5.0	Seat feels comfortable over other cheaper versions we have had in the past, parts work correctly, solid build. Now I see why Britax is a popular brand. For seat belt usage there are nice locks under cushion to hold it even more steady. Really like the click function to ensure you have proper tightening on the harness and not crushing the kid :-)
5.0	I bought this to go with the baby book that matches. It's super cute, and I can't wait to fill it up with memories!
5.0	My son has been sleeping with one of these from day 1 and he is obsessed. I bought a second one just so we could switch them out during washes and he doesn't seem to even notice. It's the perfect little lovey, perfect size, and we never go anywhere without it.
5.0	we'd gotten one as a gift and wound up buying a second to rotate out and save ourselves from the day when she lost it...  our daughter absolutely loves hers.  perfect for stroller rides, car trips, and nights away from home on vacation when she wants something familiar. machine washable.  they stay soft and continue to look clean.
5.0	Nice product for by baby's confort. Works great for any baby gender. The neutral colors make baby's room warm and attractive.
5.0	very well-made. I have used this for the last three years on my daughter<br />for all her birthdays.She is now 3 years old.
5.0	What mother could not say this is a must and it is just great
5.0	I have been looking for a new carseat.  Did you know that they expire?  Yes they do.  Mine was set to expire about the time my baby will be born.  I will honestly say we thought about just ignoring the date on it, and using it anyway.  But when it comes down to it, my baby's safety is really a LOT more important than saving money and not buying a new seat.<br /><br />I was excited when Graco asked me to do a review on their Car Seat I was ecstatic.  I was given the Graco SnugRide Click Connect 35 - Lyric.  My biggest thing is safety for my child.  The Snug Ride really has a lot of testing done on it.  It meets or exceeds the US Safety Standards.  It has also been side impacted tested.  That is a huge thing nowadays.  I have been involved in accidents and I want the best for my kids.  The base stays in the car, and has the LATCH on it.  It has a dial in the front so it can be easily adjusted to make sure it is level in the car.<br /><br />Another thing I want for me is to be light weight.  Let's face it, as parents we have to lug around the carseat AND the child.  So if the carseat is already heavy, it's a lot heavier when you add your baby into it.  This is the lightest carseat on the market.  So that means that you can keep your baby in it longer before it gets too heavy for you.  I know with my other kids I pulled them out of the infant seat because it was so heavy to lug around.<br /><br />Another great feature is that it works with the Graco strollers as well.  With the click connect system, it is easy to pop the carseat into and out of the strollers with Click connect as well.  It becomes a one step easy installation.<br /><br />The carseat does have the extra infant headrest with it.  This will help when my baby is still so small.  Where I live another thing I worry about is the weather.  It is cold in Michigan.  And being due in January, we will have snow.  So I will have several months of taking my son in and out in the snow and cold.  Graco does come with aremoveable all weather boot.  This I am most excited about.  Since you don't want to put your child in all of those snowsuits this will help ensure that I don't lose his blankets and he stays warm.<br /><br />I know you just read that and thought, WHAT?????  Not in a snow suit?  But that is correct.  Did you know that when you start adding snowsuits and coats to not only your baby, but your children in a carseat as well, it makes the straps too far from their chest to protect them properly.  Since safety is the number one goal, it really is easier to just toss on some extra blankets before going out to the car.  I do plan on warming the car up before heading out with the baby.<br /><br /> I did receive a carseat in exchange for my thoughts.  i do love the seat
5.0	Rockaroo was so loved, had to buy this as well
5.0	Perfect for making swaddling to sleep sack transition. We used this for 3 weeks and made the transition go very smoothly!
5.0	when we first brought our daughter home from the hospital, this wrap was actually too big, but once she fit into it it was awesome! she's 7 months old now and, though it's getting too small, we modified it so that it will still work because i haven't been able to find a large size that is thin enough for her to wear in the summer.     i would recommend this to any parent...especially if you value your sleep!
5.0	My son loves the Lena Lamb!  We've got 7 now.
5.0	This is the only bottle my son liked-- tried Avent and the First Years with slow flow nipple.  The avent leaks and my son HATED the slow flow nipple. I use these bottles with the brown nipple and it's all he nurses from when not at the breast.  Plus these are great because you just drop in the liner and throw away when done.  Easy to travel with and easy to clean.  Couldn't be more low maintenance than this!  Highly recommended.
5.0	Excellent value; very adjustable.  Fits perfectly on our Britax Blink stroller.  However, don't overfill it with heavy drink bottles, or your stroller will tip over backwards as soon as you remove your child!
5.0	Love the simple design. Sturdy with 2 baby bottle in one pocket and 24 oz contigo in the other. We pack 2 phones, a garage openers and keys in the zipper pocket.... Come on BOB you should include it in the purchase of any BOB stroller out there.
5.0	I can not tell you how much I love this car seat.  I have gone through four in my dear sons first two years. I have hated them all, except for this one!  I have stayed true to Cosco, but have been let down too many times.  I have had three eddie bauer car seats, they all have been terrible.  I was tired of the straps twisting.  I read reviews about this car seat and decided why not, give it a try, after a few months, I still love it.  The straps do not twist!!!  It is very easy to adjust.  I love the drink cup, my son, can easily reach it without a problem.  I also love the added pillow support, it works wonders for those long car rides when he falls alseep, actually keeps his head back, so I don't have to keep pushing it back!! I would not say a darn thing bad about this car seat, it is wonderful.
5.0	These kick mats are great. Secures nicely to chairs in our Durango and doing a good job protecting the back of chair. I love the email communication I've received directly from ZenKid. Makes me even more happy that I ordered this item.
5.0	This seat is the best. Great quality, safety record and can last from birth until they don't need a seat anymore
5.0	My Grandniece loved it !!! She was over the moon. It was delivered just in time for her First Communion,
5.0	Love this bag!!  It has worked great for travel and protecting our Clek car seat.
5.0	I use Medela Pump In Style - these valves cost less than getting from Medela, and they fit perfectly on Pump In Style. There were no problems during the pump. Worked really well.
5.0	Becoming a grandparent has opened up a wide variety of products that are built quite differently than when I had kids.  This stroller has nearly everything that you might want:  place to put stuff underneath, easy to move bonnet to keep the sun out, super easy adjustable seatback, and a piece of cake to push - especially with front wheels that lock into a straight ahead position for gravel, grass, etc.  It is not an umbrella stroller, but it light enough to match up against that type.<br /><br />Cons:  It does fold, but not as totally or easily as I'd like.<br /><br />This is a middle of price range stroller; I like this product very much and would highly recommend it.<br /><br />UPDATE:  After nearly one year of use, this is still a solid product and works as nicely now as it did at the beginning.  The wheels have held up an and so have all of the material.
5.0	Used a boppy for my first 2 children but I didn't like the way it fit around me or the way baby sits on the pillow. With this pillow, the larger side is more elevated then the small side so baby lays at a nice angle for feeding without having to prop the head at all. Fits nicely around my body. I have been using this for 2 weeks so far and I really love it .
5.0	My husband and I recently flew to Florida with our 3 year old daughter.  The CARES airplane harness was a lifesaver and saved us from toting a carseat through the airport.  We were able to carry the harness, which folded up neatly, in our carry-on bag and it was very easy to install.  I would recommend this harness to anyone traveling with small children!
5.0	We bought this as a &#34;spare&#34; for the one that our daughter's feeding therapist gave us. This is a great tool to help little ones who aren't great at drinking (at all or from a straw) because you can &#34;help&#34; the liquid up the straw by squeezing the bear. My daughter (who had a pretty severe feeding aversion) also loved playing with the bear, which really helped make the idea of drinking more &#34;fun.&#34; It's pricey if you don't have a problem eater/drinker but a great option if you do!
5.0	Great product! I get stopped and asked about this all time! It's compact and easy to keep in the car or throw in the bottom basket of the stroller! We use it at restaurants as a booster or high chair and at the beach!
5.0	My daughter loves these!! She says YUM, every time I wipe her face! I tasted one- pretty good! :)
5.0	I have a crib similar to the one in the picture with a front and back at different heighths. The crib tent still fit it just right. It keeps my cats out and the baby in. It was kind of disapointing because we couldn't use the mobile that we have because it attached to the side of the crib. The tent itself, however is strong enough that we made a new mobile and hung it from the middle of the tent on the inside. Overall we are very happy with this product.
5.0	Great value and made with good materials. This stroller is ideal for anyone looking for an affordable option without sacrificing essential performance for brisk jaunts in the park with baby on paved--or gravel--pathways. The stroller is a bit on the tall side, but as a tall person I love the fact that the handlebar is high and the wheel axel is designed such that your foot doesn't trip on it when you're moving fast. Many strollers have a straight-axel and this is problematic for anyone with a long stride. The design is simple (i.e., not a lot of bells and whistles) and maybe the lack of an adjustable handlebar height is a disadvantage, but you can't beat the quality of this product for under $200. We've been using it with a GRACO infant car seat and have been very happy with the purchase. Other jogging strollers I looked at in this price range may have had more options, but the quality of construction did not match this GRACO model.
5.0	Matches my baby's owl theme room!  Love the colors.  Very girlie and sweet!  Good condition.  And the size is perfect.
5.0	Lots of pockets and room,  very helpful when in a hurry or dealing with chaos having twins!  So glad I found this bag!
5.0	We received these about a week ago and they are great! My almost 2 year old just can't keep his little hands out of the kitchen drawers and always the knife drawer. I just opened the package and stuck these on, no drilling, no mess. He absolutely cannot open the drawers now. My only thing is that there is only 1 magnet.  I have other magnets and they do work as well so it isn't a big deal. Time will be the test with these as they are just adhesive but they seem strong. You can keep them unlocked which is a plus when I am in the kitchen cooking and getting in drawers.
5.0	These are my daughter's favorite pacifiers! They calm her right down when she gets sleepy and I like the patterns on them.
5.0	First and foremost it is washable. Very important when grubby little fingers grab, toss, suck, drool on and hug it. The loop that holds the dummy,pacifier is under the Koala's nose. It has two pop buttons that click together to old the dummy. It is super lightweight, which means it won't lay heavily on the babies face.It is also super snuggly soft, which means it won't leave any scratches.<br />Karrie the Koala is very cute, much like the other animal dummy holders.<br />Karrie comes with a dummy that has a flat end. You can attach any dummy of your choice.<br />If you happen to have a wee dummy tosser in your care then this also makes it easier to find said dummy. It is recommended for ages 0 to 3 months.<br />This would make a lovely gift for both boys and girls.<br />I received a fee copy of this product courtesy of the company Uggogg & Inny, for the purposes of review.
5.0	"Tired of being gnawed upon and constantly cleaning dropped teething rings while wearing my little one in the Moby wrap, I began looking into teething jewelry. Lots of the silicone baby-safe jewelry stated things in the review like \\""picks up lint\\"" (gross!) or tangles in hair (ouch!). I kept looking and found this wooden key necklace. I figured if my little teether didn't like it, we could use it as a pretend play house key.  The first time I wrote this, my daughter happily chewed away on it for a good 20 minutes while I did some housework. She really enjoys it. It is easy for her to hold and easy to wear. The cotton string is long enough that I don't feel choked if she pulls on it. My only suggestion for improvement would be some sort of breakaway clasp on the necklace so the string could be removed temporarily so baby could use the teether when not in the baby carrier without concern of getting tangled up in the string. Great little product!"
5.0	I bought this for my sister since all of the bassinets that I looked at had such poor reviews.  This porta crib is excellent.  My sister keeps my nephew in the bedroom with her and her husband and easily rolls it into the living room when she is cooking and cleaning.  I highly recommend this crib!
5.0	I purchased this for my grandson as he spends a lot of time at my office.<br /><br />The seat straps to almost any chair securely and is the perfect combination for feeding and playing.<br /><br />The Jungle top attachment has provided hours of fun as well as helped with hand-eye coordination and fine motorskills.<br /><br />Folds easily for portability.
5.0	We switched to this tub when our daughter was four months old and wish we would have done it sooner.  She stays in position and is very comfortable and kicks and plays while getting her bath.  There is a lot of room so we should get plenty of use out of this tub.  BUY this tub and you will be glad you did.
5.0	We gave it as a gift and the people who got it say they could not live without it. Their baby isn't even a month old yet!
5.0	I had an 18 month old and another baby on the way. I researched pretty much all of the double strollers out there. I wanted a double stroller that was side by side and was easy to use an infant seat with. I didn't want to buy extra parts for the stroller. I found that with all the other strollers out there you had to buy all accessories. Once you bought all the accessories, the strollers cost about the same as this stroller.     Once my new bundle arrived, I found this stroller to be perfect! I have a Graco infant seat carrier and it fit perfectly into the stroller and was easy to click in and remove. I have had the stroller for a year now and I am still in love with it! Both my nine month old and two and a half year old love this stroller! The canopies are fabulous! It is great that they each have their own. I also love how each seat can be reclined on it's own as well. We went to Disney last month. It was so convenient to have my little one sleeping laid out like a bed and my oldest one sitting upright. I loved that it came with rain gear, and you didn't have to buy one. Very convenient for city and Disney trips. The five point harness is fabulous. I use the five point with the baby and was able to remove the shoulder straps for my older child, which is great because he hates to be restrained at his age. The storage underneath is HUGE compared to every other double stroller I reviewed, and easy to access. I was able to fit my enormous diaper bag underneath. This stroller is amazing to steer and glides like butter on those great air filled tires. No bumps in the road for my little babies! The handle bar adjusts very easily. It collapses and unfolds in seconds. I found it easy to travel with. It comes with a lock when folded up, great for the plane. The front wheels can swivel or lock for jogging.It also comes with a jogging strap. This stroller comes with so much! The only thing I did purchase for it is a snack tray. It is removable and well worth the money. It's great to have the option of a bumper bar or a snack tray. I found that I only needed one tray.    I got the seagrass color. Every time I leave the house, I get stopped by strangers complimenting the stroller. The only downside to this stroller is it is a little bulky when folded. I found this to be true with MANY other double strollers as well. I have a large car so it doesn't bother me. It's not too heavy, I get it in and out of my car easily. I am in love with this stroller still a year after I purchased it. I am so glad I went with this stroller! It is worth every penny!!!!! I hope you enjoy this stroller as much as I do.
5.0	Seems like it is true to size, a little slim fit and sleeves seem a little short, but looks good on.
5.0	Came on time and was exactly as expected.
5.0	Bought for Christmas but think they will be very helpful with children
5.0	I have several other Guardian products on regular doors and while I bought this for a house I'm closing on this mouth, I can already tell it's going to give me a feeling of safety and security!  Love Guardian products - they provide more security for the buck than almost anything else I've found and believe me I've looked!!!
5.0	got this for my grandson and his mother is very happy and pleased with the crib, breaks down easily and has a carry bag for travel.  I purchased this brand cause we had use Graco product with my children and was very pleased with the quality.  She did mention the little portable changer that comes with the crib and adjustable height of the floor was very nice.  The price was right as well.
5.0	It had some bad reviews, so I really wasn't sure about buying it, but I am so happy i decided to get it - it is SO beautiful and different from all the other kids ceiling fans, works perfectly and makes a fare amount of wind to her pretty large bedroom.
5.0	I bought this in green when my son was 20 month old along with 2 small old fashion babybjorn potty chairs(I see that they don't make the old fashion ones anymore).He really liked it(same with the other ones) and was potty trained in 4 days.We had the big one at home,and the small ones either in the cars ,or strollers.My son knew how to keep his pee-pee inside the bowl,so no problems with the pee going in the wrong direction,plus my son was on the skinny side.We didn't use it for long because my son preferred the big toilet.At age 2 he was going by himself on it,without a toilet trainer.Now,I'm using them for my 19 month old daughter,which is not very crazy about them.Even though she is very small (barely 17 lb),she prefers the big toilet.During the day she is 100% potty trained (she is the one saying when she needs to go,we don't ask her).When nobody is around to lift her and put her on the toilet,she will go to the green potty.
5.0	So we had a larger double stroller, that was back to back, or just behind each other.  Its very bulky and was kind of a pain in the butt.  Now this stroller is AMAZING!  it was exactly what we needed. sturdy and folds up really well.  very impressed
5.0	I bought this while i was still pregnant. My baby is now almost 6 months old & really likes it. Fun tags, cute stuffy, & its a blanket! Shes really getting into peek a boo, this is perfect!
5.0	I too, read the mixed/bad reviews on the older version of this adapter. So i was hesitant to even try these. It took more time to get it out of the plastic than it did to assemble them together. I did not even need to read the directions as its pretty self explanatory. I did look them over after to make sure it was really that simple!<br /><br />  I have a brand new Keyfit 30 and an old Keyfit 22 and BOTH snapped in as it was supposed to. Sometimes it would not snap but it was due to how i placed them onto the adapter. I would suggest just moving it around a bit to get it to snap if you don't get it right the first time.<br /><br />  I am extremely pleased with how these work with my City Select. I have twins and two carseats with two adapters with the City Select works well.
5.0	Nice comfortable set.  Durable, nice colors.  My son absolutely loves this comforter set!
5.0	Best spoons.Hands down. Worth every penny..
5.0	Not sure why there are so many complaints about this cup!  I purchased this for my son a couple of YEARS ago, and have had no trouble. It was slightly difficult to assemble the first time, but once I put it together a couple of times it was simple. The straw works and has always worked fine, and while I originally cleaned it by allowing hot water to run through, I soon discovered there are small cleaning brushes designed for sippy cups and they work wonders! (See the product insert I've included.) I use those brushes for all of my kids cups, but especially these straws. We have never had a leak, and it is my sons' go to cup. The only trouble now is that the picture on the outer layer has worn off, and I'm having trouble finding a replacement. I don't know why this three pack is listed for $60, that is too much. Otherwise, this product is great![[ASIN:B00386KEEK Sippy Straw Cleaner]]
5.0	I only use this lovey for bedtime with my baby. He holds it while he goes to sleep and I don't worry about him covering his face with it. He loves rubbing the silky edges too.
5.0	I was using one of the wooden gates. I keep three of my daschunds in a little room when I leave. I kept coming home to find my little girl out. One day I closed the door and watched her climb the wooden gate. That little sneak. This gate did the trick. It is coated metal and she could not climb it. Solved my problem. Kids...Gotta love um.
5.0	I have the mother-ease diaper system.  I love it, you have to change the diapers ofetn, but it's so easy to do and I just throw it all in the wash!
5.0	My nephew loves this thing. He jumps in it like crazy and the toys are removable. There was one in particular that he was afraid of, but he has learned to love it and was easily replaced.
5.0	We love this!  We actually use it as a back up in the car, especially when my husband takes our 2 year old out alone so that he does not have to drag her into a male restroom.  We have also switched to using old grocery bags with napkins inside - it works just the same (so long as the bags have no holes) because when she first started potty training we were going through the other bags too quickly and couldn't order them fast enough (and I haven't found them in any stores yet). It really helped us to be able to pull over to a parking lot and let her go as soon as she felt the need.  I was alittle timid about it at first but we never had any probelms with the potty not locking into place and it's the perfect size for her - she actually loves it.
5.0	Awesome stroller for my 3 year old.  Folds easily and clips/unclips quickly for smooth loading/unloading.  Love this stroller!
5.0	This cover looks nice and seems to be durable and it is soft to the touch. I would recommend it to anyone.
5.0	I purchased this for my husband for Father's day.  The kit was easy to use and the blue/pink color was perfect for my husband/daughter.  I like how there was more than one sheet included in case of a mistake.
5.0	The adapter fits the graco car seat perfectly. Very satisfied with this product. Should have brought earlier when the baby was born. Great product.
5.0	Works great for my grandson
5.0	Okay, so I enjoyed the movie, and now I have the Beatles on a magnet just as they appeared in it. Every time I look at the magnet I hear the title song. The magnet is strong enough to support notes, photos, artwork, or whatever, but I just wanted it on my refrigerator's freezer door to look at. It is large enough to be easily seen, and the colors sure are bright and vivid. A very good purchase for myself, but it would also make a neat gift.
5.0	We started using these bottles with my second son after being frustrated with another brand.  The pieces are intimidating at first, but we have definitely seen an improvement in his spitting up.  The bottles themselves are taller than what we used before, but they still fit in the bottle compartment of the diaper bag.  If you don't mind cleaning extra parts, then you should consider using these bottles.
5.0	Just started using this for our 10 month old son, but he seems to like it. The material is really soft. It is pretty big, but that is just the way carseats are. We have a small SUV and it doesn't take up too much room. It goes up pretty high so I can't peak to see him which is too bad.
5.0	We were given these for my daughter at about 4 weeks old.  She's now 10 weeks and really beginning to take an interest in toys and things around her.  These are great toys in themselves; infinite colour combinations, and a rattle all in one.  There are enough of them that we hang them from her play gym, car seat, swing seat, and always have a few to hand beside our sofa and in her changing bag.  They are also great for hanging other small rattles and toys for her to look at and grab for.  We love them.
5.0	Keeps baby entertained, affordable, fast shipping and durable. Would like the back to be a little higher but baby will grow into it.
5.0	My daughter will love these!
5.0	The straps worked just like they are suppose to. My TV doesn't even wobble when someone runs across the floor.
5.0	My brother often complained about riding on airlines because the seat belts never fit him comfortably. As he often goes on the plane to visit his family out of state I found this for him and I've been drowned out in thanks from him. With a nice and easy attachment to the seat belt of the plane he stuck the extender on there and had a perfect fit to his stomach. Before it would be really tight (as he is slightly overweight) and ended up causing him pain for the entire flight. Now he doesn't have to deal with the nightmare of having endless pain on flights with this seat belt extender.
5.0	So freaking adorable!!
5.0	"This is ONE of only TWO really full sized play yards I found.  The other was extremely expensive -- this one was extremely reasonable!  The colorful features on each side of the play yard are great \\""discovery\\"" type toys for a baby/toddler.  I bought this for my grandson; my daughter is very, very happy with it."
5.0	This is the second bundle me lite that I have bought.  The first one was pink and I just had a little boy so I needed a blue one:)  I like the lite bundle me because I could use it for fall, winter, and spring.  It is so easy to just pull it over their head if it rains or is really cold outside.  The inside is very soft and it washes well too.  In the dead of winter I just added a blanket underneath.  I also bought one for my friend that just had a baby.  I would highly recommend this to anyone.
5.0	Beautiful color, fits perfectly, and is super soft. Great product
5.0	My granddaughter has now had this since she was 2 months old, she's 10 months now, and she still plays with it, flips through it, and chews on the cow handle.  She's been teething lately.  I have piece of mind knowing the parts are not going to fall off or choke her.
5.0	Really nice design, fit the changing pad perfect (i have the bigger one from safety 1st). Same shape after washing few times for now. Overall good product.
5.0	These are cute diapers and great for reusable ones.
5.0	My grandfather made me a cradle when I was a child and over the years it has been repainted and decaled several times. I did it for my daughter and then my granddaughters and now my grandson. The surface is very rough but the dino wall stickers are sticking great. The remainder of the stickers are going on his bedroom wall. I would recommend wall decals to anyone. I also purchased the crib bedding set and they match perfectly.
5.0	This bottle warmer serves its purpose just as well as the other more expensive warmers with bells and whistles.  My baby sleeps through the night, so there was no need to have an insulated unit to keep bottles cooled overnight.  Besides, I just pull bottles out of the refrigerator.  The temperature doesn't come out exactly the same each time, but it does take the chill off the milk enough to satisfy my baby.  It works great with all sizes of bottles, including Avent 9 oz bottles.  Furthermore, this unit is smaller than other bottle warmers, therefore it doesn't take up too much countertop space.  Great product!
5.0	I just purchased this stroller, and my husband and I both love it.  I also own a Pliko P3, but had a few things I didnt like about it.  Well I was worried I would be missing out on some of its features in switching to this one such as the very large hood, but it has that as well as the adjusting legrest (great for little babes). This stroller is sleek, compact and everything I expect from a Graco.  You will not be disappointed. I will be back with more after more use (just got it today). :)
5.0	I can't believe how easy it is to put a diaper on with these. The pins always stressed me out because I felt like I would poke the baby. Not so with these.
5.0	These are perfect decor for any toddlers room! My son's room is all trucks and cars. Definitely all boy! These are classy and affordable. They look like expensive pieces of decor. The frames are wood and they have plastic over them. Instead of glass which makes me feel more comfortable having them on my toddlers walls. I absolutely love these! I will definitely be buying more! I hope they come out with other patterns soon! Disclosure: I received this product for free in exchange for my honest review. As always all opinions are 100% my own.
5.0	These do the job and are not easily removed from outlet plugs. Of course it doesn't replace monitoring your baby, but when my 7-month old crawls over to the outlets, I don't have to panic - even for me,  it takes several seconds and some force to get these out.
5.0	Loved it!<br />Super soft and lovely color.
5.0	Love the ridges on the inside of the bucket, it helps the water poor where you want it to. Perfect size too.
5.0	My first purchase of this booster seat was for my daughter when she was 2. We've love how easy it is to use & move. Yes, it does shift if your child is a &#34;wiggler&#34;, but that has not been a problem for us. She is now 4 and still uses it, so we just purchased another for my son who is just turned 2. He loves feeling like a big boy at the dining table. It is so easy to clean as well.
5.0	nothing works except for this bottle. It was the easiest way to get my baby off the bottle and onto the sippy cup.
5.0	No kids at home anymore but two small dogs.  We live in a patio home so putting in a doggie poop recepticle in the backyard was out because there is no backyard as the garage door opens directly onto the driveway.  So we decided to try the Diaper Genie and the price was right (no pun intended).  So rather than stinking up the garage (where we keep the garbage can that holds all the little poop gift bags) we eliminated the odor which can be pretty tough in the Texas heat,  Once a week we empty the contents and our garage is no longer filled with the ominous bouquets.  Great engineering feat.  Designed on the KISS principle - wish I had thought of it.
5.0	These bloomers were the cutest  I have ever seen.  Ordered for a baby gift and they loved them. Good quality and very unique gift idea.
5.0	"The Halo SleepSack 100% Cotton SleepSack® Wearable Blanket is adorable and functional... not to mention safe!  I received one to review and I love it!  My little guy has to be one of the world's worst about kicking the blankets off, getting cold, and then waking up.  He has also now reached the age where he grabs everything with his hands and pulls it immediately toward his face.  With the Halo SleepSack 100% Cotton SleepSack® Wearable Blanket I don't have to worry that he will pull the blanket up by his face during the night while I am sleeping and being at risk for suffocation.  With the zip on design, he can't kick it off of him so I don't have to worry about him constantly kicking off the blankets and getting cold and then waking up!!  Each one has special \\""Back Is Best\\"" embroidery to remind parents and caregivers that little ones should all sleep on their backs to help reduce the risk of SIDS! They have several new designs that are absolutely gorgeous!  They are all 100% cotton. They offer selections for boys, girls, and neutral colors!  Halo has thought of everything to help keep your baby warm and safe throughout the night.  I definitely give this product and Halo itself two thumbs up!"
5.0	product of great quality, very roomy, with plenty of compartments, great for day to day and also for trips ..
5.0	"This purchase was a gift for a neighbor's daughter. Upon opening the package, she is reported to have said, \\""Why do I need this?\\"" For that reason alone, this was the perfect gift."
5.0	IF YOU DO NOT NEED THE SIDE WINGS FOR NAPPING CHILDREN, THIS IS THE BEST BOOSTER CHAIR.
5.0	THIS IS THE BEST THING I HAVE  IN THE CRIB OR THE BASSINET OTHER THE MY BABY. I KEEPS HER FROM ROLLING OVER AND ITS REALL GREAT. SO I CAN LAY HER ON HER BACK OR SIDE AND NOT WORRY THAT SHE WILL ROLL OVER AND NOT GET HURT IN SLEEP. I REALLY SWEAR BY THIS AND THE VENTS WORK THEY KEEP MORE HEAT OUT SO ITS A NICE STEADY TEMP IN THERE.
5.0	I have not using this product because my baby is too young I worry about hurting him, but the price is good, I will use it later.
5.0	I love, love, love this stroller! I have had it for about two months and so far have no complaints. I planned to use this as my run around and outing stroller which I do, but I also use it every morning for my walking stroller and it's great. Good price, nice big canopy, lots of underneath storage space, fits through every door, sturdy, looks nice, etc etc. Makes life with my twins easier and anything that does that has my vote!
5.0	Perfect for my Grand daughter she loved it.
5.0	I just received this item, so I am unsure of durability. I have used this item to encourage sitting with both myself and/or the infant pushing to make floating toys move. It is colorful and holds attention, so it can be used for nonpreferred activities such as tummy time/on all fours to distract a kiddo.
5.0	The cot is good quality and perfect for a child to sleep on. Easy to fold up and put back in it's nylon case.
5.0	I learned my lesson with my first kid so I was looking for a high chair with 5 point harness.  I looked at Graco ones but found the foot rest is at a very strange angle (honestly, I don't know how you can put your foot on it).  and some of the reviews concern me.  After reading the review of this chair, I decided to give it a try.  It turns out to be great!    I bought the chair for my 6-month old but my 4-year-old loves it so much that he is also sitting in it (without tray).  Now I wish I bought 2 at that time (the price already went up since I bought it)    The only thing is that it is a little bit hard to assemble by one person.  You will need two people.
5.0	I love these bottles! Perfect size, not a whole lot of parts everywhere, easy to clean and the best part is that they convert into sippy cup and more. Loveee them!!!!!!!
5.0	Well made.  Excellent versatility. The neoprene handle cover will be excellent in cold weather.   Ample storage under carriage. Worth the money!
5.0	This is a must have for moms with small children.  I wish I had known about it with my first one.<br /><br />The thought of sucking out snot really was a gross idea for me at first.  My husband convinced me to give this a shot because when your asthmatic son is struggling to breath and crying that it hurts mom instincts kick in and you put aside things like gross.  Those nose bulbs they give you at the hospital are a joke and don't do anything but aggravate the sick child.  This contraption is awesome!  Just like the picture on the packaging shows you, you stick the bulb end to the kid's nose and suck on the mouth piece.  Very simple and effective.  It works like a charm every time.<br /><br />I typically use it to suck out snot in the morning when they first wake up so they can start the day off right and before nap time and before bed time so they can have comfortable rest.  If their nose is a bit dry just put some saline solution up their nose and wait a couple of minutes before using the nasal aspirator.  If the child resists, you just have to straddle them, pin their arms down and do the deed.  They will feel soooo much better after.  My son hates the noise of snot being sucked out and insists he does not want it done even as he is about to hack out his lungs.  But he is always all smiles afterwards.  My eldest daughter used to lay down for me so I could get the gunk out.<br /><br />There is no need to change out the filter after each use.  I've never had snot come even close to reaching the top of the bulb and get to the filter in the two year of using this product.  I do have to buy the refills which you can pick up on Amazon because I dropped the other filters and got them dirty.
5.0	My baby daughter likes biting it, it's very soft
5.0	We love the bibs beautiful colors, soft terry fabric and our twins stay dry!  So great we just ordered more.
5.0	Love these blankets!  They are super soft and pretty big.  I ordered these and then had a embroidery shop embroider her name on them.  Very cute!
5.0	Three years ago I gave my Great Grandaughter a tower for Christmas.  After requestings ideas for Christmas for the new addition to their family I was told they loved the Tower of Time.  So glad I was able to find them through you.  I ordered two as I also have another Great Grandchild that I know will enjoy this item.
5.0	I have not used this yet because I'm not due till December but it seems great, the colors are cute and quality seems nice. I got this threw the elite club and I couldn't pass it up with the price
5.0	"My 6 month old babies love these keys!! They are easy to hold onto and make an excellent clacky sound when they shake them. Some other reviewers thought the keys seemed \\""flimsy\\"" but I like that they are light weight...then I don't have to worry so much about the twins banging themselves or each other with heavy chunky, plastic."
5.0	My 10 month old has fun trying to unsnap them. I've had good luck attaching teethers to the car seat handle
5.0	my kid loves sitting and reading and we got it for her at 17 months. It was a fair price and a great chair. Doesn't take a lot of room up and it doesn't tip over easily. great buy!
5.0	Our 1 year old granddaughter really likes this
5.0	Great product, good quality but a bit oversized for the smaller pad I was using. Would recommend it for regular sized crib mattress.
5.0	my baby loves this.. we turn on every time we put her to sleep..
5.0	My third child is now 5 months old. I've had the original Ergo for four years, bought it when my oldest was a baby. We have loved the original Ergo and it's still in great condition. When I saw the new 360, I really wanted it because my baby loves it when we carry her facing forward, but didn't know if I wanted to splurge that much, considering we might only have one more baby. But, I decided that since it would make my life easier, it would be worth it. I've loved it so far, and so does my baby. Seems to be the same great quality. The new velcro waistband doesn't bother me. It fits both me (5 ft. tall, 110 lbs) and my husband (6 ft. tall, 160 lbs) very well. Great product!
5.0	I ordered this for my 3-month-old grandson and it's such a great toy for that age. Appealing colors with a soft, cuddly feel for snuggling. He loves staring into the mirror on the giraffe's belly and chewing on the rubber leaf. I like the ring on back so it can be attached to a stroller or exerciser. It's not too big and has a very soft rattle sound. The different textures are stimulating. A perfect gift for an infant!
5.0	Like many new first time moms, I registered for many different bottles.  The only brand worth keeping was Dr. Browns.  Our son was born 18 days early and his digestive system was still premature. The Dr. Browns bottles helped tremendously in feeding him.  His reflux was decreased and he did not scream from horrible gas pains.  The system is definitely the best one out there.  I started with Avent and about half of the formula would spill down my son's chin. I was so surprise at how much my son did not like these bottles since so many of my friends loved them.  So if you are registering for bottles ONLY register for Dr. Browns.
5.0	I liked this side sleeper for many reasons.  1.The incline helps with reflux, 2.The side bumpers aren't too big, 3. the side bumpers are great to help baby feel secure, 4. the side bumpers are great for positioning baby on side to prevent flat head, 5. bumpers are adjustable, 6. the head rest is flat, not a bulky pillow that baby can roll it's face into or roll off of, 7. when baby is too heavy for the wedge, I just pulled it out and used the material with bumpers in reverse (head rest at the feet, since it bunches up under the face) Helpful Hint: Swaddle baby to prevent sliding or use a small blanket roll under the baby's knees.  I also used a small blanket and draped it over the entire system so that I just had to clean the blanket instead of the sleeper.
5.0	Very cute. Well work great for my wine the pooh themed baby shower. It will be going on the diaper wreath. Great buy.
5.0	I don't know what I would do without this organizer! I have it attached to baby's crib. It holds her diapers/wipes, lotions, diaper cream, nail clippers, brush, changing pad liners, medicines, wash cloths, and trash bags for her diaper pail. I find that the wipes box fits better if you put something in front of or behind it (to kind of wedge it in the slot so it doesn't slide around). I put a pack of boogie wipes in front and that works great. Highly recommend!
5.0	Mobile was a perfect fit!!!!
5.0	This tub gets the job done.  It's simple to use and everything I need.  I can use it in the sink or in the shower.  I usually bathe my son in the kitchen sink with it because it's such a convenient height.  Great price and exactly what I need!
5.0	Fits my stroller mountainbuggy perfectly! Has 2 great cup holders and a lot of room between them.
5.0	My grandson got the best gift! He loves it hours and hours of fun! It delivered in time and was as described!
5.0	I was very happy to find this booster on sale since we were going to buy one regardless. The color, though not one of the prettier or bright colors, was perfect for blending in with our maple table and chairs- so you hardly notice it. What you do notice is how completely comfortable it is. It is very well constructed with no seems for your toddler to smear food into and a very comfortable squishy material that I imagine makes the booster delightful to sit in. Our 2 year old will sit in it for the entire meal and doesn't ask to get down, we have to ask her to get down. In fact, we often catch her trying to climb into it when it is not time for meals. I wish they made a seat cushion product this comfortable for adults :) I highly recommend (even at the steep $60 price) and plan to purchase another one for our other daughter in a year when she is at the same stage.
5.0	I have only used this open as a wastecan liner for my cloth diapers, but I absolutely love it. the elastic stretches perfectly over the sides and it washes up well. I keep it open without a lid and haven't really noticed much stink -- that being said, I do wash every 24 hours or so and have not tried leaving diapers sitting longer. I actually purchased two of these I liked it so much -- so when I wash one, I have another ready to line the can.
5.0	I buy this butterfly or elephant for every baby.  Every thank you note I get back always raves about this gift.  My daughter takes this along wherever we travel.  It shoots stars (in blue, red, or green) all over the room yet it isn't to bright to sleep.  There are 7-10 songs that are calming.  It automatically shuts off after 15 minutes.  It keeps my toddler in bed instead of running downstairs because she is scared.  If she's still awake after the 15 minutes, she turns it back on again.  It has three simple buttons that turn on the lights or music.
5.0	I bought this monitor for its crystal clear picture. Your able to add more cameras to function with the same monitor.
5.0	I should have bought this 5 months ago for my baby. It is so easy to use. No more crying, no more accidental cuts by a baby clipper, no more dreading nail cutting time.
5.0	Great product. thoughtfully constructed. My only wish is that they have more design options.
5.0	After owning this for 3 years I gotta come back and say it's a winner.
5.0	Cool product that my baby and I use to help him learn to walk.  I like the handle and I use it so that I don't have to bend over as much while walking with baby.  Seems to be well made and haven't had any problems.
5.0	Bought this for my grandson, and they love it! Baby is very secure, does not tip like some do, (and make you feel like baby is coming out onto its head). Very easy to take in and out as needed. Quick delivery and very happy with this purchase.
5.0	I was excited when I saw the washPOD in a magazine ad, there wasn't a place to purchase it locally so I did so online. The first time we bathed our daughter in the washPOD, it was amazing- she was only a week old, there as no screaming as we had experienced with our oldest. Quite the opposite, her eyes lite up and she look around amazed and happy. It was a bit awkward at first, but as she grew and I got more accustomed it  proved to be a wonderful bonding experience. There were many nights when she would become fussy, that I just put her in the washPOD and it soothed her so that she could fall asleep more easily. I'm only sorry that at 7 months it seems she has outgrown it. Try it, be patient, you won't be disappointed.
5.0	Strong, durable stroller.......great product for the price.  Easy buckle to maneuver  Bought two strollers for my Grand-daughters.<br />Highly recommend this stroller
5.0	I have been using the One step ahead secure transition inflatable bathtub-I like them a lot except for 2 things-they last at most for 5 months and start deflating and second-the very unreasonably high shipping cost from One step ahead-8$ for something that weighs so little and is fairly small, not to mention last time ti took 10 days to arrive. This inflatable bathtub has the exact same dimension just the decoration is different and it cost less and ships for free for 3 days. My son is almost 3 years old he is still using there is still room for him to grown and he is fairly tall for his age. Its a bargain!
5.0	I was trying to find something special for my daughter's 24th birthday.  She had mentioned many times about these makeup brushes, but they were so expensive-so I ordered them for her.  They exceeded her expectations and made me feel really good-since it gets harder and harder to try to please my kids-but this time I was sucessful!
5.0	Bought as a gift for my daughter and she loves it!
5.0	A lot of people end up buying a bunch of different kinds of cups, due to too many parts, hard to clean, spillage, etc. This cup is awesome. It doesn't leak, it's very easy to clean, and my 8 mth old figured out how to use it in 2 days. Can't beat it.
5.0	Very happy with the product, though it doesn't fit one of our doors that has a weird little handle, will be buying more.
5.0	Loose fitting its great for long days in the heat, keeps our daughter cool and seems to fit forever.  We spend a LOT of time on the river in high altitude full sun and heat.
5.0	Love the insert , works great !!  My baby is two weeks old and 8 lbs , the insert holds her in there wonderfully.
5.0	It's great my daughter really likes it. She can sleep very well inside and  It's comfortable for me to carry her.
5.0	I have purchased many of these Angel Dear Blankies for my grandson and for gift--they are so soft and the babies love them
5.0	We started out with the Graco Nautilus but my son, who is 5, 35lbs and 44 inches tall, was complaining about the crotch strap hurting him and his back hurting.  The Britax has much more padding and 3 slots for the crotch strap, compared to 2 on the Nautilus.  My son is much more comfy in the Britax.  It was a breeze to install in my Chevy Cobalt.  I was also able to get a 3 across with a RF Combi Coccoro and a RF Graco Myride(which I hate because of the buckle).  It is tight but doable. I installed it in less than 5 minutes and it is rock solid.  I love the no rethreading harness on it.  We are going to stick with Britax from now on!  We also have the Marathon in a spare vehicle.  The Britax are so easy to install and they also have so much more padding than the Graco.  I couldn't be more happier with my purchase.  We should have started out with the Frontier and skipped the Nautilus.
5.0	This is a great value. Folds very easily . Very compact. Great for the day care and sleep overs. This comes in pink and blue.
5.0	This was a great alternative to high chairs or booster seats.  It elevates a regular four-legged chair so that young children can sit at the table.  Our four year old granddaughter loves sitting at the table like a grown up.  There are only two height settings, however.
5.0	This is adjustable and will work for a few years.  You can strap it into a chair or set them on the floor.  It's a great product for the price.
5.0	It works great and keeps bath toys organized and easy to reach for my boy. It fit well in my tub even though the shelf is place so low to the corner. I was having trouble finding a product that would work and this one did.
5.0	I set this up in my Daycare Center today and the kids love it! I put 3 kids in it.  A 10 month old, a 1 year old and a 8 month old.<br />I had just the gray color gate up but it was boring and not fun to look at. I went out the classroom and came back in and seen the bright colors. (It makes such a big difference in the classroom)  It looks real nice. :)  The kids like the toys and I love that it takes up less space and its not as bulky as the other gates.<br />Well, I'm about to go buy 2 more. Enjoy yours!<br />  T.D.L.C
5.0	Recently bought this for my 9 month old to use while we were traveling in Disney and on a cruise. I wanted my hands to be free to assist my other two children As well as something that would allow me many long hours of carrying her without breaking my back. The Baby Bjorn that I got when my 6 yr old was born is still in great condition but I have to say kills my back and it is not nearly as happy or comfortable for the baby. I was worried that she would not want to face me after already facing out and looking at everything in the Baby Bjorn, bc in the Ergo the baby faces you. Guess what? She absolutely loves it and so do I!!! Also, it is really true to it's name, bc it is ergonomicaly designed the baby is comfortable in her seated position and so are you! I used it in the airplane as well to keep her happy, safe and contained. What I also love about it is that with all the Winter sickness/ill was going around it is nice to have your baby close and on you therefore not many people feel inclined to just come right up and touch her.<br />Absolutely in love with this carrier all I wish is that I had it from the beginning 9 months ago, at least it can be used till she is 40 pounds and on my back and hip! Don't be intimidated by the way you have to put it on, once you so it a couple times it is 2nd nature.
5.0	The Lorex BB2411 is a fantastic baby video monitor.  The picture quality is superb and allows you to safely monitor your baby wherever you are around the house.  It's not like looking at a 1080p TV but it does its job pretty well.  You can see your babies movement clearly on the 2.4 inch screen and hear everything crystal clear.  The IR Night Vision works like most systems and gives you a good video feed of your baby in the dark.  The most important aspect of monitoring is seeing the child's movements and this IR camera can do that.  You will basically get a black and white video at night and I feel that is sufficient.  It is not super clear in the dark, but then again, this is not military grade and I do not expect it to be.  It is all about expectations.  This is my only baby video monitor so I cannot comment on how it compares to other brands or models.<br /><br />The Lorex has plenty of features that makes it a well rounded monitoring system.  It picks up my son's crying very well in his room and has a standby mode to conserve batteries.  There is a setting in the camera called VOX (voice trigger) and will wake the screen on the portable monitor when it hears sounds.  You can set it to a faint whisper or loud crying.  It works pretty good.  The kit includes a rechargeable battery pack but you do have the option to replace with regular Alkaline, or rechargeable batteries if you wish.  I think that is the better option as it does not force you to buy an expensive specialty battery down the road.  The manual says the portable monitor can run for 4 hours on 4 AAA batteries.<br /><br />There are 2 power adapters included. The monitor needs to be plugged in to operate, while the second one is used to charge the battery on the portable monitor.  They recommend for first use to charge the battery for 6 hours before use.  You can use it for about 6 hours once the battery is fully charged, and you should have it plugged in if you are using it overnight as the battery willnot last a full nights sleep.<br /><br />Nice features of the Lorex is a built in thermometer and music.  You can hit the lullaby button and switch between 5 different lullabies.  The lullabies are played through the camera.  Since it is playing through the camera, I can hear the music through the monitor as well.  The thermometer is nice because it tells you the temperature where the camera is placed.  There is also a built in temperature alert.  You can set the monitor to alert you if the room where the camera is placed is too low or too hot.  If you set the LO alert below 62 F, it will disable it, and anything set above 86 F will disable the HI alert.  You do not want the room to be too hot as your baby can fall into a deadly deep sleep.<br /><br />The range on the monitor is decent and I can walk around my 2 story home and still get decent reception with no interference.  I have a ton of wi-fi devices and electronics in the house and so far no problems on my end.  The monitor can be mounted to the wall and the power cable should be kept 3 feet away from the baby. The kit includes some clips for cord management, and plastic anchors and screws for mounting the monitor.  I have mine mounted and angled down at my child and I can see his movements perfectly.  There is also a zoom function, which does a max of 2x zoom.  You can tilt the monitor easily and for better reception, extend the antenna on the monitor.  You can also pair your monitor with up to 4 cameras, but can only watch from one camera at a time.  Right out of the box, my monitor and camera were paired to each other so I simply plugged it in and used it out of the box.  The monitor also has an audio only mode and will play audio only from the selected camera.  The camera also has a night light built in.  It is not super bright, but works pretty good as a night light.  You can switch it on or off.  I always have mine on.<br /><br />All in all, I think the Lorex offers great features for the price.  I am extremely happy with it and would not change a thing.  If I need extreme HD, then I will just walk to my child's room and watch him in person.  But for monitoring, I think it is sufficient.  It does everything fairly well and I am very happy with it.  I highly recommend it.
5.0	This bassinet was purchased for a friend as a shower gift.  The mother-to-be has set it up in her room and says that it is beautiful.  She is very pleased with it.
5.0	Great...except there it leaves some red marks or stains under it in the shower. Not sure what that is from, really. I'm the only one who has ever taken a shower in there...oh wait, except...uh oh..Oh geez...wait...surely not...
5.0	We love the versatility of this bag. Its not cumbersome and is lightweight and can be used as a backpack too! The changing pad is also extra large which helps with our ever growing child.
5.0	I bought these chalk placemats to pair with some chalk markers that I had purchased. They were intended as a new camping activity for three kids (ages 3, 4, and 6). All three kids loved drawing on the mats. The placemats are 12&#34; x 17&#34; in size and durable with use. They wash up and store easily. These would be awesome to keep everyone entertained when waiting at restaurants or just when you are bored.
5.0	We started using the bouncer with my daughter when she was 3 weeks old and she loved it right away.  She could not really follow the lights but she enjoyed the music and the vibrations.  <br />She is now 2 months old and she could spend hours in it!  She follows the lights and laughs and coos at them and the toys hanging from the bar.  When the music and lights turn off she makes a noise as if to tell us to turn it back on.  We can't wait until she can start kicking the lights and music on herself.  <br />It is also very useful when I want to take a shower and she is awake.  I put it on the bathroom floor and by the time my shower is over she is usually asleep in it.  She also sits in it when she watches her Baby Einstein tapes and the vibrations keep her calm and relaxed.<br />One of the best features is that the music and lights stay on for a good amount of time and in the two months that we have been using it we have only had to change the batteries in the light bar once and have yet to change the batteries in the vibrating seat.<br />I would recommend this product to every parent.
5.0	great price, arrived 2 weeks ahead of time and should get some laughs at the baby shower!
5.0	One of the best things we purchased for our baby! She loved it for months and months!
5.0	This is an amazing exersaucer.  My son loves it.  Very sturdy and well built.
5.0	Fits my 3 month grandson, and room to grow.  He looks so cute in the hat.  Great for cool spring or fall days.  High quality!
5.0	The gym arrived before scheduled which is always a bonus. Our son seems to enjoy most of the toys that came with the gym, especially the hanging ones. I have no concerns for safety and the gym seems to be as safe as could be for babies. The detached mirror/lights/music piece could be made a tad better as it tends to not want to always stand on its own. Regardless, our son loves it and could spend hours in it if we'd let him! Would buy again if ever needed.
5.0	Utilized this product with my twins 4 years ago and again with my newborn.  This filter used with its corresponding pail effectively contains odors.  Recommend changing the filter as directed as it does lose its effectiveness over time.
5.0	very safe, and easy going
5.0	I was so tired of the seat belt rubbing my neck so this product is wonderful.  It allows you to get the seat belt adjusted away from your neck and is not supposed to interfere with the safety of the belt.  It is easy to put on the belt and comes off quickly too.  Love this product.
5.0	I don't use this as a bath toy organizer, but I rate it a high 5 for organizing. I use one in my pantry and in my child's bedroom closet. She puts her next day's outfit in the bedroom closet and in the pantry I use it for little snack pockets so that she can easily have access to them without reaching to high. I'm sure i plan to buy more as she gets older and organization is a must. The organizer is very sturdy and reliable. I have been using it for a week now and am glad to add this to my home.
5.0	I was pleasantly surprised to learn that the gate extension was already put together.  It was incredibly easy to add to the full length arched gate fence I also purchased.  It is very nice looking and really fits nicely with our<br /> décor  I highly recommend.
5.0	My grandma had one that broke so my husband and I bought this one for her... it is perfect! works great! and it is a bit bigger than the one she had. she was very happy. =) this one is great! not like the other cheap ones that break fast...
5.0	I currently have one of these on my Uppababy Vista and I love it. It replaced my Jolly Jumper. It is so well made and roomy that I got tired of switching it from my Uppa to my BoB so I bought another one. My only &#34;complaint&#34; is that I have a new BoB Revolution Flex and the velco straps ( where you attach to the stroller) are too wide for the spacing. If Freddie and Sebbie made the velcro straps about .50 inch smaller it would fit perfectly. It still works I just squish it in a little.
5.0	Bought this seat for my godson for my vehicle and he loves it!!!  This is an all around great seat. I was really impress with the metal frame. You can't go wrong with this one and he sits comfortable and looks very relaxed every time we go for ride:)  And yes! Everything can be removed and washed...I asked before I bought this seat and someone said cover couldn't be washed.
5.0	My daughter is six months old and absolutely LOVES this jumperoo. It has enough to keep her interested for as long as I let her sit in it. She loves the music so dances and jumps up and down. We dno't know what we'd do without this!
5.0	Dad of 3 boys.  This was the solution for me to fit 3 kids seats in the back row.  Thank God.  Worked like a charm.  Takes time to get used to but works as described and safety tested.
5.0	Too much fun, love these guys.  Well made
5.0	Only cup holder that stays on the car seat. It was defiantly worth the money.
5.0	My husband and I decided to wait to find out the sex of our baby until birth.  A baby book was one of those things that are almost impossible to find in the neutral category.  This book is perfect because it goes into detail about mommy, daddy, baby, and what is going on in around you during your pregnancy and after birth.  I think if my mom would have had  book like this I would have loved going back and reading everything!
5.0	I have had several new moms tell me that this is the baby carrier to get.  My new grandbaby will be snug and happy.
5.0	Great bag! Love the size and color...perfect!
5.0	Love the price very hard to find.
5.0	i looked at a few different nesting cup toys and eventually purchased this one because it lends itself to so many different kinds of play. a few months ago, when my child first started playing with this, we would stack or nest the cups for her. she would knock the stack down and pull the cups out from one another when they were nested. in the bath, she would be fascinated by the water running through them. in the park, the same thing only with sand. just before she turned 1 yr old, she started sorting with them -- putting other small objects into each of the cups. this is one of the few toys that has held her interest for months. she's a bit young still, but i also talk about the color spectrum when she plays with it. it seems like every set is a different mix of colors, but the one we wound up with loosely follows the order of colors in the spectrum of light when it's organized by size. it's lovely that it is inexpensive and doesn't take up much space at all when nested. it's a great gift for infants and the perfect toy to bring along when you travel.
5.0	Great price and can't wait to use them
5.0	I am going to give this mat as a gift to my Goddaughter and I like that is very soft and the colors are so vibrant!! I have never seen a mat exactly like this one before.
5.0	My daughter has been using these for her home made baby food, works very well in freezer and microwave use.<br />Would highly recommend.
5.0	Great idea,this cover is very nice. I bought it to re-cover an older Sunshine Kids radian. It works great. I bought one in Blue and one in Pink. They are easy to wash and use. Highly recommend.
5.0	My expectation was that these strap covers would prevent the straps from cutting into my child's neck. They met my expectation and the price was good enough to buy multiple sets.
5.0	In return for my review I received this product at a discount. Its neat. Great teether for babies.
5.0	Bath when her daughter gave her turn on the water, she started a little scared, probably too young, too slowly took a look around, and then they like to put the mouth, ha ha, very funny, oh
5.0	Pleas get it for the sake of your sanity. This product is super helpful and free up your hands to do other things while pumping. I think every pumping mom should get more than one.
5.0	My son enjoys his baths in this tub. I don't worry about him hurting himself on the sides. Babies only need baths every 3-4 days so that their skin doesn't get dried out (eczema). It cleans easily too. I recommend this tub.
5.0	I can not say enough good things about this car seat. what first attracted me to this seat was the britax name and the beautiful fabric. I have a 19mo old and 1mo old twins. SAFETY is the most important thing when buying car seats so price shouldn't matter. The no tangle straps are great and the velcro to hold them in place is brilliant ( all car seats should have this). The latch and tether is great to, both my husbands car and mine have latch but I have also had to install it in my mother in laws car with out latch and it still installs very easily. The customer servie is fantastic I lost one of the plastic strap pieces when I took it apart to clean it, and they mailed a new one out free of charge. Way to go britax yet another great product from britax.  <br />Things I love  <br />1) no tangle straps  <br />2) easy adjustment of harness  <br />3) lots of padding  <br />4) easy cleaning  <br />5) easy instalation with or with out latch  <br />6) great customer service  <br /> <br />Just an extra note when my twins out grow their graco snugrides,(in the GGG pattern with matching duo glider) which I also have nothing but great things to say about,they will be getting britax marathons.
5.0	I use this at work for my pumping parts.  Absolutely love it!
5.0	This is such a time saver.  It fits comfortably and makes it so I don't have to hold the pump up to my breast the whole time.  I would not pump without it!
5.0	This lamp rocks! Very detailed drawings; shade gives a comforntable lighting setting once ON. This is a great combination with the other Bedtime Originals products.
5.0	As with all the Summer Infant Nature's Purest items I love how soft the cotton is and how well the items wash up.  The greatest things about these bibs are the size.  I found with most of the other bibs I had purchased or were given were way to large when my baby was a newborn. These ones are the perfect size for a smaller baby or when you dont want a bib to hang down to her knees!
5.0	Grandpa and I just put together this adorable stove/sink unit. It's so cute, and very well constructed. Definately a two person job; one to hold the parts together while one inserts the screws. It took about 45 minutes to assemble, our little Isabelle will have hours of imaginary fun with it. We do regret that it didn't arrive before Christmas. In store would be even better. Nanna
5.0	Love these bags! Perfect for those stinky diapers!
5.0	This product is very sturdy and easy to install. It does not mar the post on the railing at all.
5.0	100% recommend the product sastifecho am very with the purchase I made and I had no problem with the product
5.0	Looks great on the wall, even a textured wall.  Every child should have that saying on their wall to remind them to be themselves not like everyone else.
5.0	I thought that this was way to pricey for a squeaky toy. But it's been through 2 babies as a favorite toy and still looks brand new. Soft plastic is great for chewing.
5.0	Love this! The batteries last forever and my baby loves the lights and music.
5.0	It's loud but can be muffled easily.
5.0	We had this in my son's nursery for two years and passed it on to another family.  Everything held up great and looked adorable, but still boy-ish.  I also got the valance, mobile, blanket, and canvas pictures to complete the look.
5.0	My 14 year old autistic daughter loves these chewy tubes!
5.0	We bought the black/green for $39.99. We received it with a broken wheel. But Amazon has an amazing return policy and sent us a new stroller even before we returned the broken one, so we were able to take it on a last-minute vacation.<br /><br />It folds up easily and takes up very little trunk space. It also assembles in under 10 minutes. When taking it out to unfold and use, it really does unfold with one hand very easily.<br /><br />I bought this to have in addition to our bulky jogging stroller. I wanted something light and inexpensive to take on vacation or to go mall shopping with. This and the pack-n-play take up far less trunk space than the jogger.<br /><br />I was looking for something light (this is about 11 pounds), with a sunshade, 5 point harness because my kid is HIGH ENERGY and will climb out of any and all lap belts, under-carriage storage, and double handles. It has all of the above and a fanny-pack-like felt caddy for things like keys and cell phones. The only drawback is that the under-carriage storage is not very accessible. The stroller frame covers most of it so basically it's good for a small package or a pair of flip flops. It's still handy to have, but just don't expect to put a large package underneath when you're out shopping.<br /><br />I will say, I put a bag of 3 beach towels on the handles along with a small diaper bag and it was strury enough to not get top heavy when the kid was not in it.<br /><br />The recline is minimal. It doesn't lay very far back, but my kid falls asleep fairly easy when he is asleep and he has no problem falling asleep/staying asleep in this stroller. The 5-point harness helps keep his body secure and his head never flops forward.<br /><br />Recommend. I am going to buy a larger sunshade because the current one is very narrow and doesn't offer much sun protection the way it is. But it is still a lot better than the BRU $16.99 stroller and I am sure I'll get more than a season of use out of it.
5.0	Very cute and comfortable. Great with Peg Perego stroller. Much more comfortable for baby who isn`t sitting yet than regular strollers.
5.0	I love this cute backpack. My son loves it too.<br />It has the perfect size for his stuff.<br />He uses it for kindergarden and also for travelling.<br />I recomend it!
5.0	I love these bottles - they are so much better than the others we have tried. When you are mixing formula in the bottles the cap is very snug fitting to the nipple so formula doesn't shoot out everywhere when you shake it up. All the other bottles caps aren't tight around the top of the nipple and milk ends up getting EVERYWHERE when you shake it up. I highly recommend these - even though they are more expensive than some others, they are totally worth it.
5.0	Fast shipping, and was just what my sister was looking for.
5.0	Really easy to instal once you get the hang of it. The manual is terrible. Mostly ended up using YouTube videos for help and I used the seatbelt since Chevy has a 65 pound weight limit and the seat is 33 pounds. I was surprised how solid it is with the seatbelt! It sits up really high which my son loves but found it easier to install on the side rather than the middle because it would be hard to reach through the car. I pushed the rear seat as far back as possible which actually made lots of room in the front when this seat is installed. I know some people have commented how the seat is hard, so far my son has slept most times in it and doesn't complain at all. What I love is how this seat is going to make rear facing possible for much longer than our previous seat.
5.0	Perfect! Like it states...it's only for a convertible crib or twin sized bed. Not for use with a toddler bed.
5.0	My 7 month son really like it. This jumper is the only place he can stay along for over10 minutes.
5.0	Love love love these blankets!
5.0	Very traditional look, safe, colorful and soft touch for toddlers in the bath. Could have been larger, but all in all everything expected.
5.0	Baby plays all the time with this toy
5.0	We got this to use on our Peg Perego Skate. Our oldest is almost 3 and only needs the jumper seat when she gets tired or wants to hitch a ride. It is a perfect way to keep you from buying a double stroller that you don't need. It certainly gets a bit heavy pushing a 15 pound baby and 30+ pound toddler, but it would be the same with any double. I love using it. We have used it for long days at the zoo and it was perfect. An umbrella or shade for the jumper would be a nice addition, but you can buy that as a separate attachment I think. Love our Peg Perego stuff!
5.0	Great, works so well in every situation, nice large claw for quick attachment, a velcro loop, and the arm is great for portable crib.
5.0	This thing works perfectly and easily. Please note to clean it can be difficult if you don't have a long thin item like a pencil covered in a paper towel or something of that nature. Also, if you can't suck air through your mouth very well then it might be hard for you, but this gets the mucus out every time.
5.0	My wife an I have been trying to decided between two toddler beds for our just turned 2 year old daughter. <br /> <br />the Natural Madison: <br />(http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B00023C3Y6/qid=1121085833/br=1-11/ref=br_lf_ba_11//102-5322636-7661752?v=glance&s=baby&n=542388)and <br /> <br />the Traditional - Natural <br />(http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000067PO2/ref=pd_ecc_rvi_1/102-5322636-7661752).   <br /> <br />We decided upon the Natural Madison even though it cost a little more because we like the fact that the headboard was solid and did not have the openings in it like the other.  The bed is supposed to hold up to 50 pounds which should last our daughter for while.  Putting the bed together was pretty easy although you may need some help balancing the first side rail as you attach it to the headboard and footboard.  The finish on this is nice however it seems to have a tint of red even though it is supposed to be a natural color.  Not as dark as a cherry finish, but it does have a slight tint to it.  I may stain it later on to match our daughter other furniture, but right now it is not really a big difference.  Overall it seems to be a very good choice for a toddler bed and we are very happy with it.  Our daughter loves it and is slowly sleeping in it more and more.
5.0	very good product, it could recommend
5.0	I am so pleased with this blanket that I have come back to Amazon several times to order more. Our little granddaughter is VERY attached to her pink, swirly blanket. She has worn them out so finding this was a life saver for her (and us!) I have also ordered the small size Bearington Baby blankets for her to use when out so she does not have to take the big one.
5.0	Phenomenal car seat!  My 4 year old child (36 lbs, 41 inches) can sleep in it comfortably without slouching forward.  Also, it's lightweight and although a little bulky, it's fairly easy to travel with (check on airplane).  In fact, we bought this specifically for using in a rental car while traveling.  Very pleased.  Recaro makes great car seats and added bonus: this one is assembled in the USA.
5.0	I had purchased these awhile back and as soon as my 6 mo old started crawling realized it was time to use them. First things first-I like the dark color, it doesn't look too weird against my espresso furniture. I came on here to read reviews about damaging the wood-and I see both good and bad reviews on that. Since I just got my coffee table three months ago I was a little hesitant about it. What if it ruins the finish when I take it off? So I kind of just held off on putting them on. Literally that same day my son lo and behold lost his balance and fell forward causing a big knot on his little forehead :( I did not waste any time COVERING every sharp corner and edge on my table. I figure...if it ruins the finish oh well. I will buy another table. My son's safety is more important than any peice of furniture. The foam is very cushiony. Easy to use. Not sure how well the tape will stay as we are on our second day with it on but....so far so good.
5.0	Excellent jumper! Too short for tall doorways, but perfect on standard doors.  Our little guy lives it and spends a good deal of time in there just jumping away!
5.0	I love the color and pattern of this nursing cover. This cover fits well and has handy little pockets that you can store you breast pads or other things in while you are feeding.
5.0	Fits great over every shopping cart I've tried it with. I only tried it with a high chair once, and had a hard time, but I think that is because I was doing it wrong, and now that I've read the instructions I'm sure it would work fine!
5.0	I LOVE this bag..it was bigger then I expected..I use it for school..it holds everything I need and it's super super cute..I get lot of compliments..I wish I had one when I had my son
5.0	I bought this car for my son when he was four or five months old.  I had been shopping for a toy that was sturdy enough to be tossed around yet was fun enough to be played with often.  I also wanted something that would encourage crawling but wouldn't be noisy or require batteries.  This car fits all those needs!  It's small enough for a baby's hands to hold, and the popping noise from the beads is not loud or abrasive.  You can pull back to wind the car for forward motion, and while it moves on carpet it can really fly on hardwood floors!  I like that you can pull it back just a little so it moves forward a little bit -- perfect for those babies that aren't ready for their toys to be super-fast.  It was a good purchase for us and has proven to be a good item to gift to others!
5.0	Washes well time and again, wonderful fabric, and versatile! Lime green color is beautiful! We bought two for our cloth diaper system, this always keeps one in rotation.
5.0	Finally bought this after 2 months of pumping without it and its been wonderful.  Time is no longer wasted while pumping and I can actually get things done.  Its very comfortable and easy to use.
5.0	Literally the best bra ever! Fits great, the material is amazingly soft, & it really conforms to my ever changing breast! I bought one to make sure it fits, but now that I know it works great, I will buy more. Only problem is I had to wait for my size to come in stock, a lot of mothers must e a 36 D haha
5.0	These are very handy when going shopping. Saves the hassle of carrying items and pushing the stroller at the same time.
5.0	This potty is so great for in the car and on the go potty stops.  Before I used the frog style potty but always had the issue of what to do with the pee and poop when we were out and about.  This potty makes clean up so easy and you can use any gallon size zippered bag to seal it up and dispose of it after your child goes potty.  I also like that it has easy storage for wipes, zipper bags, etc.  It is also nice that the way it folds up when not in use makes it less obvious that it is a potty.  Wouldn't leave home without it for my potty training toddler.
5.0	Edited to add: This has been getting washed weekly for over a year now and is still in amazing condition. Great product!  Perfect size, cute print, easily washed and dried. Not a single bad thing to say about it. Does a fantastic job of holding in the smell and keeping the pail itself from getting musty. Very pleased.
5.0	This bassinet is very versatile, and I find that I am very happy with my purchase.  It has a diaper changing station under the bassinet part, which my husband loves because he can't bend over to change her diaper due to his bad back.  It also has a light, music, and a vibrator that is all on a timer and automatically turns off after a period of around 10 minutes.  My baby practically lived in this bassinet the first few weeks.  She is now 7 weeks old and shows no sign of moving out of it anytime soon.  I cannot imagine having a newborn baby without this product!
5.0	We use links for EVERYTHING!!! I use them in the closet to separate clothing sizes, on the playmat to &#34;lock&#34; items down and hang things, on the stroller to keep toys from hitting the ground, as a toy of their own, as teething rings, shake them along to music... everything. By far the most versatile toy we have. You can NEVER have too many links! I love the vibrant colors and textures.
5.0	This is a lifesaver. I have used it almost daily with my 12-week-old son still with an infant insert. He was so fussy in the early weeks and this was and is a guaranteed way to get him to nap and still be able to get things done around the house and take the dogs for a walk. I also didn't have to worry about winter clothing on walks outside other than a hat because it keeps him so snug and warm. I wear it around the house, mall, neighborhood, and long shopping trips to Target. He rarely wakes up until I take him out and doesn't cry for food or diaper changes. Love the pockets for me to stick stuff in. This is perfect for me. My husband, however, does not like it and does not find it comfortable. He is over 6 ft with a large chest.
5.0	Love it! The only downfall, the range isn't very far.
5.0	This hook has been a lifesaver to attach my diaper bag to the stroller and shopping cart. I just leave it attached to my diaper bag, it's ready when I need it!
5.0	This stuff really works on my tender nipples and have not had any cracking or bleeding
5.0	perfect size for a wipes case! very soft and gentle.
5.0	This has been a brilliant purchase - wish I'd found it years ago! My son is 17 months and always joins us in our bed for part of the night. We have a fixed bed rail at home, but travelling is tricky and I usually have to improvise some kind of guard. Often neither I or my son sleep very well since I worry about him falling out and he doesn't always find my improvisations very comfortable. Having used the Shrunks inflatable guard for two weeks in two different beds I can thoroughly recommend it. It inflates quickly with the pump provided, fits easily under a fitted sheet and stays in place securely all night. My son and I slept soundly as a result! It packs down nice and small and comes with a handy bag to carry it and the pump. It stayed fully inflated for 10 days (after which I deflated it to move to our next holiday location). Wish<br />I'd had this when my daughter was small!
5.0	Worked great & price was good.
5.0	Good afternoon. I want to know if the completa.los colection six dolls in the photo or just 1 doll comes.
5.0	This was an item registered from soon-to-be parents. they loved the gift and were thrilled when opening it up! yeah
5.0	My daughter has been having lots of nighttime fears lately and she wanted to sleep with the lamp on....we already have a night light in her room but that wasn't enough. This was perfect because she would now be able to sleep with her light and feel more secure at night. She loves it and places it in her bed. She likes to have it on all night long so we do not use the timer and we also use the green steady light since its not as bright as the blue but not as dark as the red. These lights are very user friendly in terms of selecting your color and removing the timer, my 5 yr old had it figured out already on the 1st night. Will definitely be buying more of these in the future
5.0	this baby carrier is great!. no hands & you can watch you tube videos on different was to use it.
5.0	Bought this for my daughter for Xmas. I use it every night at bed time time. She loves the colors
5.0	My son is teething and began gnawing on the crib rails.  Ordered this -- problem solved.  Fits great.
5.0	We used this on a recent 3,000 car trip with our 4 year old. The side pockets were useless for us since we had other stuff in the car (like a bucket of toys beside her) that limited access to them. The great things were the belt that holds it on so no matter how much moving she did, the tray wouldn't slide to the floor. The lip around the edge was amazing. It kept all her little things in place and enabled us to give small toys like little lego sets which we would not have been able to do without a tray. Be aware that this is not rigid at all and sort of bows over the lap so if you want your child to do drawing they may need a clipboard (which is what we used) or a color book with a bit of stiffness. It is too soft to hold a drink on top but great for eating meals in the car regardless. Overall we loved this tray and our daughter did too! Even when she was not playing and doing TV time in the afternoons she would want us to leave the tray in place!
5.0	These were great in the first few weeks of nursing to collect extra milk during letdown.  I wish they were a little bigger so they held more milk.  Also, they worked great when nipples were sore and needed to heal.  Highly recommend!
5.0	If this fits your vaporizon, a great buy. Buy in quantity and save time and money when replacing is needed
5.0	This is a great product.  Perfect for taking with you to restaurants and very portable.  Lightweight and folds easily.  Can throw into your diaper bag or your handbag.  Not very padded but it does the job of keeping the high chair covered.  Only drawback is that the cover only velcros on the sides of the wooden high chairs that have openings.  Without the velcros in place the cover does tend to slip a bit.  A nice feature is the 2 velcro straps in the front that you can attach toys to.  Overall this is def. a product worth buying and having in your arsenal of baby gear.
5.0	I bought this stroller because I liked the feature where it can be bassinet for baby to sleep comfortably in while out. The fabric feels very comfy and is padded nicely. Also, I like that you have the option to turn baby to face you or away from you, but you have to take the bassinet off and turn it around, the handles don't move like in other strollers. The bottom compartment is small and can fit a small purse not a diaper bag. It is a very big and bulky stroller, takes up the whole trunk space in my car. My daughter is one year old now, and the stroller can be used until she is around 3, however sometimes I don't want to be lugging around a huge stroller, but instead use one of those regular small strollers that can be folded flat and is light to hold with one hand.
5.0	Great to cover outlet for fish tank plug to keep baby safe. :)
5.0	Got this accessory to go with our Baby Jogger City Versa stroller. Works great and is better constructed (IMO) than the Baby Jogger model (and cheaper too!).  Has two cup holders, a middle pocket, and a few outside pockets. Great for holding all the essentials that you would probably take with you on a walk (snack, drink, cell phone, keys, etc).
5.0	Would highly recommend this booster. Works very well and is good transition from high chair to table. A real favorite with our princess.
5.0	This is a great fence
5.0	I got this stuffed animal for my daughter. She is a dog LOVER! We have not read the books, but it doesn't matter, she makes up her own adventures with this cute stuffed pup. When we opened the box and she first saw him, her face light up with joy and she hasn't really let him go. He is super soft, and well made, and the perfect size for my daughter who is almost 5. We also love his little neckerchief, it adds a fun playfulness that we really enjoy. Thanks for making a well made stuffed animal. This westie is a new bestie!<br /><br />I would recommend this product to anyone who enjoys stuffed animals!
5.0	Our grandson loves to jump.  This bouncer is his favorte and the favorite of his Grammie.  Other bouncers did not support him like his Grammie thought they should.  This does the trick.  Grammie is happy and most importantly our grandson is safe.
5.0	For those wondering, the mattress tag says it's made up of 60% polyester and 40% cotton. Polyester is chemically treated so this mattress is not all organic but better than some others out there. It did not have a chemical smell though and did not need airing out so I was glad about that. Seems comfortable and not too firm or soft. Will be used at grandparents house from time to time.
5.0	Quality bag very versatile has many compartments can also be used as a purse in addition to the baby supplies my girlfriend loves it
5.0	Really good quality!! Very happy. Fits nicely on my BOB stroller. 2 cup holders and multiple places for keys/cell phone/money. Great item!!
5.0	After using regular diapers for a while now, I decided to give cloth diapers a try, as my son was complaining alot about his diapers. After some research, I bought the HappyEndings night night charcoal bamboo diapers.<br />I am happy with my purchase and find them to be comfortable on my son.He likes to keep them on and it comes in adorable prints and colors.There have been no leaks and I definitely plan to buy more of these...there's nothing like going natural!
5.0	We love this stroller. I have bought it recently as my sister-in law has the Sit-n-Stand and it was just to big to fit into my wife's little toaster car( Scion Xb). This stroller fits snug but it fits. I like how the infant seat is very well padded and the front double wheels are actually spring assisted but not visible in the photo. We have logged about 60 miles of walks already and its holding up well. Last night my sister in-law came down with her two kids and sit and stand and we did a few mile walk. Lets just compare the two from the walk last night. Sit and Stand(S/S) was much longer with handle configuration but Caboose was same size inside for kids. S/S was much heavier to push and the little platform that comes down for the kids to stand on was super noisy on our walk and we had to put it up for all of us to talk and it always bounces around and sounds like you are dragging something through gravel all the time. The S/S does have a larger bin to store things under the toddler seat but its not much bigger. I do like the Caboose much better, it steers easier and tracks straight, it is lighter and less noisy and much smaller foot print. Also has steel square frame that is very strong and does not bend when kids are jumping on and off.  The S/S seems like it fights you when steering and I hated that. We bought green because it was the cheapest, I would probably buy black as it hides small spills better but green was much cheaper and the pads are easy to wash :)<br /><br />** Edit 8/13/2012 **<br />We have now used this stroller for the summer and have placed about 50 miles of sidewalk concrete walking and the rear tires are starting to bald but this is probably normal and hopefully will have many more miles left. The only issue I have had is the underneath storage canvas is attached by snap buttons and one of them would always unhook when anything was placed in it. I fixed with a dab of Krazy glue and the other 3 have not had the issue so far. Green is showingsome dirt as expected but not a big deal. Buy black is the price is equal, green does get a lot of attention from the other moms at the mall my wife has said, they think this stroller is from space as no one has ever seen one where we live.
5.0	The letters are bright and just the right size to decorate a child's room.  I have many different decals but my grandson really loves these best.  We use them as our guide while singing ABCD...  Not only a good decoration but also a good educational tool.
5.0	I had the skip hop duo (newborn-4mths), then the skip hop versa(4mths-6mths) and now this bag. Love it and plenty of room. I overpack so a big bag was very important to me. If you don't use the bottom for food, you can use it to store diapers.
5.0	Very good video quality in lighted and dark conditions.
5.0	Don't just place one order, get at least 2 or 3.  These things are awesome for babies/toddlers and we use them every day.  Great for cereal, goldfish, etc. and a must have for car rides.
5.0	Washed it and it came back just as prewashed.  Has great colors that did not wash out. So far, I expect nothing but good things out of this.
5.0	I brought this mattress to go inside my graco pack n play which I needed for my two 22 month olds for an extended vacation. The mattress fits perfectly in the graco pack n play. I brought the jersey/t-shirt type  pack n play sheet which fit great on the mattress. Definitely more comfy to sleep on then the hard one already in the pack n play.
5.0	When it came to finding a car seat that would fit our son we had our work cut out for us. He has always been about two years ahead on the growth charts, especially in height. After reading tons of reviews we took decided we needed to take him to the stores and have him sit in them for himself. The spacing between the back of the seat and the center belt strap and the height of the headrest were both issues with all other seats but this one. To add to how great this seat is, it is super comfy and he naps easily in it, no flopping heads here! We make 8 hour trips to see family on a fairly regular basis and he is a happy camper. The construction and design is well thought out and it's is fairly easy to install and take apart for cleaning. I would recommend you purchase the cup holder to go with it, but other than that we love this seat!
5.0	Thank god for pumping pals I almost stoped exclusively pumping before I finally got these. I would recommend them over the medela shields to any one. My nipples swell a lot when I pump so they would get stuck in the tunnel and it would hurt so bad while I was pumping and after. Now I use the xl sheild of the pumping pals and my supply is up and I am no longer in pain. They did take a few days to get used to and let down for. So don't give up after only one try! It's so worth it.
5.0	love these! I wear them every night since they are breathable and keep me from leaking through my night shirt. (It is hard to get them not to show through a normal bra with no padding - so I stick to the disposable ones during the day)
5.0	My granddaughter gets asthma and croup and this has helped keep the problem in check.  It's not like a vaporizer with hot steam, iit adds cool mist and is good for her asthma.  The doctor recommended that we get something for her room at night and this one really fills our need and seems way safer than many we looked at.
5.0	I loved these as they were exactly what I was looking for.  I used them with my first child, but could no longer find them in the stores when I had my second baby.  Since I nursed both kids, they did not like the traditional pacifiers and these were the only ones they would use.  Worked like a charm!
5.0	It's a toy and pacifier all in one. It's amazing. My kid uses it every night, and loves to talk to it during the day. Makes it easier to find the pacifier too!
5.0	Our grandson received this swing as a shower gift.  He was rather fussy as a newborn, and at times, the only thing that would soothe him was this swing.  Even at seven months, he still enjoys it.  This is a &quot;must-have&quot;.
5.0	I love the foot petal.  You can walk in with hands full of graceries or a child in arms and you can easily enter with the foot petal and your knee to push the gate forward.<br /><br />We are currently using this to keep a dog out of a particular area in the house and it is fantastic for pets as well as kids!
5.0	It's still very large physically but it fits in the back seat. I swear they make it so these things only fit in minivans or 50k plus SUV's. No joke.
5.0	Got it for my son a year ago for his birthday and it's still sturdy,the process of setting it up was a bit difficult but after about 45mins. It was ready.My son loves it,and even though it has a weight limit,sometimes me and his dad take turns laying with him and it even holds us,it never broke nor did the bars bend.even though I don't recommend adults sleeping in it,but if you want to comfort your child sometimes it is a durable bed.Good product
5.0	Fits graco pack n play perfectly. We take it on vacation with us wherever we go. Little one sleeps great on it and it is much softer than the pad that comes with the play yard.
5.0	Perfect carrier and an unbeatable price. Fits my 24 lb 14 month old great and he loves to ride. Very lightweight and comfortable
5.0	Purchased for me 3 y/o to use for nap time at school.  It is absolutely adorable!  I haven't brought it home yet from school to clean it, so I cannot comment on how well it holds up.
5.0	We got this for my almost 2 son because it's freezing at grandmas house.  He can walk around but it still keeps him warm.  Like many have said they run big but even though it seems huge on him I think it's by design because you can pull his feet in when you put him to bed and he has enough room in there to keep them warm.  He's still able to walk well even with the excess fabric.
5.0	I love the texture. looks absorvent too. Have it ready for my baby. We cleaned my daughters car seat and used a new cover this was the icing in the cake as it now looks like a brand new car seat. Ready for my baby due on december :)
5.0	I haven't yet took them for a spin, but they're just the right diameter, length, and stiffness I was hoping for. We're planning on using half for the baby stuff and one for my tool bag.
5.0	My son and I love this.  He is 8 weeks old and we wanted something for him to get out his energy at the end of the day...and it does just that.  He gets so excited.  He will sleep for 7 hours at night after playing on this and having a bottle.  Mom and Dad could not be happier!
5.0	Easy to use. Seems to last longer than the other popular diaper pail refills. Like this pail a lot. It stinks pretty bad when you open it, however the smell is completely contained in the pail which is GREAT! We haven't had any issues with the pail or the refills.
5.0	So cute and clever.  Soft and a great size for wee little feller!!!  Thank  you
5.0	This is good, my baby after very well
5.0	Sassy Earth Brights are awesome!!  These are by far my 8 month-old son's favorite toys, loves to chew on the fabric and he also enjoys the colors.  Another reviewer expressed dislike because baby can hit themselves with the toy.  This can be done just as easily with a plastic toy as well.  We try to keep plastics away from our baby and, in fact, the rest of the family, so these toys are a great alternative to plastic teething toys.
5.0	This is the best night light... This is our 4th one... They do tend to Break after 6 months... I will still purchase another one due to my son loving them... They are fun and safe... You child can sleep with them...
5.0	My granddaughter loves this type of toy and loves sticking things down in holes so the &#34;noisy&#34; balls rolling down the ramp is just her thing.
5.0	This Born Free Nipples are great the bottles too, I a being using born free bottles since my baby born.<br />easy to clean,<br />The price is cheaper than store. Also fast shipping.
5.0	Who would have ever in a million year thought we would be jumping on the opportunity to suck our kiddies buggies out their nose!?! This little invention works WONDERS. If anyone is like me, you are going to feel completely creeped out by the idea of this. It took a friend of mine to buy one and say to me, YOU HAVE TO GET IT, for me to even consider the idea. Let's face it, the only aspirators that slightly work are the ones that you come home from the hospital with. How many of us lose those in a matter of weeks or months?! Then you go to the store purchasing bulb after bulb, trying to find one that can even compare to the one you brought home from the hospital.<br /><br />Forget the aspirator bulbs and skip right over to this genius invention. You stick the little tube with the bulb on the end in their little nostril and from the other tube you begin to suck, you will be AMAZED at how much comes out. As well as, how much better your child can breathe after. DO NOT WORRY about getting anything in your mouth!! Everything goes straight into the jar and does not come out. I would recommenced this to any mom. Also, this would be an AMAZING REGISTRY item or gift for any new moms!! People do not understand how much easier this makes things. I cannot express my gratitude enough, for being able to receive this at a discounted price in return for my honest review.
5.0	I was in an accident this morning in which I hit a tree with the side of my van and then spun 270 degrees.  My toddler son, who was rear-facing in this seat, wasn't even shaken - though I think the van is totaled.  I will be ordering the exact same thing to replace that seat, now that it's been in an accident.
5.0	Responsible for store and very good quality products
5.0	I love this swing.  I take it with me from room to room.  The baby loves the music and lights and likes the 2 toys hanging from the top too.  We take it with us when we do a day or weekend trip and like how it can go on a tabletop, etc. in case it needs be higher to protect baby from animals or other kids.  My baby likes it so much I can take an entire shower while he waits for me near the tub.  Now that he's 8 months old he's now outgrowing it.  He can lean forward &amp; I worry that he'll fall out.  I only use it when I need to put him down in the bathroom for a minute or two and I'm right there to keep him safe.  This swing is definately a keeper!
5.0	Love these cups! They are genius! I bought one at target because I was curious how it worked. My daughter is 15 months and loves them. Also with the sippy cups she figured out how to flip them upside down and push the spout against the table until it would spill out everywhere.  They do leak occasionally if they are thrown but nothing is truly leak proof. All and all great product. I've since replaced all our sippy cups with these.
5.0	Great concept for sippy cups.  My son loves them.
5.0	I did a lot of research into what others said, and compared price points.  I've had this now for several months, and I'm very happy with it.  The range seems good, and the picture sound quality are great.  The night vision allows us to see her move, even in complete darkness.  We've been able to go outside by the pool, or in the hot tub, and be able to see and hear her in the room.<br /><br />I was a bit concerned about the possible quality given the price point.  However, the quality and durability of this are just fine.  I would say, that if the handset dropped, I would be concerned about how well it might hold up.<br /><br />Anyhow, one of my better purchases, and certainly worth the $100!
5.0	This was a gift for my 9 yr old granddaughter. She loves it. Dainty, colorful and has lots of movment. Not just for the nursery.
5.0	We are really pleased with this bank, the colors are very bright and it looks to be a great product!      This is a perfect way to show your little one the importance of saving money and the monkey is super cute, definitely a nice change from the typical piggy bank.
5.0	This is one of my favorite toddler products. It's compact and portable.  It's easy to set up and clean up. I don't understand why some reviewers said they are not sturdy. The legs have to be snapped in (and they snap in easily). This has made traveling so much less stressful! My toddler has also used it when the bathrooms at the parks were closed or too dirty. And she thinks using this potty is a novelty and will say she needs to use the potty just so she can sit on it.  I highly recommend it!
5.0	Easy to use and works great. Very handy when your infant gets sick. I had to buy two, one for our downstairs and the other one for the upstairs to prevent from losing one.
5.0	I am terrible about keeping my car organized, I'm always in a hurry and end up just throwing random things in my car. I was so happy to receive this as part of a promotion. It is very sturdy and holds a lot of stuff! The pockets are large and hold quite a bit. We have diapers, wipes, clothes, snacks, and my one year olds toys in it. It has made my car much cleaner, my life much easier because I am not constantly throwing supplies in my car. The quality of the organizer is impressive. I am so pleased that I plan to order an organizer for the babysitter's car too! A must have for traveling families!
5.0	Are excellent product, are very easy to use, and ecologic
5.0	We use these daily for our daughter's diaper changes. They're great as a mobile changing pad and in her pack n play. Nice and soft too.
5.0	Love this! It's been great for my newborn to hear the different song, heartbeat, ocean, etc. The projector is so cute too and catches my son's eye during our night nursing times. I would recommend this to any parent. Update: 2 years of using this and still going strong! Love it!
5.0	We have the travel lite crib for our baby. Amazon is the only place that has the sheet online and it a great price. I was never able to find it a brick and mortat store.
5.0	Son loves this very soft
5.0	I had to replace my original ones after about a year cuz they had stains I couldn't get off so I felt they were not clean , I actually like these better than the cream colored ones
5.0	This is a great product!! My baby loves it and sleeps sung as a bug in it!! Great purchase, now I just need a second for when it needs washed!!
5.0	My son loves this thing and never seems to get bored of it!
5.0	I love this diaper! It is soft on the inside for baby's bum and the snaps allow the perfect size adjustments. The liners are nice and big and still fluffy after several washes.<br />No leaks. No problems. And it is cute. Why pay twice the price when this one is afforable, reliable, and adorable? Yup, recommend.
5.0	Love these!  We used the Gdiapers liners first, these are so much softer and fit better.  After reading that people reuse them, we started to if he only urinated.  We just leave them out to dry and reuse after every other diaper.  We have done that for a month and still no diaper rash (also use Grovia Magic stick).
5.0	We have always been familiar with the Vanilla Soothie pacifiers as they are given out by the hospital we delivered at. We used them with our first child back in 2006 and have continued the tradition with our more recent arrival. Our kids have NOT liked any other pacifiers and were extremely fickle as to which one they take, but the Soothies have never failed us.<br /><br />I have never had one of the pacifiers degrade in any way. Generally we toss them long before that point (shortly after the Vanilla scent goes away), so we can definitely attest to the durability of the pacifiers. Completely worth every penny spent!
5.0	This makes traveling so easy!  You can fit lots of stuff in the seat in the bag, so it also saves some money on luggage.
5.0	I do not know what I would do with out this.  We had to buy another one for my husband as well when we started giving the baby baths.  I LOVE it and would recommend it to anybody.
5.0	Great quality & easy to put together.
5.0	The baby loved this rattle. She loved loved looking at it and playing with it. I would recommend this product.
5.0	This was a birthday present for my 1 year old.  Shapes fit easily into elephant body, and he likes to watch them come out the trunk when I press on the ears.  Sometimes he just sticks them back in the trunk too :) All the shapes stack together (see the amazon picture- the pink and orange shapes are connected), so that is added fun time too as he tries to fit them together.
5.0	Sent to my neice for her newborn, she loved it.
5.0	Love the high chair.  Work's great for our daughter.  She loves it.  Money well spent.
5.0	Love this product! Very happy with quality and pattern
5.0	I love this product. My children were premature, and I didn't want to purchase the preemie size. This worked perfectly until they got too long for it. I purchased two when they were about 6 weeks old and it lasted probably another six to eight weeks. I chose to purchase especially because they were both skilled at getting their arms out of a blanket swaddle (and believe me they weren't loose) and grabbing their oxygen cords. These sacks worked great, and about the time they quit using these the cords were gone. I reccomend this overall, but especially for preemies. Our hospital had a ton of these in the NICU, they are warm and help the tiny ones keep all the body heat in.
5.0	I got this for my daughter in law and she loves it!
5.0	This mobile is exactly what we were looking for. It fits perfect in our pack and play. And I also use it on our nap nanny. Our daughter loves it.
5.0	Our baby LOVES this pony!!
5.0	Love this cover! Has so many places for toys and such and I've received so many compliments
5.0	Love it! Has lots of pockets and space inside and the outside looks like a very stylish purse.  I highly recommend this diaper bag
5.0	We've only used this a couple times since it was delivered yesterday. Simple to put together and sturdy! My little one loves it because he can sit up and eat. So far so good. We have it set up as a high chair not on a chair, but I'm sure it's great either way.
5.0	This is perfect transition cup if your baby is using the natural AVent bottles.  The cup is similar and shape and the nipple is soft not hard like most of the trainer cups.  I love this product.
5.0	Very soft with plenty of room.
5.0	I just wish it had a feature to sense movement.  And look further down...  When I have it sitting next to my LO, I have to prop it up to look at him at an angle.
5.0	We received this item tonight to go in our baby boys nursery. It was the perfect price because I wasn't about to spend more the $150 for a glider. The color I chose was white with beige. The color of the padding was a tad lighter then the image but I actually like it better! It was super easy to put together and so far looks amazing!! It rocks smooths and the ottoman is great! For the people complaining of the cheap wood and getting dirty, it's kinda common sense. It is a microfiber so of course it will show stains, but people should be cleaner. And it's only $115? It's not some $600 chair- it isn't going to be the best material out there but for the price I think it looks awesome already!!! I would recommend it to anyone on a budget, and not wanting to spend a lot on a chair! So I give it 5 stars and buy it!!
5.0	We made this purchase for our first baby, who is due in about three & a half months. We wanted to get a video monitor for our own peace of mind, but didn't want to spend too much. This baby monitor was super easy to set up. We played around with it once it arrived to see how it worked, and so far, we have no complaints. The picture is very clear and there was no static or interference. Our house is 2000+ square feet and I was able to get a clear picture everywhere I went. I'm happy with my purchase so far, especially given what a great value this was!
5.0	"As is common in these free-thinking, immoral days an unwed single mother left her unwanted child on my doorstep. At first I tried to phone social services they called me a racist homophobe and hung up. The police were similarly unhelpful. What was I to do? My wife suggested drowning him, but the council forces us to sort our rubbish at gunpoint, and which recycling bag do babies go in? It was clearly not the answer.<br /><br />Several times I tried leaving him at the local park, but no-one would take him - not even the strange homeless man with the 'Jesus is Love' sandwich board. It looked like we were doomed to a life or depressing parental drudgery.<br /><br />Then we discovered the 3ct Diamond Pacifier. At first we were skeptical - diamonds are mined in the third world, where poor people live! But we did notice it is pleasingly shiny and pacifier-shaped. Anyway, for less than the price of buying up the whole planet's nuclear weapons, we were rid of our problem! We simply popped it in his mouth and left him in what the proletariat call a \\""shopping mall\\"". He was gone in seconds!<br /><br />Thank you! If only all of life's problems could be solved by buying a $17,000 diamond pacifier. Unfortunately only most of them can."
5.0	Handy and easy to use.
5.0	06/10/2016 update: this is my Regalo Gate Number 4. I love this product, easy to set up, easy to work, and finally allows me to control the access to the house for the four dogs when I need to.  I got two more coming. Thanks<br />Product as described.  Easy set up in doorway.  Easy in and out gate latch system. Now I can keep my trading room and  computers at a good ventilation rate and the 4 dogs aren't walking in and out all day!  Did the trick.
5.0	All three of my children have used these since they were each about 2 months old (I would pin them to their p.j.'s so it couldn't go over their faces but they could still feel it and become attached).  They are the perfect size and are so soft!  They have endured lots of washings and are still in great shape.  The best part--each child has a unique lovey so they all know which one belongs to who (blue lamb, pink bunny, and green butterfly).  I have a few spares for each of them that we rotate to prevent major wear and tear, but even the oldest ones (3 1/2 years) are still soft and completely in one piece!  Just finished ordering the yellow duck for baby #4 who's on the way!
5.0	So cute!  Pages are crinkly in texture and the baby loves it.
5.0	I love this little kit.  I use it everyday and it is holding its shape quite nicely.  Since I make my own baby food I can use this to put her meals for the day in when we are out and about, which is a lot, she usually has lunch on the run.  It comes will six 8oz? containers and a perfect sized ice pack.  It also fits perfectly in the bottom of my Skip Hop diaper bag.
5.0	Although it says it takes 3 months, I've only been using them three weeks and already can notice a difference! I wish I would have ordered years ago, instead of worrying about what shirt I could wear with what bra.
5.0	I'm very like it!Hope bb like it,too!It's color is not dark,so it's not so hot in summer!why is that not explaining in Chinese ?
5.0	This is the best baby mirror!  It is really sturdy and easy to install.  My baby seat is in the middle of the backseat so it does cover the view of the back window some, but I'd rather see my baby!
5.0	This bag met the expectations I had: great quality, very spacious and it is so stylish it doesn't even look like a diaper bag, I am sure I'm going to use it a lot in the future too.
5.0	My baby is now two weeks old and we are definitely using our Boppy pillow since we were still int he hospital.   Great for breast and bottle feeding.   I use it whenever the baby is hungry, it helps in different breast-feeding positions. And daddy uses it too when feeding from the bottle.   Very comfortable and the sports design is very fun and colorful.  I would really recommend this product to other moms!
5.0	Excellent Product. Excellent Quality. Perfect for every day and easy to use. Do not failed. It was just what i wanted.
5.0	Ordered this one (and another one from the same company) and I have to say I LOVE THEM!  My little guy Mortimer has been having just the most terrible time cutting teeth (he has two!) and it got so bad that even watching me go to the freezer to get those frozen towelettes for him to chew on has gotten him to cry.<br /><br />But I started playing with the necklace with him right before he had any pain, and then when he started fussing, I let him play and mouth part of it and .... WOW... he was actually so engrossed in playing with it and using it to soothe himself that he calmed himself.<br /><br />I'm going to order two more -- one for my bestie and one for a shower I'm going to in a few weeks!
5.0	This booster is amazing! It is light as a feather, easy to transport,  easy to insert into car's clips, and can be removed with one quick yank of a strap. Small enough to be thrown into the trunk without a hassle. It takes me 5 seconds to insert or remove from the car. It is reassuring to know the lock stabilizes the seat and keeps it from moving or sliding. You feel that the car seat belt can operate the way it is intended without the booster sliding or seat belt getting tangled in the hook many boosters have. But your kids must be old enough for the seat belt to rest comfortably across their shoulder without a seat belt guide hook.
5.0	super cute and fuctional.do wish the bag was a bit bigger but then again it could be me having too many things to carry.
5.0	These pills actually works.
5.0	I was delighted to see the relatively compact box, and how compact the nearly fully assembled stroller folds.  Despite the svelte folded size (and light weight), it grows to be a full sized stroller.  The only compromise is that the various fabric bits do add a bit of bulk, but that's hardly an issue.<br /><br />The controls are very intuitive and functional, specifically the way the wheels lock together and how easy it is to reverse the seat.  The build quality also is apparent throughout.  It's even almost comfortable (well not really, but better than most) on my 6' 7&#34; frame.
5.0	I have been using these bibs for over a month now.  They catch everything my 10 mo old misses when feeding herself.  When her try is empty, she reaches in the bib pocket for the left overs, HA!  I especially love the clasp design.  It isn't a snap, velcro or magnetic but something more ingenious.  These bibs wash well by hand and we have even thrown them in the top of the dishwasher.
5.0	Let me start out by telling you that i bought the whole Kahlini collection and I was skeptical because of the bad reviews that said it was cheaply made. I am so impressed at how well it is actually made. The only thing I will say that may be negative is that the bottom of the drawers aren't thicker then about a half-inch, but they seem to be pretty sturdy. And the sides of the drawers are pine wood, but most dressers have that on the inside. The back is made of the same material, not very thick, but its the back so im not worried about it. I am not made of money especially with a little one coming, and we didnt have the money to buy a collection at a store, but I am so happy with this purchase, its going to last us a very long time! I hope this helps you out.
5.0	Work fine, and fairly easy to install, once you get the hang of it. Great price, and shipped to my door in two days.
5.0	Bought an extra for our trip to the States for Christmas. This is a very sturdy brush and cleans all the parts thoroughly
5.0	I bought this toy for my grandbaby. It makes for a great toy to clip to crib, stoller and other baby items. It has been easy to clean. Baby first loved the shiny mirror and then used the toy for teething. After much research I am glad I purchased this toy for baby. I highly recommend it.
5.0	My five month old grandson was not happy with spending &#34;tummy time&#34;: during the day, so my daughter decided a mirror might help him.  I found this one at Christmas and decided to give it a try.  He LOVES it!  So far, he really has not paid attention much to the baby in the mirror, but the little toys on it have him fascinated and he enjoys being on his tummy.  It was the hit of his gifts for his first Christmas.
5.0	These little earphones worked exactly as we hoped they would.  They are a little large for our three month old, but they still fit securely over his ears and allows for room to grow.  We used these at a motorcycle track day and right under fireworks on the 4th of July.  The baby quietly slept through both events and had no idea of all the noise around him!  I would definitely recommend these.
5.0	A must item for newborn. I recommend every newborn families to buy this special and sweet product from Fisher Price which babies will surely love playing with it...
5.0	We did my son's nursery in a jungle/Noah's Ark theme and this was an affordable, cute lamp that fit in perfectly! This is a well made product that you receive for the money. The lampshade is absolutely darling to boot :) We love it!
5.0	I love this new sunglasses case.  It's sturdy enough to protect them in my bag, has a clip to attach it to keep it handy and comes in a pretty print.  My glasses fit inside with no problem (I do not wear huge glasses).
5.0	My newborn son has taken some good, long naps on my chest in this wrap. I used a moby with my first and it was great, but now that I have a toddler and need to get the newborn wrapped quickly and without incident, the ktan works better this time around.
5.0	Super fast delivery.  I got it before than expected delivery date.  Besides that this is an awesome buy. Supper fluffy.  Baby looks like a true bear :D so cute and innocent.  I love the fact its a like bit larger than the size it states. I bought a 3-6 months because it gives you the space for layering.  I live in Florida so this is the perfect material for cold nights. Its not heavy that will suffocate him specially here that doesn't get that cold just windy.  Love it.
5.0	The preppy plaid color is awesome. It is so bright and cheery! This liner is the size of a standard diaper pail or trash can and can hold many cloth diapers. I do not notice any odors when using both our bags, but I also wash diapers frequently. Well worth the purchase. Washes well (but I found that it needs to be dried on both sides, because it is so waterproof!).<br /><br />Will be a great laundry or storage bag later.
5.0	So happy with this convertible car seat!<br />Super easy to install & so cozy. We normally go with Orbit Baby but I wanted to try the Maxi Cosi based on all the recommendations I have gotten. Very happy with my purchase.<br /><br />I like the adjustable head rest. Just squeeze the handle on the back, so no more having to remove the outer lining & re-thred the straps. My 8 month old seems to like it. He never seems to be overheated in this seat.<br /><br />Also, very easy to recline with just another squeeze of a handle.
5.0	Great price for a wonderful package. My babies love mam bottles and pacifiers!
5.0	I have used this for 3 weeks now and love it....I don't detect any odors and it's so easy to use!  We use our own garbage bags.  I bought a second one for downstairs, as we live in a two-story home.
5.0	I needed a thermos to fit inside a My Little Pony metal lunch box for a 7 yr old.  This one works.  You can put it in the dishwasher. If you heat some  water  in a microwave and pour it into the thermos to heat the thermos a bit, the food you put into the thermos will stay warm until noon.
5.0	Exactly as described, love the color,  low profile shape fits easily in babies room. Love this diaper pail, would definetly recommend.
5.0	My babyl oves it alot. He always playes with it n it has so many nice music that even i love to listen to them happy to bought it.
5.0	I never liked my diaper bag and when I pregnant with my 3rd baby, my mother in law offered to buy me one I liked. I researched for months and I got the red star one. My baby turns one next month and it has been the Best Diaper Bag Ever! Best sized pockets for everything. Easy access to wipes, light interior, magnetic claps, and 2 little zipper pockets for my mom things. Tall enough for my older girls' sticker /coloring books. Wipe able leather bottom-awesome. 3 ways to carry and super comfy back pack straps.
5.0	This kind of bib worked so well for us a few years ago that we hunted them down to get a fresh set for our new baby.  The material in the front is really good at keeping food off, and he doesn't have a problem with this bib going around his neck like he dislikes with a few other kinds of bibs.  It cleans very easily because it unsnaps to be completely flat (and if the food has dried onto the bib, just soak it for a little while), and it's easy to store because it's so flexible - just fold it up!  We bought a set of three of these and use them every day, one for each of our baby's meals.    We bought a new set because the previous ones had cracked and become useless after 2-3 years of regular use.  But how many bibs last that long?  None of our other ones came even close to that.  The only thing I wish were different about this bib is that the back material is different from the front and stains much more easily.  This wouldn't be nearly so much of a problem if the back material weren't exposed as the front of the pocket because of the way it snaps together.  However, that is only a slight cosmetic problem to a rugged and high-quality product.
5.0	After searching forever for a double stroller that would work best for our family I found the Joovy.  I bought a used Caboose from someone and purchased this seat to add.  It works great!  It was pretty straight forward on how to put it on the stroller.  Some snaps were difficult to snap but it is very sturdy and secure.
5.0	The bibs are crafted and stitched very well and the team colors are on the money
5.0	Awesome! Works! My son is 4 months & fits perfect with room to grow.
5.0	Very happy with this product. Fits perfectly!
5.0	Excelent item. My youngest son was a little sad cause by lost of previuous t-shirt. This new one fit it as a glove and is happy again. Quality is top.
5.0	I bought this for my  new little grandson for Christmas this past year. My daughter loves it. I bought two and he's almost ready for the next size. Keeps him safe and warm. Easy to get him into even if he's already sleeping. Wonderful product!
5.0	Baby wearing is pretty popular these days. Not only is it a great way to bond with your little one, but it's a lot easier on your back if you are holding your little one the proper way. I got this in blue and it's a lovely, deep blue color, made of a strong, breathable mesh and has strong silver rings to hold everything in place. Wear this sling high for infants and babies, and you can wear it at hip level for older babies and toddlers. Jut in case you are new to baby slings, there's a pretty big patch sewn inside the sling with some information on baby wearing using the sling as well as photos of ways to wear and not to wear it. This really comes in handy, not only while you are out with your little one, but if you have a kiddo that needs to be held a lot, this makes it a lot easier to get housework done or meals made while still keeping them close. Received this item in exchange for my honest review.
5.0	This is a great running chair for my daughter who is handicapped.  It pushes nicely, is steady and the handbrake is useful for downhill purposes.  The basket underneath is useful for carrying her oxygen and for throwing extra shirts in when running in cold weather.  I recommend this stroller for anyone who jogs and has a child they want to run with.
5.0	Love this car seat. I have no other to compare it to, since it's for my first baby but since I bought it, I've met many other moms who bought the same one. It's easy to use, easy to clean and my baby is comfortable in it. No complaints!
5.0	I began using this pump after my double electric Aveda Purely  Yours pump DIED after only 9 months of daily use.  I was shocked at how good Avent Isis's suction is, and at how easy it is to use and control the flow. The nipple stimulator is the key part...and with a short bit of practice, the let-down reflex is easily reproduceable and the suction is far better than the Aveda pump's ever was.  Also, it's MUCH easier to simulate the way your baby feeds by using your own hand. I found the suction-rate dials on the electric pump to be useless.  The ISIS pump works so well, once it felt like milk was being pulled out of my back! And it doesn't hurt like the electric pumps do. TRY THIS FIRST before spending your hard earned money on the electric pumps.
5.0	This product was above my expectations . They fit like I expected the material  is great.i will recommend that everyone buy them.
5.0	My 7 month old loves these! Especially while she's teething, she loves them in the tub, and then we take them on the go to use as teethers (:
5.0	This lock is AMAZING! My daughter loves the fridge. You can't keep her out. We had to...to save the eggs. lol. I was very discouraged to buy a lock because a lot of them are crap and break and the rest are just too!! hard to open and need more than 1 hand.<br />This lock is wonderful. It took a whole 30 seconds to put on the fridge. I use the same hand to unlock the fridge while opening it and my daughter can't budge it. We put it all the way at the top so she won't be able to reach it for a while, too. This lock is the #1 I have ever owned or seen. I 100% recommend this fridge lock for any strength kids and no matter how clever they may be.
5.0	Love this monitor! I did a lot of research online before buying the monitor. We are very happy with it. I was most impressed with how clear the pictures are even at night when the room is completely dark. The customer supports after sale was excellent too.
5.0	It helps us to get our newborn baby to sleep next to us on the bed, and we feel safe for him.<br />We see how it will be specially useful when the mom recovers and start to do housework, or even simply set outside the bedroom and have the baby to be in safe proximity.<br />The carrycot itself is sturdy and the fabric are very nice. We like its color too.
5.0	Perfect. Packaging well done
5.0	Love the grass for drying dishes.  This twig is great for nipples and lids.  Plus it's just plain fun.
5.0	Great colors and have lasted through several washes. I'll be giving these away soon as my baby has outgrown the, and the tend to shrink a bit in the dryer...which I expected, they are a great alternative to crib shoes though!
5.0	These bibs are as good as it kits for babies who are nursing or taking a bottle. The extra ring around the neck prevents milk from getting down into those pesky yet adorable baby neck rolls and the absorbancy is stupendous. The velcro is very strong so no concern with it coming undone. I would recommend this to any parts looking for a burp cloth and bib in one. Great product.
5.0	Always necessary in my home. My baby bites the heck out of them and I have to replace them after a few. For the price, I think they are worth every penny.
5.0	My daughter is in love with these she won't use any other type of pacifier (she's only 3 months) and we've been using these since she was about 2 weeks. Also the handles glow in the dark which is super great for rolling over when she drops it and being able to see it in the dark.
5.0	We were hesitant to buy this tub because it just doesn't look as cushie as others on the market but thought the contours might be good for supporting my twin sons.  We were so right. We used it from their very first bath and finally retired it when they were one and started playing and bathing in a full size tub.  Everyone who helped me with my boys during the first few months said that this was the best tub they have ever seen or used and that comes from several people who are full time doulas, nannies, and other sitters.  It works well on the kitchen counter as it has a drain that makes it easy and neat to empty into the sink. While, large it fit in my narrowest bath tub just fine.  The bottom line was how well it supported my twin sons allowing me to give them a good wash with two hands and for them to feel secure.
5.0	Love the color and hope the mother to be likes it as well.
5.0	This crib sheet is a nice quality, and the print is so bright and gorgeous.  Sure to be a visual pleaser for a small infant.<br /><br />In addition, they will match perfectly with the other Zutano Owl items we ordered for the baby. 100% pleased. RECOMMENDED
5.0	My grandchildren love it!  Very soothing!
5.0	Works great for nipples and other small bottle parts. Of course you need the Boon drying rack first to fully appreciate the handiness :)
5.0	Solid and easy to put up. (Use the plastic mounts that they indicate are optional. They're not really optional unless you want to make it more difficult to put up.)<br /><br />To open the gate you need to open the latch and lift the gate. This is a bit difficult with one hand but allows the gate to work in two modes. You can leave the latch open and just open/close the gate by lifting it. This makes it very simple to open and close. Most dogs still couldn't open it but most kids could. For extra security you need to close the latch.<br /><br />The gate only swings in one direction.
5.0	I searched for weeks for a stroller that was lightweight and easier to travel with than my BOB. This one passed all my criteria ( except the shade could be longer). I have used it a ton and had smiley in town so our cousins have used it to. We are so happy with it and all of our Graco products. I did by the summer infant attachable sun shade for sunny days ($15). I was happier doing that and it prevented me from spending hundreds more for just a larger sun shade. Great product! I love the recliner seat and one handled breakdown feature. I have a very mobile 7 month old so it has been a great feature.
5.0	This car seat bag worked great for us. Easy to carry, easy to load, and easy to store when not in use - we also shoved some stuffed animals and blankets in it for the trip both ways and were able to get more use out of it - airline didn't mind.
5.0	I really like it,we put our baby on this to wash him before to put him in the bathtub.
5.0	Great Product! A Traveling must.... BUT the airport personnel on the first use beat the crap out of them by throwing them around... We bought 2
5.0	I purchased this stroller because of the price and the maximum weight limit (55 Ibs).  It is a great stroller for the money you spend and my kids love it!  It was so easy to put together and it folds so easily as well.  I love that the handles are tall, so I don't kick the back wheels when I'm pushing it.  I would recommend this stroller to anyone thinking about purchasing a light weight, yet very well put together stroller.<br />I also wanted to mention that I purchased the stroller on the 29th of January and they told me it would ship out on the 30th or 31st and arrive at my house between the 4th and 7th of February.  It was shipped on the 30th and I got it today, the 1st of February.  Wonderful, fast service!!!!!
5.0	This was more adorable than I had expected.  Very good quality I would buy this brand again.
5.0	Great for the price. Very soft. I expected the material to be stiff/cheap for the price, but it's not at all. The comforter is larger than most toddler bed comforters. Great buy though!
5.0	Perfect amount of light!! I've been using this light for a few months now and find it extremely helpful. Before I had this light, I was using my iPhone for light, which was way to bright for me & the baby. This nursing light, is just the right amount of light, not too bright. It helps me keep from having to use my phone or turn on the bedroom lights when I nurse (or check on the baby). It's great for travel too. I used this while visiting family and it worked out perfect! I didn't have to search for a light when nursing & wake up everyone. I love that it is small, clips on & overall just convenient. I've now added it to my list of favorite things that I give to my friends/family that are expecting!
5.0	Love these swaddle blankets.  I order them for all my friends who are expecting.  By far the softest swaddle blankets I have ever felt!
5.0	Absolutely love it!! My daughter is 11 months old ...weighs 20 pounds and fits perfectly...wished I would of purchased this when she was a couple of months younger...but...overall it's beautifully made...and...so soft
5.0	I love, love, love this item.  I have had it for about a year and it has been a lifesaver, especially when we sleep away from home and it would normally be near impossible to get my two year old to go to bed.  It gives him a little peice of home to make him feel comfortable and it helps to block out any noise going on outside the bedroom.  I don't think my husband and I would be able to watch movies after our son is sleeping without this because he is the type of child who absolutely will not sleep if he thinks there is something going on without him.  It's great.  There are so many sounds and combinations to choose from.  the sounds are clear, soothing, and they get loud enough to mask outside noise.  I love it so much, I'm going to get one for my room!
5.0	Perfect little pillow for our little guy. He loves it and sleeps on it or in his arms every night.
5.0	I have done a lot of research before purchasing one of these monitors.  I ultimately went with the WiFi Baby 2.0 cam.  Right out of the box, and I'm okay with computers and networking but far from an expert, I was able to get everything up and running for in home connection.  The only issues I had was connecting outside my network.  I emailed Gary at wifi baby and in the same day was responded to and called.  We screen shared and he then walked me through how to correctly set outside network connection.  Took less than 10 minutes and everything was done.  I then called my mother in a different state and was able to walk her through the process of connecting through the internet and she was able to connect with no problem.  I highly recommend this product for the ease of use and the AMAZING customer service I received from this company and from reading other reviews I am definitely not the only person to get this customer service.  Gary thank you so much and I will absolutely tell anyone looking for a baby monitor system to look into this product and buy it.
5.0	I love it. It works great with the other camera I have.  Would highly recommend.  It's easy to set up too.
5.0	We have 3 kids, ages 5, 3, and 1.  We have 2 cars and 2 grandmas, each with their own car, who drive the kids around.  What I'm trying to say is that in 5 years I've bought a lot of car seats.<br /><br />I've had products from several of Britax's competitors, some of them were ok, and some of them were garbage, but at this point ever car seat I'll ever buy going forward will be a Britax.<br /><br />The Frontier 85 continues the same level of engineering and quality that I've experienced with all of the other Britax seats we've had.  The owners manual is thoughtfully tethered to the seat and stored under the seat pad, the LATCH connectors can be stowed away when the seat is in a non-LATCH equipped position, moving from one LATCH position to another is a breeze, and the kids love how comfortable the seat is and how they have their own personal cup holders.<br /><br />Depending on how your the seats in your vehicle are configured, the straps may rub in the rear requiring a little extra effort when tightening the harness, and when using it with a standard shoulder belt in a non-LATCH equipped position, threading the seat belt behind the seat is not as easy as it is on say, the Roundabout or Marathon, but it's still easier than other brands (I'm looking at you Cosco).<br /><br />My favorite part of the seat is the way the head rest and harness adjust for a growing preschooler/grade school child - you simply lift up a lever in the rear, slide the head rest up into the new position, and lock the lever back down.  The harness moves along with the headrest - no more rethreading the harness straps through predefined openings in the seat back.  There are at least 7 or 8 lock positions (off the top of my head) to allow for very gradual adjustments over time (as opposed to other seats which may only have 3 or 4 shoulder strap positions).
5.0	Bought the product from amazon and this car seat is still serving its purpose. This car seat is best in breed and class compared to other similar class car seats.<br /><br />So far so good, no complaints. Ou thing was FedEx faked my delivery on that day but I had to call FedEx like 20 times for them to deliver my product on the same day noon.
5.0	this is a must have if your infant uses a pacifier and you don't care to spend countless minutes furiously searching for it while they are screaming their head off or trying to fall asleep.  we love it so much we have two, and i'm not even sure why because i never let this out of my sight.  it attaches to any pacifier btw, even the ones that are breastfeeding friendly.  this would make a great shower gift too. i wish i had thought of this, from the profits i could be putting my kids through college.
5.0	Love the plushness of this changing pad.  Carters makes the best changing pads.  These hold up really well in the wash; they keep their softness and their shape & the stains always come off.
5.0	It's perfect for the price... I antiqued it w a small brush and painted the candle holders black to give it more of a French chic look.  It's darling
5.0	This is the first review I have ever written but this monitor is so incredible I had to post one!  My husband and I bought this monitor since we are expecting our second child.  We had the summer handheld infant monitor with one camera previously.  The quality on the summer picture was satisfactory and there was always static on the monitor. The static would literally keep us up some nights. We grew to expect that was standard with video monitors so when it was time to get one with two cameras, we bought the summer infant sleek and secure multiview handheld monitor.  We returned it immediately!  The picture was horrible..we could barely see our daughter on it.     We bought this two camera system instead and are THRILLED we did!  The quality on the picture is wonderful compared to the summer models and there is NO STATIC! We can see our daughter clearly and the night vision on it is incredible.  I heard people mentioned the night vision light in other reviews but you cannot see it.  There are also great options on the monitor to move the picture, put the time/date on it, etc.  The only time we hear our daughter is when we are supposed to.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND- you will not regret it!!    On top of it, the customer service (we dealt with Tammy) at Safe Baby was beyond our expectations. Not only do we feel we made a great purchase with this camera but it is wonderful to deal with a company that stands behind their product and puts their customers needs first.  We are beyond thrilled with this purchase and will recommend to all our friends with children!!!
5.0	We bought this b/c it was one of the least expensive- but you would NOT know it based on ease of use and style. My friend has five in her home, and we are purchasing our second. The extensions are easy to attach. My son is cruising, and he can pull himself up on this gate without a wobble. I would recommend it to anyone.
5.0	These are one of the best things ever invented~ they go up super easy and come off the same way. They don't ruin your walls and have a big impact on a room! We bought 2 cans and did my son's room and daughter's bathroom. The colors are great and there are a good variety of sizes of dots in each can. Great product!
5.0	this is the cutest pacifier i have seen yet...my granddaughter just loves all the  critters they come in... She has most of them, Levi Lion was a gift to  another new baby and was well recieved...thank you..
5.0	I was looking for a metal gate that swung open. The other thing I needed was one that would fit an opening of 43.5 inches. A lot of the gates I looked at can't with extenders that were set widths. This one sided to extend and then locks into the place you want it. I am very happy with this. Though the gate I got is black not matte bronze.
5.0	We bought this product because were potty training our daughter, and we didn't want to have to worry about cleaning the carseat all the time. She hasn't had a potty accident in it yet but she did get sick on the road one day and threw up in her seat. It was a mess we thought we had to clean the whole chair but when we stopped the car and took her out, the only thing we had to do to clean the seat was removed the piddlepad! It absobed everything and kept ti from getting in all the creases of the carseat.
5.0	After a lot of research ,I ordered this  stroller because of the good reviews. It has a lot of great features ,big canopy,great recline ,easy to open and close,front bar ( my grandson loves to hold on  to it)flexible  so stroller can be closed with it on. The wheels handle well on rough ,bumpy surfaces and suspension is good to keep the ride comfortable for the baby. Very well made!!!
5.0	My favorite nursing pads!!!! They are so soft! They absorb a crazy amount of leakage. Not bulky! They fit well in my nursing tanks and bras! Love the bag for easy washing!
5.0	Love love love our bamboo dream hope to get another soon it's technicallyy daughters but I love sleeping with it too
5.0	i've had several mats, and this is the best mat yet.  very durable, and stays in place.  i'm ordering one for my car too.
5.0	Got this on prime day for $19.99. Love it!
5.0	These flashcards help your baby's brain develop! I used something like this for all of my 6 children, from the moment they were born! My kids are all very smart, and it feels good to know that I did everything I could to help them learn and grow. I highly recommend using these flashcards to help your baby be as smart as they can. Infants love contrasts and faces, which is what these cards are. They came with a red plastic ring to keep them all together and they are very sturdy.
5.0	Excellent quality, safety and comfort.  Easy set up and breakdown for quick travel.
5.0	These are adorable.  Bought 6 of them for my daughters room, hanging from the ceiling they are just too cute.  Fishing line was already attached which made hanging them up so easy.  Wish the I-hooks it came with were white to blend in better with the ceiling but that is my only complaint.  Would recommend.
5.0	My 4 year old was having trouble keeping food on his plate and reaching his schoolwork at the dining room table.  I considered less expensive models than this, but am so glad I splurged on this one.  Easily cleaned and it stays in place on the wood dining room chair.  My son loves it.  He can now eat with less ending up on the floor (when he feels like it), but more importantly, he isn't frustrated when trying to reach his workbooks and school work.  Wish I'd had one of these as a kid!
5.0	Makes our lives so much easier!!
5.0	Never quite got around to using the wrap, but LOVE the carrier. I did a lot of research before purchasing and Boba had me sold. The full carrier is comfortable and baby loves it, the travel carrier is nice to throw in if you aren't sure you are going to need it - but want to have one with you just in case. Have fully enjoyed this product and am still using it at 9 months and 20+ pounds in the front carry.
5.0	We purchased this stroller with the intention of using it primarily in the woods.  We do not use it for jogging.  I like the ability to go from a fixed wheel to a swivel wheel.  It is nice and rugged and we have had no problems going over the rough terrain that our Graco Modes just could not handle.  My only complaint is that the cell phone holder seems to be for the iPhone as my Galaxy 4 is too big for the holder. A little inconvenient but it does fit inside of the parent storage area.
5.0	Excellent and easy to clean.  They've been used for three months and I see no wear, stains, or discoloration.  People have complained about the smell but it was gone in a day and not very strong.  This came with a free gift which was a set of cloth flowers which I hung up on my daughter's wall.
5.0	I know, I know, they're basically glorified ice cube trays, but these things are absolutely wonderful.  The rounded bottoms allow your purees to slide out with ease (no twisting or turning as with squared trays), and make for much easier handwashing (I prefer to handwash plastics - just a 'thing' of mine).  What I do is batch cook, freeze overnight, and then transfer to freezer bags the next day so I can clean the tray right away and have should I need it.  If you want the cubes out quickly and all at once, the easiest thing to do is leave the lid on, flip upside down, run under hot water for maybe 5-10 seconds, and then they'll flip right out when pushed down on.  In my experience, fruits tend to pop out WAY easier because of the sugar content than veggies do.  You can also just toss the tray on the counter for a few minutes.  3-5 minutes should do.  If you try pushing the cubes out straight from the freezer, you'll struggle, so just allow a few extra seconds/minutes - so much easier!  I'm a working mother who really wanted to make her own baby food and not deal with the hassle, and these seriously MAKE LIFE EASY.
5.0	I love this bag! It is gorgeous and it holds a ton. It is super light weight so you can really fill it up and it won't be too heavy. I love the 3 pockets in the front to hold smaller items so they won't get lost. The main pocket is really big so you can really stuff it told hold all of your larger items. This is one of my favorite JJB bags.
5.0	I can't say enough about this swaddle set. The patterns and color combos are so beautiful that's it's difficult to choose which one to order! They are very soft and also versatile because of the generous size. I've purchased a few other items from The Snug Bug and I'm always happy. Their products are very high-quality and well-made, and I love that they're made in the US. As with other Snug Bug products, this is also a great baby shower gift idea! Four high-quality swaddles for this price (and made in the US) is a great deal, too.
5.0	Both my son & daughter (8-month-old twins) love the 4 switcheroos on our exersaucer.  I replaced the original toys on the saucer and they both like it much better now - this is a huge help when you need a few Mommy minutes and can put one in the exersaucer and they'll stay there happy and entertained for a few more minutes.
5.0	I bought first the baby bjorn bibs and hated them, too harsh on my baby's neck. I decided to buy the OXO bibs and what a difference!! So gentle on my baby's neck. She loves them! The part that you tie on the neck is made of a washable fabric with Velcro, this made very easy to adjust the bib to the baby's neck. Is machine washable. The collecting basket of the bib is made of soft silicone very easy to wash and clean. I highly recommend this bib!!
5.0	Soft and lightweight, perfect for summer. It is bigger than I thought it would be, but not too big, so it's nice that he will be able to wear it for a long time.
5.0	Wish I had purchased these with the cup as straws can go missing easily. This is our favorite straw cup For 12 month old.
5.0	I purchased my bottle sling at [...] and it has been a great investment. It helps a lot when both babies start crying for their bottle and you are alone. I make sure that they take turns so that every other bottle the baby is held.
5.0	It's really soft and catches all my daughter's food. It's a cinch to clean!
5.0	This is in my daughter nursery Love it, I'm glad that I chose this theme because they have a lot items for it
5.0	Amazing Product. I tried a sample of this product for my nephew who is teething. He absolutely loves it.  The colours are stimulating for him and he tries to grab them all the time. Naturally, the first place they go to is his mouth and although I don't know his mum tells me this teether is really good because he can put it all the way to the back of his mouth, it has a chewy feel which is soothing for his gums.  Also he sometimes grabs 2 pieces and claps them together with his hands. His face when he is using the teether is just a sight to be seen and his mum seems even happier than him.  Apparently, there's something special about certain teethers and she tells me this teether has what it takes.  So it definitely does the job and it made a great gift. Seller has excellent communication and next time I need to buy a gift for a baby shower I know where to go. Happy buying people. :)
5.0	Daughter loved this. It is really cute, very soft. A good buy for the $10 we spent on it. Would be a cute gift for an expecting mom :)
5.0	Every new Mom should own one of these....great to have in each diaper changing room
5.0	Baby loves it and so do I
5.0	I own this thermometer and it works great.  It's accurate and reads my LO temperature fast, even when she is wiggling around.
5.0	Love this swing. I had the old model which lasted 5 years with my baby and 2 friends borrowing it before it broke.  So I bought the newer model which is this one.  Both my babies just love this swing. The lights and music mobile alone is with it. Swings great too. Your baby will be in awww over the lights :). Only complaint is the older model stayed on 24/7 swing and mobile if you had it in on position and the newer model the mobile stops after 20 minutes and swing stops after 4 hours.  I hate that!!!! My babies sleep in their swings so the fact it shuts off gets Annoying. But over all love love love this swing.  And now my 3rd baby that is using this swing loves it just as much as the other 2 did!!! I highly recommend this swing!
5.0	Bought this with the white plush cover, and it's been great so far. I like having the strap and deep sides. A few times I've needed it so that I could grab some back up wipes or diapers without worrying about being five steps away from a squirmy baby. The size is great too, and will get us up to potty training. I mean, as long as my kid doesn't suddenly reach Kaiju proportions.
5.0	This is an excellent and essential product to give as a gift to a new Mom. My niece loved it.
5.0	only had a few days but so far my 8mo old and i both love this.her 80 dollar high chair she couldnt sit upright in it it made her lean back she hated it no matter what i did.this she can sit up perfectly in.also its easier to move cause its on chair and she can sit closer to us at table.its light wieght and u can take it with you.also have more space now that i took down highchair !!! only thing is didnt explain well in instructions what and when to adjust height from 1-3.also there was a caution sticker in box but was all in spanish.other then that love it.if i can ill come back and add to this in a few months
1.0	I received this swing as a gift and it worked great for the first week we had it. After the first week the swing just stopped swinging.  I thought it was the batteries but replaced them and tested the old ones and they were fine. My daughter was only 12 pounds so that wasn't the problem either. I am now using it as a place for her to nap because I can't return it.
1.0	This toy is unsafe. The plastic can separate and pinch little ones.  Should be recalled.
1.0	Its only 39.99 at target
1.0	I have not been impressed with this product. Both the camera and the receiver are very bulky, but the biggest downside of this monitor is that the receiver does not have a rechargable battery.  We haven't used ours since the batteries ran out.  Of course it will work plugged into the wall and when in use the picture is pretty clear.  There is no night vision feature, which I am definitely looking for in my next monitor.  We also had a difficult time figuring out how to mount this on the wall at the foot of the crib.  This was a learning experience for me in what we really need in a monitor: rechargable battery, acceptable wall mount angle, and night vision.
1.0	The box was wet and tore up. I open it up and I found scratches on the wood. Not satisfied. 😒
1.0	Bought these for Gerber bottles that came with faster flowing nipples so I could replace and baby could use. They did not work they leaked so bad no matter how tight I put it. These sucked.
1.0	We bought these to use in our Cradle Roll Bible Class. They were used at best once a week. Now, 15 months later, they have inoperable. They have  broken, fabric torn, etc. I am very disappointed in their performance and will not be replacing them with this brand.
1.0	Unusable now - for $32 these should not fail so soon, but the cheap plastic can not withstand day to day cabinet opening.  Not just one but a two of these locks have now failed.  Thought about returning them but what a hassle.  Your money is probably best spent elsewhere.
1.0	I have been trying for 2 days now and I can't use this product. I have installed the software, filled in all my info and then it won't connect to the server. And it won't let you use it until you register. I've also been trying to contact the company, to no avail. Too bad, it seems like such a great idea.
1.0	I bought this car seat from a big box store when it had only been out about a month because it is half the weight of other seats. I've been using it for 9 months now. It is so small! I put it on the smallest setting before my baby was born, and when I got it to the hospital to take home my little guy in, he was already too big for the smallest setting. He was not a big newborn, 7lbs 7oz and 20 inches long. I though it was no big deal and maybe these went smaller than normal to accomidate premature babies. Well, that's not the case. My son is now 9 months old, and weighs a whopping 13 lbs (the size of most 4 month olds. He is tiny! not even on the growth chart) and is almost too tall for the tallest strap setting. This is insane! If you have an average size baby they will grow out of this in 4-6 months. Also, there is no plate on the back to catch the straps when they are loosened.(like Graco has. The one you have to take off to re-thread the straps when you need to adjust the size.) So if you loosen the straps to get the baby out, then move the car seat they drag on the floor. Then if you set it back down or in the base before putting the baby back in and tightening it, they get caught under the seat and you have to pick the seat back up to pull the straps in to the main part of the seat so it doesn't happen when you put it back down. I am really sad that I wasted my money on this car seat. It's a joke.
1.0	As others have mentioned the lid comes off easily.  This wasn't a problem the first two times but when I went to use it a third time, I couldn't get the lid to stay in place.  frustrating.  I was really excited about this product since I hated throwing out the disposables.  I am very disappointed.  The lid should be a screw on or have a clip to hold it in place, an easy solution that should have been thought of before putting it on the market.
1.0	Annoying and exhausting to read, unless you like barking
1.0	Zipper broke after two days
1.0	I bought these sheet for the DaVinci Annabelle mini crib and they are too small.  Luckily, I had another sheet that did fit that I'm currently using.
1.0	As a testament to how much I hate this monitor... I am an avid Amazon shopper and have never written a review before. I am so fed up with it, I had to vent! We did a TON of research before adding this to our baby registry. With the Samsung name, and decent reviews, we thought we were getting the most reliable option to monitor our baby. We were wrong:<br /><br />1. The device randomly goes out of range and I constantly have to re-pair it in the middle of the night. I am a sleep deprived first time mom, and let me tell you, there is nothing worse than waking up to the annoying out of range beeping sound halfway through my three hour window of sleep between feedings.<br /><br />2. The standard video mode no longer works and we now only have night vision.<br /><br />3. There are basically zero directions or troubleshooting answers to deal with these problems.<br /><br />4. I HATE the annoying music that plays when I turn the device on.  It's so loud, you can hear it throughout our three story home, thus waking baby up.<br /><br />5. VOX is hyper sensitive and turns on at the slightest noise. Thought I'd want that's a first time mom, but let me tell you, babies make little noises throughout the night. Desperate for sleep, I hate that our bedroom lights up every time my son makes the slightest peep.<br /><br />The worst part about this device is that it cost so much money. If I were to start over again, I would recommend going with a less costly option so you don't feel quite so bitter when dealing with yet another unreliable product from the boondoggle that is the baby industry.
1.0	"I have loved the smaller sizes of this sleep sack and not had any issues until they finally just \\""wore out\\"" - I was excited to finally find it in an XL.  My daughters are tall, but it only took one night sleeping in these and the muslin frayed from the shoulder seams!  Because they're so expensive I can't buy replacements but I'm so disappointed that such an expensive products, and otherwise fine in smaller sizes was so flimsy!  I wish I could find another light fabric sleep sack for summer for my twin girls."
1.0	The pictures and the acutal items are totally different.   Very disappointed with the misrepresentation of this product!  How come they still keep the wrong pictures and misleading people?
1.0	I have yet to try the pump it self beings I have not had my daughter yet, but I wanted to put this on while I was thinking about it. One thing I was really not impressed with was the fact that amazon shipped it to me in just the Philips Avent box, there was no outer box concealing what it was. Now I am not embarrassed by what I ordered because obviously as a working mom I will need it however, the package did get delivered to my uncle instead of me (imagine if it would of been a different neighbor).<br /><br />I will write  different review when I actually use the pump itself, I just was bothered by the fact that it wasn't concealed.
1.0	not easy to put on window and rattles so much with loud noise that I had to pull it out and go back to my old ones with suction cups
1.0	No, Please don't go for this. Quality is low too as its rate.
1.0	I have also been waiting for this mobile. I beleive I have been waiting since April. I pre-ordered it online to see that every other week the release date was pushed forward. I also need this to complete our nursery. I wish someone from the Bellissimo company would finally get this out for consumers!!!!!
1.0	Ergo charges a premium price for their product.  However, their customer support and warranty is pitiful.  We had an Ergo that had a manufacturer defect that made the front chest strap unadjustable.  This made the product dangerous to both Mom and Baby.  However, Ergo only has a one year warranty.  The Ergo goes to 45 pound kids.  However, at one year age a kid only weighs 15 pounds or so.  So, Ergo only stands by their product for one year even though the product is marketed for several years of use.  That is pitiful.  And, at their request, we sent in 12 pictures documenting the manufacturer flaw in the Ergo.  After all that, they told us they only back their product for one year.  So, we got no repair even though it was a clear manufacturer defect.  Ergo is insulting in their customer service and product support.
1.0	This item arrived discolored and looked used! Returns are extremely difficult......so we are stuck with it!
1.0	Biggest waste of money or should i say smallest waste of money this gate is tiny cheaply made looks nothing like the picture and was easily knocked over multiple times. Do not purchase this item its a complete waste of money
1.0	I was looking for more of a burp cloth. Something with some thickness to it. When I searched for burp cloth this came up so I wasnt sure what I would get. So if you are looking for a hankerchief for a baby there you go. But who would buy a hankerchief for a baby????  Its is thin has cute pictures on it, but but?????????
1.0	Will never, ever buy Summer Infant products again. The motor died right after purchase. I sent it back and got a new one. That one died also. I reported it and they said that it was now outside of the one year warranty so not their problem. Their customer service is rude and useless.
1.0	I used this on 1 vacation in 2 very small terminals.  As previously reviewed, this bag is about as durable as a kleenex!  It is a struggle to get the car seat in and awkward to roll and manuveur.  And for all purposes it is completely disposable since it falls apart after one use.  The only advantage the bag has is that as far as I know, it is the only one of its kind (with wheels).
1.0	I purchased this stroller for my son and daughter in law.  They are having baby number 3 in 3 years so needed a good stroller.  The stroller arrived with a defective brake.  When I tried to return it, I was charged a substantial restocking fee and shipping.  Advise you to look elsewhere.
1.0	was an baby  gift, parent has never used it...
1.0	Didn't work and it was a pain to return.  No help from the Cloud b company, either.  No contact numbers.
1.0	I purchased this product a few weeks ago. I found it to be decent enough considering the price.. Today I looked to purchase some more as backup only to find that in the course of a few weeks the cost of the diapers is more then twice what it was before. What the heck? I mean they are basic cloth diapers, not worth the price jack up at all.
1.0	We ordered this clock to try to help with our son's sleeping. We thought he would like the monkey, which he really did. I put batteries in it and I could set the time, but the night light never worked and the monkey never closed his eyes (and yes we were aware of the military time). We returned this product and bought a different toddler clock that works beautifully.
1.0	"After carefully following the directions and applying these straps they turned out to be COMPLETELY WORTHLESS.  The quality of the adhesive is terrible.  It doesn't matter what kind of surface I tried (and I tried numerous with new straps) it doesn't stick.  They barely have the strength to hold themselves on to a cabinet or door, let alone being yanked on by curious tots.  The adhesive is so bad that it doesn't even stay adhered to itself - let me explain.  The backing is basically two sided foam tape and one side is already attached to the product and the other side you simply peel and press.  The thing is, not only did it not stay adhered to my cabinet but some of the straps actually left the adhesive tape on the cabinet and came off of the actual plastic piece that was supposed to be locking it! If it can't even stay attached to itself how on earth can it do the job as advertised?  Seriously this is a MAJOR SAFETY HAZARD and this product is going to really cause problems.  It does say on the package that this is a deterrent and that adult supervision is necessary blah blah blah...but honestly people, it is not even a deterrent in the slightest sense of the word.  In fact, it's more likely to attract curiosity from your child and then cause a problem when they give the \\""strapped\\"" object even the slightest pull.  Also, to put things in perspective I am using this for an 11 month old...so I can't imagine how larger and older children would fare.  It's only a matter of time (hopefully sooner than later) until this product is taken off the market (or vastly improved) - and I only hope that it is because enough people complain and not because a child has been seriously injured.  Absolute trash."
1.0	Way too small for the crib.  When I initially put the mattress into the crib. It appeared to be fine.  The problem is,  the mattress shrunk SIGNIFICANTLY when I put the sheet on it.  Let guess it because it's due to the low density of the foam in the mattress.  Check out the photos I took to see how much the mattress shrunk.  I honestly couldn't believe it.  Returned it for a better, non shrinking one Arron another retailer.
1.0	Did not last at all. Waste of money. Leaked quick. I had to buy standard ones at Target for my kids lunches.
1.0	This gripper is not safe at all...Does not stay on long at all...
1.0	We brought this monitor home and it didnt work the second we had it in the house.  There was so much static and it cut out.  I threw it away because my dad bought us a good monitor with a temperature and humidity reading and it works well.
1.0	I recieved this and the box was not damaged , but when my fiance pulled the crib pieces out they were all damaged , it looked like someone literally took a hammer and beat the crap out of it and packed it the box and shipped it out!!!Very pissed off we are...
1.0	Unfortunately, I waited until I had a problem with this monitor to read the reviews.  In reading them, I agree wholeheartedly,...this monitor is terrible!  I feel as though we threw money away with this purchase!  Static (and unable to hear our baby at all on either channel), people's conversations,...you name the problem and we've experienced it!
1.0	This does not fit a normal sized changing pad-- it's too small. I should have believed the other review and not purchased it!
1.0	This was so small, even though it was supposed to stretch, I don't know what kind of table it would fit.  I returned it.
1.0	When my first child was born, I bought the Britax for my vehicle (daily use after he out grew the infant carrier) and in order to save a little money, I got the Evenflo for my husband's vehicle (occasional use).  To me, compared to the Britax, the Evenflo is very difficult in a couple of ways: <br /> <br />1. Installation- not too easy.  If you are going to put it in and leave it in I guess this part isn't too much of an inconvenience. <br /> <br />2. Cleaning-most children make some sort of mess at all stages of life (diaper blow outs, throw up, food/drink mess).  I was in total disbelief the first time I went to clean it.  Yes, you have to take this thing COMPLETELY apart.  It took me atleast a half hour to unscrew all of the screws off the back (not to mention the time to put it back together)! Fortunatly this was our rarely used seat, so it was a while before I had to wash it.   <br /> <br />After moving it from my husband's car to Grandma's car ONE time, I promptly went out and bought a second Britax for my husband's car. The Evenflo is now an extra seat that sits in the garage! <br /> <br />To prove even further my dislike, my second child was just born and I already purchased another Britax for her.  Yes, that makes three Britax that I love and one Evenflo that I think is very time consuming -which once you have kids, you have very little of!  Time should be spent with kids, not messing around adjusting,installing, and cleaning car seats!!!   <br /> <br />Evenflo... not even good enough as a second car seat.
1.0	I have used these bottles before but this time around seems like I got defective products. The bottles bottoms are round such that the bottles can't stand on them. The milk/water leaks almost everytime from the neck of the bottle. Seems like either the nipples or the bottles themselves are not round enough, causing some gap between the bottle neck and the nipple resulting in leaks.  I have already used them and am out on US now so I can't even return them. So looks like I' have to buy another set here.
1.0	I wish I would have read the reviews before buying this product. What they say about the center being weak is true. I have twins and they where born of 3 and 5 lbs and the bassinet started loosing its form. I can't imagine with heavier babies :/ I don't recommend this product at all, it's potentially dangerous and you'll be worrying all night.<br /><br />On the other hand the GRACO people were very nice and tried to solve the problem, they sent me all the bassinet part for free, but unfortunately, it's the same part, and I didn't need a replacement of the part that presented the danger, I needed a solution and they don't get that they have to make a complete change in the design.<br /><br />I ended up throwing it away (the bassinet part) and it's only good as a play yard. If I knew that was the use I was going to give it, I would have bought a cheaper one.
1.0	I bought this kit for my 23 months old son, eventhough the product looks OK, I regret to say the fork and spoon came on pink color, I will not feed my son with a pink fork or spoon. Therefore this product became very expensive for just a case, as I wont be using it.
1.0	Super fast shipping from amazon. However, we were missing a part when the bed arrived. I tried to call Delta for the missing part but could only get through to the answering machine. I've left several messages with no call back. I finally called a random person at the company who was unwilling to help me. She said to send a fax to the company. I sent a fax and still have not been assisted. I will be returning this bed. POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!
1.0	My mother bought me 2 of these. On first trip my 2 year old son kicked his leg and ripped the pocket. Within days both were falling apart. Good idea but poor construction.
1.0	This is advertised as a pack of 3 yet it is NOT. I wanted all three but only received 1. At least the company reimbursed me, but I spent a long time on the internet searching for just this item.
1.0	Would give 0 stars is possible. They don't not absorb anything!!!
1.0	Returned because the leg holes were too small for my 15 pound, 4 month old baby.
1.0	I purchased a camera and monitor, and two additional cameras ahead of my second granddaughter's birth last spring.  The setup was reasonable; just needed to follow the directions.  In general my son and daughter-in-law have been pleased with the set. The IR lights freak out my 3 year old granddaughter, but they do provide a good image in the dark.  The problems started when the mini-USB connector on the bottom of the monitor came loose from the monitor's circuit board. Initial emails to Lorex were unanswered, and once you finally get in touch with them, they play a game for help. My son finally called their tech support line, but since he didn't purchase it, they wouldn't deal with him. I contacted them, they said I needed the serial number. Since the system was in another town I didn't have the info at my finger tips. When I got it and called back, the guy on the line said I needed to contact another entity in Lorex.  I called that number, and I swear I got the same guy!  Next, from the day they received the failed monitor to the time they got a replacement to me (I instructed it be sent to my son's address, but they returned it to my address), it was over a week.  I gave the monitor to my son and the first time he placed it in the charger base, the mini-USB connector came loose from the monitor's circuit board.  I'm tired of dealing with these folks.
1.0	I try it for my six month old daughter. She doesn't like it. At first I thought it is normal for a baby who just starts to learn use cup. But one day my friend's two years old baby was at my home and I gave her some juice use this cup (a new one). She said I can't get the drink. Then I try it. Yes, you have to suck very hard to get the drink.
1.0	My parents bought this swing for my son so he could have something to set in and be relaxed.  I will give it this much it is very pretty and sturdy but it will not swing that well.  I had another one given to me (3 speed) and it swings a lot faster than this one at (6 speeds).  They need to make it a better  For 6 speeds it should have a little bigger motor.  The highest speed is the same as the lowest.  Maybe it was a defect but it was not the greast for me.
1.0	This does not go on easily.  It covers some of the hair needing rinsed. Careful, If you apply the pressure need it would hurt.
1.0	I got this and it looks like it has been used obviously y return it
1.0	WOW, my daughter is tiny, 4 months old and 11 pds,,THESE LOOK LIKE A CHOKER NECKLACE..I CANT BELIEVE THEIR ARE ANY POSITIVE REVIEWS!!  So disappointed in this purchase..
1.0	Junk ! Don't expected for this to suck out any of your babies gunk! Horrible product .
1.0	It's horrible, not even a little soft. Possibly the cheapest material i've ever seen
1.0	Get Dr. Brown's bottles. They are worth every cent. They're the best out there!
1.0	Leaks all over the place. Don't buy this product.
1.0	I liked the idea of having this for quick changes and easy access to bags. The hinged door wouldn't stay closed so the bags would keep falling out.  I spent the money on this and told myself to make it work so I taped the door shut and clipped it onto my diaper bag. My first day out with it was to the pediatrician. By the time we got there, the clip had fallen off and was lost somewhere between the house, the car, and the doctor.  You'd be better off just buying a bag holder used for dog walking...we've had ours a few years.
1.0	My son is 2 1/2 and this potty has been a nightmare for us. First, it did have a tendency to go off at all times of the day and night, and 2nd, the splash guard is not tall enough or secure enough. I can't even begin to count the times that I've turned around and seen him chewing on the guard he's removed or how often urine has shot across the bathroom because his penis is pointing 1 cm off of 'straight ahead'. On the bright side, it's comfortable for him to sit on and mine has never leaked, but that just may be because the urine never quite makes it in the receptacle.
1.0	I really don't have much to say about this product other than I think it's pointless. It sticks onto a surface via sticky stuff on back (hello that won't last forever) and even though it says it fits most ovens it became clear fast it wasn't going to fit an oven without the knobs down by the door. (what I call the old school type) The surface of this product was just too big to fit onto an oven (at least mine) where the knobs were up top. I can see how this product might be great with a bigger surface to work on but again the fact that it only sticks (my fault for not being more thorough in my research before purchasing) is a big turn off. All in all I ended up tossing this in the trash. Not even worth trying to return it in my opinion.
1.0	I have nothing to compare this sippy cup to because this is the only one we've used, but we've been very happy with it! It's five pieces all together; the cup, the handle, the silicone spout, they grey piece that covers the spout and a white plastic piece that attaches to the underside of the silicone piece. I find it easy enough to wash and assemble. We have 2 to rotate.<br /><br />This cup doesn't leak if it's properly assembled and the top is screwed on tightly. After my son drinks from it there is water left if the spout that will leak out. If you shake the cup to TRY and make it leak then it will.<br /><br />Cold water without ice will stay cold no matter what the outside conditions are for about 6 or 7 hours. With ice liquid will stay cold all day long, like 12 hours! Yes, even if it's left in the hot car all day.<br /><br />I chose this sippy cup because I hate plastic and it was the only option I could find that wasn't made entirely of plastic. I gave it 4 stars instead of five because the white plastic piece that attaches to the bottom of the silicone spout is made of plastic and does come in contact with fluids.<br /><br />EDIT:<br />About a month ago 1 out of 2 of our sippy sups became terribly leaky. It would literally leak it's entire contents out all over the floor in less than 30 minutes. Today the same thing happened to our other one! For a $13 sippy cup I think this is absolutely unacceptable. Save your money and don't waste your time with this garbage.
1.0	I use them month. He broke. There is not possibility to return. I live in other country.Very disordered. To purchase new there is not possibility.
1.0	If you think you are sleep deprived now just wait until you get this monitor.  It has great features but it clicks constantly.  You are up listening to the sound of the monitor rather than the sound of your baby crying.  I called Fisher Price and they said that this monitor makes a clicking noise because of the transmission of all the features.  There is no way to get rid of it.  It isn't worth the lack of sleep.
1.0	I really wanted to love this.  But I can't.  It comes rolled up which I get, but then won't lay flat.  I've left it flat with books on top of it for a few days and it seems to help.  THEN you have the issues where the suction cups don't actually work on any surface that isn't completely smooth.  We have a wood table and it just doesn't stick well.  Which renders it useless with a 10 month old who flaps around a lot!
1.0	Very disappointed.  I bought this changing table/dresser for my son and daughter-in-law to match the crib they had bought.  While it was very pretty, the construction of the drawers completely disappointed them and embarrassed me.  The glide assembly broke off while they were assembling it.  It made me feel cheap.  Invest in something else.
1.0	If you need formula or pumped breast milk in a hurry, this is not the product for you.  It took an hour to warm breast milk to a temperature for my child to eat, and more than a half hour to warm formula mixed with room temperature water.  While traveling with a hungry child this is definitely not the product for you.
1.0	We have had this monitor for 3 months now and the static did get annoying at times but as long as you adjusted the receiver, it would stop.  Then one morning at 4am the reciever started screaming and it never worked the same again!  I tried changing the batteries and it continued to do the same thing.  Nothing I tried worked.  I am now looking for a new monitor and will let everyone I know NOT to buy this monitor!
1.0	Terrible. Lid will not stay closed, even without being bumped or even touched at all, the lid will pop open. I am usually a big fan of OXO products but this is a definite exception. This was a complete waste of money. Very disappointing.
1.0	Would not recommended. A lot of static. Spend a little more money for something better.
1.0	These advertised as one size, but the size that arrived was 6-9 months, which is so small that many babies (including mine) aren't yet eating when they're that small. I did an exchange with Amazon and noted the problem, and they sent me the same size in response so it appears not to have been just a one-time mistake.
1.0	Don't buy this. It broke the second I tried to install it.
1.0	Too loud for my purposes. I like that it has a brushless head, but the noise is enough to stress out my daughter. Really it is louder than your average $5 electric toothbrush, not quieter as I assumed for the price. The vibration itself is pretty subtle, especially out at the tip.
1.0	i don't see how this will be able to grow with your child into toddlerhood. it was too small for my 4month old. in the picture the 2 pillows are at a distance when the velcro strap part is at it's regular position. when i received mine and put it in the same position, the 2 pillows were touching each other. so i adjusted it to the longest part and my baby still did not fit.
1.0	I bought this monitor back in May and had problems with it from the beginning.  It would constantly lose the signal with the nursery unit even if we were just in the next room.  We would charge the parent unit all night and I would use it during the day, but even though I would shut it off whenever my daughter was up for naps it would still be dead before we went to bed for the evening.  The only thing I liked about it was we could see what the temperature was in her room.  Finally I went to plug in the parent unit one night and the pin broke making it unable to charge.  Luckily I bought it at Toys R Us and got the protection plan so I should get a store credit at least.  Will NOT be buying the same monitor again.
1.0	So not worth the money. My son is 2 months and so far I've gotten no use out of it because he doesn't like it. His feet are close to hanging off, so in about the next two months it might be useless to me. Wish I had not make this pricey purchase. I purchase a cheap swing and is getting more use out of it.
1.0	It doesn't recline enough. My baby can't even sit in it. I guess maybe when his 6 months old it will work but by that time he won't need it anymore.
1.0	The clock arrived and it was cute but broken. Not physically broken, but it did not work.  Its been has been 2 months and I haven&#34;t received a refund yet.
1.0	This is a unique concept.  easier for them to get on potty for sure.  folds up nicely.  Problem:  The raised front on seat is not enough for a boy.  Shoots out all over the place.  Needed to be higher guard.
1.0	After just nine months the recharging cable is not recharging the battery anymore. Tried doing it with the one from the camera intead. It used to do the job but not anymore. Now nor the monitor nor the camera works. Second Summer baby monitor that stopped working. When i had my first son, a year in and the baby monitor just stopped out of nowhere. Wont be buying Summer products again.
1.0	I have never found the time or energy to write any review on anything.  However, if I convince just one person to buy a different monitor, this is worth my effort. I have been extremely disappointed with it.  It's range is much smaller than other monitors than I have used at my sister-in-laws or friend's houses.  Not to mention, every time my cell phone rings, it causes loud interference noises that wake the baby.  Also, it manages to click just as I'm falling to sleep and I'll have to get out of bed to rearrange it on my dresser just prefectly so it doesn't click all night.  Please buy another monitor.  I am on this website right now to buy a different monitor and to throw this thing away.
1.0	The fabric can't be taken off to wash so it got really gross from my 2 year old climbing into bed.  About 2 months after purchasing it the plastic broke and the entire thing was useless.  We took it off and haven't been using anything.  She has not fallen out of bed.<br /><br />There are better ways to keep your toddler from falling out of bed, don't waste the money. Check pinterest and other Mommy boards.
1.0	the best stove knob cover I found, is to take the knobs off, store them in the drawers, and put it/them back only when I cook.  I read about this tips in one of the reviews. It's so worth mentioning again
1.0	I bought this pump to have a 2nd one at work. This pump was initially ok, but shortly thereafter it started misfiring and switching the pumping rhythm all by itself. I dealt with this for a few days until I could contact Philips Avent, who of course can do nothing about it. They tried to have me reset the pump handle, but it turns out that wasn't the problem, but the pump itself. After a few weeks, I heard an odd noise while pumping and the pump died. Some part came loose on the inside because I could hear it moving as I shook the pump. At least it was my 2nd pump. The 1st one was bought brand new and still works great on the 2nd child.
1.0	Can hardly hear the items.  Not to many light up items. Not to much of realistic.  Maybe if the icons would lite up.  To much nothing for the price
1.0	This sucks the pillow stinks like literally stinks totally not worth it not even 4 worth it not even a body memory pillow the thing is like two lumps that smell super upset
1.0	After having been on several flights with my daughter as an infant (she's now 5 and doesn't need this anymore) with 6 flights before my daughter even reached a year old, I have yet to find an airline that will allow me to use it. If my kid is never in because the steward's make me remove it, then it's a waste of money. I specifically bought it because of the FAA approval. But not one single airline would let me use it.<br /><br />If you are in the Tacoma area and want to test your luck at Seatac, I have a free one that's NEVER been used.<br /><br />Useless...
1.0	Not worth the money. They fall apart easily and they aren't properly sized.
1.0	DO NOT BUY THIS!!!! It is TERRIBLE! I bought it after reading reviews thinking it would work for me because I have never had supply issues (my son was 10 months old when purchased). I had previously used the harmony to pump. I would over flow the bottle in ten minutes. This pump is crap. I used it at the same time (making sure it was out together correctly) and got a total of 2oz! (Usually 7oz). It's nothing but a waste of money.
1.0	Does not stick at all. Scotch taping it everyday, different place.
1.0	If you like this style of cup holder than you should like this.  It seems very sturdy, like it would hold up well.  We are not fans of this style but bought it just to be sure and compare to the Sunshine Kids and the other style Baby Jogger called the 'parent console'.  Both of those attach and hang between the handles.  We prefer the parent console.  It looks like it belongs on the stroller.  Doesn't dangle off and seem ready to break.  We like that you can use one parent console style for 2 cups and still have a velcro storage area.  You can also just have one cup and 2 velcroed storage areas. Stoller still collapses easily with console attached.
1.0	We have the smaller click and lock sippy cups and these DO NOT fit correctly. They are too long. We were super disappointed as I cannot find replacement straws at the store.
1.0	I bought these to use as wipes but they are very rough on one side...  and not all that soft on the other.  I wouldn't use these on such sensitive skin, so not sure what to do with them at this point.  Waste of money.
1.0	This sheet seems to be a little too small and pulls on the mattrerss so it's not completely flat.  I've had better luck using a fitted crib sheet or a blanket and tucking the excess underneath the mattress.  I know some people will not agree with this method because the sheet or blanket could potentally come loose and cause a suffocation hazard.  This is what has worked best for me and my children.  I've also had pack 'n play sheets from another brand and did not have good luck with that brand either.  It was a generic Walmart or Target brand and I thought if I got a Graco one it would work better on my Graco pack 'n play.  I was wrong.  They are all a waste of money in my opinion.
1.0	I ordered this for my father who had recently suffered a stroke and was recovering. The handles were not sturdy enough to hold his weight (about 150 lbs) safely enough to actually use them. I do not recommend this product.
1.0	This doesn't fit anything. It's like trying to put an origami puzzle together. I don't recommend this to anyone. Sorry, something practical, easy and fast would be great.
1.0	We registered for this monitor because of all the great features. We were very disappointed, however, that the receiver was so loud it would keep us awake more than our new baby! Even when our baby would cry, it was hard to hear him over all the static and humming of the receiver. If you want a real monitor, don't get this one. We have tried two monitors since and recommend the Sony Baby Call (27 channel) monitor. It is truly a high-tech piece of equipment and so clear it sounds like the baby is in the room with you.
1.0	Thesr clippers stink!  The plastic on both sided of the clippers gets in the way!  Light or not, you cant see what your clipping!  Worst baby product we purchased!
1.0	this thing was horrible. did not do that job at all. I am not one to write a bad review but I did not find any success with this product.
1.0	Have you thought about what happens when you take this car seat out of your car when you get to your destination?  Would you like to gently rock your baby in his car seat?  oh, that curved bottom that every other car seat in the world has does not exist here!  There shall be no rocking!
1.0	I put unit together and discovered that one of the side bars on top was not locking completely. Called Amazon, who was awesome as usual, and they emailed the company. Company told me I would have to take the unit and mail it myself and pay for the return postage. This item is very heavy in the box. My husband and I both work full time and I am 7 months pregnant. I use Amazon because of convenience.  Husband works 6 days a week so even Saturday mail drop offs are not possible.<br /><br />Company who sold it told me IF the unit was found defective, they they would reimburse me.  I guess I will not order anything ever form a third party seller. Now I have to figure out how I am going to drag this beast into the post office and shipping will not be cheap as it is quite heavy.
1.0	I used pressure mount to install this gate to keep my daycare children and my own children from getting to my front door so that parents could drop off and pick up kids freely without worry of &#34;trompling&#34; the little ones.  Most of the children can just jiggle it a little and the gate opens.  The pressure mounting hardware has to be tightened about every other day to keep the gate intact.
1.0	I bought this video as an opportunity to work out and interact with my baby at the same time. I was excited to receive this video so I could get back into shape after having my daughter. Upon receiving the video, I watched it through before trying it. I found the video to be very low budget and not very interactive. The video shows some exercises to use with a ball briefly then goes to a background screen that says try it on your own. The fitness instructor does not do the exercises with you or motivate you during your workout. It felt like a video someone made for you tube then decided to market on Amazon. Overall, I would not recommend this video to another mom. I returned this video and purchased Jillian Michaels 30 day shred which while it doesn't involve your infant, it is only 20 minute workouts which I am able to do during my daughters naps. I did it once and I really felt the burn the next day. I would save my money on this purchase and look for a better quality mommy and me workout video.
1.0	This product is so small. It only hold one full size bottle.  It can't hold a size three diaper and wipes. To boot it doesn't stay warm. Warmed it up for the allotted 1:30 min and it stayed warm for one hour.  Not long enough for a trip. Disappointed it was not bigger and better quality.
1.0	I am a pro traveler. I make it through security juggling my baby, stroller, carseat, breast milk, laptop, and diaper bag faster than most people do just dealing with their adult self. I would never buy this product. It will just slow you down and make the boarding process inconvenient for yourself and your fellow travelers.<br /><br />Here's how gate checks work: you bring stroller and/or carseat through security to the gate to get tagged. Supposedly you would have baby in stroller in the airport. So then you have to go down the jetway - again, guessing you have baby in stroller - and then have to fold the stroller for the agent to carry it down to the luggage area for the flight. Meanwhile everyone else who is trying to board the plane is waiting behind you (or pushing past you). Are you seriously going to take the extra 5-10 minutes to pull this stupid bag out and put your stroller in it? Meanwhile, where is baby? If you are wearing baby, fine... but then why do you need your stroller to begin with? Having carrier + stroller complicates everything. Streamlining is the key to smooth travel, friends.<br /><br />And seriously... protecting your stroller from germs. Are you kidding me? Your little human petri dish is more germ filled than any nylon and metal stroller could ever be. This bag is stupid and pointless and if I ever saw someone fumbling with one at the end of my jetway I'd toss my best stink face at them, fold my stroller one-handed, and push on past. Amateurs!
1.0	I had so many problems with this that I through it away.  Buy another pounding toy.  The problems were as follows:  1.  The top part and the tray aren't connectedat all.  The top just sits on the tray, which creates storage problems and makes the toy unstable.  2.  You practically have to be a body builder to get the balls in the holes.  I could hardly do it, let alone my small children.  3.  The balls don't stay in the toy well and go everywhere.  Don't buy this one.
1.0	The measurements are inaccurate and it leaks. When you get down to the last bit of medicine it would shoot out and scare our daughter. I eventually gave up and just tossed it in the garbage.
1.0	If I could rate it lower I would. First of all the Zipper is from top to bottom so I am not sure how you would ever get your baby in and out of this easily, you have to put it over their head. Second, the zipper broke after I washed it once, my daughter never even got to sleep in this thing.  And they didn't let me return it because I bought it so long ago before my daughter was born and didn't realize it was useless until right now. My advice to this company is to turn your Zipper around and make the arm holes bigger and use a YKK zipper so they don't break so easily.
1.0	We got this after our babys 3rd weeks check up. And has been using it occasionally outside and inside. Sometimes my baby just sleeps in it so i believe its comfortable for her but for me after wearing 10lb baby for 15 min my shoulders start to kill me. But we didnt mind it at all until for our 2 month check up our pedetrician ordered xray for hip dysplasia. After that i started to research it and found that bjorn could cause hip dysplasia. Im not sure if it really was the problem but i just returned it straight away. I just thank amazon for their great customer service
1.0	This is for anyone that gets this product. You are not getting but one towel with terrible material. This is not worth your money and to get a refund you have to pay half of the selling price. Terrible customer service! Never again will I shop from blueberry shop.
1.0	This was a great addition to our bathtub/shower.  Both muy wife and I use it.
1.0	My 5 month old LOVED this - I would have rated it one of our absolute best purchases. Then while I was driving one day and it was attached to his car seat the attachment part split - broke into 2 completely severed pieces. I don't know which piece did it but my son had a little gash on his arm from it. I was just glad it didn't make it into his mouth! I have returned it and am shopping for something else like it, but am a little nervous too.
1.0	The lid came off when he pulled his hand out with the snacks. Maybe we had two defective ones?? The tops need to screw on, then they'd work perfectly.
1.0	I wanted to love this, but it just doesn't work. I ordered the small vest, xs/s pouch and it's too big. I'm a small person, but not tiny - 5'4&#34; and 120 lbs. I had this cinched up as tightly as possible, but still couldn't get my baby (7 lbs) close enough to my nipple to nurse properly. I found myself hunched and holding her up trying to maintain her latch. Also, the positioning of your baby in this cradle (according to the instructions to have him/her face up vs. chest to chest) just doesn't make sense. Whose nipples point downward? Due to the awkward positioning, my baby, who does NOT spit up, had massive spit-up and hiccups after one feeding session. Also, the pouch is meant to help reduce strain, but the distribution of weight ends up on one trapezoid or the other, causing neck pain. This ended up being a return. Too bad, was really hoping it would be great :-/
1.0	RECALLED BY THE CPSC!  ALL GEM COVERED PACIFIERS WERE RECALLED FOR CHOKING HAZARD, INGESTION OF LEAD RHINESTONES, & VAPORS FROM CANCER CAUSING GEM GLUE.  ALL PACIFIER COMPANIES PROHIBIT THE DECORATION & RESALE OF THEIR PRODUCTS.  AMAZON MUST REMOVE SUCH LISTINGS PER U.S. LAW!!!<br /><br />http://www.cpsc.gov/en/Recalls/2007/Pacifiers-Decorated-with-Crystals-Recalled-Due-to-Aspiration-and-Ingestion-Hazards/
1.0	One shake and the snacks went flying. Very disappointed, since we generally love Nuby products.
1.0	They warp, turn all sorts of odd shades and leak like crazy, save your money!
1.0	I got this for my twin boys- hubby liked the Jeep name.  We tried it out at Baby depot and thought it was tough to maneuver because they had the aisles filled with merchandise waiting to be put away.  It is impossible to turn with one hand, and even still tough with two.  Terrible for taking in a store! I liked all the storage beneath, and the look of the stroller, but this purchase was a definite mistake. I ended up buying a cheap side by side-aria I think was the brand, and I use it instead.  I was looking for something we could use as the boys grew, but this is definitely not it.  I figure if it is tough to turn when they are 15 pounds each it is going to get tougher as they get bigger.   I am putting mine in a yard sale for $40 and hoping I get a taker! Save your money and go with the duoglider- that is what I am planning to replace the jeep with.
1.0	The handbag is cute and all but the quality is garbage inside the bag I can't figure out if it's paper or some type of plastic and the bag is unbelievably delicate.
1.0	After going through a box of Dr. Browns nursing pads the first month after my baby was born, I decided to go for the washable pads and wanted to use some organic cotton ones. After I bought these and followed the detailed washing instructions (three times separately in hot water) I tried them out and leaked right through them. Very disappointed. Now it's back to the disposable pads.
1.0	The item description said it would fit a 3in mattress. I have a 2in mattress and after washing it once it barely fits a two inch. I am afraid to wash it again for fear that it won't fit even that.
1.0	Have a basic transition crib and it seemed to fit at first. 2 months in and we have a gap of several inches which is not safe, nor acceptable for our baby girl. Luckily we're still within the return timeframe, so we will.
1.0	We purchased this warmer to reheat breastmilk and ready to feed formula.  The temperature was very inconsistent, sometimes too warm, sometimes barely warm at all.  It also continues to heat even after the warmer shuts off.   If you aren't there to immediately remove the bottle it overheats.  Of all my many purchases for our first baby I was most dissapointed in this unit.
1.0	Quality Guaranteed??? This product is very poorly constructed. After a few light uses the material inside the cup holders came apart at the stitching. This was used on a BOB Revolution Duallie, it did not fit properly. We bought this hoping it would be a better product then what we bought from BOB but the velcro straps are just not long enough to go on the stroller as it should fit. The only way to attach it was to put it right next to the handle bar. I contacted the company asking what the return policy/exchange policy was. This is the response that I got...<br /><br />We sincerely apologize for the torn interior issue you were experiencing. This appears to be an isolated incident, as we have not heard this before, and will certainly replace it for you at no cost to you. Please confirm your shipping address is still the same and we'll take care of this immediately for you.<br /><br />Eileen,<br /><br />Stroll-a-Roo<br /><br />I immediately responded to her and confirmed our address. 6 months and 3 more emails later I have never received my replacement, nor another response to my follow up emails. This is a poorly made Stroller Organizer made by a company that does not stand behind its products. Quality Guaranteed it says on the item description. What a joke! If you have an issue be prepared to be blown off like we were!
1.0	After reading all the reviews, I was ecstatic to get this and maybe get more than an hour of sleep at a time! Nope, he woke up furious within 15 minutes the two times I tried it. Sent it back. No miracle here. :(
1.0	I tried these and Avent pacifiers.  These are shorter but harder then the Avent.  My baby didnt care for these much at all, his lips would get tight like he refused to take it.  The avent didnt work out too well for us either th
1.0	I bought this item 3 times because mine kept ripping the sponges after a couple of uses and I thought i was doing the cleaning too hard. But once i switched brands, now it works well and i didnt have to replace it.  i will not buy this again and i would recomend people to buy the Munchkin version instead.
1.0	Was excited to see this design - bought it at babies r us (for less than Amazon) - and got home only to be thoroughly disappointed.   I agree, my son who is 1 as well, could not get any liquid out of it and ends up chucking the thing out of frustration.  I loosened   the lid a little and he began to drink out of it, but then proceeded to turn it upside on his tray and spilled the liquid everywhere.   Huge clean up!  Not worth it!  They need to redesign this.  Skip this one.
1.0	I purchased the entire 13 piece bedding, the mobile, and the lap shade; and the nursery looked fantastic for my unexpected neice who is living with me.  Within 3 months while the little one was asleep it feel on her.  Luckily someone was in the nursery with her and was able to remove it from her crib.  I contacted the seller to inquire about a return and was told that returns are only within 14 days.  I find it disgraceful that a child's mobile which is seldomly used broke within 3 months.  I would not purchase from this seller or this mobile.
1.0	I bought this item and it did not work well it took forever to express milk and would not seal very well on the breast i also bought another manual pump that worked great i would not spend the money on this product.
1.0	It is very difficult to put it on, I never used it...
1.0	I haven't noticed any difference after starting to use this
1.0	Prior to purchasing this product I called the sales / support lines and asked a flurry of questions to verify that what I wanted to do with this product would work. The product support person assured me that as long as I had a stable WIFI internet connection I could connect with my network to the camera with no problems - both at home and on the go (i.e. wifi at the beach cottage). I received this product very quickly but that's about where the positive review stops.  As soon as I opened the container and followed the instructions I uickly found out that the 10 step process would hang up around step 5/6 which is having the camera connect to your wifi connection. As a result I could never get this to connect at home but decided to test this camera connection where I was staying at the beach. Believe it or not, I was able to get to the last step (after about 30 mins of trying to get the camera to connect to the wifi) and then once I had the software installed on the phone, I could not get camera to come online via reaching the cloud.  The only way I could access a live feed via the camera is by manually connecting to the wifi via my phone using the default settings after resetting the camera. Save yourself the $$ and time and by something that actually works.<br /><br />Also don't bother with the customer service - I ended up knowing more that the &#34;outsourced sounding agent&#34; when i called in. After an hour of getting nowhere I just hung up and put the unit back in the box.
1.0	This may be a decision to avoid lawsuits, but the water barely registers in this tub. The baby's body is mostly outside of the water, and he cant play or enjoy his bath fully. This  gets worse as the baby grows, so this tub wont serve you long.
1.0	Love love love Dr. Brown's bottles...but sippy cups...not so much.  Rubber valve and inside of lid molded with just water inside.  Ugh.  I hate mold and no matter what I could do to get it off I never would feel safe giving it to my little one again.  In the trash...
1.0	The scale worked once and then the digital numbers stop showing on display and it would not weigh properly. I do not recommend buying this scale.
1.0	It is beautiful but I can never use it with my baby. He's 6 months old and puts everything in his mouth and I've washed this blanket 3 times and can still pull fur off by the hand full. I DO NOT recommend this to anyone.
1.0	This is terrible. The material is foamy and you can barely see the print. It sticks to the sides of the thing used to cut it out so it doesn't even make a nice circle. It was useless. I bought as a gift and would be horribly embarrassed to give them to someone. Went right in the trash. Don't waste your money!
1.0	The handles started to chip. I felt like for a designer bag ,that was so expensive it should be made with better quality.
1.0	We loved this swing and so did our little one. The problem was that it barely swings now, even in the highest setting. This is swing #2 for us. The motor went out in the first swing and now even though out baby only weighs 11 pounds this swing barely moves. Great product for about 3 weeks - frustrated now.
1.0	Its a sweet idea, but honestly, my 15 month old and 3 year old played with it once or twice, it didn't fit a standard tub, and then its just became another bathtub toy that really doesn't add anything to the bathtime experience.  We got rid of it after a week.
1.0	I cannot believe this item was shipped to me in the condition in which I received it. When I removed the bath sponge from the box, the edges were all brown. It looks disgusting. I am definately not giving this to my daughter for her new baby. I am buying another one from a different retailer. There is no way this item should have left the warehouse in this condition. Very disappointed.
1.0	Please give review about measurements of the drawers (inside -depth, length, width, how many adult jeans would fit, what the bottom, back of drawer are made of? can it hold/carry heavier adult clothes? plastic sliding rails?
1.0	We loved the lightness of this fabric, but our son - who is an active sleeper - kicked this sleeper open at the seams the third night sleeping in it. For such little legs, I was surprised at how easy it was for him to rip the sleeper that cost so much!!
1.0	This is an ultrasonic device and it has been advised by the Surgeon General that ultrasound should not be used unless necessary.  Why?  Because we don't know the long-term effects of ultrasound.  Could it be that ultrasound is contributing to Autism?  Yes, it's absolutely possible.  If you look closely, you will see that Autism didn't start showing up until the use of prenatal ultrasound did in the late 80s.  Autism didn't blossom until it was used routinely in the 90s.  It could be that immunizations trigger Autism, but the root cause could very well be ultrasound.  Countries that do not use ultrasound routinely do not have the rate of Autism that &#34;developed&#34; nations do.  Even if you do not believe that ultrasound is a risk for Autism, do you really want to risk your developing fetus to something that we really don't know about?  Do you really want to take the risk for &#34;peace of mind?&#34;
1.0	These were LIGHTLY used and all broke within a month of purchase. The pop easily and when refrozen they become hard and unmoldable. Two zip lock baggies with ice cubes work better than these and are much cheaper.
1.0	I spent an entire afternoon putting this piece together, drilling, only to have to take it down, pack it up and return it.  Looks great from the pictures, however, looks are deceiving.  The materials are cheep, unstable, and falls apart easily.  I do not recommend this item for any parent childproofing their home.  We are having to hire fence company to install out child-proof gate for out stairway.  At least I'll know that it won't come apart.
1.0	I ordered this item because it was listed as a flannel sheet and my son's room is drafty. Well it's definitely not flannel. While the pattern is cute, it wasn't even soft cotton. I returned it without even taking it out of the package.
1.0	We purchased two for our stairway. They are not sturdy enough to stay in place. We have serious safety concerns with this particular gate. We returned both of them.
1.0	This seat has a very strong chemical odor when removed from packaging.  I can't find info on what it's made off and whether flame retardants were added.
1.0	I happily bought six of these bottles (four from Amazon and two from Whole Foods), since i was looking for BPA-free bottles.  The bottles morphed into unrecognizable white and crystallized blobs, one after the other (I stopped using them when this happened with the third one).  They all started out with a small white mark near the mouth of the bottle, and did the bizarre morphing thing soon afterwards.  I had the bottles in the microwave sterilizer with both a Dr. Brown and an Avent bottle, neither one of which had any problems.      I would love to post a photo of the blob because I am convinced that anything that could turn into THAT cannot be good for my baby.      The worst was that I could not get a response from the company.  I wrote emails, I spoke to one of their customer service reps, wrote more emails...and nothing came of any of it.  I then reported to the Better Business Bureau in their region (Louisiana), which wrote me back several weeks later to say that THEY had not gotten any response from the company either.    My daughter is the most precious thing in the world to me...would I trust her well-being to a company that produces a flawed product and THEN refuses to respond to legitimate concerns, even from the Better Business Bureau?  HECK, NO!  I would urge everyone to take care before buying this bottle.
1.0	This is worth $200.00 at walmart this price is a rip off. Don't even bother with this one. shop walmart
1.0	"This is a SAFETY product.. Therefore dimensioning  should be the determining factor in the purchase of this and all like items.<br />IE: The dia. of the suction cup, and the centerline dimension between the two suction cups.<br /><br />Note: The service with Amazon was outstanding..<br /><br />Thank you,<br /><br />Phil Forney<br /><br />Mommy's Helper Safer Grip 11.5\\"""
1.0	Constant static and interference with picture.  We are very unhappy with this monitor.  Do not waste your money.
1.0	The thermometer was relatively quick to read, but sometimes would take more than 8 secs to reach its final temperature. However, after 6 months of light use with our infant, it started displaying &#34;Err&#34; and stopped working. According to the product manual, our unit has a malfunction. The worst time to discover you have a faulty product is when your child may be sick and you need to check for a fever! While it does have a one-year warranty, you apparently have to ship it back with its original packaging and a sales receipt for them to repair or replace it. Who keeps their original packaging? We will not be buying this thermometer again.
1.0	"I purchased 2 of these, given the high star rating, thinking they would be a great addition to my pantry for storing baby food.  Thankfully I only wasted the time to assemble one of them before I realized how poorly designed this product is.  It seems as though the shelves should \\""lock\\"" into place, but they really don't.  Several times while trying to fill the silly thing, the middle shelf kept falling down, even though I had it \\""locked into place\\"" just like the instructions said to do.  Not only that, once I had it completely full and the shelves were being held up by a miracle of God, I could barely get the thing to rotate.  Rotating this product from the bottom tier is nearly impossible.  I honestly thought about keeping the organizers and super-gluing the shelves in place, but then I decided that I would just return them for fear that it wouldn't work and I'd just be even more frustrated.  I have never returned anything I have purchased online, so this should tell you how disappointed I was with this product.  Just a warning out there to those reading these reviews:  Even if you follow the instructions to a T, the product still comes apart at the least little jostling, causing the shelves to fall; it's not \\""user error\\""...it's \\""product error.\\""  I will be finding another system to use."
1.0	This did not work for my child. He just wasn't ready!
1.0	I bought this set for my classroom. It had no directions and a million pieces, it seemed.  I never did put it together. Expected much more from ikea.
1.0	I ordered this product from two different sellers.  The first one did not work.  I assumed it was the batteries and set up a return for that item and ordered from the second seller.  That one also did not work.  I'm going to keep one and replace the batteries and hope that fixes it.
1.0	s product looked used----all were missing pieces  they were broken but had to be used as they were to match others being given at a church function on love----paid someone to re work them and replace all clothespin pieces and wire to re hang word love from the hanger-----would have returned them but had to have them to meet correct number of giftsthey were not new obviously  or severly damaged
1.0	Cord is too short and charger stopped working after a month.
1.0	I had the cup for two days and it broke. Not worth the money.
1.0	"My child fell off of this potty when we were using the insert for the \\""big potty\\"".  One of the supports snapped off the insert, fell into the bowl and my child fell through my arms and on to the hard tile floor. She bruised her bum and leg and wouldn't attempt potty training for nearly a year after because she was so afraid.  I contacted the company and was offered another potty or an assortment of toys for my troubles.  I can't believe they are still selling this thing and sadly people who don't read reviews will buy this in stores because it is cute and caters to what little girls want.  0 stars from me."
1.0	"My simple advise: GO BUY IT FROM OTHER SELLERS. BABYHAVEN SUCKS.  I ordered the adapter back in December and thought it will be part of a great gift for my friend's baby shower. However, it's March 24th and I still don't have the pacifier adapter. I've contacted BabyHaven via email and phone for several times but the only answer I get is \\""it's been sent out and it will be there in 4-5 days\\"". It's been THREE MONTHS and I'm still waiting. Very very very disappointed. Don't believe it when they send you a \\""confirmation number\\"" because that doesn't mean anything! Again, BABYHAVEN SUCKS!"
1.0	Pegperego, I was so trill when I bought this stroller . it's very light, has nice design and color choices. But then my excitement only last for a month, after several usage, the front wheel is so hard to controlled, it goes not according to which direction we want but wherever it likes. I used to be able to control the stroller with one hand, but now, I need to lift the from part up just to get the stroller going to the direction I want . Poor design for $200 bug and pegperego big name... The should take this stroller out of the market. I better used my big secure Graco product....
1.0	the material is baddddd and dirty some how even i tried to wash them but it didnt go<br />tooooo bad
1.0	This tub sucks!  I don't know where they get the idea that it has four stages... it only lays down or sits straight up.  My baby scraped her feet and legs on the green plastic part many times.  When it is sitting straight up the baby is also not comfortable because it doesn't recline at all and there is a hump that sticks out at the bottom.  I am now using this tub as a watering dish for our dogs!  DO NOT BUY THIS TUB!
1.0	I have 2 sons in cloth diapers.  I went to Meijer to find a diaper pail and only had 3 choices.  This was the only one that used regular bags.  I used it for 2 days and the lid wouldn't stay shut.  Also, it doesn't push cloth diapers through to the bottom.  I had to use my hand to push them down.  Yuck!  It is also small and won't hold very many diapers.  I generally wash diapers every 2-3 days and this pail won't hold that many diapers.  What happened to the good old fashion tall diaper pails without all of the contraptions?
1.0	Bought for a friend's baby shower: It is cluttered with &#34;Mommy&#34; and Daddy&#34; labels, which rendered it completely useless for my purposes: A gift for two fathers.<br /><br />Single Parents, Same sex parents, or unmarried couples should avoid this book like the plague: Great concept: Poor execution.
1.0	I did not like this product as it was not as described.  There were pieces missing and we've been unable to get the issue resolved with customer services.<br />We bought a similar crib from bed, bath, and beyond we love, however this one does not measure up as it's still not assembled, waiting on pieces.<br />We were hoping that small convenient size of the crib as well was the portability would work for grandma's house, so she could pack it away when she wasn't actually using it, but without the ability to set it up, I'm not sure if the crib will meet our expectations.
1.0	It is a nightmare to get it on/off diapers efficiently when you have a screaming baby trying put his foot in a diaper full of poo and you know he thinks peeing on you is a sport.  More importantly, it doesn't fit our baby right. We have tried everything but we get false alarms whenever we use it. Imagine this: you finally get the baby to fall asleep and you are dosing off for the first time in a week when a stupid false alarm wakes your baby up. We even tried several different diapers and different mounting locations with no reliabilty. It might work better when the baby is 20lbs, but for now it is only good for keeping people awake and alert 24/7. I might try again when he is bigger. A spring loaded clip would probably be much more effective than the stupid plastic clip that the instructions say not to bend too much.
1.0	The car seat looks great but it is clunky and flimsy...because the back is all one part when the child grows you extend it from the bottom.  The problem is that creates a gap and it is uncomfortable for my daughter.  Also the lights seem to be more a safety hazard than a convenience.  If ther ewas any side impact those lights would shatter right on your child's face.  Will return -not worth the money at all.
1.0	I purchased about $300 worth of pull-ups from Antsy Pants/Fly Baby a year ago.  I did not like them because they leaked out of the sides, so I returned them (exactly by the procedure outlined on her website).  I have repeatedly tried to contact, with no response back.  Do not purchase from this person unless you are sure you will not return the diapers.  Now, I am out $300, and I don't even have any diapers that I could sell to get some of the money back.
1.0	"I got my package today expecting a bit more then i got...I guess I was put off by the picture of five wipes and the fact that it says \\""wipes\\"", I thought that I was going to receive 5 \\""wipes\\"" but in fact only received 1. I feel like i was a bit misled by the fact that it says \\""wipes\\"" instead of \\""wipe.\\"" perhaps this should be changed due to that fact that it is considered false advertisement."
1.0	My baby hates it, and i feel the nipple to long for a newborn breastfed child, I was<br /> kinda disappointed for spending so much cash on these but whatever.
1.0	There is no way the designers tested this product. The straps ride too high towards the neck and cause shoulder pain. Lower back is pain is bad, needs a,lower back strap. Needs 2 ppl 2 get baby out. Baby is not close, but hangs away from you..very scary. Do not purchase, could not use past 10lbs/ 5 wks old.
1.0	We bought this product because it seemed perfect to be our changing table/hamper/storage for diaper changing supplies.  As we started putting it together, one of the wooden rails started to split as we were tightening the screw, this was the one that's meant to hold the baby.  The the two shelves to hold the top two drawers didn't fit correctly, they couldn't reach all the way across to the other side to be connected.  We are going to return it as soon as possible, luckily we are going to use the top of the dresser for the changing table like most other people do.
1.0	I didn't get the stroller straps at all And the long messenger/backpack strap isn't the fake leather like in the picture, it's like the material of seat belts. Very disappointing.
1.0	This thing was a waste of my money.  This is nothing more than a kitchen sprayer! And it doesn't even come with all the parts needed to set it up.  I could have purchased this at Home Depot for cheaper! We ended up buying a Black and Decker Dog Sprayer instead.  It has a nice long hose and a trigger so you don't get water everywhere.  It has lots of water pressure behind it and we spray with hot water.
1.0	A couple others have noted that the thinness of these bags cause them to slip easier into the pail and you end up wasting a ton of the plastic which basically makes them last way less then the diaper genie brand. Stick with the main diaper genie brand on this one and pass on this cheaper version is my recommendation.
1.0	The title says it all.  A sticker that doesn't stick is worthless.  It peels off the wall in a matter of hours (or less).
1.0	purchased  pink color, got blue bottle, never again!
1.0	This is a piece of junk.  Go out and buy a travel set of whatever brand you use and glue some fabric on the case and tada, you will have this.  It's hard to open, does not keep wipes wet, and fell apart within weeks of use.  Such a huge waste of money.
1.0	These bottles are not that good.    FYI When I purchased these online I bought two of the 3-packs.    The nipples are really small and flimsy compared to other bottle nipples, and my son had a difficult time latching onto them, tho he probably would have gotten used to them.    For some reason the first 3 pack of bottles that I bought got a really bad smell after only one use, that no amount of washing or boiling could get rid of, so I had to throw them away.    The second pack of bottles had a really bad chemical smell that didn't go away after boiling or washing them, so I ended up throwing them away without ever using them.    The only good thing about these bottles is that they did NOT leak at all.  Also, if the bottles were actually usable, and hence not a waste of money, the price would have been good-- not too high at all.
1.0	WORST STROLLER EVER I ORDERED THIS STROLLER FOR MY 11 MONTH OLD DAUGHTER YEA ITS CUTE BUT ITS SUSPECT I HAVE NEVER SEEN A MACLAREN STROLLER WITH PLASTIC WHEELS. CHEAP PLASTIC WHEELS AT THAT. SO I RETURNED IT AND I AM CURRENTLY AWAITING MY REFUND.
1.0	I should have read the reviews before buying this product.  The product does not come with long enough adhesive tape to completely adhere the cushion to furniture.  Our 9 month old ripped the cushion right off as soon as I put it on the furniture so the tape is not strong enough.  Would not buy this product again...needs stronger adhesive tape and more of it!
1.0	When I purchased this carseat, I assumed that I would be able to use if for a long time.  However, now that my son has reached the maximum capacity for the five-point harness, I discovered that this carseat has the LOWEST (actually not recommended) rating as a booster seat ([...]).  I recommend looking into the Graco Nautilius because it has a much higher weight limit on the five-point harness (65 pounds) and has the HIGHEST safety rating as a highback booster.
1.0	I know colors vary on computer screens and you can't expect a perfect match. But the color I received was completely different than what I saw on my screen. The product received was a very bright sky blue, not the soft grayish blue-green on the picture. The sheets are also very stiff and rough. I'm going to wash it a few times and hope it softens up. I'll keep them as a back up sheet because returning them is more of a hassle, but I'm still on the hunt for light colored neutral sheets after thinking I had found what I was looking for.
1.0	This product was defective.  It caused a major leak in our toilet upstairs.  When I came home to water pouring from my ceiling light fixture, I didn't know what it was. We found the problem, it was this diaper sprayer.  We put it on correctly, it was just defective!  The cost was over $4300.00 to fix all that went wrong with this leak from our toilet due to this sprayer. We originally purchased this because our daughter loves hers, so I know they are not all defective, but I must report on our issue.  This was a very expensive outcome!!
1.0	From the picture, you can not tell that it is VERY small; this item could be considered a keychain.  Also, the toy was opened and obviously used when we received it.  In addition to that, the item was not working - even after replacing the battery.  I was extremely dissatisfied and recommend that parents look elsewhere for a 'See N Say'.
1.0	I was excited when I seen someone came up with this awsome idea. But the 2 times I mixed the formula and tried feeding it to my baby. It was coming out the sides of the nipple I even gave it another chance, and tought maybe I didnt tighten the cap but it did it again. So I just returned it and got a full refund.
1.0	My husband and I were so very excited to have received this monitor as a gift at our baby shower. We were very impressed with all the features it had. Once we actually were able to use the monitor, we were disappointed in the constant clicking noise it made. As well as the volume knob did not alter the volume very well. We even took the original one back thinking that the volume knob was broken, but the 2nd one did all the excact same things as the first. We were dissapointed as we really liked this monitors features. We did finally return this monitor and excahnged it for the Fisher Price Vibrating Monitor with 900 Mhz technology. We have had this one for a month and are extremely thrilled how it has performed. Great monitor for $10 less.
1.0	bought this for my granddaughter And it's at a seamstress for adjustment.  The holes for the baby'so legs are too small.  This is made for slim babies.
1.0	I purchased this pump for the occasional use. I am a stay at home mom but wanted the freedom to go out for more than 2 hours every once in a while. After using this pump 15-20 times over several months, milk started leaking through the battery chamber. It lost all suction after that happened. I called the First Years to send me replacement parts or a replacement pump and they told me that it was beyond its 90 day warranty. THEY WILL NOT BACK THEIR PRODUCT EVEN IF THERE IS A FACTORY DEFECT!! I am very dissapointed in the company as well as this pump!! I will not purchase anything else made by the 1st years (if I can help it), and I HOPE THAT THEY DONT GET OVER ON YOU TOO! ***What a waste of money***
1.0	"It is disgusting this product exists.<br />Excerpt from [...]<br /><br />\\""Studies have shown that excessive media use can lead to attention problems, school difficulties, sleep and eating disorders, and obesity. In addition, the Internet and cell phones can provide platforms for illicit and risky behaviors.<br /><br />Television and other entertainment media should be avoided for infants and children under age 2. A child's brain develops rapidly during these first years, and young children learn best by interacting with people, not screens.\\""<br /><br />So, with this information available by the American Academy of Pediatrics, why does this product exist?"
1.0	I purchased the Aspen stages crib about two years ago.  More than a week ago, the mattress base bracket broke while my son was in it.  The company's customer service is totally unprofessional.  Unbeknonsted to me, these brackets were recalled in January and after telling them that my son has no where else to sleep, I am still waiting(3/3/09) for the brackets to be shipped.  Just calling the company requires about a 20 minute wait on hold.  I was sent an email saying it would be shipped first come first serve, even after telling them that my son was without a bed because their product was faulty.    It is a shame because the crib itself is beautiful and decent craftsmanship.  It was a bit cumbersome to assemble, so count on putting some time into assembly.
1.0	Noneed of the test worked
1.0	Horrible. Nothing good to say about the walker. I loved the idea that it was ocean themed, however it is unsturdy. It wobbles and has poor support. It does not go on carpet...even low pile commercial quality carpet. It was even hard to skoot in on hardwood floors. I returned it and hope the new one is better
1.0	What a disappointing piece of junk. Out of the box, it only worked sporadically, despite my fiddling with the batteries, testing them, etc. Worse, the sound (when it does work) is AWFUL, grating and in no way representative of the instruments pictured. I wish I had checked out the one-star reviews and listened to the sample first. My husband and I immediately decided to deep-six this item and never let it see the light of day. If you are a music lover (esp. classical) stay far, far away from this.
1.0	very bad material, smell very bad<br />not good at all
1.0	I purchased these in an attempt to find some relief for my sore nipples during the first few weeks of breastfeeding, however, I never used them because they were too big to fit in my bra and they made me look like I had huge tumors on the end of my breasts so there is no way I would wear them in public.  Also, the instructions say that you can only wear them for 40 minutes at a time because they can reduce your milk supply--not something you want to be doing during the first weeks when you're trying to get your milk supply up.
1.0	The cushion on this potty is like a sponge that absorbs any of the waste a child makes. Once it's in there, you can't get the smell out no matter how much you wash. <br /> <br />The shield does not work for a boy.  <br /> <br />The potty cannot be used without the cushion so now it's useless. <br /> <br />The actual seat area is for a child with a very small bottom. My son is a little over two and it's too small for him.
1.0	You have to slide the case off a little in order for it to fit on the charging station. Don't waste your money on this case or monitor.
1.0	The first time I used these, milk stated to backwash into the tubes, which caused mildew to grow into my tubes. Do not buy these. Buy the real version straight from Medela! Don't waste your $$.
1.0	It's no the same of the description is diferent color, diferent sticker and not to strong to support baby weight
1.0	No directions on how to use it and poorly made material
1.0	These don't work with my Ameda pump. They just don't seem to fit properly and the suction was very weak. Don't waste your money.
1.0	I love the look of these knee pads, but as other reviewers have mentioned, these do not stay in place when my son crawls around.  Also, babies actually crawl on the top part of their shins, not directly on their knee-caps where the silicone is placed.  I had a decent amount of luck with the Safety First knee pads that cost about $5.
1.0	The bottom is SO slippery. I had to hold my poor baby still to bathe her because she just slides all over the place. It doesn't stay inflated and offers very little back support if my baby leans against it. You get what you pay for!
1.0	This case is extremely small.  I read other reviews stating this but purchased it for my 11 year old daughter to pack her few toiletry items thinking it might be ok since she only has a few small items.  The case will not fold/close after putting the items in.  The picture is very misleading, showing large bottles in the pockets.  You can fit some bottles in the pocket but you will not be able to zipper the case to close it.  It also is not very wide. If you need a hanging make-up case for small, flat items this could work.  I wish it was bigger.  They really need to change the photo's, because I feel it doesn't represent the case honestly.
1.0	complete piece of junk.  literally fell apart after a few minutes after using.
1.0	Waste of money.  It just stuck to my kid's skin.  We had fun, but we didn't get to create the ornament.
1.0	Price is good but it came off so easily. I am looking for other sets to replace it. Not recommend.
1.0	hard as a rock. returned it bought the spring mattress. much better
1.0	arrived late and two small for a toddler. it's a better fit for an infant under the age of 6 months.
1.0	We received this as a gift and did not realize that the cover is not machine washable?!  Within the first week, my daughter had spit up on it multiple times and had a diaper accident.  Not a good long-term item and considering it is not inexpensive, I would skip it next time.   BTW- I called Combi to give feedback and inform them and they were unhelpful and not concerned with my lack of satisfaction with their product.
1.0	I have always liked thermos products. Owning a number of them throughout the years. My experience with this particular thermos foogo product as well as my experience with their customer service has given me a bad taste for thermos products in general. When we received this product I did notice (as other reviewers noted) that the suction was rather strong, making it harder for the kids to get the juice out. But they acclimated and were able to successfully master the tricky spout. I give sippies to my kids at night so if they wake they can have a drink or if they are thirsty in the morning they can have a drink upon waking. After a couple of uses I began to realize that each morning the apple juice had turned sour and fermented (don't know how much of that spoiled juice my kids actually consumed.) I figured that the strange suction must somehow be creating a fermentation type effect, so I just stopped giving my kids these cups at bedtime and went back to our old sippy cups. However, I continued to use them during the day. After several weeks my husband gave them at bedtime with the same result, spoiled juice in the morning. After another few weeks they were accidentally given the cups again, but this time the juice did not spoil and never spoiled again after that. This has seriously concerned Me because my original assessment about the strange suction causing the spoilage could not be accurate as the problem stopped after several weeks. So I realized that there must have been something in the manufacturing  process or In the cup's plastic in general that has caused the juice to turn sour. I was concerned, because although the juice stopped souring quickly in the cups, if it was the plastc material causing this, there could still be small amounts leaking into my kids beverage. I no longer felt safe giving my kids this plastic material. I figured, no problem, thermos is a well known, succesful , legitimate company. I would call thermos and make them aware of the situation and they would replace the plastic with something else to alleviate my legitimate concern! But, no! The MANAGER, Jennifer thomas,  spent the majority of the conversation insisting that their plastic cups were safe and detailing the types of plastic they use and explaining why they were under NO obligation to replace this unsafe (safe, according to her) plastic cup with a cup of made of a safer material (like its stainless steel counterpart). Information that isn't relevant, because it still doesn't explain why their cups soured my kid's juice. They refused to replace these plastic cups with something else. And it wasn't until I became insistent and belligerent did she finally offer to write up an incident report. I was told i would be contacted about the incident. I am waiting to hear from them to see of they will offer me any sort of resolution or if they will continue to act like I am some neurotic parent who has no legitimate concern. I also have learned from other reviews that apparently there is a known concern with the plastics made by Eastman, the company that produces the plastics for thermos' plastic sippy cup! Shame on you thermos!
1.0	The chair broke within two months of use! This is a very bad quality piece of furniture. Very disappointed.
1.0	I wanted so much to have a sweet, little mobile for my daughter.  I found this one and thought it was perfect!  The entire thing broke immediately.  Extremely shoddy.
1.0	I bought the Safe Sippy because it is made from safe materials and keeps the liquid cold. It really does keep the milk cold, but it leaks terribly. Even with the ring and valve in correctly, it leaks from both the seal and spout constantly. It's a huge mess. I'm really disappointed after spending so much on one cup.
1.0	very bad, my baby can not find hi balance when we are walking him. he is doing excellent when we are holding hands but not great when we use this product.
1.0	"The camera unit works fine however the unit we received had a defective battery that couldn't be charged.  Lorex customer service routed the call to a foreign country.  The agent said he was going to \\""escalate our case\\"" but we never heard back.  The product is OK but the initial quality is poor and the customer service even worse.  We returned the unit and bought one from another manufacturer.  Buyer beware!"
1.0	I was surprised to see that customers had success using this monitor.  Perhaps it has to do with the depth of the babies breathing.  After a very scary pregnancy and prolonged stay, I brought me preemie home from the hospital.  I am constantly frightened that he may quit breathing or something will go wrong.  This monitor went off so many times the first night I had to give up and shut it off.  Before I did though, I wanted to see if my baby was having apnea or not so I layed my hand on him so I could feel the breathing and the monitor was going off for no reason.  I tried adjusting it but nothing I did made any difference.  I had more piece of mind putting him in the bassinet & sleeping with one hand on him than using that monitor.  I am so dissappointed because I wanted it to work so badly so I wouldn't have to be afraid.
1.0	I was so excited when I purchased these. My four month old could only sleep when she was swaddled and she had finally outgrown her infant swaddle. The first night I used the leapord print one. She woke up SCREAMING. The material evidently does not breathe at all and her own body heat created an oven. She was drenched in sweat. The next night I tried the second one, it had a different feel to it. Maybe a different fabric? Same thing happened again. These swaddled actually helped us wean her from swaddling. Which made for a rough couple of weeks. I can't return them since I threw the packaging away. I won't even donate these.
1.0	This is basically a bag that you put your baby into.  The elastic sides close over the top of the baby as the mother moves and then she rebreathes the air trapped in the bag.  You wouldn't place a blanket or pillow over your baby's face, so why would you do this with this carrier?  Check Consumer Reports for additional information, and take a look at other options if you want to carry your baby.  Hotslings, ring slings of various brands, wraps like Sleepy Baby or Moby Wrap or mei tais like Babyhawk and others are much safer options for your baby.
1.0	I wanted something different for my baby and he only like the hospital pacifiers so i thought he would like this but it was way to small and not worth the money....
1.0	Very generic, this scared my grandson and he LOVES Barney!
1.0	Poor range, quit working in the middle of first night. Difficult to set up. Unable to get video to stay on  Return was easy.
1.0	So cute - I took one picture of my kid in it.  Then I washed it.  The bib shrunk, but the &#34;tie&#34; picture was painted on, so that sorta crinkled up and looks like it might peel off.  Worse, the snap fell off.  Just fell off.  Complete waste of money!
1.0	This crib has a very bad oder.  Contacted the maker for assistance and found out that the smell is formaldehyde.  This chemical is not used in the USA anymore due to respiratory distress.
1.0	Rubber around hurts the skin and does not fit perfectly allowing for seepage. Too expensive with the American exchange and costoms fees.
1.0	The design of these is a great idea (breast shield and valve in one piece), however the membranes aren't as good as the medela brand and don't make as good of a seal and the threading is very tight so it is very difficult to get medela bottles on and off the valve without splattering milk everywhere.
1.0	These were very disappointing!!!! They say glitter, but they don't actually have glitter on them like you would see on an appliqué, it's like photocopied onto a sticker.... We were very disappointed!!! And I can't return them because she will be 1 month in a day!! 👎🏼😱😓
1.0	The worst quality ever seen. I've tried different brands and this one are smaller and have the worst quality I had ever seen.
1.0	After only 2 months it's started to leak.  We're going to throw it out and buy a different one.
1.0	Took exactly the same amount of time to warm up the milk bottle as putting it in boiled water - gave it away....
1.0	I thought I was getting 3 for the price, I only recieved one. I should have read you only get one and that is my fault. You can get 3 sassy brand dangles for 9.99 at Babies R Us, Sears, Walmart and various other stores.
1.0	First off putting this together was a nightmare. None of the pieces were labeled and all of the hardware was in one big bag so I had to do everything from the pictures. Second, a bunch of the holes didn't line up and one of the drawers isn't flush on the inside. The same drawer wobbles when you pull it out and the top one catches and you have to yank it to get it out. The cabinet on the side the shelves wobble and there is no catch for the door the shelves actually stop the door. I didn't order this from Amazon and I got the dresser/hutch combo for 300 some odd dollars and I wish I had not gone with this brand. It is all particle board with a wood veneer. That being said it works like crap but at least it looks good sitting there.
1.0	I understand the fork isn't sharp for safety reasons, but it is absolutely worthless.  The spoon is so flat that it barely holds anything either. If your baby has a steady enough hand to use the spoon, you can be assured that your baby is coordnated enough not to poke his/her eye out with a fully functioning fork.
1.0	Our daughter likes a lot of musical toys, and seems to have a real knack for music. (She loves her piano and xylophone.) However, she has hated this toy from the get-go. When I first presented this toy to her, she immediately pushed the button once, and immediately tossed it as far as she could. Apparently, that wasn't far enough, because she then proceeded to crawl to the toy, pick it back up, just to throw it further away. This is only one of few toys that she has done this with. It's puzzling to me because I really think the music this thing plays is quite descent, not nearly as annoying as some other toys, and the song selection is good. But it's her reaction that counts.<br /><br />P.s. I've presented this toy to her multiple times and have gotten the same reaction every, single, time. If i put it in her play pen, she would immediately find it, and toss it out of her pen. It's almost comical!
1.0	"This set, although very attractive, is completely non-functional. We got two, even though there was only one review, since the set looked nice and met our criteria.     Well, turns out the suction base is removable from the bowl, which means it doesn't actually suction if any air gets between the base and bowl (which will happen every single time my daughter pulls on it). I only give the bowl to her if I'm prepared to clean the table, floor, and her hair. Otherwise, I load a spoon and hand it over. We've used this from the time she was seven months til now-eleven months.    Also, the bendy cow spoon seemed like a good idea, but a bendy spoon in a parent-child tug of war, or just with a child, quickly becomes a food catapult. I hate when these are the only bowls/spoons still clean, and wish I'd sent them back. We've been \\""using\\"" them for months now."
1.0	If 0 stars were an option that's what I would rate this product.  Delivery required a signature with ID so my wife stayed home waiting all day and the gate arrived broken I need the gate asap to contain my newly mobile child so I didn't bother returning and zip tied it together. This product is a total waste of money look elsewhere
1.0	Very thin and you can see through it to whatever is on your mattress.  Don't buy this.  Go to Pottery Barn and get some on sale for the same price!
1.0	"I was really excited about this and it truly could have been a winner...I purchased this item for my 8 month old daughter and was extremely dissapointed with the crafstmanship.  It was packaged nicely so I did not suspect there would be problems...every piece was individually wrapped so to protect all of the wooden parts.  After unwrapping each piece I was shocked to find severe scratching to one entire side panel of the exterior side of the chair (where you can't just hide it).  I was equally dissapointed that on that same side the piece was not shaped correctly.  There were large gaps where the wood pieces should have fit flush together.  This was on the same side panel and was pre-made, so I could not undo it and fix myself.  I am extremely unhappy with this product...I would not go to a furniture store and say to myself \\""that is the one I want right there\\""  all banged up and misshapen.  I can't believe that this company does not have better quality assurance measures in place.  Whomever wrapped this bad boy clearly needs glasses.[[ASIN:B000JHM318 Excellante' Wooden High Chair, Mahogany]]"
1.0	Ridiculously thin cheap material... Definitely over priced.. Will not recommend this product. Save ur money!
1.0	I really regret of putting my daughter napping on this one. It works as a support, but it was made of cheap synthetic material and the color continue to fade after washes. After just spent 2 hours napping on this one, the back of my daughter's head turned red because of the color fading issue.
1.0	I agree with a couple of other reviewers that these are a fantastic product, but you should purchase them elsewhere if you get the chance.  I use these for my daughter and my sister liked them so much that she wanted them for her son.  I figured I could order exactly what she wanted reasonably on amazon.com.  Not true.  I can walk into at least 3 local stores and get these forks for about 1/3 to 1/2 the price shown here :(  Love amazon, but not enough to pay this much for this product~!
1.0	Received damaged. Had to return it
1.0	Too big to use as a corsage.NO!
1.0	When you pull the cord Nemo just spins in a circle on his side. Doesn't work very well at all.
1.0	I purchased this monitor based on the reviews on Amazon.com and CR.  Unfortunately, I have not found this product to be worthy of the ratings.  The highest volume setting is so low that we can only hear the baby when he is really crying.  At that point, I can hear him better from upstairs than I can with the monitor.  You have to hold the monitor up to your ear to determine whether they baby is fussing or not.  The parent unit should come with a set of headphones instead of the belt clip.  Avoid this monitor - I am currently searching for a new one.
1.0	I ordered  the letters for my daughter's name (Kiana) when package arrived both &#34;a&#34; were missing. But they arrived few days later. BUT the color of &#34;a&#34; was completely a different shade of white from the rest of letters! I'm very dissapointed and will return items as soon as I get a chance.
1.0	We're going on a vacation soon, and I wanted to debut this mirror as a new toy for my infant twins to enjoy on the long car trip. I don't usually go in for toys that light up and/or play electronic music, but I figured that under the circumstances it might be a nice treat for the babies. It was an impulse purchase while I was at the store stocking up for the trip. <br /> <br />Tonight, I loaded the batteries into the remote and the mirror, and pressed the button on the remote just to see what we were in for in terms of the music. Nothing happened. I checked the switch and the volume; again, nothing happened. I checked the batteries, and switched some batteries out for other ones. Still nothing. <br /> <br />Convinced that I must be doing something wrong, I called the 800 number on the box. Once I was transferred to the customer service department, the operator made sure I'd checked the batteries and switched it on properly. After confirming that I'd taken these steps, she told me that they would be FedExing me a new product within a few days, along with a label so that I could return my original to them without cost. I was surprised at how quickly they offered to replace the product until I read the reviews on Amazon! Apparently, lots of folks have problems with it and rather than fix the flaws or design a product that actually works 100% of the time, it's easier just to mail out replacements. <br /> <br />A pox on impulse purchases! I wanted this mirror for a trip we'll be on when the replacement product arrives. If I'd done the homework I usually do I would *never* have bought this lousy thing in the first place. Ugh. <br /> <br />Fisher-Price is no longer a trusted name, as far as I'm concerned. The product rates one star only because I couldn't give it zero. <br />
1.0	Mirror is not very good. It is a distorted reflection.
1.0	"Did not work at all!  had to return it!  We prefer the \\""Tinkle Toons\\"" potty with a moisture sensor.  the motion sensor on the royal potty did not work!"
1.0	Won't stay up, constantly falling down.<br />No matter where/how we positioned the mirror, the car seat handle was in the way of seeing the baby's face - but that part probably isn't the mirror's fault.
1.0	I am very disappointed with this product!!! On one side of the rocker, there are no threads to form screws. I do not recommend this product!!! Too often, manufacturers cause us unnecessary stress!!! Anyways who cares? Amazon? No!! The manufacturer? No!!
1.0	We bought this stroller before the birth of our daughter.  Initially, we loved this product.  Recently, our daughter had one of the red rings on the harness straps lodged in her throat (there are 3 rings that dangle in front of the occupant).  This plastic ring cut off all oxygen and she was choking.  The red rings are slightly larger than the size of a quarter and are used to tighten the harness straps.  Our daughter turned a shade of deep purple before we successfully removed the ring allowing her to breathe again.  We were terrified, and thankfully our daughter was not seriously injured.  When we contacted BOB to alert them of the problem, they blamed our 5-month-old baby.  We have filed an official complaint with the Consumer Product Safety Commission and asked they investigate this product.  Please, for the safety of your children, take a pass on this product.
1.0	I ordered this toy organizer despite the bad reviews because my co-worker has one and loves it. Unfortunately, it did not stick to our bath tiles and kept falling even with very little bath toys inside. I ended up returning it.
1.0	Except for the fact that this is priced really low, I could not find any other reason for getting this monitor. It was a good thing that we got it as a gift. After using it, we thought of keeping our Fisher Price monitor in the registry.<br />Some of the problems with this monitor are:<br />- generally flimsy construction.<BR>- lack of a clip or a flat base on both receiver and monitor. Makes it really difficult to place it somewhere.<BR>- because of the level of white noise you have to keep the volume up quite high<BR>- since there is no visual indicator of the noise level, you have no option but to listen to the hissing and strain hard to hear if it was your baby crying.<br />I think the Fisher Price models are a much better option.
1.0	Love the nuk learners but for some reason this specific one is terrible. The spout keeps morphing and popping out so my son can't use it. Buy the nuk learners with the clear spouts. They hold their shape better!
1.0	A pillow case would be better. This was too small for anyone nursing. Fabric was too thin and too rough
1.0	So very disappointed in this toy box. The pre drilled holes didn't line up at all and, after drilling our own holes to get it together, the hinges don't let the top close. For $100, I really thought it would be of decent quality, but I don't think we'll be able to use it at all. It's the worst purchase I've ever made on Amazon. Keep looking.
1.0	This is such an awesome toy. So great that I returned it and re-purchased after buying it the first time and it stopped working unexpectedly after a few weeks. Hoping to have better luck the second time, and didn't. Boo.
1.0	When we recovered the bed it only had 7 slats instead of 8. Also there were no instructions for assembly.
1.0	As many others have written this product is NOT safe for wood furniture.  Whe we removed it it actually pulled the finish off of a brand new Crate and Barrell table we had.  Using several different solvents, a nylon pot scraper, about two rolls of paper towels, and a LOT of elbow grease I was able to get the massive amount of remaining adhesive off without doing further damage.  Although the company does include a short disclaimer about how they are not liable for damage to tables, elswhere in the packaging materials it clearly states that the product CAN be used on wood furniture.   They even show the product on a wood table in their advertising! I can't state emphatically enough that this product WILL damage your table - only use it on wood furniture you don't care about.
1.0	Unfortunately, I requested this item twice and I never received the ones I wanted.  I requested the pacifiers for a girl and I kept receiving for boys.  It was suppose to be a gift for a baby shower.
1.0	I purchased this item from Amazon on 11/28/12 as a gift. My daughter has one and loves it (I purchased hers at a toy store in Chicago). When this Sophie arrived it looked totally different than my daughters. The colors looked faded, the material feels thin and the serial number on the back is very obviously fake. The real Sophie has an almost powdery feeling to it when you first get it. It has a serial number on the back of one of the legs which is RAISED not stamped into it. It feels much thicker and more sturdy than the one that Amazon sent. Even the booklet included with the amazon Sophie was an obvious copy and not an original print. My suggestion: forget saving $2 and drive to the local baby toy store and buy it in person. The ones from Amazon are fake.
1.0	I bought this for my daughter and husband's first baby, a boy.  They are avid Vikings fans, but when they opened it up, the football which hangs in the center of the mobile was missing, very disappointed!  The football was a major figure in this mobile too.  I'm not sure if I'll order another.   It was very cute, but a major part missing!
1.0	I loved the hat, color was perfect, but it was crumpled beyond recognition.  It can't be worn, it should have been put in a box instead of a plastic bag for shipment.  Such a shame, I was looking forward to getting this hat.  I'm not going to try to return it, too much trouble, but I wanted you to know my disappointment.  I/m at home now and the hat is at my job, I will send a picture tomorrow.
1.0	It doesn't work. I wouldn't recommend it, is dangerous to trust this product and then breastfeed your baby because the results are never correct.
1.0	It fits the pump but does not suction correctly. It is good if you don't have anything else but does not work properly.
1.0	Spend the extra money and get the full size. I'm 5'2&#34; and this pillow was just too small. I sent it back and got the full size. It is much better.
1.0	This tub has disaster written all over it.  We bought the tub for my oldest daughter who is now 4.  We proceeded to keep using this terrible tub for my second daughter who is 18 months younger and had so many problems.  First the non-slip issue.  Yes, they slip and yes we did have to use a towel under them to keep them in place because when they were able to sit if they slipped the bar would go right between their legs.  Now in my opinion if you have to rig a tub up with a towel to make it safe why buy it in the first place when their are so many other alternatives.  The second issue with this tub is it does not fit in a sink so you will eventually break your back bending over all the time to give your baby a bath in the bathtub.  <BR>    Now I have a 6 month old little boy and finally got smart and bought a new tub.  In the companies defense they finally got smart and came out with what I think is the best tub on the market.  If you need an alternative to this awful creation you should really think about buying the first years Sure Comfort Deluxe newborn to toddler tub.  It fits in a single or double kitchen sink and has a netting to cradle your newborn.  This tub has another plus, it's CHEAPER than the good old disaster tub.
1.0	The sound activation feature didn't work, which was the main reason we got it. We literally had to scream to get it to turn on and even then it rarely worked and never did from our baby's crying. Amazon sent a replacement, but same issue.
1.0	The box it came in was beat up and decal had water damage. No issues for a replacement. The name decal would not come off of paper no matter how hard I pressed on it with credit card. It ended up ripping in several places when I tried to put up & ended up just throwing it away.
1.0	This extension is not the correct height for the North States Industries Supergates we purchased from Amazon.
1.0	This print is copyrighted by GroVia and is being sold illegally. These diapers are also not CPSIA compliant. These made in China diapers work ok for a while but they do not hold up to multiple washings like higher quality diapers do
1.0	WOW! I'm currently shopping around and have seen this bath seat for $29.99. Please research before you buy this for over twice what other shops' price!
1.0	Not like the picture.  Its long..very long even with straps adjusted it hung to my knees and im 5'0 tall. No matter  how I adjusted it the baby's face was still up against the fabric. I like that it has a seat belt but that's the only good thing. Waste of $
1.0	They worked decently well for about two weeks, but they kept swiveling open too easily, so one finally fell off during a time I was collapsing/loading the stroller in my car. I didn't notice until I got to my next destination and my diaper bag doesn't feel secure with just one hook (and it's just a matter of time before that one falls off too). I'm ordering some clips that attach with velcro and hope that those stay on better.
1.0	unclear description. 2pack doesn't mean 4 nipples. They sould describe 2 nipples instead of 2 pack!!! It wasnt  worth it ($9.50) for 2 nipples!!!
1.0	I have purchased two of the Ultra CarGo seats and promptly returned both.  The tightening strap mechanism is awful.  The plastic piece falls off when tightening it, making it near impossible to snug it sufficiently.  I thought it was just a default w/ the initial seat I bought, and I had liked the other features.  But I have since bought another one and the same exact thing has happened.<br />Save yourself the $.  Not a good seat.
1.0	I ordered this because it got a lot of gresr reviews from other moms. My daughter is four months and is transitioning out of a swaddle and doesn't sleep well without a swaddle. We tried the magic suit for over a week now and she wakes up just as often as she would if she wasn't swaddled.  Maybe the suit is too large for it to work? Were going to keep trying hoping she gets use to it.
1.0	First off, this contraption is a pain to put on. You have to struggle to zip it up and get it on properly. after 1 use I found myself preferring to just hold the pumps with one arm and type with one hand rather than spend 5 or more minutes strapping the dang thing on.<br /><br />It is also uncomfortable. I felt stifled because of the thick fabric, and worst of all, this thing hangs from the upper area and provides zero support to your boobs. The bottom is loose and just hangs out. A better designer would have designed this with a stretchy fabric (or something) underneath to provide support underneath the boob and push the whole area up.<br /><br />I wanted to like this, I really did. It would have been glorious if I could have used this and have both hands free to type!!
1.0	My son is an average sized boy, but will reach 40 pounds probably several months before he's likely to hit 43 inches tall.  The result: I have to buy a new car seat to hold him untill he's tall enough to use this seat as a belt positioning booster.  That's what their customer support line told me.  Apparently, the harness is only safe to 40 lbs, but the seat isn't safe to use as a belt positioning booster till they're 43 inches tall.  On top of that, the straps are a nightmare to adjust every time you buckkle your child in.  I hate this car seat.  I bought it because it was supposed to be the only one I'd ever need, but after needing the baby carrier and now an interum seat, I would have been better off buying almost any other seat on the market!
1.0	It sucks it stopped working right after 2 weeks
1.0	Really great image and quality BUT didnt have too good signal. Im at just 25ft distance from my babys room and didnt get signal. Box says 400ft but its not true. Me room is in the same level than my babys room, but still didnt get the signal. :(
1.0	I got this one for my little one and am not happy with it. This is so thin and delicate and am sure it is not going to last long. But exceptional service by Amazon, they deliverd it on 2nd day. Shipping so fast.
1.0	These make my baby REALLY gassy. We didn't use them a ton since she breastfeed but it didn't take long to realize if she had a bottle at night she always was up crying in an hour with a gas bubble in her belly. There is no way for air to get back into the bottle as she drinks. We ended up trying a ton of different bottles trying to find one that worked for her. Ended up with Dr Brown, which I hate because there are a ton of parts, but baby not waking up with gas definitely out way cleaning annoyances.
1.0	Was really excited about this product and had put it on my registry. When I got it, it looked like it would work. Fell apart a week later when it was due for wash. The semicircular boning collapsed and thus did  not serve the purpose. I continued to use it despite the floppy boning. But now after 6 months of intermittent use, i would not suggest buying it.
1.0	I returned this monitor after testing it for a few days... and the only reason I had it THAT long was because I was testing it in every room of the house and at different times of day. The picture was terrible, and with all of the static, the audio part was worthless. It didn't matter what room it was in, the range level, time of day, whether the other household electronics were on or off (although I must say any monitor that requires you to unplug your telephone is worthless). Don't waste your money.
1.0	Very decepointing! Spills half of the time... We bought Tommee Tippee afterwards and not once does a botle spill, so clearly the Avents were the problem.
1.0	The one star is mostly due to Customer Service.  I have emailed Foscam twice and haven't received a response yet.  The little kickstand on the back (which is flimsy) broke about 2 months after getting the monitor.  Being that I just bought the monitor, I am extremely unhappy that I will need to go the next three years or so without the kickstand!  Foscam, if you read this, please contact me about a replacement!<br /><br />For the monitor itself, I give it two stars. I do like the pan feature and the picture is pretty crisp.  Some things I do not like are the auto on/off.  When the window air conditioner is on, the picture will not stay off because once it &#34;hears&#34; a noise, the picture clicks on.  In my opinion, I wouldn't change the sensitivity for this because I am afraid then I won't hear the baby when I'm asleep.  I rather be in charge of when you see the picture and when you don't but be able to hear the baby the whole time whether the picture is on or off (this is the way my old Summer Infant monitor worked).<br /><br />That brings me to the second issue...the battery.  At night, I leave it plugged in so that's fine, but it barely gets through a nap, never mind two naps in one day!  And then it beeps when the battery is down to 20%, further decreasing battery power.  Temperature reading seems to be accurate.  My baby is only 4 months old so we haven't used the talk-to feature yet so I can't provide a review of that feature.  Lastly, the zoom only goes to very close up and then out again.  There is no gradual zoom.
1.0	I love making baby food for my little one until I have to remove the cubes of food from these trays. My hands hurt after slamming the trays against the counter. I have to defrost the food almost completely and use a spoon in order to get the food out.<br />The fresh baby trays work a thousand times better and they take up less room in the freezer. Don't wasted your money on this product!
1.0	These didn't work for me. With the angled shields, I wasn't able to get much suction, and so I didn't produce as much milk. I don't love the standard Medela flanges either, but at least they succeed in extracting milk.
1.0	There really aren't any redeeming qualities about this stroller, other than what you could probably get in any other stroller on the market. Like others have mentioned, there is a major design flaw on the front wheel which causes it to shake violently. My husband and I have figured out that it's because the lug nut keeps loosening. When we tighten it, the shaking stops. However,  it doesn't take long before it's loose again. It loosens even quicker while jogging. Locking the wheel does help it to keep from wobbling, but the lug nut still loosens. The other issues include the rediculous puzzle-like strap system in the car seat, the bulkiness when folded (It's hard to even lift when folded, as there's no good place to grab), and overall it feels poorly made. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. I wish I had the receipt so I could return it. I hate it. I hate it. I hate it. It should be recalled for the wheel issue, because I could see that being a safety issue.
1.0	"Was buying additional blankets for my daughter and bought these. This \\""Aden\\"" version is a significant step down from the version I bought in a boutique. These are very rough and slightly smaller. What a mistake."
1.0	It is still in the box unopened.
1.0	we used it at the beginning but it was definitely pushing my baby's ear toward the outside, and it seems to me that they were starting to stay this way!! so I took it off, baby had a little beginning of flat head, so the pediatrician told us just to make baby sleep on each side night after night, that's completely sufficient, and baby sleeps actually better on the side!!  beside of that it seems well made...
1.0	The description says that batteries are included but I didn't get any batteries.  VERY DISAPPOINTING!  Now I have to spend an addition $10+ to get batteries for it when I just spent $60!  And Angel Care customer service was absolutely NO help at all and didn't give a crap that their product didn't have all the pieces to function.  I can't even say if the thing works or not because I haven't found any batteries for it in any of the stores around here.  It works as long as it's sitting in the cradle but it has to sit in there just right.  If it moves slightly it turns off.  Then I have to jiggle it around until it gets power again and then wait 15 mins for it to find the monitor in the baby's room again.  It's very frustrating and I will probably end up returning it.
1.0	Buyers beware!!!!  I wish I had read the review before purchasing!!!!  Buyers, learn from me and only purchase from Amazon, not others. This one is from Blancho Bedding, and the stickers are not large.  The paper is very wrinkled, and some of them are peeling off the backing, and I have not opened them yet.  Because they were not from Amazon, but this Blancho Bedding, I cannot return without paying shipping cost.  It cost me over $11 to learn this lesson...
1.0	"Parents please be aware that many studies show that the more television children under five watch the less likely they are to engage in creative play. (DVDS being basically the same thing).     Dimitri Christakis the director of the Child Health Institute at the University of Washington quoted in the book Parenting Inc, states: \\""Based on the research I have done there is reason to believe these products (DVDs for babies and toddlers) have a deleterious  (negative) effect on the developing mind\\""    Another quote, again from Parenting Inc.\\"" \\""There is no research to show that watching a screen is beneficial to a baby in any way, educational or otherwise. If anything it may be putting babies at risk\\"" \\""A two dimensional screen can never replace a real environment, rich in all five senses. Holistic play is what  develops the all the pathways to the brain.\\"" Alvin Poussaint, child psychiatrist  and director of the Media Center of Judge Baker's Children Center in Boston.     Please think twice about buying DVDS for a baby or toddler. Do the research, it's not a good idea. Stick to the old fashioned toys that engage kids in creative play - blocks, balls etc."
1.0	Don't buy this! Total waste of money. Chains always break. Drinks spill. Cups break. Such a mess. Sticks out so far you can't fit through standard doorways. Go with a Jolly Jumper or Joovy Organizer instead. Save yourself the headache.
1.0	I thought this was a great sippy cup until we act unused it. This cup is far from leak proof. As another reviewer noted, &#34;it leaks like a waterfall&#34; from under the lid. Also, I have 2 cups that are now completely useless because while attempting to wash the spouts I punctured one of the slats, thus combining it with the one next to it. Upon calling Playtex,  the only thing they could offer me was a coupon or two to buy more Playtex products.  I switched to Nuby...much more satisfied!
1.0	Wouldn't turn on and after multiple tries it would finally start then couldn't turn it off.  Frustrating!! I think I got the lemon!
1.0	The bib is fine until your baby insists on feeding him/herself or spits food back out. Then it slides all the way down past the pocket and onto his/her diaper bulge and lap or pants or the highchair seat because the pocket doesn't stay open. The pocket only catches about 10% of whatever falls its way which still leaves me with a baby who needs a complete bath after EVERY meal, and a full change of clothes because the food has soaked through the pants and the bottom of her onesie down to her diaper!
1.0	finite and very small towels cumplemis no expectations
1.0	Dear Supplier, we would like to alert you that these bags were made over two years ago. The manufacturer stated that these will expire in June on 2014 due to the fact that they were made with biodegradable additives. These bags do not have it's integrity as recommended by the manufacturer after expiration date. They should be discarded.<br /><br />Thank you.
1.0	The product vibrates like it says but also makes a loud noise when it vibrates. The noise and vibrations slowly die down after being used a short time. I would say the batteries died after about 7 hours of use (about a week). Putting in new batteries is annoying because you need a screw driver. Not worth the hassle!
1.0	Leaked through the very first time I wore these at night. As someone else had mentioned, after you wash them they come out completely misshaped. However, I really wouldn't have mind the odd shapes they shrunk to if they actually worked. Maybe they would be fine during the day, but definitely not for nighttime. I've never soaked through any other pads before so this was very disappointing.
1.0	Despite multiple attempts (with water, without water, etc.) I could never get this to stick at all.  Had to return it.
1.0	Sucks, hardly blows any air. Not worth it!!
1.0	Its ridiculous how Bob designed this new tray.  It has very little surface area so you better hope your child is nice and tidy when they eat snacks.  It is also ridiculously high.  I have a large 1 year old and its sits at his face.  Seriously.....this isn't rocket science......just make a large flat tray with a drink holder at the right height.  You'd think they were trying to design a space ship.
1.0	Sadly the sleeping bag came apart at the seams the second wash, second week of preschool. Fabric is this which is okay but low quality. Pillow is nice and soft though really tall to be used for someone with a tiny neck. Not something id buy again.
1.0	I'm pregnant and must have had my first round of &#34;pregnancy brain&#34; when I ordered this item as I had imagined that it could do a lot more than it does. $50 for oversized earbuds? Nope.  This product does nothing of any value. Returned it right away.
1.0	The hook is so bad it does not work anymore after using it in the stroller for one month.
1.0	they leak everywhere and the flow is too fast so the milk leaks out of her mouth.  We won't be using these again
1.0	Too complicated and takes forever in the Cuisinart Baby Food Maker. It is much easier to freeze in ice cubes, transfer to freezer bags, and reheat in the microwave!
1.0	We ordered this to treat an inverted nipple condition.  Unfortunately, this product isn't it.  The inverted nipple shells are similar, but with a small opening.  If you want inverted nipple shells, you need a different product.  We're going to return this one.
1.0	We used this bottle brush for about 3 weeks and it was ok.  It did the job, nothing fancy.  Then I noticed some black flecks at the bottom of my baby's bottles (on the inside).  At first I couldn't figure out what it was, I thought it was mold. (EEEK!).  But after numerous attempts to clean the spots and some investigative work, I determined that the spots were caused by this bottle brush.<br /><br />The bristle core is made of metal wire wrapped in plastic.  After constant use, the plastic on the tip had worn off, leaving the metal exposed.  Each time I was plunging the brush into the bottle to clean, the metal was scraping the bottom of the bottle.<br /><br />It's not like I was using a lot of force, either.  Just normal, average daily use.<br /><br />Needless to say, I was not excited about the idea of any metal markings left on the inside of my kid's bottle.  Not only because of any leaching (no matter how miniscule) which may occur, but now the bottles are damaged, too.<br /><br />Lesson: stick with bottle brushes that don't use wire.  The [[ASIN:B0009ET49K Philips AVENT BPA Free Bottle Brush]] and [[ASIN:B0038JDVCE OXO Tot Bottle Brush with Nipple Cleaner and Stand, Orange]] brushes are plastic cores and you will not have this problem.  (But only use the OXO if you use wide neck bottles - see my OXO review for more details)
1.0	I have twins and I used this once. Thank God my mom was visiting, because we had to hold and watch each baby very close. Babies are 5 months and this pillow is not giving any support, seat is huge and it sinks. You cant even take it out of tub when is wet because is soooo heavy!!! worst item ever!!!!!
1.0	So out of alignment one leg is over an inch off the floor.  Floor is level, chair is terrible.  Debating returning
1.0	"I paid good money for these bottles ... I think Avent is a great product ... however the bottles I DO NOT like! Everyone that has bought them (that I know) have said the same thing. Some people say you have to listen for the \\""seal\\"" when you putting the cap on the bottle.I must not be doing it right, cause it still leaks. I end up having to change my son (if I did not notice the leak). It becomes real irritating especially when you are out and about. So overall.. not I would not suggest these bottles. Born free bottles I have had better luck with :)"
1.0	This car seat is not made for babies larger than 8 pounds. Every time we put my daughter in the seat she screams. She is squashed in the seat. She has no room to move her head and her shoulders do not rest comfortably. We are very disappointed with this product. She is now 14 pounds and 4 months old. I can no longer use this car seat.
1.0	"We bought GroVia AIOs because we were looking for an easy way to cloth diaper.  We have 1 baby and we thought that if we made the investment to get a lot and were very careful to properly care for the diapers, we would be able to use them for a future child.  We bought 24 newborn AIO, which lasted us 2.5 months and 30 regular AIO diapers.<br /><br />After only 8 months of use, the regular AIO diapers are getting holes in the legs and the back where the elastic is bunching.<br /><br />Let me emphasize that we have been very careful to follow all GroVia's instructions in caring for our diapers.<br /><br />We even spoke to a woman in our parenting community who is known as a cloth diaper expert and owns a store that sells GroVia  (she was the one who originally recommended GroVia to us), and she assured us that we had a good number of diapers- certainly enough to last through one child. Since the diapers started showing this wear after only 8 months, we were concerned that they might not make it through to potty training.<br /><br />We contacted GroVia as did our local expert, in fact, and Grovia told us that the solution is to buy more diapers, specifically to \\""increase our 'stash' to 38 - 50 diapers to avoid premature wear.\\""  As our expert said to us \\""that's crazy!\\"" It definitely is for the price of the diaper.<br /><br />So, please beware in buying these expensive diapers that you need to buy a ridiculous number or they will suffer from wear after only a short time, and GroVia won't replace them under the warranty.  If we had known this before we bought the diapers, we would have gone with another brand."
1.0	Item arrived and first it was very hard to put together! Second I was sent two left sides! Really needed a left and right side! Had to return and purchase from somewhere else cause my granddaughter was sleeping on the floor!
1.0	these said they would fit the medella pump in style, but didnt.
1.0	I have twin girls and thought that this would be a great stroller for them.  I figured they could face eachother and they would enjoy that.  This stroller is awful.  It's impossible to steer when there is a baby in the front seat.  If I only have one of them in it and she is in the back seat then it steers just fine.  It is very cumbersome.  I dare you to make it through the narrow aisles at the library!
1.0	This stroller is bulky and unwieldy.  Minutes after putting it together, the right mud flap fell off and won't stay in place.  I have had multiple strollers including a Bob, a McClaren, a Chicco, and a Graco.  This is by far the worst stroller I have owned.
1.0	broke after 1 day of use. really poorly made and designed. I would never buy this or recommend it to anyone
1.0	I found this very difficult for adults to open the  doors with this. We found cheaper ones that work much better
1.0	I ordered 4 of these, two for each car.  The buckles had the chrome flaking badly....first sign of poor quality.  The purple is ridiculous, why not make black also?  The rivet fell off another one.  Now I was really not wanting to put my kids life in the hands of these items.  The springs are weak and flimsy.  Pathetic quality for the price.  Once installed, I could not really see any improvement over the lap belt only.  I did the test like one of the videos I saw, where they shake the seat around a lot and wiggle the belt loose.  Maybe if you were driving off road, that may happen, but in the real world with an accident it is usually one impact....unless you roll over I guess.  Anyway, I sent all 4 of mine back and received a refund.  I have purchased many items from Amazon and this is the first time that I have ever returned an item.
1.0	I bought this shield 2 years and a half ago for our trip to Disney, Orlando, FL. It worked amazing and l could easily fold it for storage, BUT I LOST IT in Orlando, so l decided to buy it again in amazon and l found &#34;a big problem&#34; -for me-. The plastic is not very flexible and it is impossible to fold it for storage on its bag or wherever it unfolds by itself and becomes a bulky thing. l have no idea why the plastic of this shield had a different quality and even the size was slightly smaller.<br />l took too long to write a review because l had not used it since l bought it.
1.0	I couldn't hear anything but static even at 31 weeks. It couldn't even pick up my heart beat. Waste of money. I bought mine at Babies R us and quickly returned it.
5.0	Dark brown almost black color. I mix this with Stevia powder and almond milk and make sugar free chocolate milk every day. Love it!!!
5.0	Very delicious! Like the fact that they are individually wrapped. Would order again.
5.0	I've used this formula for two of my kids and it has been great. My son had problems with constipation while he was on another organic formula but never had problems with Earth's Best. We are just starting to transition my youngest to formula as the pumped breastmilk runs out and she seems to be doing just fine. I know some people have concerns regarding traces of hexane, and concerns about formula in general, but my kids are great. Very healthy, intelligent, happy, and strong.
5.0	Umm it's Hershey bars...how can they not be five stars?  No problems with melting on any of my orders.
5.0	LOVE this product and so does my grand daughter!!
5.0	I blend my own coffee beans as I like a hearty, dark roast with solid body.  This bean works very well for me in creating a great pot of coffee.  It brews extremely well in a french press or espresso machine. If you also like to blend your own coffee beans you will find that it has the rich, warm tone needed to enhance the flavor of french roast, columbian and other dark roast beans.
5.0	I have discovered the dressing and love it!!! This has lots of flavor without the calories, I use all the different flavor.  My new addiction!!
5.0	Good! We like coconut oil for everything.
5.0	I thought my world of pancakes and cookies was over until I found this mix. Holy cow, this mix makes the best pancakes and chocolate chip cookies ever! There are several easy recipes on the side of the bag and I've found the flavor of everything to be equal to the beloved wheat recipes I used to use. I'm so happy I can eat my favorites again!
5.0	Yum. Short, Sweet, and Savory.
5.0	Got this as a gift for my mom and she loves it! A local coffee shop stopped carrying banana coffee and it was her favorite and she says this one is even better! Good amount for the price as well.
5.0	Great price & quick delivery!
5.0	I have tried both the mild and medium hot S&amp;B Golden Curry mixes from my local grocery store and they are wonderful. The instructions on the back of the box are easy to follow and so in a relatively short period of time you have a delicious meal that can serve several or last over the course of several meals. While it is of course best fresh, it stores well for a few days if necessary.
5.0	This flavor will be a constant in my home.
5.0	Delicious all natural cereal.
5.0	For the most part the taste is sweet, but it has a nice taste coupled with the pecans added in. Still, if you don't like a sweet tasting cereal then it probably would be wise to get a different cereal from Nature's Path, as sometimes the taste can be a little bit much in sweetness. At times though I wished there was more a even distribution of pecans, but it varies from package to package, as one package didn't have that many, while another was more even, but still a great cereal.
5.0	Great product. THanks for carrying it! Fine seller!
5.0	This soda was all that I expected and more! I really really really hope Surge makes a comeback!!!!
5.0	Strong coffee without any bitterness. I brew each pod twice (1 - 8oz and 1 - 6oz) to fill up my travel mug and its not watered down at all.
5.0	As in other reviews i have done.. i recommend this stuff to everyone... Its the best sauce not only for steak, but for burgers, chicken and pork!
5.0	It you like oatmeal and want to have a healthy breakfast this is for you.  I add blueberries to it and it tastes good.  I like a hot healthy meal for breakfast and this is what I have most mornings.
5.0	We sent this to our son who is deployed in the MIddle East. He got it<br />in 8 days and loved it..
5.0	Good blend of organic herbs. The citrus and ginger add a full flavor to the Guayusa, also adding lighter notes from the citrus and spicy notes from the ginger. I prefer the plain Guayusa, though this blend is also unique.
5.0	If you want to feed your squirrels you need to buy a lot of these because they go through them pretty fast.
5.0	Taylors of Harrowgate puts out a Yorkshire red. A strong, plain tea that is wonderful and mellow. The foil bags containing delicious loose tea are promptly mailed when ordered. Th price is right. If you are not in a large metropolitan area with a British contingent, this is the place to get your tea.
5.0	it was very good and filling
5.0	Delightful and delicious!
5.0	My friend loves this coffee!
5.0	Great way to buy coffee for  your Keurig coffee maker. Buying in quantity makes sense  and it is less expensive.
5.0	This is the best cereal ever, helps regulate insulin, good carbs, but the price on amazon is over 2x the price you can find it in the stores.  This is one item I will not be buying on Amazon
5.0	This tea cup makes drinking loose tea very simple. I developed a taste for gunpower green tea and tea bags are a completely different flavor. Its like comparing ground coffee to whole bean. Anyway, I experimented with a few brewing methods. This cup works the best. Once 4 minutes has past, I just lift the strainer and dump the loose tea in the garbage. It's no more difficult than throwing away a tea bag. The ceramic cover keeps the tea hot while brewing. Highly recommended!
5.0	I would really recommend this honey. It tastes great!
5.0	These Gluten Free Pizzelles are amazing. You won't believe they're Gluten-Free! They have an authentic homemade texture and taste wonderful. Even more amazing - they traveled from PA to CA without a single cookie breaking! Bravo, Bella Lucia! Bravo!
5.0	republic of tea never disappoints, the same holds true for this flavor. very good. the black tea isnt too strong and you can taste the almond and vanilla.
5.0	Yummy tasting Himalayan salt. Perfect crystal size for my salt shakers. Great price point.
5.0	We have tried many kinds of coffee and keep coming back to Newman's Own.  I love ordering from Amazon!  Coffee right to your door!  Can't beat that!
5.0	Good coffee no after taste low acid taste, one stars best try it u like,  go to a store and try it then buy it.
5.0	My family loves these! Even my pickiest eater will eat dinner with the family when Linketts are the main item on the menu, & in this larger size can we get 3 or 4 meals out of a single can (we pack some in zip bags with some of the liquid & freeze them)
5.0	I love the extra dark chocolate flavor.  I will definitely buy this product again.  It is very smooth throughout. I love the flavor.
5.0	Who doesn't love poptarts? This is a good price for them and comes conveniently packaged. I ship the whole box over to my troops in Afghanistan as a special treat from home.
5.0	Both my Husband & I really like this coffee. It's inexpensive. Good price on Amazon.
5.0	For a snack these are great, best little cookies I've ever eaten and my kids love them as each one gets his own package, no more fights. When we go hiking or biking there with us. Always have a few packs with us in the Van.
5.0	this is amazing, and very helpful for my depression.
5.0	It's really good and it isn't to sweat it's now one of my favorite kinds of candy.
5.0	taste great, great price.
5.0	I particularly like the  strong fruit flavors of this candy, especially the green apple.
5.0	I put them in my office and my customers are devouring them!  Well, the few that don't like licorice don't care for them.  If you like licorice flavored stuff, you'll probably love these.
5.0	Great product, nice price and super fast shipping would recommend, in fact I do recommend this product to anyone that desires this type of product. Makes a generous amount with the perfect mixture for fine tasting and looking popcorn.
5.0	My wife likes to have one cup of coffee in the morning and then drinks Decalf the rest of the day.  We both like a coffee that is bold and with lots of flavor.  This is the best we have found so far.
5.0	Delicious, fresh, and very festive. Great buy!!
5.0	My cake came out with a wonderful texture and flavor.  I could taste the difference between this and other varieties of Dutch cocoa.
5.0	A very tasty snack.  I bought some to have in my desk at work and in my car for an emergency.
5.0	Very tasty best salt around.
5.0	I love Jelly Beans and have purchased many pounds of them.  I am very glad I ordered these Gimbal's.  For many years I have thought that Jelly Belly beans were the best you could bye, but of course you had to pay a premium for them.  Gimbal's offers a product that is at least as good for 2/3 the price.  I highly recommend them.
5.0	I have this five stars even though, to my own personal taste, I much prefer the orange...but if you like lemon then you will probably enjoy this drink.  Its fizzy, not too sweet, made without high fructose corn syrup (real sugar!), and very very lemony.  In fact, its a touch too tart for me, which is why I prefer the orange San Pellegrino.<br /><br />This would make for a great mixer and it is nicely refreshing.<br /><br />Has about the same amount of calories as any regular soda, but again...no high fructose corn syrup and it actually has some juice in it.
5.0	Our newest addiction! Very good.
5.0	I've been turned off to tahini as products I've tried in the past have been bitter.  I saw this on vegan.com, thought I'd give it a try, am so glad that I did.<br /><br />Al Wadi tahini isn't bitter, likely as the sesame seeds aren't roasted before grinding them. I'm back to using tahini when I make hummus, and use this for a salad dressing and sauce I make all the time from recipes on theppk.com.  I buy it by the case as I really use that much of it, and like to occasionally give away a jar to friends trying one of the recipes that I frequently make.<br /><br />The containers are plastic, probably a good thing to prevent glass breakage with shipping.  The product is incredibly reasonable in price...I buy this using subscribe and save to ensure I never run out!
5.0	definitely good, can use with other things like ice cream etc.
5.0	I don't tend to like energy bars or anything like that but a friend of mine got me hooked on these. He started using them when he was training to go to boot camp, he needed to drop some weight, so he worked out and ate these. No matter how hungry I seem to be, if I eat one it'll keep me good for several hours because of all the protein. They don't taste like the typical meal/energy/snack/diet bar either, they actually are tasty! They're a wonderful snack, or a meal replacement if you're running late to work.<br /><br />I tried the other marathon bars, hoping that they would be as good, but so far nothing has compared to the peanut butter! Definitely worth a try.<br /><br />Only draw back is the price, I wish that they were cheaper. When I bought them direct from a local place it was $22, $25 does seem a bit high, especially with shipping, but I can't find them anywhere else around here.
5.0	Grand fan of Fever-Tree. I compare all other Ginger Beer's to Fever Tree - nothing has passed the test yet. Fever-Tree Ginger Beer rocks!
5.0	It's a big bag of skittles! Nothing bad I could possibly say. Plus it arrived fast.
5.0	I have been using these for just a short while so can't speak to longevity but I find them to be an excellent substitute for Kcups.  Much less expensive.  They are a little messy to clean up but not terribly so.  I would recommend them if you would like to save money, stay green and use your own coffee.
5.0	I love these and no calories!!
5.0	We learned of Uncle Dan's from a friend while we were traveling to Yuma, Arizona one winter several years ago.  We loved it and when coming home we could not find it anywhere on the shelf in stores so we had to buy it direct from the factory.  It has become our facorite dip for vegetables and chips.  It ia easily mixed with mayoniase and sour cream that is readily at all stores.  This year was the first time we noticed it on Amazon and ordered it.  We belong to Amazon Prime so as always Amazon came thorugh with us with free shipping in two day delivery.
5.0	When I saw theese online I just had to order one of my fondest memories of my father was when he would take me for a ride to Thrifty Drug .  We would always check out the candy bar aisle and he would always pick up the Rocky Road candy bar.  I am happy to say that these are exactly as I remember and what a great way to relive a fond memory.
5.0	My next door neighbor told me about Truvia so I gave it a try It is great and is just like real sugar Does not affect your blood sugar levels at all My order was prompt and fast I will definetely use this product for the future and the seller done a great job!!! Thanks
5.0	After reading &#34;Grain Brain&#34;, we are trying to cut gluten from our diets.  These are not only gluten free, but seem to be quite healthy.  Best of all, they are just delicious.  Our 3 year old granddaughter calls them chips & thinks she is getting a treat.
5.0	I like hard candies and love these.  The flavors are good, just like regular Life Savers.  I recommend them to all.
5.0	Breakfast blend is the only keurig coffee that I think tastes good.  The flavored coffees leave an<br />aftertaste and I really did not like them.
5.0	Totally addicting, wish they sold in stores..
5.0	Always a great flavor, no bitter taste.
5.0	We are great fans of Robnson's Lemon Barley Water, and my husband enjoys a glass - diluted with water - very meal.
5.0	Great option for those who don't like the taste of plain coconut water. The passion fruit is delicious and it tastes best when served ICE COLD.  Love to drink this before, during and post workout. Besides being a great hydrating tool, it helps avoid cramping as well.
5.0	suifable for older man
5.0	This stuff has some serious kick. When used as instructed it is very good, but if your proportions are off you'll know it. Quality product. Very nice.
5.0	great deal.  Mine arrived in good shape.
5.0	"these are terrific -- and a great deal when you buy 5-pounds.<br />the ad slogan \\""bet you can't eat just one\\"" was written for Chimes Ginger Chews."
5.0	Great snack for the kiddos!
5.0	This is my second order. After the first I was very satisfied with the quality and ease of use. Have tried other non brand products with poor results including rejection by the printer. These refills are seamless and easy to use.
5.0	I love this popcorn combination. I use it in an electric popcorn popper using coconut oil. I won't ever buy other popcorn again.
5.0	OK, so I don't like this stuff -- but my hubby sure does!!  SPAM, as he realizes, is a guilty pleasure -- but he feels a little less guilty with the single pack, which provides portion control.  He feels even less guilty with the Lite version (and the Weight Watchers points are lower, too, confirming his opinion).  But until now the Lite had only been available in the can, which frustrated his system of portion control.  Sadly, he had looked in vain for Lite Singles for months.  We just found some today at Walmart, and he bought a dozen with great delight.  I can't wait until they're available in a case from Amazon so I can surprise him!!!  :)
5.0	This was my first time having powdered green tea outside of a sushi restaurant.  I had high expectations.  It lived up to them!  It is fantastic!  I highly recommend this green tea.
5.0	I am tired of hearing all the fruit cake jokes over the years and have never understood the illogic behing them. I used to buy these Claxton 1lb cakes at Stuckey's highway road stops years ago. A friend mentioned they were available on Amazon and I have bought two 3lb boxes to date. Some fruit cakes deserve the rep of dry or tasteless and I have had a few, but if you try one of these you will never joke about FC again! I refrigerate mine after opening and sometimes put some butter on a slice or two. After 6/8 sec in microwave. Wow. I have no connection with Claxton.
5.0	I was pregnant and needed a decaf coffee that was bold and tasted like regular coffee. I finally settled on Peets and have been really happy. It is definitely a bold cup but not too acidic. I can't tell much of a difference between this decaf and regular coffee. It's as close as I've found.<br /><br />I also love that Peet's uses the chemical-free Swiss water process for extracting the caffeine out of their beans. Starbucks uses the chemical process on all their decafs with the exception of the Sumatra Decaf for some reason. That is a major reason I am still buying Peets. I think I will try their Major Dickason's decaf next!
5.0	Have purchased this item before and it was, as always, as good as I remembered it.  Would definitely purchase again!
5.0	Fresh nuts, a little sweetening and some crispy things.  An easy way to carry some essential fatty acids and nutrients with you through the day.  These go fast in my house!
5.0	If you have a young daughter she will love these, and you will feel good too!  Apples.  Freeze dried.  That's it. Very clever using the Snow White character with an Apple snack.  I first found these at Babies-R-Us, and I am glad that Amazon sells them too.
5.0	Great way to taste all the flavors.  Love them all
5.0	We first found this BBQ sauce going through Bourbon Distilleries in Northern Kentucky.<br /> Makes the best grilled wings on earth.
5.0	These folks consistently produce the best maple syrup. I grew up in the maple woods of Ohio, where we made syrup. This is the closest to what we made, and brings back memories of those years.
5.0	I bought this as a gift for someone who thoroughly enjoyed them.
5.0	The best caramel flavored coffee I have tried!  YUM!
5.0	love them and order them in bulk all the time. Can not  say enough good things about them
5.0	Great taste with just enough mint.  I enjoy 3 to 4 cups daily!  One of my favorite green teas.  Try a cup in the morning to get you day off to a good start!
5.0	Nice and chewy - husband loved his gift.
5.0	I know I can find it in my healthfood store.  But what is the generic name for Ralston?  The kind of wheat it is and how is it processed?  Thanks!
5.0	Woohoo this stuff is cocoNUTS! So delicious on a hot summer day
5.0	I wasn't too wild about the idea of chocolate in gum when first offered a piece of the Dentyne Chocomint.  But it really works.  First you feel as if you're eating a mint flavored piece of chocolate.  Then the chocolate pretty well leaves and you're left with a nice mint gum that stays chewable for a long time - meaning it doesn't quickly get rubbery.  This is a new favorite in our home and since we can't find it in local stores we're sure grateful for Amazon.com!
5.0	I gave this and the cannoli as a gift. THRILLED with the 1-2-3 delivery. It did NOT take 5-7 days as the site says. &#60;br /&#62;<br />The cake was most excellent and given a rating of 8 out of a  possible ten from a tough food critic !! You won't be sorry and you can definitly send this as a gift !
5.0	I'm addicted to this stuff.  Man is it good. Now instead of paying $4.00 or $5.00 a cup for coffee, I just heat up the tea kettle and add to one packet of this coffee.  It comes out to about a $1.00 a cup and it is really good.  I add a cinnamon stick sometimes for a little different flavor.
5.0	Love Colombia. It is one of the best VIAs.
5.0	I really like these and I want MORE!  Buy two and you will not be disappointed. Real peach flavor inside.
5.0	I used PB2 in a smoothie and it tasted great!!!! Was a little skeptical because I read a review after I ordered it that it was pasty but it's not...it tastes great!  I will be sharing with my family for sure!
5.0	Hands down the best there is.  Makes wonderful pancakes, drop biscuits, pumpkin bread!  You won't be disappointed when you purchase this great mix.
5.0	I bought these because my husband had a tendency to take the chip bag with him to his favorite chair and eat with abandon. He recently had heart issues so we're working on single serving items that will cut him off earlier.  This sample pack is nice to determine your favorite flavors.  Will order more and looking forward to the hopeful addition of Poptillas.
5.0	My favorite cereal and especially at night
5.0	AMAZING......I just wish they would sell UTZ CHIPS here out west.......SO WORTH IT....AND FAST SHIP.....THX THX THX
5.0	Good Product, Fast Delivery. Would recommend.
5.0	Another recipe calling for an unusual spice so ordered and the recipe was delicious.
5.0	this is great peppermint. I use it to make peppermint tea and it's delicious. Highly recommended! Also, very good price considering. This is an enormous amount of peppermint!
5.0	Received on the day stated thank you. I'm another Brit that likes her fruit Christmas cake so thank you Scott's and thank you Amazon ! 😁 very pleased.
5.0	Love love love these cookies!!!! Will order them again!
5.0	I am a big tea drinker and lover all of celestial seasoning teas (non-caffeinated). My husband is a coffee drinker, but makes an exception for this tea. It is his way to unwind at night before bed. I live in Colorado (where Celestial Seasonings in located) and can't find this tea in the store anywhere. So I decided to buy it in bulk to last us a while.
5.0	Amazing seeds. Period. They are totally comparable to other private company seeds, especially the 12/2016 batch. totally unwashed and perfect for my needs. I have to wash them 3 times before they are clean enough to cook with.
5.0	I don't really know and I fear to find out. This is my earthquake food - my last ditch earthquake food. I will eat all the food in the refrigerator and freezer first and the canned food next. I have some emergency meals also in plastic buckets. The power, water and other vital services would have to be off for several weeks before I would be reduced to eating this stuff.<br /><br />With luck I'll never have to eat this. So I really don't know what it tastes like. I did open the similar rice bucket and it looked well packaged.
5.0	I discovered these a while back online. Being the curious person that I am, I looked them up and later found them at a Walden books (before they closed). After just eating one (or two), I fell in love.<br /><br />But since there are no asian markets around my town, they've been very difficult to find; until I found them here (in bulk!). Though as with any snack, always in moderation. Thankyou Amazon.
5.0	The best quality vanilla in the most convinient size/ value presentation.. Excelent product. Since i first bought this vanilla extract, i don't use anyone else
5.0	Great! Just as described.
5.0	This method is not a neat as the tea bags but still has the same kick and euphoric feeling coffee does not have.
5.0	Cannot wait to use these!!
5.0	I love this. It takes 30 seconds in my old microwave, (on a paper towel) to become perfect, ready to serve bacon, and if you like yours crispy (I don't), perhaps 10 seconds more. It's incredibly convenient, tastes delicious and I plan to keep buying it from the seller.
5.0	I love these cute little 34 degrees crackers. They're tastilicious and they go well with a wide variety of comestibles.
5.0	I'm a buzzagent# and gotitfree#, Was very excited to be able to try this tea. Really has a well rounded taste of spices and sweetness. Love the shape of the cute little bags and they hold up well in hot water. I've had bags break in my cups before after a few squishes of the spoon. Really a great flavor whether you add sweetener or not. Didn't lose the flavor even switching to a cold tea and was quite a refreshing taste cold. I feel like you get a lot for your money 18 bags per pack.
5.0	This is my favorite kind of tea. The smell alone relaxes me. I only drink a few cups a week as I am usually a coffee drinker. This is like a treat for me.
5.0	The only problem was, no note allowed when sending.  Those I've sent to have of course guessed it was from me.  But, if sent to someone who does not know this would be from me, it becomes a problem.<br /><br />The combination of Dark Chocolate and Acai is wonderful!<br />It's addictive!<br /><br />HOWEVER, would love for you to have a one pound bag.  This is a little large and cumbersome.  Do consider one pound bag, as well.  I would then purchase more than I do.<br />Thanks!<br />Annette A. Kaufman<br />aakaufman@erthlink.net
5.0	"Cashews are the tastiest (and one of the costliest) of the what we call nuts. Although a nut in the culinary sense, in the botanical sense the fruit of the cashew is actually a seed that grows from the cashew tree. Their caloric numbers may be a bit high, but they provide surprising amounts of potassium, protein, and dietary fiber.<br /><br />That being said, these are some of the tastiest cashews that you'll find, and they have no trans fat, either. Must also note that Emerald's \\""On the Go\\"" canister\\"" is an excellent variation from the standard packaging, featuring a handy lid that seems about right to measure a single portion.<br /><br />Pros: Good sized cashews (Emerald says they're \\""25% larger than that other brand\\""); very few pieces. Lightly salted with an excellent natural buttery cashew taste. No trans fat.<br /><br />Cons: oil and sodium... but it's the salt that makes them great.<br /><br />Serving size: 1 ounce (about 1/4 cup)<br />Servings per container: 10<br />Calories per serving: 160<br />Calories from fat: 120<br /><br />Bottom Line: If you want some really flavorsome cashews, Emerald does a tremendous job with these. For those who prefer a slightly less costly alternative, just try [[ASIN:B000V96CPW Emerald Nuts Cashew Halves & Pieces, 10-Ounce Canisters (Pack of 4)]], and for an interesting (and highly-recommended) five-star taste treat, you might want to try [[ASIN:B0015ZSH54 Emerald Sea Salt & Pepper Cashew, 10oz Canister (Pack of 4)]]. All of these have outstanding natural buttery cashew taste, and are packaged in the same handy canister.<br /><br />Warning: any of these can be habit-forming!"
5.0	I second the other review. These are really good. Everything I love about 7 layer dip and without the mess :0)<br />Do yourself a favor, though. Get some snack sized plastic bags and portion these out. Otherwise you may eat the entire bag.
5.0	I discovered this item about 5 years ago, and it was a life changing event.  I love all the Boomi items, but this is my favorite.  Since my first taste, I always keep a few at my desk and eat one almost every day.  I never get tired of them!  And it's good to know they're healthy.[[ASIN:B000LKWUMK Boomi Bar Cashew Almond, Gluten Free Energy Bar, 1.7-Ounce Bars (Pack of 24)]]
5.0	I was hesitant about buying from some of the sellers due to bad reviews, but I bought these flake bars through British mart and we not only received them about a month ahead of when the expected delivery date was, but they were fresh and packaged carefully. That's a long trip across the pond for chocolate and they were delicious! Will definitely buy from British Mart in the future, I know we can trust them to send us good, yummy Cadbury that we just can't get here in Tennessee.
5.0	This can be used as decorations either on top of cupcakes or by themselves, specially liked that they are strong enough you can stick them on the frosting without fear of them breaking.
5.0	This Is authentic suya rub!! I am black American married to a proud Nigerian and been to Nigeria and had some real suya. This is the closest to authentic suya rub I have found in USA so far!
5.0	I have used this formula for all 3 of my boys and will continue for the 4th! very fast shipping and great price!
5.0	I decided to try this, I was a little hesitant to try it, because I seem to screw up the recipes when it comes out a box! But the baked chicken came out perfect, I was surprised! And the taste of the seasoning was perfect, I didn't need to add any extra salt or anything! Thank you Laury's and BzzAgent for letting me try this awesome product for free! I will definitely purchase more of this crispy baked  seasoned mix!
5.0	I love, love, love these soy crisps.  The cheddar flavor is my favorite, although the apple & cinnamon is a close second.  These are a much healthier alternative to potato chips, but you don't feel like you are sacrificing anything.  I can't find these anywhere in CA, but Amazon.com always has them.
5.0	I love Mix 1 mango as my choice protein recovery drink.  Tastes great to me, but my teenagers aren't so thrilled.
5.0	I really enjoy this coffee.  It is one of the best coffees I have used.  The price is also much cheaper than purchasing it in the local stores.
5.0	I like very much Reese's Peanut Butter Cups Mini. I ordered them for my son's b-day for children. Box looks bigger , that made me more happy. Later on I will order again. By the way it came much faster. Thank you very much.
5.0	I love these links, they are the best.
5.0	My kids and grandkids love this fruit leather.
5.0	Can we give 10 stars?  Amazing coffee!! I've ordered several different coffees from a number of different vendors. No more this is the perfect coffee in my book!!
5.0	Christmas Stollen has been a tradition in our family for 30 years - recently my mother and father passed away - My sister and I wanted to keep the tradition alive - unfortunately - the Christmas chore of obtaining the Stollen had always been my father's task. I live in Minnesota and all my family lived in Washington, DC - I looked online and inquired around locally - the best I found was the Kuchenmeister Marzipan Christmas Stollen.     My Sister and I were able to keep our family tradition going through our first Christmas without our parents. The occasion was poignant,  both happy and sad; full of remembrances. The stollen was the highlight of our Christmas morning. Keeping a happy holiday remembrance fresh and joyful in our hearts.     We'll be customers for life...
5.0	Healthy, delicious, good price.
5.0	I've been enjoying Gevalia Lattes at home for a few months now and it is my absolute favorite! Excellent rich taste, texture and depth of flavor.     I also recommend:    -Bodum 9 oz. or 11 oz. Double Walled, Mouth Blown Coffee Glasses-  They keep your coffee hotter longer and hold the exact portion.   -Bodum 9 oz.- for those not reqiring sugar.  -Bodum 11 oz.- for those who add sugar.  These coffee glasses are the perfect pairing to beautifully serve the Gevalia Lattes with a sophisticated presentation.
5.0	Excellent !!!  So far it's contributed to some great cornbread dressing and a great 4 Layer Dessert crust.
5.0	The BOMB!  A bit pricey but brings great joy if you like hot stuff..
5.0	Excellent service from beginning to end. Will buy again.
5.0	The bacon arrived frozen, no problem. It was delicious and priced right.<br />Certified Humanely raised and handled is the way to go. The animals we eat should be treated right in their lives! Not enough people think about it or even care.
5.0	Great, this was a repeat purchase.
5.0	I make a tea cake recipe from my grandmother and it needs good vanilla. The ordinary stuff won't give the right flavor. This vanilla has made excellent tea cakes and that's highest praise.
5.0	These are great beans and they arrived quickly.  I make beans from scratch, and I hope these beans last a year or so.  These beans expand a LOT when you let them soak in water overnight. I cook them in a rice cooker, and they turn out great every time. Just avoid cooking them with salt, as the beans might not cook correctly.  Great healthy product; will purchase again :)
5.0	My daughter loves them for her breakfast drink. We will being purchasing more as she goes thru them quite regularly.
5.0	I used to buy these outside of Chicago, IL where I spent the first 49 years of my life. They are not available in Hibbing, MN or anywhere nearby. They are great with coffee or milk. Just don't hold them under; dip only. They'll soak up the coffee like a sponge! You can dunk them longer in milk. I had to buy a lot more than I thought, but they freeze beautifully.
5.0	These cookies are moist with a lot of flavor. They beat out the other gluten free cookies hands down. The only cookie that I like better is the WOW brand oatmeal and cranberry cookie. You cannot get those with the subscribe and save however.
5.0	love this coffee it is so fresh when arrives beans still look wet when you grin beans the aroma is so good and makes a delicious cup of coffee have bought several times great delivery great price.
5.0	I couldn't make a better marinade if I made it from scratch.  Wonderful product.  I highly recommend it for steaks, tri tips, etc.
5.0	Bought this for my wife.  She likes chocolate chai.  This really hit the spot with her.  It is a loose decaf tea which she enjoys drinking in the afternoons and evening.
5.0	If you like Cinnamon and just want something a little sweet, this is IT!  Found them ONCE in a tiny local bodega and never was able to find them again until Amazon started carrying them.    From the moment you open the bag, you will smell the cinnamon and be captured by its scent.  The flavor reminds me of churros.
5.0	These things are addictive! Really amazing with ice cream too.
5.0	Can't go wrong with C2O, taste great, helps keep you hydrated.  Works great with protein powder after a workout.  Get the easy packaging option instead of the retail one or else all your cans will come dented to hell.
5.0	Great price on sale. Kids love them as much as I do. Not too sweet and heavy. Great for soccer games and the morning rush.
5.0	I keep a box of these at my office, where I have soup for lunch nearly every day -- and I use these unsalted, unsweetended whole-grain cheerios in the soup rather than crackers (which primarly consist of white flour and salt).  It's an immeasurably healthy alternative, in addition to tasting fantastic.  People who thrive upon these cheerios are simply better than other people.
5.0	Energems are truly an amazing product. I LOVE the Mint flavor but all are delicious and provide me the little boost of energy I need before a morning workout, to lift me up in the middle of my day and even satisfy that craving when I want just a little something sweet. The Peanut Butter tastes just like a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup and the Chocolate like a big M&M...they are DELICIOUS! I have never been a fan of the energy drink/shots/candies/etc because of the terrible after taste but Energems are different - they are product unto itself. You have to try these!
5.0	delicous apple flavor with just the right touch of caramel
5.0	These nuts were huge and delicious!  Fresh and well packaged and arrived on time!  Had 4 and felt full.  Healthy alternative snack!
5.0	"I never was one of those women that swooned over Paul Newman in his movie days, but I have come to trust his gourmet food products, esp his candy. I have tried several of his organic candy products and this is one of the best. It's not as sweet as Reese's Cups, and a little drier, but I love the chocolate to PNB ratio. It's more of a piece of quality chocolate with a little PNB stuff, rather than the Reeses version of lots of PNB with a light coat of cheap chocolate. The chocolate is smooth and delicious, not too dark or sweet, just right.<br /><br />They are packaged well, 3 smaller cups fitted into a molded plastic tray in a heavy foil lined wrapper. They were packaged so well, in fact, that I recently found 3 pkgs I had bought on clearance (so already a bit aged) and opened them 8 months later and they were still good. So delicious, actually, that I decided to write this review.<br /><br />If you are expecting an organic version of Reeses's PNB Cups, you will be disappointed, but Newman's definitely tops the charts where 'health-food' candy is concerned (some of which can be kinda nasty), this is the best \\""healthy\\"" candy I have found so far. Wouldn't mind continuing an official search, though!  Really want to try his sweet dark chocolate with orange oil!<br /><br />FYI-I recently read that chocolate is one of those food items that organic is important due to how chocolate is processed. So..chocoholics, go organic!"
5.0	Perfect for a salt grinder.
5.0	Very nice! - I love Marmite though, so I am biased.
5.0	Hey, every culture has their ideal preference in cocoa. Look at the humble Nestle Milo or even Ovaltine---every nation has variations. Made in Singapore or anywhere in Asia is sweeter than their Latino counterpart. Mexicans or Colombians like that strong cocoa taste.<br /><br />Ive also tried Neuhaus, Chirardelli and other store brands, but I prefer Bellagio because there's no need to mix in milk for that smooth Belgian taste.<br /><br />Belgium or European chocolates are different from America's Hersheys brand. Their chocolate mix is not overpowering.<br /><br />Bellagio Chocolate Truffle reminds me of Starbuck's Signature chocolate drink with less calories (thhe company phased out this brand because of high caloric content -- 700 calories for the venti)<br /><br />So if you're on the go or a busy mom like me, Bellagio choco is the best comfort drink this cold season.
5.0	My kids love these and I pack them as a school snack.
5.0	"I am not a candy lover, generally speaking, but Nestle's Crunch with Caramel is the one candy I do eat. For reasons best known to Nestle's marketing people, this product is no longer distributed to stores in my area (South Florida). Other \\""Crunch\\"" variations are, but not the one with caramel. So I started searching online and found it. I have ordered it several times since."
5.0	This stuff is delicious! Nutritious and fulfilling, I have it delivered in subscribe and save every other month. The chocolate too!
5.0	Do NOT! ... I repeat ... Do NOT open the bag when you are alone in the house.  You won't be able to stop eating this candy once you start.  Dangerously good!  : )
5.0	I love this cup I use it daily, the tea strainer is easy to clean and the cup is a good size and sturdy. The teas are very good too, the coconut flavor isn't super strong, but good all the same.
5.0	"It arrived on-time in a paper bag. There were 35 different K-cups. 2 hot chocolates, 1 cider, 2 teas, 2 decaff coffees, and the remainder different regular and bolds. Some were flavored. Many were \\""name\\"" brands like Wolfgang Puck. No one company had more than 4 k-cups. None were expired (though they didn't all have an obvious date). None were bizarre flavors. It was exactly as described."
5.0	These noodles do really absorb all the flavors that you put into them.  I love they are calorie and carb free.  If you are familiar with sukiyaki noodle...these are basically the same thing.  Same texture, everything.  They are great!
5.0	These are my go-to garnish now that I've discovered them. They become a talking point because of how different they are from regular maraschino cherries. Their rich dark color as well as wonderfully deep flavor make these the only ones I buy now.
5.0	This really tastes great.  I like it on my popcorn.  I pop my corn with olive oil, then lightly sprinkle it with this.  Yum!
5.0	Enliven your granola and salads with this nicely priced nut treat
5.0	Love Tully's Italian and also shopping at Amazon Prime. I found my new favorite coffee. I will continue to look for new specials online.
5.0	I like it because it has just the right amount of pumpkin flavor and 70% of your day's Vitamin A in each serving. I like to crumble some pecans into the batter. My kid loves it too.<br />Each suggested recipe size (using 1 cup of mix) makes a great breakfast for two people.
5.0	Perfect for pretzels. It does not melt/absorb into the pretzel (unless you leave it sitting overnight like I did!)<br />Salt attracts water though... so I expected this to happen. The texture is superb for pretzels. And guess what, it tastes like salt.
5.0	I love dark chocolate and these are great. I've tried 3 types and all are great. I plan to try some other flavors soon.
5.0	Excellent quality<br />While this product costs more than McCormicks or Watkins vanilla that u would buy at the grocery store, it is well worth it. Can't be beat as far as flavor. Use it to make an Italian cream cake which is to die for.
5.0	Ferraro Rocher...........the name alone just makes you drool and so will this treat.
5.0	The product is excellent with good taste and of course real bottles.  The shipping container was just great and provided GOOD protection for the bottles.  Product arrived in a timely fashion and I was very pleased with the overall service.  I would recommend this experience to anyone!
5.0	Makes for a great Manhattan!
5.0	I was surprised as well how good this cereal is. It has the perfect chocolate taste and I'll be buying it regularly. I can't believe a cereal is this tasty. A whole grain addition makes it a plus.
5.0	I love being able to provide something healthy on the continental breakfast line, and Kashi cereal does that for me.  Individual bowls are more sanitary than a bin and a scoop.  The only low glycemic thing in the whole breakfast, except for bananas and milk.
5.0	These noodles make a great companion to any food. Light and largely tasteless on their own, it only takes a little pad Thai sauce, veggies and heat and you have a filling, very low calorie dish.
5.0	This is by far my favorite K cup. It is a strong flavorful and not harsh coffee different from a french roast no real burnt edge to it I admit I like it really strong  we also drink Newman's extra bold for mild coffee and so we have something to offer company but I buy these four 24 packs at a time, if you like it rich and strong with this you can't go wrong!
5.0	Wonderful individual snacks. . . .do not make your hands sticky.
5.0	The only waffle mix we will use!  Love it!!!
5.0	this is the cheapo alternative to redbull works well with mixed drinks as well a college kid must for the weekends
5.0	So excited to get my case! Blast from the past!
5.0	I did not think I would like this, but got addicted very quickly!  If you don't like spicy, I would not recommend this salsa.  If you do, you will be pleasantly surprised.
5.0	I studied abroad for a semester and lived with a local family in Costa Rica. If there's one thing I'll never forget, it's how incredible their coffee was. I drank Cafe Britt every day for 6 months, and have been missing it since then. Thankfully, I stumbled across it here and have fallen back in love all over again.<br /><br />This is a medium-dark roast, and stronger than your average coffee. We use a stainless steel, Ekobrew refillable K-cup. The grounds stay fresh in the bag, and the first cup is as good as the last.<br /><br />This is organic, shade grown coffee. In case you didn't know, non-organic coffee is one of the most pesticide-laden foods you can consume. Along with being filled with carcinogens, non-organic coffee is grown in the sun, as opposed to the shade. This allows it to grow faster. However, they don't get natural protection from critters from birds, so they spray the beans with loads of pesticides to keep them off. The pesticides are destroying farmlands, and farmers are dying young from associated cancers.<br /><br />Don't take any chances, and stick with organic, shade grown coffee. This is the best you can buy - don't think twice!
5.0	One of my favorite flavors for an afternoon coffee.
5.0	Chocolates arrived in excellent condition and are delicious as always.
5.0	This is the best peanut butter that I have every eaten.  Whether it is on bread, celery or straight out of the container this is the best, I wish I could find it anywhere.
5.0	I bought this for my peanut butter, banana, protein smoothies.  It's perfect for these because it tastes exactly like regular peanut butter but without the mess or the calories.  My smoothie recipe is as follows. 1 1/2 cups Almond milk (any milk will work), 1 banana, 2 soops PB2,  1 scoop protein powder, 2 handed scoop of ice.  I put it all in my Vitamix and blend for about 1 minute until smooth.  You can add chocolate powder or syrup too if you like.  Tastes like a Reese'speanut butter cup.
5.0	My Granddaughter loves these cookies and since she is on a nut and gluten free diet it's wonderful to see her enjoy something.
5.0	delicious source of protein
5.0	It's spicy and kinda sweet, great flavor.  It's my very favorite tea.  The tin is cute too, saved mine for storage.
5.0	Reasonably priced good quality coffee pods.
5.0	Since the doctors and health professionals promote eating seeds and nuts and since I happen to like pepitas, I have been buying pepitas from all over, seeking the best.  These are quite good and best of all, they are in individual bags
5.0	Delicious flavor and so nice in warm in my belly. It feels good to know that I am drinking a tea that is good for me. I am really enjoying it. It's very simple to make, anyone can do it. I would highly recommend this tea to anyone who enjoys hot tea!I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT IN EXCHANGE FOR MY UNBIAS REVIEW
5.0	I far as I'm concerned this is the best salt available
5.0	I have 6 dachshaunds and they loved them.
5.0	Awesome on baby back ribs will get more 5 star.
5.0	"I have a very sweet tooth and I wanted sugar free candy to keep my glucose level low.  I expected the candy to taste \\""a little off\\"", and it does, but it did satisfy my cravings for taffy.  The only problem I had was that the chews are very soft.  I would advise storing the candy in a cool place.  I think if you actually like sugar free products, this may not be so bad.  And like most sugar free products there is an aftertaste."
5.0	This is a warm and sweet treat to sip as you read Jane Austin on a cold and rainy Sunday afternoon.
5.0	Free product provided for evaluation and review.<br /><br />I got this for my adult son's smoothies- he's lifting weights trying to put on a lot of muscle for a Cosplay coming up.  He hasn't much cared for the protein powders I've tried in the past.  He likes this one ok - it is a bit grainy but I cut the amount to 3/4 of the recommended serving and it is working out a lot better.  A banana also helps add a lot of creaminess, or a bit of chocolate syrup is nice too, these things really compliment the taste, I've found.  The taste of the powder is nutty to both of us- we both find it earthy and pleasant.  It's also a great source of fiber.  There's no aftertaste, and while I would say that the texture is grainy, it is not at all gritty.<br /><br />He's been drinking his before workouts and he's able to increase his workout time about 30 minutes.  They give a nice sustained energy boost during the workout, and help provide protein replacement as muscles heal and recover.
5.0	I use this tea to brew Iced tea. Fantastic flavor. Will definitely buy again.
5.0	We have enjoyed these for quite a while, then suddenly they were off the shelves at local stores so we began ordering through Amazon.
5.0	Love the product, the reasonable price, fast shipping, love to do business with, highly recommend, thank you! A+++
5.0	wish I could get them in larger bags
5.0	Wish they made these all year round. I order ten bags or so to last me several months then I can't wait till they are in production again for the holiday season!
5.0	Another staple for those who need to snack and have gluten issues.  Wonderful flavor and texture.
5.0	already bought a 2nd bag!!
5.0	Hit the right spot was hard to find all of a sudden
5.0	These are just what I wanted!
5.0	This Knorr Pasta Sides Cheddar Broccoli is my favorite of them all, buying this product here on Amazon actually saves you more money.  The product it self is amazing and it's cooked in minutes.  I highly recommend it especially for those who are in a hurry and need to eat something quick.
5.0	Full flavored, medium roast with a pleasant aroma while brewing.  Great for that first cup in the morning.  I made mine a little stronger, because I like that flavor to stand out.  The caramel smell is delicious!
5.0	This is the only tuna that I'll eat... and now my family is the same...<br /><br />Great taste... every time.  You can put it in salads right out of the can and use the olive oil as part of the dressing (just add a bit of balsamic if you'd like...)  Also, just make some pasta, put the whole can on with the olive oil, maybe a few chopped tomatoes if you so desire... and it's perfect.<br /><br />dmb
5.0	My Granddaughter loves these and could not find them in Wyoming.  So, I sent them to her and she was so excited!
5.0	Since coffee is one of the most highly sprayed crops on the market, I choose to drink mine without pesticides!  This tastes great, price is better than you can get in a store and the owner of the company is very nice and personable. I called him to ask about the different products and he was extremely nice and helpful.  These are nice robust, oily beans, but are not &#34;dark&#34; like a Starbucks Dark roast, which always tastes burnt to me and very acidic. You just cannot beat Colombian coffee, IMO, but it would be nice if the company could give samples of their different flavors to their Subscribe & Save customers.  My only complaint is that now the discount for Subscribe & Save items is only 5%; however, that is still better than no discount.
5.0	I can make a huge amount of broccoli sprouts with this seed. It is great!
5.0	There aren't a lot of things about brownies that I don't like--in fact I can't think of any. That is why I recommend Brownie Brittle. It's all the flavor of the brownie in a delicious cookie/cracker/brittle package. Get it. Today!
5.0	I am glad I found it here, as I am no longer able to find it the local deli.<br />It is beyond a doubt the best flavored mustard out there. Boring cold cuts take on a whole new meaning for a sandwich. You will not be disappointed, and Boetje will not be among your mustard bottles that are now collecting dust.
5.0	We have loved this mustard since a friend gave us the first jar. It has a vibrant flavor that brings out various dishes. We particularly enjoy using it with my chicken and rice recipe.
5.0	My local Whole Foods sells Nature's Path products for $3.79 a box, so this Amazon.com price is an excellent deal.<br /><br />The cereal is hearty and crunchy, although it becomes soft in a few short minutes when submerged in milk. I sometimes add a little sweetner, as sugar is not added artificially. My housemate (who grew up in France & Italy), loves this cereal, as he says it reminds him of his European 'grainy' musli-style cereals. However, I am not a big fan of what is sold as 'Musli' or 'Muslix' in this country and Heritage Bites are nothing like this.<br /><br />Think Chex style bites and crunch, without the Chex fake crunch, slimy coating, preservatives and sugars.
5.0	These are great nut snacks.  The clusters are formed by a candy-like substance so the nuts adhere in small bunches.  The result is a small nut snack, slightly sweet  but not so the sweetness overcomes the fine nut taste.
5.0	It's hard to find the bubblemint flavor where I live in single packs or triple packs plus I'd rather buy in bulk anyway! Great price and yummy gum!
5.0	My favorite decaf coffee.  I love the little pods for a great tasting coffee later in the afternoon without the caffine rush.
5.0	I was so glad to have found this product on Amazon!! Walmart quit carrying this flavor and I was not sure how I was going to get it!! Thanks for the great product and the great savings!!
5.0	Fresh, strong. 100% what you want in a whole bean coffee.
5.0	I usually put these seeds in the yogurt or cottage cheese. It allows me to reduce my bread consumption while keeping high satiety levels. Good product overall.
5.0	After seaching long & hard for Squid Ink Noodles, I found them Amazon.  I was not dissappointed by this product, it has lived up to my expectations.  I make them according to the package directions.  I reduce heavy cream in a pan & add lemon zest & fresh chopped Rosemary.  This is truely a great tasting pasta dish!
5.0	Unbeatable quality vanilla.  Really awesome flavor.
5.0	I am really happy with the results of the 5 day cleanse... I will be ordering again...I missed food but never felt real hungry...I had plenty of energy and felt great!
5.0	This was a great treat!
5.0	this one is great - smells like pumpkin pie baking with all the spices -
5.0	This is so great I have ordered 5 of them! It fits any coffee pot that takes the K cups. Will definetly save you money
5.0	I use this as an accompanying spice while cooking.  Heavy on the paprika, if used to gradually develop flavor in chili or thicker stews, it adds a nice flavor that is not overpowering & does not leave an aftertaste.  I have also lightly dusted immediately before throwing a ribeye on the grill.  Provides a flavor that is not your traditional rub/sprinkles for steaks.  Have also used it in larger amounts with Worschestshire/Soy as a marinade for beef jerky.  A Unique blend, I like it.  A nice add to the spice cabinet.
5.0	I love wowbutter. I tastes and has texture of real peanut butter. After discovering I have a peanut allergy I was so upset because I love peanut butter and toast for breakfast. It is a great substitute. Thank you! Used to get at Walmart but they quit carrying it in my area, so I ordered off of Amazon.
5.0	I have purchased this coffee 3-4 times now and am well satisfied. Can't beat the price. My taste for my morning coffee is strong without bitterness.
5.0	Really like these protein shakes, and had discovered them in a high-end grocery. When I looked, Amazon carried them! So I now subscribe and have them shipped every month. On my third or fourth month and not tired of chocolate yet (tired of chocolate=oxymoron?)
5.0	I love chips so this was a steal when I picked it up on subscribe & save, great value pack!
5.0	Great flavor, and a good start to my morning.[[ASIN:B001E6EE4C Fiber One Honey Clusters, 14.25-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)]]
5.0	"I'm not a \\""tea snob\\"" and this tea taste GREAT!. Came fresh and packaged well and at a MUCH better price then the local tea shop and health food stores!"
5.0	Authentic Ceylon (Sri Lankan) tea , nicely flavored....<br />I am from India so it's good to see the real flavored products like Adam....
5.0	this was an excellent find! For a Merlot, It's a little on the lighter side as far as body, but the taste is great! it's great as an everyday wine and the price is fantastic! I have ordered one of every wine they sell to compare with the higher priced 6 week kits i normally get. I'll be submitting reviews on those wines once I taste them.
5.0	I wanted something different and saw these.  I was impressed by the flavor.  Lite on the chocolate and gooey on the inside.  Perfect.
5.0	best thing ever..I can use any espresso I choose..  and cheaper !
5.0	What's not to like it's chocolate and peanuts.
5.0	This is the best non caffeinated chai on the market. I wish they had more stock, I would gladly drink it from dawn till dusk.
5.0	Love the Peach Mango!
5.0	These are milk chocolate Hershey kisses. If you like chocolate, you know what these are.
5.0	The Tea arrived just as promised, I was suprised at the fast shipping. And the tea itself, OMgosh, it's simply the best tea I've ever had. We have this several times a week, and a VERY small amount makes a TON of tea!
5.0	love these,,, cant get in Hawaii, and I miss them from the mainland  thanks again  brad
5.0	This henna was awesome! I'm definitely going to buy more. The henna is really dark so I'm pretty sure it's going to last longer than two weeks on my skin. I hope to buy quite a bit for art fairs and such. One problem that it does seem to have is during really big or detailed designs. Occasionally it needs to be remixed in the tube because sometimes the paste can get dry inside the cone and prevent the rest of the paste from getting through. But overall it is definitely a wonderful value for the cost!
5.0	my wife use it for crapes and some bake pasta dish and since she start using it you can tell the difference its better now. you can not substitute it with vanilla extract. once i run low i will buy some more definitely.
5.0	Delightful taste and texture! Arrived unmelted as well. Great!
5.0	Very bold and strong coffee selection. Lots of Italian and French roasts. Good deal.
5.0	Unsalted 100% peanut PB. Taste heavenly
5.0	I use this instead of Kosher salt for most of my cooking, and also add it on top of eggs, garlic toast, cottage cheese, open face melt sandwiches, etc.  It adds a wonderful herb smell and taste to my food.
5.0	Great texture and mild coconut flavor.
5.0	I was introduced to these delicious little cookies by our neighbors who hail from Surrey. They are delightful. A little sweet, a little crunchy and surprisingly satisfying. Once you try them you will scour the internet trying to find them in the US. Good luck. PJ
5.0	What a wonderful taste these little pods have.  It's a pleasure to bring a little southern flava' up to New England!  Almost made me wish I hadn't gotten rid of my keurig! After it broke a second time and seeing how devastating these are to the environment, I'm all set!  But to each their own, if use keurig, these pods are delicious.
5.0	While these might not appeal to a refined palette, my preschooler (and now toddler) cannot get enough of them. Whether packed in their lunches, or taken along somewhere for a snack, the only problem the kids have is deciding which flavor they want. They do live up to the leather part of their name, but not so much so as to make them inedible.<br /><br />As others have mentioned, the price can be high here on Amazon, so I try to stock up when the price dips. Unfortunately, I've never seen them at my Costco.<br /><br />Give them a try. If you don't like them, you can always send them my way.
5.0	I am very pleased with this product.  The seller is wonderful to work with.  I will be ordering a pack again soon.
5.0	Yummy!  I gave this as a gift and the recipient raved about it!
5.0	This was purchased for Harry Potter birthday party - kids had a blast picking out beans and watching the reaction of those who chose poorly!  Definitely want to keep a trash can handy!  Highly recommended!
5.0	I love this candy. I need to buy some more soon. It's nice to be able to get a childhood treat again.
5.0	I have ordered this product numerous times and will continue to do so. This is by far the best price for pure organic coconut oil. I use it for everything cooking, hair, nails and skin.
5.0	. . . this is the place to start.  Pasta has a relatively small number of ingredients, so use good ones.  This flour makes wonderful pasta and is reasonably priced.
5.0	This is wonderful and so very easy.  Make a quick French dip with deli roast beef!  Yum.
5.0	I have tried several varieties of this tuna. All of them are superior tasting and better than any other brands on the market as far as I am concerned. The cans are low in BPA and now&lt; I believe, even BPA free.<br />The tuna is cooked with no addition of water or broth. Unlike other brands of Albacore, WildPlanet Albacore has 6 times the level of beneficial omega 3s and is relatively low in mercury as are the other varieties of tuna.<br />The large foil pack is a great buy and after having checked on a tuna industry web site, I learned that it is possible to freeze this tuna with no adverse effects. My wife devised a method whereby she weighs out 2 oz. portions and wraps them in aluminum foil, the, freezes them in a muffin pan.<br />She then removes the individually wrapped packets, puts them in a large zipolock bag. When we want the tuna, we remove the packet or packets and defrost them in the microwave by weight, 2oz. for each packet. The tuna then is not changed and is just as it was when it came out of the original large packet.<br /><br />Given the low levels of mercury and low BPA content, this tuna can be enjoyed more frequently than ordinary tuna.
5.0	Excellent packing, quality, and shipping.
5.0	These are chewy granola bars that are gluten free and GMO free made with oats, brown rice, millet, amaranth, oat flour, buckwheat, quinoa, coffee and dark chocolate as the main tasty ingredients and they are a great snack or quick breakfast bar for on the go to keep your body fueled. I love KIND bars and the coffee and chocolate combo is delicious and I will be adding these to my subscribe and save rotation.
5.0	This really does the trick. I couldn't believe it. Tastes fine. Does take 8 hours or more to kick in... Be prepared.
5.0	I first had these peppers on a pizza at a popular Seattle pizza place.  I asked where they got them and they told me the name of them and the store where I could buy them.  I went to the grocery store where they said I could get them but they were super expensive so I diverted to Amazon Fresh and found them, bought a case and have now used them up.  Amazon Fresh website is now saying they are out of stock and on the regular Amazon website they are only available through a third party and are again very expensive and not available for Prime shipping.  They are made right here in the area, so why so expensive?  These peppers are great, you can use them on eggs, in salads, on pizza and sandwiches.  They are sweet but hot just as they advertise, but not too hot that you can't feel your tongue after eating them.  They come with garlic cloves in the brine also which are great to eat.  This is the best combination of sweet, hot peppers I've ever tasted.
5.0	Mio works great if you want to sweeten water, especially as a substitute for soda. For people who choose to eat low carb, such as the Atkins method, this provides a way to enjoy a sweet tasting drink without the carb or sugar penalty. I wanted to avoid diet soda and anything sweetened by Aspartame too (as suggested in the Atkins book). MIO is just the ticket (it's sweetened by Splenda). This stuff is small, easy to use and tastes good to. It helps me to drink plenty of water and provides easy travel options. I also use it to flavor water when camping, hiking, at work and on weekend trips. The bottle is so small and light and sweetens 24 cups worth of water.<br /><br />When I first started using this, I would over flavor things. After just a few times it's easy to determine about how much to squeeze into the size of container you are using. The fluid is very concentrated so be careful not to splash or spray it on your clothes. 1 bottle lasts me several days and I drink it all day long. It dissolves instantly, just a little stir and your drink is ready. If you really crave the Soda fizz, you can add it to plain soda water too.<br /><br />Mango Peach is my favorite flavor. I rank the flavors about like this:<br />1. Mango Peach<br />2. Fruit Punch<br />3. Strawberry Watermelon<br />4. Orange Tangerine<br />5. Berry Pomegranate<br /><br />The price varies wildly, check your local stores too. Give it a shot and you'll be happy you did.<br /><br />5 stars for a great product, providing a carb free option.
5.0	So many different flavors! Seems very fresh.
5.0	I have ordered this product fromyou before. The price is good and the postage price is good too. I used to take this as a kid growong up in England
5.0	These we found in some snack packs a while ago that we got as a gift from a friend.  It makes for a great little protein addition to our snack time or an on the go kind of meal with salad for busy busy days where we have to really run.  I am happy because it's a bit of protein and not all sugary and it is a fairly clean option, no syrup, cream, stickiness to deal with.  The pack comes with many sausage bites in it and 6 pieces make a serving but we get away with three or four for the little guy.  I like them because of the protein.  It helps to keep his tummy happy and it's a good snack with crackers and fruit.
5.0	I love these skittles. The green ones are my favorite. I can never find these in stores, so Im glad that these are sold here! :)
5.0	I love this set. Sticky Rice rules. Don't believe the hype about microwave recipes, this is the way to do it, and it is always delicious.
5.0	This was what we expected. We are using it to color popcorn for a local team. It does not take much.
5.0	Great taste with just a hint of toffee. Amazon is offering this 50 pack for far less than any retail store. Gotta love Amazon!
5.0	Product is just as described
5.0	My local grocery store had this on sale so I decided to try it. I couldn't believe how richly flavored it was. Not watery by any means, nor is it salty-tasting. The recipe featured on the box is an excellent introduction to making a very delicous pot of soup, and I've also used it as a guide for other throw-together soups. I tried to find this in the bulk stores near my home without success, so I'm very glad it's available through Amazon. I'm adding it to my cart today.
5.0	I use this in my daily shakes. a great source f pure easily digestible protein.  You just have to get past that it turns everything green. Use a dark blue glass. Other than that it rocks.
5.0	I consume 1 can of tomato juice each day, I was previously having a problem with leg cramps. The potassium in the tomato juice solved this problem.  I am happy to say I enjoy this drink and hopefully I can continue this service with the automatic deliver ever 2 months.  KEEP IT UP! Vern Rodacker
5.0	Yogi is pretty much the only tea I drink and the main reason is taste. I don't like to add any sweetener, I don't like sweet drinks, but normally, with tea, you just have to add something otherwise its not even drinkable. Not yogi though. I can make my cup of yogi and enjoy without sweetener :) happy tea drinker
5.0	I love the Jacobs Kronung coffee, and I wanted the same taste in an instant version.  This is perfect!  It has a smooth taste, but strong enough that you know you're not drinking Nescafé.  I wish I had discovered this coffee ages ago!
5.0	We use this often! We have not found a better price than on Amazon.com. It's really convenient to have the subscribe & save.
5.0	The cheese was great, just the correct consistancy. So good it did not last long. I need to order more!
5.0	I love to drink matcha green tea, and this is one of the best ones I've had. It has a really smooth taste and it has a wonderful scent when it is prepared. I've also tried adding it a smoothie and it adds a great aroma and flavor to it. Its a must try for tea lovers!
5.0	Nice satisfying snack made with health-giving palm oil.  I would never buy any other brand.  Used to buy them at Trader Joes but now they carry some kind made with unfavorable oils.  I'm glad I can get Inka Plantains through Amazon.
5.0	I use this to make a tomatoe based fish soup and it is wonderful!!!  Much better then their shrimp base stock which I have used in place of this when I couldn't find this in the stores...but yippeeee Amazon has saved the day with this army size can!!!!
5.0	These are great.  A little crumbly, so you want a plate, but these are yummy enough my picky eaters will eat them and I can feel much better about the health content of these.  The nutrient content is well rounded and gives kids some energy without the corn syrup attitude and then sugar crash that some sugar-laden brands will give.  Lots of flavors for the various tastes in my family.
5.0	Gummy cokes are my second favorite after bears.  This is a great price.  Less per ounce when buying high volume.
5.0	For people that enjoy a nice espresso or latte after dinner, these pods are the answer. Easy to make, no mess, great flavor and without the caffeine at nighttime.
5.0	Best stuff out there on the &#34;Gummi&#34; market. This is candy for the discerning palate. I am a very happy customer!
5.0	I love Himalayan Sea Salt. Phresh Salt is a really great product, and this shipper knows what is up. YAY!
5.0	Love pumpkin spice. Couldn't wait to try them.
5.0	Have tried a number of different coffees from this seller and have been pleased with them all.  The seller is excellent and the coffee is always fresh and delivered very quickly.  The Mexican Chiapas is one of my favorites.  It has a very full and rich flavor even though it is described as &#34;mild body.&#34; Don't be afraid to try this one.
5.0	Chocolate perfection. I purchased this during the summer and it was shipped in an insulted package with an ice pack inside. If the delivery was delayed even a half day longer I probably would have had chocolate soup instead of the little balls but they arrived in the nick of time.<br /><br />I have since purchased 2 more boxes.
5.0	My family are not what many would consider &#34;coffee drinkers&#34; because we never buy or brew unflavored coffee.  Having said that, we LOVE our flavored coffee & are always trying different flavors from various companies.  To be quite honest, I bought this coffee & a couple more, because they were on sale at a significantly lower price than the other available coffees.  Of course when I got home and my husband & son saw the coffees that I had bought, they were ready for some coffee.  Since our son is a big fan of Vanilla coffees I decided to make this one first.  I put the coffee pot on and it was not long before this amazingly enticing aroma reached everyone and they were asking how soon before it was ready.  I hoped that the taste matched the wonderful aroma.  I prepared the cups (I always put things like sugar and/or creamer) in the cup first so the hot coffee will mix in as I pour it on top.  I poured the coffee into the cups and as I finished pouring each cup it was quickly taken.  Before I even had a chance to put the pot down and get to taste the coffee myself, I started hearing high praises and they were telling me to keep buying this coffee!  Then I tasted it and immediately knew that this was a coffee that ALWAYS had to be on hand!  Very rich, without being strong, very aromatic, without being too sweet.  The sweetness is just right and this coffee is absolutely delicious!  I should mention that we have tried other coffees from this company with equal pleasure!
5.0	My whole family loves this ice tea drink. We go through a gallon a day. It is refreshing, sugar free, caffeine free and the cheapest drink next to water. What more could you want. It is easy to carry back home, my bad back loves that. It is easier to store in cabinets. We take the canisters with us when we travel, no threat of spilling. The canisters are better for the enviroment than plastic jugs or aluminum cans. Plus we use the empty canisters later for storing anything from nails, screws, threads, etc. Can keep things dry & sand free at the beach. Our extended family has grown fond of it also. It is not available in their area so they are ordering it by the case online. The only thing you need to do is clean out your pitcher routinely. A residue will build up on the inside of the pitcher over time. I love it mixed with cold water and chilled. My husband likes it a little stronger by mixing powder with hot water and chilling. It makes a difference.
5.0	My son gives the carrots 5 stars but isn't a fan of the peas however that's all on the learning tummy of a baby and nothing to do with the product. I've got no complaints.
5.0	I am obsessed with this stuff. It's amazing. The flavor is very subtle, and not at all sweet. It's perfect for a very hot day since it's so refreshing, but I drink it pretty much daily.
5.0	All I can say is that this coconut drink is thee best I've ever tasted! I've tried a few different brands and I wasn't impressed with them. I always come back to Amy and Brian's brand, I totally recommend it!
5.0	Love crackers....but unable to find any that taste remotely similar to the regular crackers....until now!  These are sooo close and tasty....best yet....perhaps ever.
5.0	I have used many of Marshalls Creek products and this one, like all of the others is of high quality and a good value.  Although I haven't tried all of their products the 10 or so I have tried have been consistently of high quality.
5.0	I love that I can buy this tea in bulk online, since I can no longer get it at Starbucks.
5.0	My son-in-law from North Carolina loves these chips that he can only find here in Florida when visiting during the summer.Now H ecan order them online!
5.0	This is clearly the best no salt kettle cooked potato chips on the market. I hope the lower calorie per ounce claim is accurate.
5.0	I never leave home without ginger! Great for people with chronic migraines, motion sickness, nausea, etc. They also taste great.
5.0	My husband and I have a protein shake and one of the KIND Health Grains Granola Bars every morning. We really like the chunchy taste...
5.0	These bitters are awesome. Best Bloody Mary ever.
5.0	Very good espresso. Easy to use pods. Fairly priced.
5.0	NEEDED THE DARK OIL BUT THIS IS OK ON FISH
5.0	Sit down, dim the lights, and get ready to have your mind blown away because these breakfast biscuits are almost TOO MUCH TO HANDLE! I struggled for years trying to find a good breakfast item that would make me feel this good. Let's beak down the facts:<br />  -No cooking required.<br />  -Who has the time to prepare a real breakfast?<br />  -I'm a man so I don't cook.<br />  -Healthier than Pop-Tarts.<br />There's no reason you shouldn't buy these stomach filling god biscuits. Wake up, eat a pack of these and you'll be good for the rest of the day. You'll lose so much weight, people will think you're actually trying to improve your health! Nothing comes without a few negative points though, check it..<br />  -So convienent, you won't know what to do with your spare time in the morning.<br />  -Sometimes you want 5 biscuits but they're packaged 4 so there's some mathematical problems here.<br />  -Some people like to waste their morning cooking food.<br />  -Not as nostalgic as Pop-Tarts.<br /><br />So that's it, the choice is up to you. You can keep spending your mornings cracking eggs and getting grease burns on your chest or you can make the switch to these little packs of delicious oat grain things.. I think the answer is obvious though. Tasting is believing, and boy do I believe. My life is about 37.5% better now that I eat a pack of these every morning. Can't argue with those statistics!
5.0	Everything I expected it to be.  The hardest part is not eating all of it in one sitting!  I will be ordering more of his item.
5.0	Brine chicken and make sausage with this.  Can't find it in stores anymore.
5.0	my wife likes it because its has no corn syrup in it.
5.0	If you like eucalyptus you'll love these little sugar-freepastilles from Norway. The eucalyptus taste is strong without being overpowering. One or two pastilles will provide long-lasting flavor and are a great way to freshen your mouth after eating. They're also good for your breath. They come in a convenient travel-sized flip-top box. Sweeteners include maltitol and sorbitol; so, consume in moderation to prevent a laxative effect.
5.0	Highly recommend sprouted rice for its nutritional benefits. this red rice is attractive and flavorful. Lundberg brand is the best.
5.0	I really like it, it dissolves very well and the taste is really good. I wish it was just cheaper.
5.0	Best quick and fresh spaghetti sauce around.  This size makes a double batch of spaghetti sauce to freeze or use in lasagna.
5.0	I wasn't sure what to expect the first time I made this rice. It has a hearty texture which I really love. I made it with chicken stock instead of water and add some butter after it cooks and it's absolutely delicious.
5.0	This was the first time cooking Couscous by myself. I will continue buying it. I recommend Osem Couscous if you're a veggie especially!!
5.0	Have purchased these several times. We love hot apple cider and enjoy them on a cool day.<br />They smell so good when you first make a cook. The taste is mild and very good.
5.0	I did not expect this item to taste so good. It really impressed me. I dipped warm naan (Indian flatbread) in it to get the excess broth and it was delicious. It does taste like Chili. I wish I had the recipe.
5.0	We eat a lot of rice in our household. We choose this rice initially because based on a consumer report study it has the least amount of arsenic of all the brown rice tested. I choose this particular one because it said it keeps its individual grains and does not get like sticky rice, which is exactly what it does. It gets soft when cooked, but not soggy. The taste is also different from other rice, almost nutty. I would recommend it compared to all other brands of rice that I have tried.
5.0	Great coffee and really fast delivery.<br /><br />This coffee is very good. It is a little expensive and there are not many of the one-cup servings in the box.<br /><br />However, it is very good coffee
5.0	My 15 month old son really likes this juice.  I think is is just the right mixture.  If adults think this is just watered down juice, well it was not designed for you.
5.0	"My sister actually told me about ordering Saladitos (\\""Salas\\"" for short I call them) online at Amazon.com. She lives in Arizona where they are sold in some stores, and I live in Florida. I've been living here in Orlando for two years now and I have found no one that knows what they even are!! I also have a good high school friend who sent me a few bags of assorted varieties of salas last year, and she still sends them today!! But the lemon flavored is my FAVE!! They are absolutely delicious and ordering on Amazon.com is a breeze.. I love it!!"
5.0	This is the best popping corn my wife and I have ever tried.  It pops well; the popped corn is fluffy and flavorful.  Far superior to the generic stuff in the grocery stores.  We use a stir and oil type popper and get great results every batch.  We buy it in the 12 pack and find that it also makes a good gift for other popcorn lovers.
5.0	Tastes just like sugar free red bull.  Love it!!
5.0	The peanut butter exceeded my expectations. I like that it has all natural ingredients. I like to add it to smoothies, warm toast, or straight out of the jar.
5.0	I love these chocolate covered pretzels so much that I forget they are gluten free! They are super tasty and a better quality chocolate than what I have found with other brands.
5.0	I have tried a couple other plum organic flavors with my 11 month old. He has never refused any of them and eats the whole thing! But I must say he could not get enough of this flavor he learned how to suck ever last drop out of this bottle! Lol!! I love these for traveling. I typically make my own food for him and thought these would be less of a mess to travel with. They are once your child has mastered how to suck on them to eat and not to suck to hard, it took about 7 to 8 diffent feeds for him to learn this. All in all I love the quality and the taste of this product. High recommended! Wish it was an amazon subcribe and save item, just saying! :)
5.0	great flavor, just the right about of &#34;kick&#34;. It taste great over some brie cheese with crackers.<br />The sweetness, and spice makes a winning combination..
5.0	Thank you so much!!!! My son loves Spongebob and his 3rd birthday party is on May 31st so I'm so excited to see all the kids especially my son's face when he sees all the Spongebob!!!!
5.0	These were great--light and fluffy. We bought them for a visiting relative and served to the family. Made them a couple of different ways--added blueberries one day and bananas another.  My picky 2 year old (not on a gluten free diet) loved them!
5.0	These are my all-time favorite hashbrowns.  Soak them in water for 15 minutes and they are ready to cook.  Unfortunately they are no longer sold at grocery stores near me.  I wish they sold only 1 carton at a time instead of 6!
5.0	As a confessed chile head I bought this on a whim while picking up some habanero dust. Boy am I glad I did! Think of this as pizza peppers on crack. I use them like crushed red pepper on pizza, in soup, wherever you might want a kick and it's perfect without being unbearably overpowering (granted if you get too much you will know it very quickly). Low grade chile heads might find this stuff a bit excessive and non chile heads need not apply but if you're even slightly into the hotter side of stupidity this would be well worth your time.
5.0	What can I say, delicious. Light plastic bottle, easy for shipping. Tasty product. Purchase without regret. Tastes great on whatever you put it on.
5.0	My husband is diabetic so must watch his carb intake.  The fact that Smucker'S uses Splenda as a sweetener makes this syrup highly acceptable.
5.0	Geez...this is incredible...Love this..Have used in several recipes and the taste is perfect. Great to have on hand for any mushroom related recipe. Have made Mushroom Soup and Meatloaf with Mushroom Gravy so far...This will last a long time..
5.0	Everything was great.thank you.
5.0	i'm a insulin dependent diabetic of 46 years & my son suggest i try Agave. He uses it all the time<br />so when i visited him i tried it.  It didn't spike my blood sugar & it's natural.  i like buying it at<br />Amazon's bcause it comes in the 2 pack.  I LOVE AMAZON !!
5.0	Love this stuff. Only pizza sauce I use.
5.0	Very smooth taste and dark roast. Love this coffee!!
5.0	I don't eat this as breakfast cereal, but with eggs (substitute for bread), some soups (substitute for crackers), or put in meatloaf or meatballs for extender. I think it's delicious.
5.0	Very good nuts.  Just a few at a time is a good, tasy snack and these are good.
5.0	For some reason the larger box is crunchier. Great stuff. I hope anyone would give it a try if they want the larger size.
5.0	This is a great product if you like coffee, and money. If you don't like money, you may not like this product.
5.0	I actually liked them, my college uses this brand, because it comes in bulk, so for four years I had them off and on for breakfast in the dining hall. They taste just like the brand name and they are much cheaper. Don't leave the bag open though because they go stale fast, and another downside, just like the brand name they get soggy quickly so eat fast.
5.0	Having a quantity of these on hand is a boon to my favorite hobby: cooking! The quantity is a bit large, but some of our children and grandchildren, also avid cooks, like to &#34;shop&#34; in my spice pantry from time to time.
5.0	kids love them, i love them since there nothing to cleanup after they done!
5.0	As a European and an absolute rye and pumpernickel bread fan, I have always snapped up any of the Mestemacher brand variety in the local store.  But it becomes increasingly hard to find.  Amazon seems to be the one source that can offer such specialty items.  My family and friends love it when I entertain with German dishes on special occasions and these make a great addition.  Also, it makes more sense to buy these in larger quantities such as the one offered, as they can be stored for 9 to 10 months.  Because of this quality, they can be part of someone's emergency pantry, too.
5.0	I ordered these for my Kuerig to try something different.  They were an excellent price under $30 for 72 K-Cups and they qualified for free shipping.  Excellent cappuccino taste.  I love all 3 flavors.  To match the size one would get at a coffee shop, you would need to use 2 k-cups.  It tastes too watered down on any setting above 8oz.  Still, coffee shop taste for a fraction of the price.  My only recommendation would be to brew a cup of just hot water after using these.  If you don't if may clog your Kuerig.  I'll be buying more when I run out.
5.0	30.00 for 50 of the best coffee it is a no brainer. Expiration dates are a long ways away as well
5.0	If you use green tea in the amounts that we do, this is a great way to buy it.  It is a good value, and way cheaper than buying smaller quantities at the store.
5.0	Arrived quickly. The product was packaged well. This is a great buyer and when I need them again I will purchase from them again. Thank you.
5.0	Just like the restaurant.
5.0	great size for lunches, good taste, great price
5.0	We actually did not use it as of yet but we are glad we found a single grain barley cereal!
5.0	I needed the extract and it worked will in my cookie recipe.
5.0	wonderful Flavor!!! great price taste amazing
5.0	There's nothing like a good cuppa (cup of tea) and PG tips is just that. The strength of the tea is just right, not too strong like some of the Irish tea I've tried but stronger than say for example the Twinings English Breakfast tea or Stash teas. The price offered by amazon is also by far the best that I've been able to find anywhere. I like the 6 pack of 40 as well since the packs remain sealed and fresh till I need them although I do tend to go through the whole lot quite quickly. For those who like a good strong cup of tea, nothing beats PG tips.
5.0	Fabulous product.  Works great. Makes me want to bake more!
5.0	I have been buying these for years.  Natural source, no garbage additives or chemicals.  Great taste mixed with organic olive oil and organic balsamic vinegar. I will keep buying!
5.0	My family couldn't tell that they were gluten free.
5.0	I actually bought this because I needed to coffee-dye some clothes very cheaply, and this was the cheapest coffee I could find. I thought it meant that it must be terrible.<br /><br />After I was done I had a ton of it left over. I use a keurig and had recently bought some really weak coconut coffee that I knew i'd never finish. I started cracking open the keurig cups and mixing the coconut coffee with Cafe Bustelo. It tasted like it was right out of a coffee shop- so amazing. Now I add a little to any coffee I drink and it always tastes really amazing. I am so glad I ended up with it and now I'm going to be buying more.
5.0	Very neat product.  Small pot, but the bloom fills up the pot, which I think is great.  Using actual tea cups its 2 servings, but a coffee mug gets about 1.5 servings per pot.
5.0	I miss Aji in Peru, but I am going back next month . Thanks.
5.0	This tube of tomato paste is fantastic! When we were stationed in England we often bought a product similar and were disappointed when returning stateside as we couldn't find it.<br /><br />I like the flavor a lot, very fresh tasting and so convenient because now I don't have to figure out how to store a partial can of tomato paste. I love this and will certainly be buying more.
5.0	I began drinking pumpkin spice coffee at dunkin donuts and then tried green mountain. At first I wasn't sure if I would like it however turns out it is great. It's not as strong as the other brand so it doesn't hurt my stomach yet it has the same great taste.
5.0	"Growing up, I was a huge fan of the jerky sold at Costco stores under the namebrand \\""Pacific Gold.\\""  They recently, however, stopped carrying turkey jerky.  A little research led me to discover that Oberto owns the Pacific Gold brand, so I tried this out and - lo and behold - it's pretty much the same thing.  Score!    It's an unusual take on jerky - much softer and chewier than the typical drier stuff.  It's hands down my favorite, but be aware that it's significantly different from other brands."
5.0	Love this cereal!! It can be a bit pricey but totally worth it if you grew up eating this cereal. Tastes exactly like the cereal and when I found out I was worried that it was expired. But it's all fresh cereal that is packaged and sent to you.
5.0	Good quality cinnamon. You can use it for cooking, baking, or simply with some<br />granola or cereals in the morning, likey!
5.0	Prior to having celiac, I always used Maple Groves products. They make a nice gift basket for gift giving also.I serve this pancake mix to guests not knowing it's GF. Everyone loves the pancakes! look for their maple syrup also, for a wonderful pancake experience!
5.0	My grandson loves the flavor and because his parents travel a lot the love the ease of using the product.
5.0	Next best thing to the real stuff. If you are trying to lose weight, this is great. Tastes good, easy to fix. Mix it and use it on toast, english muffins, etc. or even put some in a smoothie.
5.0	These are my favorite vegan hot dogs. Yes they are high in sodium but also high in protein! They taste great. These are the best hot dogs.
5.0	These are a hit!! Even sending them to a child who is abroad.
5.0	This SFSB, is excellent. It tastes great and allows my family to use it the same way we once did peanut butter.  It is also great to use for school lunch, to keep nut allergy students safe.
5.0	You just can't beat V-8 for putting all the goodies in one can. Low sodium tastes very flat if you are used to the salted version, but who can't add salt? Or Mrs Dash? The amount of sodium in the average diet is disturbing and any product that leaves it out is a better choice. Your heart and ankles will thank you. Only consideration with this purchase is that the case comes shrink wrapped with 24 loose cans-- there are NOT four 6 packs held together with those seagull stranglers that you get at the grocery. So be prepared to lug a whole flat into your pantry. Small inconvenience for the price + free delivery to the door :)
5.0	I found this product to be a delicious and it satisfies the mid-morning and afternoon munches.  The bar delivers a nice punch with lots of nuts with just the right amount of chocolate. My favorite is the Peanut Butter on Dark Chocolate. It tastes so good you forget it's a protein bar. Great job Nature Valley!
5.0	The Red Gumballs were great.  The flavor was exactly as I remembered from my youth.
5.0	Best BBQ Sauce I've tasted.
5.0	I'm always on the look-out for jam or jelly that doesn't have a ton of sugar.  I really love this fruit spread because it only has 6g sugar per tablespoon but tastes great. It is both sweet and tart (which I love -- I'm a huge fan of raspberries, rhubarb, cranberries, etc.), and doesn't make my blood sugar spike (I'm not diabetic, I'm just sensitive to sugar).  I eat it on bread or mixed with plain Greek yogurt, and I may try baking with it.  Really yummy, and plus it's organic.  I found it in my local co-op grocery.
5.0	My kids laughed when I ordered these organic cookies.  Afterall, how could anything be better than the original?  However, they stopped laughing when they and their friends ate through all 6 boxes in short order.  We just placed another order for 6 more boxes.
5.0	I love Miracle Whip, but my son loves it even more..  thank you so much.  Debbie
5.0	I would definitely fall into the category of a jam snob. I make jams, preserves, conserves, jellies, marmalade, and syrups fairly regularly using french methods. This has left me accustomed to high quality preserves that taste natural, vibrant, and tangy. And, have plenty of jewel-like fruit pieces suspended in them. When making strawberry preserves using french methods, it takes a few days of soaking in sugar and briefly simmering to draw the water from the berries and replace it with sugar, before the final boil. This process gives the berries a beautiful translucent quality. That being said, Bonne Maman is a lovely brand of french confitures. The strawberry is loaded pieces of french strawberries and is good enough to eat strait from the jar. Try the strawberry inside crepes with ham and swiss cheese. The four fruit preserves are also delectable and very homemade tasting. I love to try a new french preserve recipe in my kitchen then try the Bonne Maman version to see how they compare. Bonne Maman is always worth a few extra dollars, other cheaper mass-produced varieties do not compare in the slightest. Try any of the Bonne Maman Preserves on good french bread or as filling in tarts and cookies and you will not be disappointed. Since they are high quality preserves they handle baking well and do not run out of cookies or small tarts like cheap preserves do. If you are looking for something a little out of the ordinary, try the Chestnut Preserves if you can get your hands on them. I can't find many of the varieties I want in stores around me and work too much to go try to find them (always cooking and baking on days off), so I purchase them online and have not had any issues as of yet. Try this line of preserves with confidence if you appreciate well-made fruit preserves that are deeply flavored and not too sweet.
5.0	Another flavor for the chef son-in-law
5.0	I usually buy these by the tub from a local grocery store. But they are bloody expensive so I struck out to the internet in search of a more economical option.<br />Thank you Amazon.<br />These cookies are so good. So, so, soooo good.<br />They have a delicious almost spicy cocoa snap to them, and are not ridiculously sweet.<br />I'd say they're a grown up treat, but my 6 y/o loves them too. but he has a pretty refined palate...for a 6 y/o.<br />Seriously, give them a try, they really are delicious.<br />I cannot attest as to any probiotic properties. But I don't feel like hell after eating them so there's that.
5.0	Very pleased, taste great & like that it doesn't spike your blood sugar as other sugars do.  We use in our coffee everyday, but many other uses for it besides that.  Also very good price.
5.0	I'm a regular dude and have never been a huge tea drinker. However, because of all of the benefits of green tea I've been on a kick over the past year. I have GERD so I only drink decaf.  This tea and a few other flavored decaf green teas are of limited availability unfortunately. The Kiwi Pear Decaf tea sounded like a really strange combo but I ordered it anyway. It has a one of a kind taste that, to me, resembles pistachio.  It's not gonna be for everyone but it is one of the best teas I've ever had. I went to order more and they were sold out and upon writing The Republic of Tea (manufacturers), they don't plan to bring it back to market unless they get overwhelming demand.
5.0	Awesome! I've missed pop tarts, these are way better!
5.0	Love or hate; rarely an in between reaction to Twiglets.
5.0	Their taste is what you know from eating and loving them when you were in Germany. And they are as fresh as you get them over seas.
5.0	Love love love. Gotta order more. Nice and fresh! Drink it hot or cold, or with or without milk.
5.0	This jam is delicious, it is a new family favorite! This is what cranberry jam should taste like! And being a home jam-maker myself, I am happy to see that only organic and natural ingredients went into it.
5.0	Great chocolate...I bought these about two years ago and they were good then. Still fresh and sweet.  They will last 2 or 3 months for me.
5.0	Always the right stuff and always prompt and at a good price.
5.0	I like this product very much as a mouth freshener and keeps my mouth busy when I might otherwise reach for candy.
5.0	Bought this for my husband after seeing all the reviews.  This has been the ONLY powdered cheese he will accept on his popcorn besides what comes in the Kraft mac and cheese box.  I was tired of finding boxes of Mac and cheese sand cheese in the pantry.  This worked for both of us!
5.0	These are much better than M&M peanuts. I love the taste and texture and have to force myself to stop eating them.
5.0	My 7 month old loves these. Individually packed and easy for the go. Will get again Very soon. Great price
5.0	I brewed this in my iced tea maker for the 1st time today. Had a friend over to visit and we both loved it. It is light and refreshing with a pretty strong coconut flavor to it. I will be ordering this again.
5.0	If you have a newborn who appears to have colic, reflux or any kind of digestive problem, this is the bomb!  It is a miracle product which not all drs know about.  Research this online for the recipe.  It includes some kind of acidolphis, molasses, liquid c, etc so that it is totally balanced.  My granddaughter is absolutely flourishing on this after enduring 4 Dr prescribed formulas!  Now the pediatrician is asking for the recipe!
5.0	It is a great expresso powder. will be buying again
5.0	According to my thirteen month old grandson who loves these crackers dearly.These seem to be his very very fav cracker.
5.0	We used to buy it at Kroger.  They stopped carrying it.  We were upset. It was fantastic to find it on Amazon. I hope we continue to be able to order it. This soup tastes every bit as good as homemade, perhaps better.  We add chop meat, 1 can of chopped tomatoes and 1 can of tomato soup.  Delicious!!
5.0	Black Walnut is just a good herb to have anywhere. I use black walnut as part of a parasite cleanse and a mouthwash I make from time to time. You could even fill gel capsules with these if you didn't want to use a tincture.
5.0	I don't know how those people on YouTube eat these whole all at once. A little goes a long way in most recipes and I like some hot foods even to the point of making me cry by a stack of tissues.<br />While the habanero chili is my favorite, we like the extra heat and flavor of the ghost chili.<br /><br />I plan on buying some more very soon as our supply is just about gone.
5.0	Been using this rub on fish, chicken, and pork for several years. Always coming back to order more of the Rasta Rub :) 10 cans and counting!
5.0	it came very nicely wrapped. pretty much looked as pictured. after a week or so one set of 5, give or take, leaves fell off. i was kinda devistated. ive never had a green thumb and wanted to start getting into plants, health and the fung shui or feng shui thing so i ordered it. when u order plants i think u take a chance. i moved it more away from heat source and closer to where i have a humidifier and i think its doing better. knock on wood no more leave fell off. i luv it.
5.0	These corn flake crumbs worked out great on the chicken I fried. They were crispy.
5.0	ordered these for my diabetic family and myself for the holidays.
5.0	It's a good way to get veggies and fruit.  Also convenient on the go.  My toddler loves the taste and drinking it straight from the package.
5.0	Muir Glen Organic tomato products are the best. This is the only place in my area that I can find them by the case. Thank you and please keep them available.
5.0	still using ...ok so far
5.0	My family loves it, if you really like the spicy food, it really worths to try this super hot sauce.
5.0	GREaT product for the price!  I expected a lower quality product.  The under shelf is wire (which is strong wire) but the top holds up my Keurig well. :-)  Love it and will order again!  Great product with free shipping!  Thank you!  (I paid $16 and it was a prime item so free shipping).
5.0	This is really good. I thought I'd give it a try. Now I make sure I have it.
5.0	American tea is dishwater so I drink PGTips.  Strong British tea with plenty of caffeine. Amazon has the best price I've been able to find on-line, and free shipping too!
5.0	How could it have taken so long for someone to design such a simple product that works effortlessly and flawlessly
5.0	The cookies are beautiful (nice images pressed into the cookies), and lightly sweetened (delicious).  Great snack/ treat (with a little learning)
5.0	This is good chili and I got it at a reasonable price. It's good to have this on the shelf.
5.0	Item as promised, promptly shipped. Recommend most highly! Love this Pho!
5.0	I like this tea for it's aroma and spicy taste.<br />Can't say anything about the Detox effects since I find it nice to have something<br />different without caffeine later in the day.  The price on Amazon certainly beats out<br />those at local shops.
5.0	Excellent! Truly large nuts, super crunchy and with the taste I remembered truly wonderful peanuts having (from my childhood.) Great memories of Christmas at grandma and grandpa's house in every deafening mouthful. These are pretty darn good, and the price is better than competitors.
5.0	First time trying this coffee but it beats the grocery store types I have been using for years. A bit pricey but has a nice aroma and flavor. A hint of chocolate in both.
5.0	I just wrote another review for  Premium Chocolatiers and this order deserves the praise I gave  for the Christmas Figures. This is Awesome allergy free high quality chocolate and I am ordering Valentines chocolate<br />from Premium Chocolatiers..  Chocolate lovers can't go wrong
5.0	Mccormick always has good flavor.  The bottle was a nice size that fits in almost any spice rack.  It also is sleek looking.  The flavors are amazing.
5.0	Daily drink  excellent!  Thanks!
5.0	I do love this in terms of quality and taste, despite the fact that I personally don't care for fish and seafood! I bought this because it was in a few recipes I wanted to try from Nom Nom Paleo's web site. This is great for Asian dishes if you like a mild seafood flavor. Excellent quality and healthy. And Paleo!
5.0	Baby loves it, I love it.
5.0	Great alternative than real lemon and you can carry it with you.
5.0	I think Amazon has the best price for this product.  Agave is best substitute for sugar for baking..
5.0	Had an unexpected spiciness to it which I had to get used to.
5.0	Every one tasted amazing! I will defiantly order again!
5.0	This is amazing seasoning.  I'm a very good cook and this is one of my secrets......it goes in everything!
5.0	These are the best instant potatoes I have ever bought. Compared to the flakes these are more like beads and they absorb more than the flakes.<br />A little butter, salt and pepper or Mrs Dash instead with a little cilantro and you have wonderful tasting mashed potatoes.
5.0	Many Decaf coffees are weak and tasteless. This decaf is full bodied and has goo coffee taste and aroma. I recommend it to those who like good coffee but must or chose to refrain from caffeine.
5.0	These nuts are to die for! And I agree with the other reviewers ... they are absolutely addictive. I'm not a coffee drinker so I wasn't sure I'd like the taste. But they are delicious. Just barely a hint of a coffee flavor to them; it's more of a caramel flavor.  I can't wait until these are available from Amazon.
5.0	Surprisingly good. Just add boiling water to the box (my tea kettle works great), wait a few minutes and throw them into a cast iron fry pan or griddle. Works good on a non-stick electric griddle too. &#34;Smothered & Covered&#34;. Got my own Waffle House in the kitchen now!
5.0	These are excellent for snacking, I keep some in my car in case I get the munchies.
5.0	Arrived early! I think this is the best tasting tapenade. Great for cocktails, mid day snack, and with steak. YUM. Highly recommended!
5.0	This is a great product, high quality, good price.  I bought the small harness for my kitten when she was three months old, she learned to like it because she got to go outside and explore when she had it on.  Two months later I bought the medium harness as kittens grow really fast and it fits her just perfect.  My kitten is 6 months old and weighs about 6 lbs. at this time and because the harness is adjustable it should last her through her adult life.
5.0	Hi, I'm Ron Don Volante, singer/manager of the group Bottoms Up. Instead of downloading my music, I thought I'd download my thoughts on Schwan's new Creamed Chipped Beef/Corned Beef Hash Combo Can. Part of Schwan's new beef series.<br /><br />Creamed<br />Chipped<br />Beefy<br />Corned<br />Hashy<br /><br />Right. Put this ish right into my stove and heat it up right outta the can. Tastes good!<br /><br />What do you want me to do, not eat this hash?
5.0	I cannot say enough about the Talking Rain Peach Nectarine sparkling water  It is so refreshing and delicicous  It has not yucky sweeteners and that is another reason I love this m Please do not discontinue this flavor  I love it  Wish they would put this flavor instead of the berry flavor in the mixed case  The berry is awful  taste just like Robitussin+
5.0	Make a knock your socks off salsa with these peppers the fact that it brought my annoying neighbor to his knees as he crawled to the kitchen sink begging for water makes me want to buy another round and make some brownies with a kick of pure evil..... Absolutely love your peppers 10/10 would buy and use again! P.s. for those of us that can handle heat its got a slightly smokey flavor with a intense burn.... Its good
5.0	Lindor Truffles put the Swiss into Swiss Chocolate. These dark chocolate truffles are a delight and perfect counterpoint to the [[ASIN:B002RBTVC8 White Chocolate]] variation. Vive la diff&eacute;rence! Both are dangerously delicious.<br /><br />They share a common texture with their [[ASIN:B002RBTVC8 White Chocolate Truffle]] cousins - the delicious shell around a creamy smooth interior. They feel sensuous in the mouth and a wonderful complement to the delicious and smoothly chocolatey flavor of the truffles themselves.<br /><br />On the package it recommends keeping the truffles between 60 and 68 degrees. I put one in the fridge to see what they are like when cold. They become more stiff and for me not as delightful to eat. It seems the cold also mutes some of the flavor. I expect if kept too warm they may tend to melt too easily. If you are in a warm or hot climate you might want to order a seasons supply before it gets hot to ship them safely! Box of melted chocolate might still be tasty but not delightful...<br /><br />I shared some of these with friends along with some of the [[ASIN:B002RBTVC8 White Chocolate Truffles]]. The men generally thought they were good but most of the women expressed a stronger delight with these lovely morsels. I expect anyone who likes dark chocolate will enjoy these, but for some of us these can be more than just tasty; they can be a sensuous experience.
5.0	An excellent product sent quickly by the Amazon seller. The price was fair (much better than my local whole foods store). Don't forget to hydrate the seeds as they absorb 9 times their size in water which can disturb the digestive system if not hydrated. I recommend a drink of the seeds consisting of the juice of 1/4 of a lemon along with a few drops of stevia. I have not yet made a gel of the seeds which is the way many people use them. The gel can be added to a variety of other foods to increase the health benefit. After drinking my concoction daily for a couple of weeks I seem to feel a little sharper mentally which is one of the health benefits of the seeds.
5.0	My favorite! This has replaced coffee in my house. Luv, luv, luv it!
5.0	Our local stores charge an arm and a leg for dried fruit. With diabetes in the family, dried fruit is the answer. The peaches are very large and appear delicious. I just opened them today and added about a pound of almonds to the mix. Thank you Amazon for coming to bat for some of us in the outer regions!!!
5.0	this hair product is really good. It keeps my hair soft and silky throughout the day. It is not like normal oils which are very sticky on palms when applied.
5.0	If you like rich chocolate and also spices like cinnamon and cloves then you will enjoy this hot chocolate. It's good on it's own and also makes for a delicious mocha when added to coffee. Try in in a milkshake too.
5.0	My go-to when I get a chocolate urge or just need a little more fiber in my diet. It's hard to find something that tastes yummy and is good for you too. Thank you for selling it on amazon.com.
5.0	I use this in a specific spice formula where blend, flavor, and consistency is important to me - this powder is perfect - great size and price - fast delivery - thank you
5.0	This seasoning is fantastic... Cut potato wedges put them in a plastic bag with a generous amount of seasoning and shake it up. Place them on a flat pan and roast in the oven at 350 degrees for about 45 minutes. They go great with anything!!
5.0	The shampoo works great.  I have been using it for awhile and it cleans my hair very well.  Not over drying my hair.  I keep buying it for my hair washing needs. I wash my hair about every 2 days.  I have very fine hair.  I use the conditioner that goes with the  shampoo. I have been very glad to have found this shampoo.
5.0	It is what I used for years. When we couldn't find it in stores I bought it from you. Thanks so much, I love the non drip bottles.
5.0	THE ABOVE ITEMS WERE DELIVERED ON TIME, AND WERE BEYOND EXPECTATION. <br />THE ITEMS WERE FRESH, AND TASTED GOOD, AND WERE ENJOYED BY ALL.  MANY THANKS.
5.0	Great price! Great Quality!
5.0	Excellent coconut oil
5.0	Helps with my anxiety alot
5.0	salty and good-these almonds are delicious and nutrious. the package is easy to open and reseal.i will definately order again.
5.0	It's the best thing to eat with ham or sausages or chicken or pork or...  Tarhonya accompanies nearly any kind of food.
5.0	Ordered it before and will probably order again.  I just hate paying 50 cents for coffee so I usually prefer Caza Trail.
5.0	Love the fiber content in this product. My favorite way to mix this up is with Chocolate almond milk, hemp seeds, about 1/3 cup of pineapple (for a little sweetness), 1/3 cup of water and a little ice. I love the nutty flavor of the protein combined with the chocolate flavor.
5.0	These are super tasty and healthy too. Low sugar and calories. The perfect mid-morning or mid-afternoon snack. Would be great over yogurt too!
5.0	I brew this coffee in an Aeropress and use a 35 dollar manual grinder and get fantastic results with a medium/fine grind. A while back I bought some Gevalia whole bean medium roast from a local grocery store and no matter how I changed the grind or water temperature, it would always come out too sour tasting and lacking good flavor. I thought it was a mistake on my part even though I was sure I did the brewing correctly. I decided to buy a bag of this and brewed it the exact same way as the gevalia, and this stuff just blows it out of the water. I could tell from the smell and first sip that it was a far superior bean for my taste. The taste for me is JUST RIGHT. It's on the strong side flavor wise, but not overly acidic or bitter. It hits the perfect balance between all of these and has such a great, bold flavor that it almost resembles dark chocolate at times. Very smooth and just a great full bodied coffee for anyone wanting a good strong cup.
5.0	I bought Grand Arome by Poulain in France in 2001 and love it!  Everytime anyone from my family goes back to France, this is the one item I ask them to bring back to me.  I find that, not only is it delicious, but when I have one mug full of hot cocoa in the morning with two pieces of toast, that I don't get hungry again all morning.  I actually lose weight when I stick to this for breakfast.  What a great treat, and with such good benefits.
5.0	Great price for great food; my baby loves these! We have yet to try the Salmon yet since I'm waiting until he is a year- but he loves all the rest, and I like that you can SUBSCRIBE and get 20% off. Will buy again!
5.0	I ordered these for my dad for Father's Day, and he asked me to get some for my mom on her birthday, because she was 'helping' him finish them off too fast!
5.0	I love this tea! I like it plain or with honey and almond milk.
5.0	These reusable K-Cups have saved us tons of money! They say you only get 20 uses out of them, but we have used ours for months now. You just dump the grounds and refill them. I will reorder when these we have show some wear and tear.
5.0	"This \\""family pack\\"" has 4 10 ounce bricks of Pilon, ground, light and heat protected, and vacuum sealed. This is a VERY FAIR PRICE for the highest premium, and the grind is just above Espresso (slightly coarser than Turkish), perfect either for espresso or moka pots.<br /><br />Amazon warns that there are \\""lower prices\\"" but I've used those vendors and 1. They charge $6 shipping, while this is free on Prime and 2. You know that ground coffee begins to stale in only days, and the batches I've gotten from Amazon ship direct have been extremely fresh, whereas third party marketplace sellers have not. For the extra couple bucks, this is worth it.<br /><br />The quality of this 100% Arabica is comparable to Lavazza, Illy and other Italian imports. It's priced at about Lavazza here, and Illy is $16 for 9 ounces, so it clearly is a far better value there.<br /><br />Highly recommended, try it if you're an Illy lover like me, and you'll be shocked at the price, taste AND freshness difference. I'm a Barista instructor at become a barista dot com and have nothing to do with this brand or manufacturer (other than liking it!).<br /><br />CAUTIONARY UPDATE: Amazon advertises, and this brand used to be (and sometimes still is), 100% Arabica. Recently, some shipments have changed labeling that says \\""100% pure coffee\\"" instead. When we sent this to our lab, it was OVER 50% cheap Robusto! This will give you a great caffeine buzz, but it is like paying a premium price for Maxwell House. The key is the label-- to avoid US FDA and FCC problems, the manufacturer changed \\""Arabica\\"" to \\""pure coffee\\"" -- make SURE the label you get is marked Arabica, or you're getting ripped off!!"
5.0	I'm on a budget so getting something that taste like it claims is worth the minor splurge. I would recommend this product
5.0	This gift to friend was big hit.  It's same as her mother had man come every year to their house to get.  Usually get this little fruits but saw this Christmas one and went with that--glad I did.
5.0	Love it! This water is the best!
5.0	Just had one of the 4 Dosas. Yum, yum yummy!!<br />This tastes just like the Udupi Dosa. Now I don't have to run to an Indian Restaurant, during my Dosa cravings. Thanks a bunch to Tandoori Chef for bringing this to us.
5.0	These are 100% the real thing.    I bought out my local Walmart of jelly belly's for a party favor jars I am making. When they didn't have enough of the product I went on amazon ( which I should of done first would of saved a lot of money ). They shipped fast, the jar was full of goodness. When I got them I compared flavors with the jelly belly's I hard already purchased. They are the same product. The brand this is sub packaged by ( Kirkland Signature ) is actually the same brand at Costco. If Wikipedia is right about the brand Costco does own it ( I say if because it isn't always dead on ) but they do carry it in there stores.    Will be purchasing again for my own greedy stash of Jelly Belly's!
5.0	This tea is great!  I have been drinking it for at least a year now and never tire of it and nothing else seems to compare.  It is great with honey and a splash of milk.
5.0	This sauce is hard to find and we were so happy to find this large bottle.  The 40 ounces is great for holidays and football games.  Use one bottle over little meatballs, wienies, or sausages in a slow cooker for appetizers.  Also, great served with cream cheese and crackers.  Great flavor of heat and sweet.  Good pantry staple to keep on hand for a quick appetizer.  Eight thumbs up from our house!
5.0	Cashews, yum. Product is as expected. Tasty, healthy and wonderful cashews. Will order again in the future. Ordered larger quantity to get a more affordable price.
5.0	I have been ordering Crio Bru for over a year.  I have to admit, it is the best go to item when you want a warm cup of something wonderful, that will not make you jittery or add unwanted Carbs.  Great in the morning with something to read, and great late night treat.  I prefer the Gahna, but that is an individual choice.
5.0	I accidentally purchased this product because it wasn't clearly marked as not containing the popcorn, but rather just the mixtures (noci crunch, butter, plastic bag). I wish that had been more clearly marked. Other than that, it's perfect - I had just intended that it would be the one with popcorn.
5.0	"This organic French Roast bean has a fantastic aroma and is very smooth.  It is 100% Arabica, is dark and oily, and rich in flavor.  Mine arrived fresh, and the \\""Sell By\\"" date was 11/28/2013.  At this price ($21.81 at time of purchase on 1/13/2013), this organic bean is well worth it.  Will be purchasing this again.<br />[pics posted]"
5.0	This a great peanut butter.  I particularly am happy about the short list of ingredients.  Not the 20 or so chemicals and miscellaneous byproducts in regular styles.  This butter tastes like peanuts, because it is.  It is easy to spread and my children love it.  We use it regularly in school lunches.
5.0	Very good flavor, and no aspartame!  My kids love this and I think cinnamon is the best out of all the glee flavors we've tried.
5.0	I use this stuff on pretty much everything. Turkey sandwiches, homemade sushi, scrambled eggs, chicken nuggets, and more. So perfect. Not too spicy, not too sour. Not too expensive either. Love it.
5.0	This is hands-down the best spicy brown mustard I've ever tasted, and I've tried lots of different mustards, both big name and specialty. I specifically bought the case on Amazon so I'd be sure never to run out.
5.0	Love this vinegar, as very good quality!
5.0	I have a hard time rating this, I tried it and it was very good and tender, tasted great. But when I went back to get more my kids had already eaten it all.
5.0	Best coffee I have ever tried. This coffee is extremely smooth and hard to resist. Company that has tried this at my home love it and end up going and purchasing this on their own. Highly recommended.
5.0	"I thought I was in heaven when I acquired the Bialetti Brikka stovetop espresso (Moka Pot) maker.  I loved it so much that I actually purchased a second one just in case the first one failed me. THEN........I came across Illy MOKA coffee,that is roasted and ground especially for stovetop makers and have to say it is by far the absolute BEST tasting coffee I ever had.  I've tried Starbucks Espresso blend and just as the other person said, it left a strong bitter after taste leaving a displeasing taste on my pallet.  When made correctly, this coffee will yield about 1/8\\"" layer of crema with a velvity smooth flavor.<br /><br />I also own a Bodum milk frother that goes hand-in-hand with my Brikka pot and Illy MOKA coffee.  I am able to replicate cappaccino that will stand up to ANY local coffee house.  I say this with confidence because it's true, so I must share my success.  The trick in my opinion is to use fresh 2% milk with a drop of light cream for absolute perfect froth.<br /><br />I'm rambling... but bottom line is ILLY MOKA COFFEE is the BEST on the market!!!  Get some today and you won't be dissapointed.  I also like the fact that they are in vacuum sealed 8.8 oz. cans that you can use up before they have a chance to get stale.<br /><br />Happy coffee drinking!"
5.0	Good seller<br />Product as described
5.0	Our whole family loves these yummy grapefruit candies.  Don't order them in the summer though unless you will be home to receive the package because they will melt in the heat.  It is a great deal and we will buy them again!
5.0	mom loved this new assortment of chocolates, variety, freshness, i'll be purchasing this again for her soon, anything that puts a smile on a mothers face
5.0	Addictive, and close to homemade, oh but the calories!
5.0	Super inexpensive and delicious! I WILL be buying these again
5.0	Too bad we can't buy this product locally here in Albuqueruqe, NM.  We can buy other Krusteaz products but not this one.  I'll order some more next Fall -- it is wonderful!!
5.0	If you're a chocolate and coconut fan, these Kashi's hit the spot.  I agree with another reviewer who said the calorie count is minimal, but sometimes it's hard not to eat the whole box.  However, over time, the desire to eat more than one does seem to wear off.  Kashi does a terrific job of combining nutrition and taste without going overly sweet.  This variety is the best of their sweeter choices.  The honey almond flax nevertheless remain my favorite overall. [[ASIN:B002DHN956 Kashi Granola Honey Almond Flax,1.2-Ounce Bars (Pack of 24)]]
5.0	Love it sugar free what I need it
5.0	"I have tried every brand of GF pasta I can find -- stuff made from corn, rice, quinoa, you name it -- and it all has a funky aftertaste, cooks up poorly, and falls apart if reheated. NOT TINKYADA!! :-)  This stuff ROCKS! My hubby is super picky and not GF, but HE LOVES TINKYADA.  When I serve it to my gluten-eating friends and family, they take a bite and say, \\""oh, too bad you can't eat this...\\"" SURPRISE! GF doesn't have to mean icky-tasting!  :-) :-) :-) :-) :-)  More great stuff from Tinkyada you can get here (and prices here beat the other online GF grocers as of 3/2008):  [[ASIN:B000FK63IS Tinkyada Brown Rice, Spaghetti with Rice Bran, 16-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)]]  [[ASIN:B000FK63LK Tinkyada Brown Rice, Penne Pasta with Rice Bran, 16-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)]]  [[ASIN:B000FK7PQW Tinkyada Brown Rice, Elbows with Rice Bran, 16-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)]]  [[ASIN:B000FK7PYY Tinkyada Organic Brown Rice Spaghetti, 12-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)]]"
5.0	The best thing about gluten free is that most anyone can enjoy them--those on a gluten free diet and those who are not.  These pops are small, colorful and very tasty.  Kids and adults loved them as I passed them out at an event I was attending for autistic children who are often on a gluten-free diet.  Parents were very happy that I had them a giveaways and I had many compliments throughout the day!  I will get them again for my next event.
5.0	It was very good and easy to make.
5.0	I would snack on one of these every day, if I could!
5.0	Not much to say but it's a yummy tea for evenings when you don't want caffeine keeping you up.  I particularly like it during cold nights by the fire or while relaxing in the hot-tub.
5.0	The chocolate cashews were amazing and i would recommend them to anyone. These are exactly how chocolate cashews should taste like.
5.0	We really like this olive oil due to it's more complex flavor profile.  We add it to finished dishes and it lends nice richness to our prepared dishes.
5.0	When I first went gluten free the thing I missed the most was good pasta. Quite frankly I can't stand the Tinkyada brown rice pasta and while most quinoa is OK, it's super expensive.<br />This pasta is the closest to the real thing. Additionally, since it comes from Romania it is non-GMO, which is a must when I purchase corn products. (why in the heck are GMOs still allowed in this country? Oh yea, it's because big-business works hand-in-hand with government, just like fascism is designed to!)<br />Anyways, if you are looking for a gluten-free pasta option this is the best.
5.0	I love this cereal and the last place that had it was Costco and I haven't been able to find it in a long time. I hope it arrives fresh and good! Thank you so much for the shipping.
5.0	very satisfied with this product and the quality.
5.0	We tried these for the first time.  The whole family loves them.  I dice them and serve them as a side dish with meals or use them and the juice as a basting marinade for ham or pork.  They have a light pear/apricot flavor that seems to go with everything.
5.0	In my opinion the only things you need for top-quality coffee are good beans (Starbucks from Costco, maybe) and well-made filters. These are great filters.<br /><br />Mornings wouldn't be worth getting up for without some fresh-ground beans, one of these excellent filters, and my $10 Melitta pot and plastic cone. You can grab these #6 filters in bulk for about $3 a box right here on Amazon. Forget the pricey Keurig nonsense and get back to basics - these filters result in a smooth, non-acidy, delightful brew. And it’s fun to watch the coffee “bloom”: pouring a little water in and see the carbon dioxide bubble away. This brewing process, its great smell, and the wonderful-tasting result have become second nature to me.
5.0	God these things are so good stay away from them i ate the whole five pounds and I think I'm still wearing them.
5.0	Man, these almonds are so fresh they're juicy. They will wax your innards, be warned.
5.0	I was gluten free before around 15 years and had to mix my own flour for a long time. I tried many ready mixed flours and this is the best that I have tried so far. I think It could use a little more sweet rice flour to help the baked goods hold together a bit better but over all it is a very good mix.
5.0	We bought these after taking antibiotics.  You'll notice a difference in just one package. Your stomach might feel a little bloated or rumbly the first day you take it but then you'll probably get used to it. We didn't mind because it meant that it was working.  Our (ahem) stool was more formed and solid, definitely an improvement after the antibiotics took their toll.<br /><br />You really only need to use 1/2 a package per dose, so your money will stretch farther.<br /><br />The taste is not noticeable--just stir it into a small glass of water and drink it down. It's sort of like drinking flat, quite-diluted, lemon-lime soda.
5.0	We try and purchase local food when we can.  Our local honey is quite good, but does not compare to this honey.  This is very flavorful, and thick,  Our 2 year old will try and climb the shelves to have more.  It tastes great with some greek yogurt, but overall you can use this with anything.  Can't go wrong with this honey
5.0	This is a great organic nutmeg at a great price.
5.0	I ordered this raw cacao powder on the recommendation of a friend.  It is an amazing product, from the health benefits to the awesome chocolatey taste.  I love that it is a raw product with an incredibly high antioxidant content and a large dose of magnesium.  It comes in a resealable package, which is quite handy, and the packing date is always quite recent, so I know I'm getting a fresh food.  Even my local food co-op doesn't carry it, but I know I can always find it on Amazon.
5.0	we had a monster birthday party for my grandsons first birthday the kids loved the suckers they were a big hit
5.0	threaded right on the bottle and pumps a full stream everytime, easy to clean.
5.0	Wonderful product.  Treat the bees right.  I will buy again.
5.0	Just about any Mexican meal is enhanced with a serving of refried beans. There are a lot of brands on the market, but I've never been disappointed with the quality of Old El Paso traditional refried beans. They're nice and thick and have a rich taste. Add a little bit of grated cheddar cheese and you have a great side dish to tacos, burritos, enchiladas, etc. And nothing could be easier to prepare. Open the can, heat the beans in a saucepan over medium heat for a few minutes, and you have a perfect addition to your meal.
5.0	I ordered these chocolates for my niece who is on a gluten free diet.  She called and let me know how delicious they were.  She and her husband enjoyed them tremendously.  It was delivered in a timely manner.  I will be ordering this product again for other occasions.  Also I would recommend this product to everyone.
5.0	"This was a Christmas gift. It was a \\""BIG\\"" hit. My wife loved it. All of her friends and visitors want one. It is very authentic; a \\""can't miss\\"" great gift for any chocolate lover."
5.0	Pumpkin pies wonderful
5.0	Sent to a Peace Corps volunteer. This is the second one I've sent him. He really likes it.
5.0	This seasoning once sold in supermarkets, is no longer available.  I'm shocked because it's the best I've encountered yet.  I'm glad I'm able to get it here!
5.0	I usually use this dressing on a Mesclun salad. I add fresh strawberries and sliced almonds to the mixed greens and drizzle the dressing all over it. Everyone who has tasted this has asked for the ingredients. Since the first time I tried the dressing, I just knew this would be a hit and it was. That is why I bought a case of it and when that runs out, I intend to buy another for the holidays.
5.0	These are pistachios and they are salty and crunchy... just like the bag says. It's what I ordered so I'm happy. Can't go wrong.
5.0	Taste is great, colors are what it is supposed to be and the packaging was an A+. No complaints her just wish I got it at the $18 price instead of the $20 price. Grrrr
5.0	The best poor man's food I've had....I'm no longer eating those Fat boy noodles in a package
5.0	Best ghee on the planet! 👍
5.0	I love them and I have been sharing my find with others I love that crunch and your pop chips make it satisfying glad I found them thank you
5.0	Delicious coffee. Love the ease of using this with the Tassimo. Coffee is strong and does the job in the morning!
5.0	I love CC, this is a way I can buy it for a decent price and not have to drive to LA to purchase it, even though it would be fun. Was fresh and received it quickly. I love CC for its smooth, nutty & full favor, the dark roasts and Colombian are best traditional flavors and their Sumatra is their best gourmet flavor.
5.0	Reliable, fresh, and so simple to replenish my gum habit both at home and in the office.<br /><br />Awesome in combination with subscribe & save - one less thing I have to think about.
5.0	Bought this drink mix as a substitute for coffee and just love it.  Mix with Skim Plus and you save a few calories and it's still great!  Cannot find it in stores and ordering online saved my day. It always feels like a treat!
5.0	Great quick cup of coffee
5.0	recommend it to anyone.
5.0	These things are amazing for people like me who can't roll. They taste great and the doob tubes are great for holding the ones you've already filled. I also love the mouth pieces as they make the inhalation much smoother. They're also a great price for the amount that you get.
5.0	Great filters for one cup coffee makers.  Buy in quantity and save money!
5.0	These dried apricots are so fresh, soft and yummy! When I opened the package, I was amazed by the great smell. Highly recommend!
5.0	Arrived on time and in good condition.<br />just what I expected...great designs for my windows and curtains to improve my sewing skills
5.0	I bought this for my husband, and he loves it.  It gives him the freedom to put ground coffee in and drink it after.  This arrived on time and way before the time it said.  Thank You!  Would order from this company again!
5.0	We used to buy this at DFW airport on our way back from Mexico.  We had not been that way in a long time and my wife asked for it for Xmas.  I was very glad to find it on line.
5.0	I purchased this as part of a welcoming gift for a visitng friend from out of town.  She has always loved this candy, but it's difficult to find.  It was just as she remembered.  The packaging was good, and the candy arrived unbroken.
5.0	For me these are the best spiced sardines i have tasted, Opening the can you don't get hit hard with that fishy smell, it's there but not bad, the spice is pretty consistent in terms of heat. I've had about 20 of these can's (not in a sitting but over the course of a year) and have not had one hotter then the other, i did however get a can where there was no pepper. Over all i am happy with the taste and texture of these canned sardines. Not mushy and firm enough to pull out of the can without it falling apart.
5.0	My plant came today. It's in perfectly good health and moist. It's so healthy and I'm so happy. It's perfect. The alternate soil IS a little dry. But I'm ecstatic. This is AWESOME for the price. 5 stars!!
5.0	I use this tea at work for its convenience.  In an office setting, making it one glass at a time is super quick and easy.  I probably use around 16 oz of water when I'm at work because I'm just looking for a hint of flavor, and I don't need sugar.  When  I make it at home, I use about 8 oz of water and then add sugar and ice.  It's ready after 5 or 10 minutes of sitting.  I really enjoy it.
5.0	Roasted just right, not too much salt, great crunch. Bergin always provides excellent quality, and these are no exception. Best pepitas I've bought anywhere.
5.0	This is the best peppermint tea and so easy to make in the Keurig. We love it.
5.0	I was delighted to find these Heinz Baked Beans available on Subscribe & Save.  Having moved to the US in the last two years, I was surprised to find that Heinz Baked Beans were not readily available for purchase in supermarkets without being mixed with frankfurters (yech).  The nearest equivalent was the Heinz vegetarian beans, but the taste was not the same.  Moreover, the price in the supermarket is ridiculous.  The price on Subscribe & Save is a little high, but at least I can get the product I want
5.0	It's very satisfying grinding my own flour when I need it.  Great product.
5.0	I have been using Mudhava Agave Nectar for about a year and have eliminated my low blood sugar problem.  It tastes great as a syrup for pancakes, cooked in foods or in tea/coffee.  Since I have Celiac disease(gluten intolerance), I have to make everything I eat from scratch.  This nectar really works great in recipes. Also the low glycemic value is good for people on the low carb diet so I can use this for another member of my family.
5.0	"but we like this one in particular because you can modify it to be a fluffy muffin. We add fresh wild (tiny) blueberries or even mix in a little banana baby food puree, and it makes a nice little afternoon snack. It's great as is, too, and if you mix in colored sprinkles before baking, you can make a gluten-free \\""Funfetti\\"" type of cake."
5.0	The price definitely worths it. This coffee is pure crema. The flavor is in its point. The texture is unparallel. If you gather with friends to share good espresso shoots or lattes, this is the bean you must acquire.     Suggestion: This coffee should be use JIT (just in time). Order it once you are running low of beans and you'll always have fresh coffee.
5.0	I want to thank the people at Creek House.  My first order was not what I expected.  The shipment of truffles were superb--just not the product I ordered.  I served them, anyway, & guests raved over them.  When I wrote to the company to explain how great the truffles were but that they weren't what I ordered, they were ever gracious.  They gave me a partial refund & then sent the correct truffles.  Other than the first glitch, these chocolatiers are exceptional: from superior ingredients to gracious customer service.  There needs to be a higher rating than 5 out of 5 stars for Creek House. A pleasure to rate this seller & their products.
5.0	It's good.  I'd recommend it and order it again!
5.0	My new favorite rub! Sweet yet tangy not overpowering. I have put it on ribs,pork butt for pulled pork and chicken all with fantastic results. Have given some to a friend and he says the same. The bonus is the very reasonable price.
5.0	I absolutely love this water. It is light and refreshing. It is a healthy alternative to drinking pop that's for sure. I am very pleased with this purchase!
5.0	I had not recently tried organic raw honey so I was not sure what to expect, regardless, I did not expect this.  The taste is unbelievable, sweet yet not cloying- nothing else tastes quite like it.  The texture is also a nice surprise in that it's slightly creamy but with more body and texture than a typical processed spread like Nutella.<br /><br />Take a piece of high quality dense bread like Ezekiel bread, lightly toast it to bring out the nuttiness, then liberally apply a swab of raw honey to make a little piece of heaven on earth- delicious!
5.0	Blow Pops are my son's favorite and cherry is my favorite flavor. The pops were fresh and not chewy nor stale.
5.0	This is my favorite Easy Mac.  I agree with both of the other reviewers actually...it is very flavorful and more filling than the original Easy Mac, but the sauce is thin.  I personally like it that way - but I think if you wanted it to be thicker you could just put a little less water in than the directions say.  I think the alfredo tastes great...I especially like the noodles better (they are spiral) and it is just a nice change from regular Easy Mac.
5.0	This product is excellent I use it for all of my baking.
5.0	Purchased an 8 pack of Adolph's Marinade in Minutes (Original) because I can no longer find it in local markets.  Have tried researching it and much of what I have read seems to indicate it has been discontinued.  I am so saddened by this.  I have used it for many years and it does such a wonderful job of tenderizing and flavoring meats ( I use it mostly on sirloin tip steaks before cutting up into kebabs for the grill.  Everyone always raved about how good my kebabs were!  I hope Adolph's will reconsider if they are indeed discontinuing this product.
5.0	I love Cinnamon. I just found out there is a difference in the cinnamon I get from the grocer and Ceylon Cinnamon. I always choose the healthy option.  This is it. It arrived in a timely manner and I will continue to buy it when I run out.
5.0	Ordered this item with the intention of using it for a particular recipe and loved it so much have used it on pasta and roasted vegetables. You won't be disappointed with the purchase.
5.0	This Arriba Garlic & Cilantro Salsa has some Texas heat to go with the strong garlic flavor, that maybe puts it closer to a hot than a medium, but still makes for a really good salsa. However if you are not a garlic lover, than try one of the other types.  Garlic is the very dominant flavor.  I happen to like garlic, and knocked off a jar in one sitting, but the flavor was still with me the next day, so be warned.  The pepper flavor was a bit different than the usual salsa too.  The dry heat from the Serrano peppers was a nice change, but tends to linger a bit and so gets hotter with the more you eat.  It tastes great -if-you-like-garlic- and if you like it a bit hotter than your typical tomato-onion salsa.  I also liked that this was not loaded with onion too.  Like I said -good for a change from the usual. For the milder crowd, or for company, I did mix a jar of this with a 28oz can of crushed tomatoes, and it was mellowed out considerably, but still tasted like salsa and was still really good (and a little more office friendly for a work night).
5.0	Absolutely love the original black bean with sea salt.  I never thought I would like them.  Even my children liked them and they are hard to please lol.I'm even going to try them with my spinach dip.  I'm sure that would be yummy!
5.0	I love how you can try a variety of flavors without being committed to something you might not end up liking.  Of course I didn't like all the flavors, but I think that is the point of getting a variety pack, so you know in the future.  I will definitely purchase these again!
5.0	A dream for those on Weight Watchers who love potato chips. The individual serving bags of Pop Chips are only 3 points and taste delicious.
5.0	Cheer on!  To enjoy this and all their home products you need to be a TIGER ON SATURDAY  AND A SAINT ON SUNDAY!
5.0	I seriously lost a count of how many of these Numi Organic Tea Flowering Gift sets I have bought so far. And each and every time it made a perfect gift!!! Nice packaging, great product!!! The teapot is a little tiny but I'm not concerned. Like I said, if you need a perfect gift, don't look further. Just click and buy!
5.0	With four kids eating healthy isn't cheap (but neither are doctors bill).  This syrup has wonderful taste, and I love the price!  Thanks amazon!
5.0	what a great substitute for an iced coffee or frappuccino!  I make a strong concentrate (1 bag in 3-4 ozs of hot water), let it cool or put in fridge and then put in blender with coconut milk, liquid stevia and a dash of vanilla and ice.  You can also use organic cocoa powder. I can't have coffee or dairy due to stomach issues and this is a delicious summer drink! The concentrate will even make 2 drinks.
5.0	The shortbread is delicious and the tin can be used for other things.  The cookies were a little broken but edible.
5.0	Hope you like spicy. good smoky flavor.  This is a big jar had to give some away to my fellow spice minions at work.
5.0	Great bargain. We use them every day.
5.0	The Anthon Berg Dark Chocolates are excellent! The delicious candies make an impressive gift. The bottle shaped chocolates each contain just a sip of liqueur. The gift box makes a nice presentation and each piece is wrapped in red, gold, and green foil with beautiful little labels. The chocolates are well packaged, easy open, and shipped fast.
5.0	Excellent sauce - hot but not super hot and the hot goes away relatively fast. Love it !
5.0	Not quite ready to go on auto ship for this, but Yogi's peppermint is the very best there is.<br /><br />This shipment came in individual boxes as opposed to the last time I ordered; then, they were still in their individual boxes, but it looked more like the original packaging from the manufacturer.<br /><br />They shipped in good time.
5.0	It's the best olive oil I have ever tasted in the US.  Recommended it to my family.  Loved it tons!!!
5.0	I got these for the health benefits but found I love them. I mixed them with dried fruit and peanuts and could not stay out of them.
5.0	On time and as advertised.
5.0	On a visit to the Caribbean we toured the factory and were treated to samples of these cakes. I was hooked immediately. These are simply the best tasting rum cake. They come shipped in a vacuum packaging that maintains the moist cake and all the taste. Finding these available on Amazon was exciting and now I can have my rum cakes whenever I want and don't have to wait for my next cruise to get my fix.
5.0	Yummy and healthy. My kids and I love them.<br />Very yummy, equally good as Erewhon brand.  MiDel brand graham crackers are horrible, though, and taste like cardboard.
5.0	I was craving coconut one day and the grocery stores in my area only carried the version full of preservatives and sugar so I bought this on Amazon and I love it!  I sprinkle it in fruit salads, regular salads, in stir fries.  It is very versatile, natural and healthy.  I would definitely purchase again.
5.0	They were very good they take the graving for salsa away I love them
5.0	The mortar & pestle looks good and has the right heft and balance for grinding.  came quickly and well packaged.
5.0	I purchased these rocks to help decorate a construction cake for my son's 4th birthday.  Who knew the rocks would be the highlight of my cake masterpiece. The colors were fantastic and the taste was yummmmmmm.<br /><br />Per my son's request he wanted a chocolate cake.  These little rocks of heaven took each bite of the cake to another level. As cake really doesn't have a texture besides soft spongey bites of sheer delight ( at least mine are like this) These little rocks adds the perfect crunch.  Not too hard. Not too soft.  Just right!!! Every little kid and their parents were trying to get some rocks with their piece of cake.<br /><br />Not to forget, the chocolate is fantastic. To me, the chocolate is milk chocolate with a hint of dark. Some might say a semi dark; I feel it's more on the milk chocolate side.<br /><br />These rocks are fantastic, and will now be a staple in my chocolate drawer. I'm trying to figure out other ways to use them. So far, I will be using them in trail mix instead of m&m's, cookies, and of course decorating cakes.<br /><br />If everything stays the same with these rocks ( manufacturing wise) you will not be disappointed.
5.0	Very easy sweetener to use and there is no after taste. So glad I found this product. Makes my sweet tooth happy.
5.0	It's a crazy way to buy organic sugar, but I'm a believer!  I have felt wasteful buying organic sugar in those small, plastic bags, and it's expensive.  Buying it in 5# foil (recyclable) bags that arrive on my doorstep makes good sense.  I bake a lot, make my own maple syrup (1 c. sugar, 1 tsp. maple, 1/4 c. water, bring to boil, add 1 c. corn syrup and stir) and enjoy that good stuff in my coffee.  FRONTIER also distributes an excellent line of healthy spices.
5.0	Arrived right on time, box is lovely, and the assortment of teas is great. It even came with a few extra!
5.0	My wife and I have been using Maggi for nearly 40 years, for both as a taste enhancer for sauces and gravies and as an organic part of our marinades. It has been on many occasions our secret ingredient in 'down home,' 'international,' and 'exotic' recipes' as an enhancer with better than average successes.
5.0	Excellent product that we always purchased when we were in Germany.  My wife and I are delighted that we finally found this product on Amazon. In our opinion it's the finest decaffeinated product anywhere. When we serve it to  to our guests they cant believe that it's decaffeinated.  It's aroma is unbelievably and the taste is fantastic.  It's the only coffee that we will purchase.
5.0	Some time ago, Cheesy Hashbrowns Hamburger Helper suddenly disappeared from grocery shelves!  We were not happy with this development and have checked every available outlet.  Was VERY happy to find it on Amazon.com.  Thanks for restoring this staple to our pantry!
5.0	Awesome coffee, great energy boost after drinking, the taste is fantastic, both my wife and I enjoy this blend, let me go make another cup.
5.0	The pumpkin bread was very delicious and I enjoyed it very much. The bread was moist and the pumpkin smell divine.
5.0	I love that this syrup has no high fructose corn syrup and it always has a great taste.  This is the best syrup you can get for a resonable price.
5.0	My kids love them.  It's as good as any other brand of brown rice rotini.  Can't beat the price of buying in bulk.
5.0	I usually only cook Jello Cook and Serve puddings. It can take from 10-15 minutes to cook, depending on heat level. I tried the instant Banana pudding and it was very good, and very quick and easy to make.
5.0	Found this coffee a few months ago for my husband and had trouble finding it in the store. One of his favorites.
5.0	This Blood Orange Olive Oil  is very tasty in a salad dressing with a little Sweet Pedro Ximinez vinegar, ratio 3 parts oil to 1 part vinegar.  Add a little mustard and salt and enjoy your salad!
5.0	I bought the red velvet mix at giant food for $3.50,,  it just caught my attention because of the box.  It's normally $8.50.  Made it as a sheet cake, and it's so delicious.  It's not as sinful as my own homemade chocolate cake, but far superior to other box mixes.  Absolutely delicious cake!!  I'm getting 4 more boxes today while on sale and giving some to my daughter.  I totally love his cake mix.  Will definitely try others.  He gets an A++++ from me!!!!
5.0	I love this soda!!! It is light and refreshing.  Possibly the best I have ever tasted!
5.0	I made an Easter Bunny PEEPS cake using PEEPS all around the side of the cake for decoration.  Everybody loved it.
5.0	Oh this is so good! I've bought this and other dry flavoring so I can use them to flavor coffee, tea, and even water. And not pay the high prices of already flavored products.
5.0	islanders delight with sticky rice and soysauce.
5.0	Fiji water was a great buy. if you want some healthy water, drink Fiji. It is the best on the market.
5.0	Best kcups ever foamy delicious
5.0	Minced onions. What's not to like? I use these in everything when I don't feel like chopping onions. Nice and easy!
5.0	Fast delivery. Add to my yogurt or cottage cheese for health benefits.
5.0	Great Product. I've loved these since i discovered them at an  con shop and I bout them as a gift for my nephew. He enjoys them as well. It's just a carbonated soft drink but its not to sweet and the flavors are just right.
5.0	My favorite of the hazelnut coffee brands.
5.0	Nice flavor!! You would think that because it's Sugar Free that they would be tasteless but they're not!  I would recommend you try them
5.0	Let me start but saying, I would never, ever pay close to $30.00 for this. However I bought it on sale for $9.59 with free shipping. This is a great deal for what you get. The packaging is great, and the cylinder is a good size. The chocolate was super yummy, and I received a very nice variety of flavors. You get 45 pieces, each individually wrapped. I think the other reviewers are upset because the original description said 80 pieces. But as long as you know what you're getting before you order, and you can get it at this price, then go for it!
5.0	These are great!  Love the flavor and they make a great addition to hot cereal and yogurt. Also great for after school snacking.
5.0	Great, strong flavor. Kinda reminds me of Celestial Seasons Red Zinger. Really good hot or cold, with or without some honey. Love it!
5.0	I'm nuts about this coffee--it's truly the exact same flavor as a classic blueberry muffin, just _in_ a coffee cup. I typically drink this with a half-shot of vanilla syrup and about 8 oz of milk for a great blueberry latte. If you like flavored coffees, try this one for a change. Wonderful smell while brewing, but better taste!
5.0	I buy a bag every 2 months.  I drink it with lemon and sweetener, hot or iced. I highly recommend.
5.0	Smaller than I expected but arrived on time and in tact. Used for birthday party. The kids seemed to enjoy the taste. Good price.
5.0	These chips are expensive, but much better than other brands.  The only ingredient is apples - and the applicable seasoning.  Nothing else.  They are the crunchiest ones I've tried.  Perfect alternative to chips or popcorn when you want something crunchy.
5.0	I love mixing flavors for the perfect latte so this goes well in combonition wtih french vanilla or white chocolate.  Great flavor to enjoy those lattes!
5.0	Awesome fruit snacks, fun size and good price too!
5.0	When you just can't find them in retail stores, this is another avenue to get them...  Husband loves them for energy
5.0	Just received my 2nd order of WellBee Super Fine Blanched Almond Flour. Fair price for an outstanding product. I'm sold.
5.0	Fast shipping and great product!
5.0	I was a Three Crabs brand fan for many, many years until I read about Red Boat and bought and tried it.  All I can say is there is no comparison of any other brand available in the USA to Red Boat.  They also sell a 50N version which contains more fish protein and it is even better than the 40N but harder to source.<br /><br />You can literally taste this straight out of the bottle.  It is THAT good.  My kids eat this tuff up to.  How many 11 year olds will willingly put &#34;fish sauce&#34; on anything??  Mine do and they love it!<br /><br />Find it in your local well-stocked Asian (preferably Vietnamese) market for the best pricing.
5.0	Just what was needed.
5.0	no complaints whatsoever better than the senseo although i suspect they are made in the same factory.  similar packaging probably just a private label version
5.0	Our household has become a fan of Stash Teas and being able to buy in bulk is a great plus.  Our friends whom we have had the opportunity to serve tea to in our home are now Stash customers.
5.0	I usually purchase cappuccino at Speedway and miss not having it at home.  This is wonderful and a great taste.  Will purchase from seller in the future.
5.0	Nice combination coffee.  Smooth tasting yet with some robustness.<br />The K cup makes it easy to use and make as many or few cups as needed.
5.0	Another winner from Omaha Steaks. Beautiful cuts of meat.
5.0	This stuff is magic, kids will eat anything once I put braggs on it
5.0	I actually give this to my dog mixed in with his dry dog food. He absolutely loves it, scarfs down his food and his coat has never been so soft
5.0	This cereal is so good that I find myself eating a bowl for a snack at bedtime.  I finished off the box I got from Vine and ended up buying more because I'm addicted.  It's low calorie, low sugar and just plain delicious.  Hard not to love that.
5.0	These whole wheat matzos are fantastic tasting and so satisfying!  I enjoy these crackers at every opportunity and they are lower calorie than many other crackers.  Highly recommend seller!!
5.0	Wish they made this year 'round.<br />Just plain excellent.<br />Highly recommend.
5.0	This is my favorite tea. I drink about three cups a day. PG Tips steeps quickly and has a strong flavor. This is a great value.
5.0	Flaky .... just like homemade!  Made fried fruit hand pies .... Grandma thought I'd made them from scratch!  Yippie!  I'll be back for more!
5.0	Wallenford Blue is the real true Jamaican Blue Mountain Coffee.  The flavour is rich yet smooth.  I really enjoy having a cup every morning.  Love it.[[ASIN:B00344R71Y 16oz Wallenford Blue 100% Jamaica Blue Mountain Whole Beans Coffee]]
5.0	I love this product. Thanks.
5.0	Great product and great deal...Exactly what I've been Looking for.,
5.0	Delicious! Better than any lollipop you've ever tasted!
5.0	Had this flavor at a movie theater and can not possibly live without it.  Only place I could find it was Amazon.  My daughter and I are hooked.
5.0	My husband takes Brach cinnamon hard candies to work with him.  They are easy to (put in and retrieve from) his pocket.  He loves the strong sweet cinnamon flavor of Brach's brand.
5.0	Enjoyed the rye bread I made with this flour and the fact that it is organic make it even better
5.0	Easy to sprout in a mason jar. Fresh sprouts in a few days. Organic and fresh. I will purchase these again.
5.0	Best protien bar for taste and nourishment.
5.0	Does it get any better? No.
5.0	Excellent product with good baklava taste and texture.  Very fresh and moist throughout.  Was quite surprised at the freshness considering the shipping time.
5.0	The combination of teas and herbs was an easy decision for me to order this item and it being loose allows me to decide how strong I like (2Tbspn to 16oz) my teas; less is better. If you love green tea this is a nice addition, I do add fresh mint and honey. Enjoy.
5.0	I got these for my cousin and she loved them.  I tried one and it was pretty tasty, better than the generic stuff you find in the store.
5.0	This is the real thing -- not the poor quality, imitation vanilla flavoring.  I was taught by the good cooks in my family to always use real vanilla extract.  This is good quality and great value!
5.0	These orange slices are a perfect, small size. Jelly-belly and Sunkist have teamed up to make the best sweet-tart jelly candy. My 94 year old mother has lost she sense of taste. Everything is bland to her. But, she can taste these! Thank you for providing me with a way to delight my mother.
5.0	I found this brand and cracker when I received a gift basket.  The large size is perfect for mozzarella cheese, even small sandwiches and is lower in calories than bread.  The flavor is subtle but definite.  Our family liked it so much that I went on line to find it locally.  I am buying cartons from Amazon since it is not available where I live.  I tried the pepper ones which are almost even better!  I will be buying them regularly.
5.0	Fantastic stuff!  Will order this again and again.  Rich, Smooth and brews up nice and strong!!!!  Best coffee for the money!!
5.0	So good !! & nicely packed . Came eariler than expected
5.0	First bag of Snyder's Pretzel Dips in Hershey's Special Dark Choclates I've ever had that didn't make me sick from eating to many. LOL<br /><br />The only problem is, I haven't been able to find another bag. I bought my first bag in Public's on A1A near Palm Beach Gardens, FL. Every Publics store I go to I look. I have a Public's store I can walk to on Haverhill, FL. 33417 and they don't have them either.<br /><br />Please help.. I Love These Dark Choclate Pretzels.  Regina Linville
5.0	This is quality tea and there is a lot of it. It really is a great deal for this price and is more flavorful than the stuff in the pre-made bags you get at the store. 16oz would be more than you could pack into a gallon size Ziploc bag. I will definitely buy again.
5.0	No gluten, no eggs and easy to make in the microwave.
5.0	I live overseas, and the taste of good ol american coffee is something I hate to do without.  Good price as well.
5.0	Tasty, delicious and addicting! SO good!!
5.0	Great spice nice and fresh I just love the flavor, and what the heck if we get a little health benefit too
5.0	I was very impressed with this Tuna! I tried the Jalapeno, Sun dried tomato, and the Chipotle was my favorite! They are not hot AT ALL which was a little disappointing since I do like a little bit of heat. However the additions imparted great and different flavor to the tuna! With these additions it is great by itself or added to a salad or casserole! Boring tuna is a thing of the past with Bumble Bee Prime Fillet Gourmet flavors! I normally don't like the addition of oil in my tuna, but the olive oil is a healthier fat and this adds to the flavor without being overly greasy. I am picky about tuna and this way exceeds my expectations! #sponsored
5.0	great! The pretzels are so buttery soft--they are sandwiched together between a very cheezy creamy filling (tastes a lot like the coating on cheetos, but in a creamy form). My kids absolutely LOVE these as a snack and they don't last very long!!
5.0	I've bot as many as 10 bags and the last bag is as freash as the first and it is freash to the bottom of the bag.
5.0	My toddler son has loved these longer than any other little snack we've tried. Had his first around 7 months and has been happily eating them for 9 more months. A lot of adults we hang around with always sneak a few from him, and they like them too!  Sure, there's not a ton of nutrition here, but they are good and keep my son happy.
5.0	I wasn't sure quite what to expect when I tasted this Lindt dark chocolate bar with sea salt. Thankfully, I wasn't disappointed. Although not as intensely dark as the Lindt bars that contain 70% or more cocoa (this bar is less than 50% cocoa), it is still genuine, smooth, creamy dark chocolate. However, it definitely has a sweetness to it. This sweetness is perfectly modified by the addition of sea salt, which also is done in sufficient moderation as to not be overwhelming. All in all, this is a great combination of sweet and salty flavor.
5.0	Works like it was designed to do!
5.0	This is my first time to order wheat grass and I'm very happy with my choice.  The product arrived faster then expected and the seeds look great.  I can't wait to try them out.
5.0	It pops up most of the kernals only leaving a few which you can put back in the bag and re-pop so that there is no waste and some good popcorn.
5.0	If youre a fan of the darker coffees, then you should enjoy this. Its among our favorite
5.0	Wanted to get a treat for husband, who normally around here gets it for Christmas.  Love the hard sample sent will order more.
5.0	No problems ordering and receiving the coconut flour. Bag was not ripped. It was a concern because I've read other reviewers talk about other products arriving torn, and that did not happen here. I received the package and it was sealed and safe. This coconut flour is awesome and much cheaper to buy it like this than at Whole Foods.
5.0	This is my favorite flaver with a great crunch even after soaking in milk. Lots of raisins and it's Organic. Good stuff.
5.0	I love these snacks I was buying them at a limited time at my grocery store.  I was sad when they were no longer available and have searched for them everywhere I go.  Please bring these back to Publix's in Decatur Alabama.  Tammy
5.0	I love Rooibos tea overall and this one was as good as it suppose to be Flavorful and strong<br />And its giving me brake from caffeine
5.0	I had a problem finding these sugar-free products locally for awhile and ordered them from Amazon.  The order was quick and I had no problems. <br /> <br />Thank you
5.0	If you like matzo farfel --- then you are going to love this Yehuda Matzo Farfel from Israel.  Costs a little more, but this is 100% authentic, 100% Kosher and it is, without question, the best-of-the-best.  Everything we make with this farfel tastes better.  If you haven't tried it, then you are in for a treat. TEN STARS!!! for this outstanding product.
5.0	Good quality organic honeybush. Great taste.
5.0	Delicious.  Love the scent and the pretty tea bag.  When I'm finished using the teabag I throw it into the compost bin.
5.0	This is the best oatmeal I have yet to try! No gritty, hard pieces in the mix. Has a great flavor!
5.0	"We were first introduced to huckleberry products while vacationing at Glacier National Park.  One of the most enjoyable things we ate while there was a fresh huckleberry pie.  So I ordered this pie filling to make our own pie here in Colorado.  The pie turned out great retaining that unique \\""huckleberry taste\\"" we remembered from Montana.  Using this pie filling rather than frozen or fresh huckleberries avoids a big problem many people encounter and that is huckleberries are so juicy they can soak through and saturate the pie crust and many people have reported the pie can turn into mush. Treat yourself to this very unique pie filling, you WILL NOT be disappointed."
5.0	and quite good although too few of them.<br />need a bigger package.<br />or a two for one offer would be nice
5.0	Love, Love, Love is all I can say.  I can actually have pancakes again (that taste like pancakes!!) which is a life changer for me!
5.0	I really love using Cooks Pure Vanilla Powder!  I add it to my homemade pancake and waffle batter, it give a slight malt flavor.  Its also great in coffee, often sprinkling it on the grounds before brewing.  It helps bring out the flavor in so many things!  I use it where ever vanilla is called for giving a great flavor without that alcohol taste of liquid vanillas.
5.0	I hate to tell everyone how great these are because they are hard to find and I want them all to myself!
5.0	Delicious decaf coffee. Received this from Amazon in 3 days.
5.0	It is hard to believe all you do is add water, and then enjoy the best mustard.
5.0	My wife has health problems so we bought this to help with carbs. I really like the things she has been making with it. We use it for everything using flour. I know I couldn't have bought it here for this price,can't beat amazon
5.0	The product arrived in a package smaller than expected.  We read the directions which explained the plants were in a dormant state and followed them including the optional step of soaking the roots (overnight in our case).  We then planted them in pots of potting mix and waited.  It was incredible how quickly these plants starting aiming to the sun.  It is now day 3 and they have opened up and are thriving - every one of them.  We are happy.
5.0	The best healthy drink I have ever had by far. Everyone should try this great beverage. Refreshing and good for you
5.0	I ordered the Kiva All-natural Xantham Gum to be used when my gluten-sensitive daughter visits.  I ended up us using it myself as a thickener for my sauces, gravies, soups etc. Once I was able to determine what quantity to use for what, it has become a staple in my kitchen.  This order from Kiva arrived promptly and well packed. It is without hesitation that I will use Kiva again as needed.
5.0	Not quite as sweet as the last batch but still a superior product.  Great delivery time!
5.0	Great value, I like my Yerba Mate with honey and enjoy the smooth clam yet awake feeling it gives me.
5.0	Perfect, but thought I was getting 1 box & not 6-duh-sorry! Thanks.
5.0	I use these to wrap my sushi rolls. They are really good and big.
5.0	I may not be a marathon runner like all these other reviewers *allegedly* are, but I like to have a little extra energy myself from time to time. Maybe I'm taking out an extra heavy load of beer bottles to the recycle bin, or maybe I just don't want to fall asleep in the middle of a good movie or baseball game. In either case, I have found this product to be very effective. When my friends comment that I look less lethargic, or am a less sluggish video game opponent than usual, I just smile and quietly thank Orbana.
5.0	I started taking them when I started doing My HCG shot diet , first they have a non tasty flavor, but you'll get used to them if you eat them frecuently.
5.0	It was a bit better than average price, and a good turn around time.  Good value, good product.  Starbuck's is Starbuck's whereever you get it
5.0	This is what real New Orleans coffee should taste like. Smooth with no bitter taste.  Brought back memories of my parents, this is what they would drink every day.
5.0	I really enjoy this product.  Not the usual hot chocolate taste - far more sophisticated.
5.0	For me its the best &#34;K&#34; cup coffee I've had in the 3+ years we have used the Keurig machine.  Highly recommended.
5.0	Excellent product! Mixes easily , dissolves quickly, even in water!
5.0	I've tried and failed many times to get off of Diet Coke. Only recently, when I switched to Zevia, was I finally able to break the habit. I used Zevia as a substitute until I could get used to drinking teas and water instead, and still have one on occasion if I have the urge for something bubbly. If you're used to Diet Coke, the taste difference is an adjustment, but over time I preferred the Zevia. We've also tried the orange and ginger root beer flavors, and my family enjoys them.<br /><br />I did have one bad shipping experience, where a case was damaged, but this is rare.
5.0	Big, big jars.  Perfect.  What a great value and I wasn't tempted to buy more than I needed like I am at the grocery.
5.0	A great snack that keeps for a long while.  Very good pretzel brand. Thanks. Enjoyed the flavor. Will buy again.
5.0	It is something different for my gluten free Italian husband.  Won't buy it often because it is so expensive!
5.0	Great tea!  Smells awesome!  Relaxing!
5.0	These were an add on item, but I needed some other things so I just threw these into my cart because I am a Lychee fanatic (ever since a honeymoon to Maui). They are so good. When I got them, they had been sitting outside my house for a few hours in -10f weather and they were nearly frozen. I ate a couple anyway. I think I like them better that way! Now, they aren't as full as the picture shows, but not as empty as, say, a poptart. There are 6 in a box and I have one left :( I wish there were more per box. The Mochi is soft, chewy and sweet. The filling is a Lychee jam and it is heavenly.
5.0	We eat rice everyday, and I usually mix white rice with brown sweet rice and purple sticky rice. The flavor and texture of this rice is great.<br /><br />In addition, in order to enjoy its flavor, you'd better cook it with pressure rice cooker. If you cook it with plain rice cooker, you won't be able to enjoy its taste.
5.0	This is my favorite great taste no calories
5.0	I'm tired of paying $10 for thai noodles at restaurant and this is close enough to satisfy the craving. I like to jazz it up a bit with some meat, rice and srirachas.
5.0	Lovely tea.  I wish Bentley's still offered white Jasmine tea.
5.0	I love this powder.  Smooth and flavorful.  Requires extra mixing, but is worth it!
5.0	I really like this stuff as you can make it as strong or week as you like depending on taste and workout. I just pop it in my gym bag or freeze it in a bottle so it is nice and cold
5.0	I gave these as a Valentine's Day gift and my girlfriend loved them. I managed to snag a couple myself and they are very good. These are a little bit different than your typical filled chocolate variety. They try to replicate the different desserts in a candy form. I especially liked the fondant chocolate and the eclair caramel.
5.0	I love this diet cola.  It got here faster than I thought it would.  Thanks.
5.0	This is wonderful for iced tea. I keep it stocked up at my house.. especially in the summer.
5.0	Bought this to chew on hcg diet. Great flavor (spearmint), all natural, doesn't last the longest as some other brands but overall great sataifsftion. Will purchase again.
5.0	A great price for a lot of turmeric. I have just order the capsule filling machine, because getting a tablespoon of turmeric and black pepper down your throat is a little more than I can handle. I have noticed a definite improvement in my knees after just 2 weeks. I will keep the site bookmarked for more in the future.
5.0	Favorite kale &#34;chips&#34;. These are more like a kale version of a tortilla chip. They are not to be confused with the baked kale chips (available everywhere these days) that are covered in some variation of sugar, oil, salt, cashew butter & nutritional yeast. Those are great too, but increasingly you have to read those labels to find out if they're actually healthy versus kale loaded up with minimally beneficial seasoning. These are more like tortilla chips or crackers that are mostly made with kale , but with the addition of buckwheat. So they taste like a good brassica, baked into a chip with the addition of buckwheat. I loooove these and I've been buying them for years. They also come in other seasonings (hit,etc) and other based- the sweet potato is also excellent!
5.0	This has become my morning staple through the cool winter months.
5.0	First of all, no one has offered me any incentive to write this review.<br />I thought I hated Ghee because the other brands I previously tried tasted disgusting.<br />But I'm lactose intolerant and I love butter on my veggies and to cook eggs in, so I kept hoping there was a ghee that would give me that great butter flavor without the problematic lactose.<br />After reading the Amazon reviews for this brand, I decided to give it a try.<br />And it is absolutely fabulous.  Beautiful, clean butter flavor without any lactose or milk protein to mess up my digestion.  Other reviewers have made negative comments about the granular texture, but that goes away when you warm it up.  I love it as a cooking oil because it gives food a lovely butter flavor but does not burn at higher heat the way butter does.  Its wonderful on popcorn and on steamed veggies, and in baked goods as well.  I find a little goes a long way, so I don't need to use as much of it as I would with butter.<br />The only downside in my opinion is the price.  It's REALLY EXPENSIVE, and because it tastes so good, I use it up pretty fast.<br />However, I appreciate that it comes from grass-fed cows raised without hormones or antibiotics, so I am willing to pay a premium for that.
5.0	great buy for the money
5.0	Found these locally but they couldn't keep them in stock so I now get a shipment every couple of months.  Love these things!
5.0	Very tasty soup/stew.  Easy to follow directions and not loaded with all kinds of chemicals and preservatives.<br />Freezes very well and great to keep on hand already made.
5.0	This has become our favorite salad dressing.  I won't buy it again because, including shipping, it is too expensive. I disagree with the claim that it is good with ice cream or cream cheese. But, we love Paula and this product.
5.0	I've seen 8 O'Clock coffee in stores for years but never tried it before.  I'm nearly through with the 33 oz bag I ordered and the end of the bag tastes as good as the beginning did.  Could be because I've just started grinding my own (got the whole bean 100% Comombian) or just because it's great coffee.  I don't care about the why, I just love this coffee!  I'll stick with this brand!
5.0	My title might seem silly, but let me tell you a secret- I hate the processed, normal store bought honey. I have refused to eat my whole life, even childhood. The only time was when I was in first grade. My class went on a field trip to a local bee farm where we got to see everything you could possibly want to know about honey and bees. Naturally, they handed out their little organic honey, and much to my dad's surprise, I loved it! So of course, when I went home I wanted more of that delicious honey. So my parents tired to humor me, and, well.... I hated it, just like all the other times. Flash forward to present day, one of my sister's friends who is living with us wanted some honey, and picked up some 'organic' honey from Target. I taste tested it, and found it 'eh-okay'. But then I remembered the little bee farm from first grade! This Y.S. honey had the best recommendations in my opinion, so I bought it. It came yesterday, and Jackie and I grabbed a spoon to try it out. Perfect, just as I remembered! Or at least, close enough that I actually loved it! I can't way to start substituting it while I'm cooking.
5.0	Awesome with Nutella...
5.0	Exactly what my daughter wanted and arrived on schedule. Thank you!!!!
5.0	Delicious!  I keep them in the freezer to retain freshness, and they're great!
5.0	Shrinks after washing (hung to dry) so order larger.
5.0	Okay, let's add it up - cholocate + Harry Potter = happiness.  This is just what it says it is - a chocolate frog.  Ordered it for my daughter as a stcoking stuffer.  Hope it tastes as good as it looks!
5.0	This brand of pasta is the best gluten free option I've found.  After finding out that I have allergies to many foods including gluten, white rice, white potatoes and corn I got really bummed thinking I'd not be able to get my pasta fix any longer.  I tested many different brands including store and internet bought items and most tasted okay but never the right texture or flavor.  Then I tried this brand and I can say that the texture is spot on and so is the flavor.  I can stop looking for other brands now, this is as close to regular pasta as it gets.
5.0	Very tasty BBQ sauce.
5.0	Was a Christmas gift and it went over very well.  Quite large and packed full of stuff.  I would buy again.
5.0	These are the absorbent, gentle to the skin kind of tampon. We order these frequently.
5.0	I tried to order a case of this from every month to every other month.  My wife loves this stuff so much that I have to revert back to every month.  I also like it, but my wife gives me some mixed with my hemp and red berry cereals or my Kashi GoLean cereal.  I like Cracklin' Oat Bran anyway she serves it.
5.0	It's one of the big things I miss most about New York, since having moved to Colorado in April of 2007 - Bakeries. And specifically a really good Coffee Cake. Unless you are living in the heart of Denver there are just no real bakeries to be found. King Soopers and Safeway do try but then I just don't think they really know just how good a good coffee cake should be.<br /><br />Grandma's definitely fills that void for us. This is just a scrumptious coffee cake.<br /><br />I have ordered this in the past from QVC but have found the quality of it different by ordering this from Amazon. The two times I ordered it from QVC - the cake and the sample cakes were wet and mushy and nearly inedible. From Amazon it was moist - as it should be - but not wet and well - simply delicious.<br /><br />I will definitely be purchasing this again, although I wish that the shipping charges were less expensive. I get my head around it by defining it as a treat that anyone hankering for a good coffee cake should allow themselves the luxury of having at least once and a while.
5.0	DO NOT, AND I REPEAT DO NOT &#34;WASTE&#34; YOUR TIME WITH ANY OTHER SWEET TEA.<br />SOUTHERN BREEZE SWEET TEA IS BEYOND WHAT I EXPECTED. I will NEVER use another tea bag other than this for my sweet tea. OMG you try this product and im telling you REFRESHING is an understatement.<br />Go ahead and try it you will NOT be disappointed. Its FANTABULOS<br /><br />HAPPY DRINKING
5.0	I waited to review this product until I had used it for at least a month. So here we are, and this has been a great addition to my hair care regimen.
5.0	Learned to love Milka in Germany
5.0	Great price. Great Product. Thank you
5.0	These are hand down the best tasting ramen I've ever had. Luckily for me the nearest Asian market sells ever variety for .40 each. I love how you can customize the flavor with the packets. Most of the time I eat it with all or I'll add only half of the chili sauce. I recommend trying with an over easy egg on top! It's heavenly.<br /><br />I will never go back to regular ramen after having this.
5.0	Love these! They are plump, long & wonderful.
5.0	"I just ate one of these cookies and it's really, really good. I wish I knew more about it...like the caloric content and is \\""blue agave\\"" better for you than sugar? I'll have to assume it is. Now I just need to find these cookies cheaper than $3 each. Bulk discount? Also, what's their shelf life?"
5.0	My only complaint is that I wish I could find more of a selection of dispensers at regular stores instead of having to go to a specialty place or online and pay for shipping...  Other than that pez are a staple candy that I grew up on.
5.0	As good as the original!
5.0	Who would've thought I would order food from Amazon?  However, since these are simply killer pancakes, and anyplace else they cost two or three times as much, it's pretty much a no brainer.  They make most excellent waffles also, very light and crispy.<br /><br />Try 'em, you'll like 'em.
5.0	Sounds disgusting and tastes like mangoes. My son loves them. I'm glad they have spinach in them. The packages aren't recyclable like jars but look really cool. We are currently living overseas so I can't give you an opinion on the price of them. They are lighter weight than the jars and don't require spoons. Although you can put the cap back on it's not nearly as secure as before you took it off the first time. I strongly recommend NOT dropping it into the bottom of your diaper bag or handing it to your kid in the back seat because inevitably, even if they are starving, they will pull it out of their mouths and give it a squeeze. The cap can be considered a choking hazard.
5.0	I wanted the ability to receive this on a regular basis as I use it in everything, including my scrambled eggs, makes them taste excellent and my grandson loves my eggs.
5.0	I love maple syrup and have purchased many different kinds. This one is a keeper. I will definitely purchase again. The flavor is rich and full of maple flavor.
5.0	Tasty and perfect for on the go.
5.0	Almost like the runt brand, but really close and satisfying.
5.0	Best chips EVER!! I will be ordering theses again real soon. I grew up with these. You have to try them.
5.0	Delicious product!!  I order this fairly regularly because it's always a hit.
5.0	"I grew up in Sri Lanka and had the opportunity to enjoy different types of tea. Since I moved a while ago I have had this shipped to me from Sri Lanka and I've enjoyed every cup. I go through about 3-4 cups every day and I can't say anything bad about them. I know I can't expect the perfect cup of tea that I used to have in Sri Lanka but this brings back memories.<br /> If you like pure tea with no additives this is the one for you. I hate those \\""flavored\\"" tea sold at stores but this always puts a smile on my face."
5.0	I ate Sunshine saltines ae wee bladback in the early 40's.....guess what;I did not even know they were still around...and they are my favorite brand.  Well this really is a lot of crackers, but for sure I will eat them all, and have a good time doing it.
5.0	Delicious flavors.  Easy to make and taste great
5.0	I have a water bottle at work that I mix up lemonade in to keep me from going after the soda. Tastes better than water. Doesn't have all the calories.
5.0	We love the taste ! The convenience of using the keriug cups makes all so much special! The price was right!
5.0	Delicious crackers.  These are my wife's favorate crackers.  The brown flax seeds add a delightful taste to the crackers.<br />Our order arrived in excellant condition, contary to the other reviewer.
5.0	From spouse of account holder. .. I really like the flavor of this brand of aloe. No bad aftertaste. Giving 5 stars and getting the benefits of a healthy alternative compared to the juices and tea I drink normally.
5.0	Casing packs usually did 25#, but this one did 40#!! I use only venison in my sausage (no pork, no added fat; 1 large grind) and they did so well. Only 3 little holes appeared during stuffing and otherwise in great shape.<br />buy these.
5.0	I ordered this beautiful chocolate jar to use as a table centerpiece at a professional Christmas dinner.  It drew many compliments.
5.0	The best cashews I've found at the best price. I think these are truly raw (which apparently many cashews are not), because even at 8 hours of soaking they were not the least bit slimy. I toasted some up and made the rest into cashew cream to freeze. Perfect.
5.0	Mix it with Dill and Ranch for crazy good combo.
5.0	I make goat or lamb nehari in the crockpot (I am not my Mother in Law and don't have the patience to stand at the stove for hours at a time).  My hubby LOVES this spice mix.  It's a different brand than the MIL uses but it's the perfect mix of spice, salt and flaver.  I also use more than the 1 kg of meat/bones than is called for.  Usually I use at least 3-4lbs of meat and bones and far less oil.  Hubby likes it hot, and this comes out more than hot enough for him while still being edible for me.
5.0	Wanted Morton's Hot Salt.  Can't find it.  This is not a suitable replacement.
5.0	Start small.  My grains are growing like crazy now and each batch tastes better and better.  Thanks!!
5.0	Yummy for healthy cereal which usually dont taste the best
5.0	Use this all the time for gravy and smoothies
5.0	I live in Florida and it is now hurricaine season. This product and packaging is perfect when we have no electrical power or when we have to evacuate.
5.0	I have use the clear flavor for a while now. I just started to venture onto other flavors in fear it wouldn't taste like it claims. I was way wrong! It tastes like chocolate with a hint of raspberry. Love it in my tea.
5.0	Great product all around. Completely natural & unrefined so this is the purest & best kind of coconut oil. I use it as an overnight treatment for my hair & started to notice improvements right away. Smells amazing! I take a chunk in my hand, rub my hands together so it liquifies & apply it to my hair. You get a huge container for a great price. You won't regret this purchase! On a side note if you don't like the smell of coconut, you won't like this product. It's pure coconut oil so of course it smells like coconut. It seems silly to write it but you wouldn't believe how many reviews I've seen where people actually complain that the coconut oil smells like coconut!
5.0	LOVE these bars.  I buy them often.  They are great to keep in my purse for when I'm running around and don't have time to eat.  Wonderful guilt-free snack.
5.0	Yay pancakes. Just add water? Maybe a little chocolate chips or fruit or, dare I say, bacon? Great pancakes, great price!
5.0	Nothing is better than this brownie mix!  My husband loves them!  I make them for friends and they rave on them; and can't believe they are gluten free when I tell them!
5.0	Love them, great price. Only drawback, seasonal item. Make sure you stock up when available or you'll be craving them until then.
5.0	Who knows what the hell these things are made out of, but it might as well be ambrosia. Charleston Chews are desert island treats, I would choose them over water if I was stranded.
5.0	Yummy, they're so good. Most gluten free cakes and cookies are not as good as the wheat version. These are some of the best cookies I've eaten ever. They break easily--and I ate every crumb. :-) Bought mine at a grocery store, but online you can get them for about $2 less per bag. Goodie!
5.0	A little goes a long way. Been using it exclusively on popcorn. I will eventually try some on eggs. I've used truffle oil and am now a fan of the salt. I find it easier to use in the salt form than the oil which can be a bit tricky to get only one drop ( maybe I should get me a dropper ).
5.0	I put 2 tablespoons in my smoothie each morning.  It really improved my stamina and energy.  I am sure my girlfriend does not know where I got this new energy.  I am over 50 and I strongly recommend to older men to turn back the clock.
5.0	Delicious coffee like drink.  The aroma and the flavor give you the same experience as coffee without the acid and the caffeine.
5.0	Delicious, easy, and they go with everything. I absolutely love grits, and these are a great find. They do take about 30 minutes to prepare, so don't expect an instant meal, but they're very good stuff.
5.0	Have been buying these for our church for a couple years now. Just don't buy them too far in advance.  The shelf life is usually within six months of expiration, and you definitely want to pay attention to that date, unless you enjoy sour grape juice.
5.0	Definitely a trip back in time to my childhood.  All flavors the same and delicious.  Love these candies.
5.0	By far my favourite candy, and such a good price.
5.0	Fit perfectly and did the job.
5.0	This is a great selection of flavors without having to buy a ton of pods.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend.  Arrived quickly and in perfect condition.
5.0	This is an excellent product made like sauerkraut should be made. The taste is mild and it's full of proboitics making it extremely healthy to eat.
5.0	delicious and fresh product
5.0	I totally agree with  P. Moore
5.0	Soulfully Sweet cookies are the absolute best cookies I have ever had. I can't believe they are gluten free. They are a MUST buy. I am going to try a few other flavors and Also purchase for Christmas gifts!
5.0	Super healthy! 30% of calcium in one bag and 40% of your iron - coming from a plant source! Its the perfect snack - my kids even like them!
5.0	Arrived Early. The site tells it all about the item.    I would do this again anytime.    Good Price Thank you    As Described.      [[ASIN:B000E6LBXK Splenda No Calorie Sweetener, 400-Count Packets]]
5.0	Love the coffee and their commitment to the environment.
5.0	I've had good results with these chia seeds. Good source of Omega-3 ALA: 2900mg per serving! Compare that to the 100mg in many supplement pills. ALA is not EPA or DHA so do your research. The seeds a keep things moving (read: bowels) but not overly so. Good fiber.<br /><br />Packaging is a strong plastic container with scoop inside. I take about 3/4 scoop daily and each 35.3 oz container lasts 3 months. A full 15g scoop is supposed to be 66 servings, so roughly 2 months supply. I'm happy to be able to get it via Subscribe and Save.
5.0	USE A few drops at first, otherwise its nasty.
5.0	Healthy, vegan, low calorie and fills me when I need an in between meal snack.  I eat these for lunch and my granddaughters enjoy them also.  I'm hooked on Dr McDougall.  I have about 10 cases of his soup in my cupboard  now.
5.0	These are so good. I like the rose flavor best. They are a great dessert for company-- or, for just you.
5.0	Great almonds at a great price!
5.0	I want more, when it will be available again?
5.0	We have tried all kinds and like the taste of this one the best. Excellent price as well. Great value.
5.0	These things are fantastic, my friend got me hooked from a bag his girlfriend in japan sent him. Great potato flavor, and the actual cheese on the chips is extra delicious. Why can't American chip manufactures catch on to this wonderful combination of food technology so I don't have to import these delicious chips from the other side of the world.
5.0	I have no complant  about it . It taste great and it needs no sugar and that's what I really love about it , and another thing is that it's Diet how about that . All I have to say is to try it and you will see ,also you can taste the Peach very well .
5.0	I bought this combo of milk kefir and water kefir grains about one month ago and I'm THRILLED. They arrived in perfect shape, double bagged in heat-sealed bags and tinfoil. They were alive and well.  I've done milk kefir in the past and these grains, which don't look like much (quantity), are extremely active. Already they produce nearly 1/2 gallon of kefir every 24 hours! I use organic, hormone free whole cows milk, and the kefir it creates is rich, creamy, and delicious. I just made my first batch of herbed kefir cheese, which is delicious and so easy, too! I'm totally new to water kefir, and I'm having so much fun experimenting with different flavors for my natural probiotic &#34;soda&#34;. My grains have already grown so much that I've already given away 2 cups of grains and still have too much to keep up with! The one thing I'm doing that might account for the rapid growth is that I'm doing both types of kefir anaerobically using one of those Pickl-it lids on a mason jar (and for the water kefir, swing top bottles for the secondary fermentation). Bottom line, for a very affordable price these grains are amazing!
5.0	Sunpure is a great mix of natural energy. This stuff is also great for a pre-workout. I didn't feel shaky after taking this as I would with other energy drinks.
5.0	I was very pleased with this item, it came promptly, and satisfied my need for use in a cookie recipe.
5.0	"KODIAK CAKES ARE THE GREATEST HOME MADE HEALTHFUL PANCAKES IN THE WORLD.  THEY RISE UP SO HIGH AND THEY ARE SO GREAT FOR EATING, ESPECIALLY WITH HONEY DRIZZLED ON TOP.  KODIAK CAKES ARE GREAT FOR COOKING WHILE OUT CAMPING, AS THEY ARE SO WHOLESOME AND VERY TASTY.[[ASIN:B005HQZCWS 50 RECYCLED KRAFT GREETING CARDS 4x5\\"" & 50 ENVELOPES-MAKE YOUR OWN CARD INVITES!]]"
5.0	Dayum good chocolate mix, I drink this when I miss a meal and am hungry. Pound two packets in a mixer bottle and drink it. mmmmm but I do feel better and rejuvanated just hungry as hell afterwards.<br /><br />Good taste and very nutritious! A+++
5.0	While this product is exactly what it says it is, paprika, it's not nearly as good smoked paprika, but then again, I didn't buy smoke paprika. It's good and that's what matters. Will buy the stuff in the red tin next time though. Love Hungarian Paprika smoked.
5.0	"So-called \\""curry powder\\"" is a blend of spices, and I am not always motivated to blend my own, since I like this one. I buy it in the large container, it reduces the shipping cost per once, and I share with with my family so it doesn't sit and get stale.  This one is my personal favorite commercial curry seasoning."
5.0	This soda tastes pretty good for a diet drink.  The flavor is unique, and it tastes very refreshing.  Much better than average.
5.0	This product mixes well with chocolate syrup and the substrate did not settle out into an undesirable combination. Being that I enjoy extra chocolate flavor toward the end of the glass, it performed superbly in that respect. It also worked equally well when mixed liberally with coffee and sugar. I am currently in beta testing of the freezing properties of this solution to determine if it can be used as a suitable substitute for ice milk. Those wishing to donate additional quantities of the fluid and its related shipping costs will receive a complimentary copy of my research findings.
5.0	Good stuff, what a good snack, kids enjoy it as well as my hubby.
5.0	I really like these lentils. They are of a great quality and I never find any rocks or other things in them. They cook very well and have a very nice flavor. You can season them with chicken broth, herbs, spices, or anything that you like. They take on any flavour very well. Love the brand and love this product.
5.0	Hands down my favorite oatmeal! The flavor is great! It's sweet but not to sweet, but I like sweet so keep that in mind. I really like it! And eat it frequently as a go to snack/meal. I keep it in my car and at work in case I need or want something to eat. Very tasty!
5.0	This stuff is just plain fantastic.  It has become my go to base rub for pork butt, ribs, and chicken.  I still love to finish with something a bit sweeter (like Cowtown Sweet Spot), but Plowboys Yardbird is just awesome for that thick base rub that isn't so heavy on sugar that you'll end up with a burnt bark.  I will not change now that I've found Yardbird.  It's just hard to beat.
5.0	I like a strong coffee in the morning and for my taste nothing beat this brand!
5.0	Great Candy and sweets.  Greaty quality dont think twice.
5.0	They are chewy, chocolate-ty and nutritious! My 8 and 2 year olds love these bars, as do their playdate friends. It's nice to have a portable, healthy, tasty alternative to bars that contain so many additives, preservatives and HFCS.
5.0	Yum! Yum! A delicious healthy snack (just restrain yourself and don't eat too many at once).  We are very pleased with the quality.  The yogurt and cranberries are fresh and certainly a lot better for you than candy bars.  We keep them on hand for company to snack on, also.
5.0	Hubby and daughter love this for stomach issues.
5.0	Excellent quality. Fresh and flavorful with a lovely aroma.
5.0	"My family prefers food made from scratch-breads, soups, jams, pickles, etc. The taste has more depth, better spices, texture & freshness. So, I thought I'd give making my own yogurt a try. I have used the Yogourmet  Starter with excellent results in a EuroCuisine maker. I use a combination of skim, 2% & powdered milks & a long overnight processing time  for a thicker, Greek style product.  All of us love the \\""tang\\""  & texture of the fresh yogurt. Since we started eating the homemade yogurt, we have noticed better digestion & less between meal hunger,too."
5.0	These are very yummy.
5.0	This product is wonderful.  I use it constantly in my Japenese cooking class.
5.0	In my opinion, the best chocolate flavored breakfast drink out there - can be a bit pricey most of the time on Amazon.com, but I don't like to go through a morning without one.
5.0	I have never made menudo but, I use this for chili and tacos and have used it for many years.  A+++ product.  Was unable to find it in the local stores after moving from Texas to Montana and was happy to find it at Amazon.com.
5.0	Love the dark chocolate!
5.0	I love my Nespresso in the morning and am wary of generic capsules, but Gourmesso has exceeded my expectations. There was been a little less crema than I was used to but the taste was exceptional. Very smooth, not too acidic, and in my opinion, preferable to Nespresso even though they're a little over half the price per capsule. I would recommend this!
5.0	This is a good product! I would give it a A+ ! I love it !I would recommend it to everyone!!
5.0	I usually do not like dark chocolate, but this was all my Mom had. It is delicious! I look forward to relaxing with a cup of this after a long day of work.
5.0	Arrived in good condition. No spillage, just a little paprika dust in plastic bag, no problem.
5.0	So simple. So convenient. So delicious. I substitue the eggs for flax eggs (2 tablespoon ground flax seed  plus 3 tablespoons hot water) and they still come out perfect and fluffy--they even rose some! For egg free baking that's like magic!  My daughter and I devour them! We like to make them mini muffin size and they make the perfect snack!
5.0	I must have these crunchy, cinnamony little cookies before bed each night.  I like to dip them in tea.  If you like good things you will like these things. Yum.
5.0	I've been on a very low sugar diet for about the last 9 months and have lost about 25 pounds. I feels real good! Now I'm adding a few &#34;treat&#34; items to the diet, but I'm still trying  to maintain a low sugar, high protein and high fiber intake. That's how I came upon these Fiber One Oats and Chocolate Bars. They're good! Real good! Sinfully good! I found them at Costco in a 24-pac package. They're just what I needed for a nice desert item. Low in calories (140 per bar). High in Fiber (35% daily value). Oh, did I mention that they're very high in flavor. I's a really good snack item, but watch that you don't eat too many.<br /><br />Gary Peterson
5.0	Always a hit as a gift
5.0	Good stuff!  I like the taste.
5.0	I got a Bottle of World Market  Extra Virgin Olive Oil as part of a Christmas Gift.  I have used it and was happy to see it on Amazon, as I live in a very small town, no Health food stores near.  So I am happy to be able to get the Olive Oil, without driving an hour or so. The olive oil is very mild and I have used it for over a year now and am very pleased with it!!
5.0	I add these to salads for a twist.  I sometimes add them to yogurt.  You can add them to some recipes like roasted chicken.  This is a staple for me.
5.0	I recently bought this coffee and I am a first time user of this product.  It is simply a rich and smooth coffee with low acidity. I frequently get Reflux with various coffee regardless if they claim to be bold or smooth.  No reflux with this product.  You are paying a premium but I think it is worth the price.  Additionally, no jittery or anxious feeling with this product.  Would definitely recommend this to a friend.
5.0	This is an Awesome product. I get the 5oz. bag all the time. I can't wait until I can get the 25oz. bag. My grandchildren love it they think it's candy. This is the first time I've found something that is really good for you that they will eat all the time. Thank you Sunsweet!!!
5.0	I have a serious foot problem, and have up to now only purchased slip on shoes/clogs, but I thought I would take a chance on these Fisherman Sandals to fit, they are great and fit just great, the built in Elastic top strap allow's these wonderful classy shoes to fit just fine, I tempted to order a second pair. PS I love the colour........
5.0	It is easy to make and tastes so good. I am going to try other flavors. I would buy this product again.
5.0	VERY SATISFIED.  THANK YOU.
5.0	very nice, I like it, It is what I expect. The quality is very good. ^_^ I like it .
5.0	Received the coffee filters quickly.  They were in good shape.  Its a nice number of filters, since my family goes through coffee filters very fast.
5.0	This is by far the best instant coffee I have ever tasted.<br />Same great quality as the one purchased at the market.
5.0	These are my FAVORITE!!! I can't find them anymore in stores :(  They are the BEST EVER!!!! Wish Frito Lay would find a way to bring them back to stores around Houston, TX!
5.0	We love barilla and finding this for the price we did was awesome! It cost us under $6 for for the 4 boxes, which is a great deal!
5.0	I first bought a jar of it while in Jamaica and I really liked it. I use on many different foods. It is not hot
5.0	better that the restaurants
5.0	This tastes good, and is very affordable.  A great buy for latte lovers.  Good deal.  I will buy them again.
5.0	I recently travelled to Japan and bought some as a random purchase to bring home.  The drink is so delicious and easy to make.  I will be purchasing here to replenish my stock!
5.0	I would highly recommend this brand for nuts.  Have purchased many different types of their nuts and ALL were of high quality.
5.0	nice to have a veriety for your morning cup! Just love it.  Not a fan of French Vanilla but all the rest wee great!
5.0	Mom is happy... can't complain. Works better than sbux pods in the sbux machine.
5.0	I love this hard to find (for me) candy.  I purchase this 3 pack approx every 6 months.  The product is fresh and the shipping is wicked fast!  Thank you!
5.0	I discovered teas with rice a few years ago and am always on the lookout for new combinations.  I really enjoyed Mighty Leaf's blend of popped and roasted rice combined with a smooth green tea and just the right amount of caffeine.  This is definitely one of my new favorites.
5.0	"I know this tea is not for everyone, most people who smell it after I make a cup say \\""what is that\\"" and not in a nice way. Nonetheless it is very full bodied and goes with many spicey dishes. I make it extra strong and drink it with smoked fish. I have never smoked a cigarette, etc in my life, but I do love this tea."
5.0	As stated and on time. Thanks
5.0	I love a bold coffee and the Italian Barista fits the bill to a &#34;T&#34;.  Rich without being bitter, it is the perfect addition to my K-Cup collection.
5.0	I just got done writing a review on another brand.  I decided since I compared them to Little Pepi's, I would write a review here.  Little Pepi's have been around forever, and are still the best.  I do not know why we tried the other product, but we will never do that again.  Anise flavor is my favorite, but honestly they are all excellent. Take it from me, I have tried the rest, just stick to the best!  Can't go wrong with advise from an Italian Grandmother.
5.0	Love this product!!! I use it in lieu of Parmesan cheese
5.0	This chocolate was really creamy and tasty!  I loved the flavors they put together.  Will order again!  OMG!  Why do they want 3 more words?  Just give it a try!
5.0	Great alternative to Doritos. No artificial flavoring, colors
5.0	when I need a moroccan/indian style food but cant get actual indian food, this works in a pinch. Good, not spicy as in heat pepper spicy, but spicy in its spice flavors.
5.0	Chocolate is a matter of taste. I like dark chocolate and this is a very good and smooth product. Best price around compared to Walmart where it may or may not be on shelf. Also, this source is likely to provide a fresher product.
5.0	Great snack option and at this price who could pass them up, great for kids and adults alike though might rot the kids teeths out haha
5.0	I had always asked people to get them for me from England. Was so happy to find it on line. I can't do without them, and have always had a stock of them.<br /><br />Very reasonable priced, hope it doesn't go up, or the shipping.<br /><br />Monica.
5.0	Delicious! And healthful!
5.0	I read some reviews about this product being discontinued and how the company who makes it changed the recipe formula. I'm not sure what's going on with all that stuff but all I know is I ordered it and I really liked it. It's sweet but not too sweet. It's very smooth and flavorful. It's like drinking a lighter version of cappuccino. It's very easy to make as well.
5.0	Excellent value! Only thing better than the taste is the price. Have already recommended to family in California and she ordered 3 jars also!
5.0	Very hot but it has a good flavor to it just a couple of drops is all you need to ice up any meal.
5.0	Received these today. They are exactly what I have been searching for. Great peach taste without being overly sweet. I have tried many many peach candies. If I was lucky and could actually detect a peach flavor, the candy would be too sweet. These are the best.
5.0	Best tasting crystal light flavor, love that it is free from sugar. Very refreshing as a drink or even cocktail mixer.
5.0	Fantastic. They taste great and even have a little tweezer to use. Would buy again.
5.0	I like this to fry greens in.
5.0	I received the product quickly and in good condition. I used it to make GF cinnamon rolls which turned out delicious!
5.0	I first bought coconut oil from Walmart and it was organic & refined which I used for deep conditioning my long, thin chemically dyed hair and I liked it a lot. However, I ordered this because I found out that unrefined is better for your hair than refined. So as soon as I got it I opened it and the first thing I noticed was the difference in smell. Literally smells like coconuts fresh off the tree!! I wasn't sure if I smelled anything with my store brand so I went to smell it and, it smelled like cooking oil. :( So I went on to testing my new oil on my hair, and the results were similar..maybe made my hair a little more shiny but I guess I can't really know for sure since I only used each one once so far. But, the smell makes all the difference for me lol, I feel pampered.  I also use it as a leave-in now but although it makes your hair super shiny and strong, it dries/stiffens your hair. So I mixed it with jojoba oil.. it was a little better but I think I'm going to try shea nilotica.
5.0	I like Starbucks Chai Latte and this one comes pretty close.  If I could just make it with milk it would be perfect.  I don't drink coffee and this fills the caffeine void for me.  I continue to buy it from Amazon as I can't find it anywhere else, plus there's no shipping!
5.0	These are great tasting.  It's like a mix of raisin bran and honey bunches of oats.  I did the subscribe and save and it really does save you money.
5.0	"A delicious dark roast that's smooth and balanced. Buying in bulk shipment from Amazon means that the price I pay for a pound of coffee drops from almost $7 to under $5 -- well worth it. People accustomed to the bitter, burnt taste of Starbucks coffee won't like Community Coffee -- it's a traditional American grind that makes what some would consider \\""weak\\"" coffee, but it's what I prefer.<br /><br />EDIT: Well, the price of coffee keeps going up. From around $47 per 10 lb box to more than $63. So it's less of a great deal now, but still cheaper than buying it in the grocery store."
5.0	Best gummy candy you can buy!
5.0	"Added these prunes to our baby girl's diet to get things \\""moving\\"" again.  She loved them, and now is as regular as mom and dad!  As far as the BPA? - we researched: amount is negligible and is contained under a non BPA layer.  No contact with the food at all.  Therefore - no BPA in the food whatsoever."
5.0	Hmmmm.... I thought as I was walking down the grocery aisle and spotted the Marzetti Sweet and Sour dressing, I wonder if it's like the sweet and sour dressing I tried 30 years ago and liked an awful lot. Well, it's hard to make a comparison with something that you haven't had in 30 years, but on its own, this dressing is fabulous. We love it. I use it both on salads and as a marinade for chicken and pork. Not overpowering, it adds exactly the right amount of flavor to everything I use it with.
5.0	A great smooth coffee for the morning drive into work!
5.0	I used to love Razzles, the cavity-encouraging candy that magically becomes gum.  After watching a rerun of &#34;13 Going On 30&#34; where the confection is prominently mentioned, I just had to have some.  Having my Amazon app for Android on &#34;speed dial&#34;, I immediately found a purchased this 24-pack of the original, full-sized bags of candy ... I mean, gum.<br /><br />The candy is fresh, and tastes exactly the same as I remember it.  GOD I love Amazon's ability to cater to my every ill-conceived impulse buying &#34;need&#34;.
5.0	Excellent robust coffee.  The flavor is very rich and satisfying.  If you like a strong brew, this one should satisfy!
5.0	I use this to flavor my coffee and it has become difficult to find locally and I wondered if that has anything to do with a possible shortage of chocolate this year.  I have tried others and this is good for the price.  There are others out there that are better but you will have to pay much more and get a lot less.
5.0	I used to be able to buy this in a regular size container at grocery stores and Walmart.  Then Walmart chose to only stock a few national brands along with their generic brand of spices.  As it turned out, NO ONE stocked the regular size anymore, and a Google search revealed that other people were looking for it also.  I found this huge container on Amazon, which was sold as a pack of 2.  I thought it would last me forever.   WRONG!  I love this stuff and use it on everything: salads, vegetables and all types of meat - specifically steak and burgers. I still have plenty, but it's going much quicker than I thought.
5.0	Love this coffee!  No issues with acidity on my tummy!
5.0	beautiful olive oil, intense yellow color and GREAT taste...only issue was the box itself falling apart, nothing duct tape cant fix....packaging aside, my highest recommendation..
5.0	We just recieved this coffee as part of our standard office coffee service.  Its a lot better then the other brand we used to get.  Good to see you can order on Amazon.
5.0	There is no comparison between this tea and other brands.  It makes the best Decaf Iced Tea I've ever tasted.  I tried to use cheaper brands, but the tea came out flavorless.  It's Luzianne only for me from now on...
5.0	A really delicious tea.  A good price for a premium tea.  And well-packaged in an airtight container!  I am a big Republic of Tea fan.
5.0	nothing else will do.  Just have to have some of the good stuff once in a while.  Post office does not obey instructions on the label so try to have somebody watching for delivery.
5.0	I like to eat hazelnuts from the shell.  These met my expectations.
5.0	I love this powder - dislike the packaging because the loose powder flows out when you open it but I love what is inside. I use Sunfood in my make up and while baking. It has a rich aroma and is a very fine powder which works well for cooking, decorating and making cosmetics!<br /><br />I highly recommend this product - I also recommend you save yourself some messes by transferring it into a glass or plastic container as the bag is terrible! It still gets 5 stars because now I just put it in something else and feel so much better!
5.0	This is the best Taboule I've had and is hard to find locally.  Happy to be able to order from Amazon and have it at my house in just a few days.  Great service and awesome, easy wheat salad!
5.0	I've purchased several different seasoning salts over the years and this one is a keeper.I've purchased Lawry's, season all, different store brands and nothing could replace my Lawry's until I tried this.To me the difference between this seasoning salt and Lawry's is Sylvia's is a little warmer on the tongue, not hot.Like that warm cumin or chili flavor.It's not too salty either. I mean some seasoning salts are so salty you can't taste the other flavors.If you can also try her lemon pepper seasoning it is terrific on fish and grilled chicken.
5.0	This tea is delicious!!!!! I just pop 4 bags in my gallon pitcher and let it cold brew in the refrigerator. This brand tastes as good as Tazo Awake, and costs less, and it's organic!
5.0	Fresh, tasty, and priced below the locally available price.  Will be back for more.
5.0	While I have never been a huge fan of the Wonderful brand pistachios, I absolutely LOVE these Wonderful Sweet Chili Pistachios!<br /><br />Pistachios are good eatin'. They taste great and yet somehow they are beneficial (rather than harmful) to health. And given you have to crack them they even offer a natural portion control! Wonderful has made these using a variety of spices, including sugar, salt, onion powder, chili pepper, paprika, and vinegar. Unlike some flavored snacks, there does not appear to be petroleum in these, nor are there any ingredients that I have concerns about safety/health. Rather, it's just a bunch of good spices mixed together to bring out a roasted flavor with a little kick. As others have noted, these are pretty salty so if you are not a fan of salted pistachios you probably will not like these. If you are a bit of a salt lover (like myself) and you like spice with a little bit of sweet heat, these will wow you. You can still taste both the pistachios flavor as well as flavor from the roast, but the roasted flavor is amplified with these and there is a smokey element to them. I find the flavor balance here to be perfect since there are both sweet and salty elements at the same time, much like kettle corn.<br /><br />The only downside to these would be price. However, that goes for all pistachios, and most nuts for that matter. Still, between the great flavor and the fact that these are beneficial to health, the price is justifiable. Do note that since these are flavored pistachios that their visual appearance is a little different from regular salted/roasted ones.
5.0	I absolutely love poptarts even though they aren't the healthies breakfasts, I buy the low fat version and save half the fat of the regular version and I think they taste better, they are crispier when toasted.  The price is also right on amazon.com.
5.0	Lots of great variety. This was for my father for Christmas, a must have for anyone looking to find a new favorite.
5.0	Great body, taste and flavor
5.0	Spicy, yet more garlic flavor than other Sriracha sauces.  Also has a slight tangy flavor, as from vinegar, and between this and the garlic I highly prefer this Sriracha to all others I have tried to date - and that would be quite a few!  Good stuff, and so far my favorite of the Sriracha's out there.
5.0	Happy to see a good tasting coffee in a more eco friendly packaging.  A light coffee drinker, making a full pot of coffee each day became wasteful.  I felt guilty using and discarding even more plastic into the environment + the cost involved, made using my recently purchased Keurig less than attractive.  Have a fill-it-yourself drop in for the unit, but cleanup of the micro filter not desirable for the little coffee I use.  The SFB OneCup fills my needs perfectly!
5.0	Wonderful product to use for baking. A little bit goes a long way. Definitely worth the money. Huge quantity! Shipping couldn't of been quicker.
5.0	$1.49 per box is an awesome price and free delivery! If you like carmel corn, you will love this. Only thing is: How to keep the KIDS out of it? Maybe order two cases and hide one? Then on that rare occasion when I hafta have some, it'll be there. Not too sweet, great crunch, plenty of peanuts, just what you'd expect in carmel corn! Amazon has the smaller boxes, too: [[ASIN:B000HDHZZI Crunch 'n Munch Caramel Popcorn, 4-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)]].
5.0	Daaammmmuuunnnnnn this is alot of gummi bears
5.0	It looks just like it does in the picture.  Very happy with the purchase would not hesitate to buy again.
5.0	As a broke college student, I essentially lived off the 100 pack of these for about a month. My digestive system will probably shut down eventually, but at least I have a few decades until I have to worry about that.
5.0	Actually this is the type of KitKat I have like from my country lovely smooth taste.. I will order again and again the taste is great.
5.0	Better than coffee itself!
5.0	I was very surprised how fast it was deliverd when i only paid for normal delivery
5.0	I only purchase coffee beans and have found this product to be among the excellent brands for medium roast and french roast coffee. I highly recommend this coffee.
5.0	I bought the case of this marinade because we use it for almost everything we grill.  My family loves the flavor this marinade gives pork, chicken and  beef.  We even use it on ribs in our electric smoker.  I would recommend this for everyone who loves to grill!!
5.0	What can you say.. Chocolate is Good.. and when it is Hershey's can it be any better.. very fresh and good
5.0	Update:<br />I was worried when I bought my True Lime shaker that I would run through it too fast to make it cost-effective.  In fact, I just finally ran out about a week ago, using at least a little just about every day.  I'll be re-ordering soon.<br /><br />Original Review:<br />To be fair, I need to explain that I ordered this product because I'd already tried True Lime and loved it.  It really tastes like fresh lime -- much more so than the stuff in the little squeeze bottle you can buy at the grocery store, which tends to have a weird aftertaste.<br /><br />I True Lime it in all kinds of applications -- adding a little flavor to plain water, making dishes with black beans, adding a little kick to Kool-Aid, and beyond -- so this purchase was a no-brainer.  The bulk format is perfect for my needs.<br /><br />My only complaint?  I wish I could find an *even bigger* jar ... but maybe the world isn't ready for that :D
5.0	One of my favorite candies.  I learned something purchasing it here on Amazon.<br />The same company also makes a dark chocolate Almond Roca.  My order<br />has come, but I have been waiting to savor each piece.
5.0	Excellent tea!  Comes well packaged and very fresh.  Brews a great pot of tea and doesn't have a bitter taste even without sugar or sweetner which is the way I prefer to drink it.
5.0	These were very fresh and came quickly!  Loved it!
5.0	This is the one- General Mills recently re-released French Toast Crunch in the US; it is inferior to the Canadian one, which to me, tastes like the original 90s one. If I had to guess it was to cut costs- buy the original and import it from umkapolka!
5.0	They looked adorable on my daughter's birthday cake! And arrived in perfect condition. Not one was broken! I was a little worried ordering sugar birds online but they were wrapped perfectly. Thank you.
5.0	Much tastier than the generic brand from Publix.  My husband and I like them a lot. We order them regularly.
5.0	use these for years with no problems
5.0	World's best split pea soup, even if you don't like split pea soup! Arrived on time. Very well packaged; no damage to cans.
5.0	This oatmeal is one of the best in the oatmeal family. Yes, I like the taste and texture of the product.
5.0	bought these for the wife likes stronger heavier coffee then I do she loves it when she gets to the last 6 will order more fast shipping
5.0	Love these snails, I only buy this brand.  I have eaten many different brands and these had been the largest and most tasteful I've had!
5.0	Now we're talkin'! If you don't like spices, this is not for you, but it's my favorite. Buy it whilst watching for the best deal: This is expensive.
5.0	Tastes like the Tenkasu I used to get in Japan!
5.0	This is an absolutely delicious flavor combination. I wish Amazon would bring the price back down so I could afford to buy more.<br />Orange Tangerine... I would drink any where from two to four every day. A real thirst quencher.
5.0	We love this rice.  I've been using it for years but for some reason my local grocery store no longer carries it.  I was delighted to find it on Amazon (and where else would one look?). It's not cheap but it really is good! It has an amazing subtle pecan flavor....for additional flavor add a small amount of ground pecans and butter and salt and you've got a wonderful side dish.
5.0	These mushrooms are wonderful to add to so many dishes.  They're delicious and so convenient.<br />As science finds more reasons to include them in our diets, they have become more than just a garnish.
5.0	Not your avaerage Hot Chocolate, takes a little prep time, well worth it for the taste.
5.0	Better than described.
5.0	Really love these noodles! The myriad of different vegetables is so refreshing. They just need a splash of olive oil and nothing else.
5.0	I purchased this tea in May. But i did not try it until my birthday in September. WELL WORTH THE WAIT. The flavoring is excellent, a combination of fruit, mint& floral flavors. An exquisite taste.
5.0	i love pea soup. this stuff is really good. its so thick its hard to get out of the can. if you're a pea soup fan, you can't go wrong with this product. excellent price.
5.0	A while back my fiance and I found this seasoning at Sam's Club. We absolutely love it! We've used it on venison as well as chicken, vegetables, potatoes, etc. We recently ran out of it but now cannot find it anywhere and I'm seeing comments online that its discontinued! I certainly hope that is not the case because it is the best blend of seasonings I've ever tasted. We were very disappointed to find that Sam's no longer stocks, nor does Walmart or our local grocery stores. Hoping to find it somewhere online.
5.0	What better way to start your day than a warm piece of toast with butter and hagelslag?  This really makes the perfect breakfast with some berries and milk on the side or a great pick me up snack later in the day with a cup of tea.  It arrived quickly and in good shape and the boxes were good size.
5.0	These tablets are really fun! After dissolving them on your tongue, anything spicy or sour tastes sweet! I would recommend them to everyone, and they are fun way to eat combinations of foods you wouldn't even think about before.
5.0	McCormick is my favorite brand of seasoning products. Every time I purchase one of their products the quality is always top notch. I received a full size bottle of McCormick Gourmet All Natural Thyme in my #FrostyVoxBox from Influenster. It was free for my testing and review purposes, but all the opinions are my own.<br /><br />I love the new look of the packaging of the McCormick Gourmet line. The Thyme that I received was great, as usual, as met the same high standards that I always have of my McCormick products.<br /><br />I will keep buying McCormick and continue to recommend it as well. Excellent products!
5.0	Great Rich Body Coffee. Only way we can get our favorite coffee here in South Florida.
5.0	So, so good and all natural
5.0	This the best decafe dry mix i have ever had it is to bad the shop keepers and store will not keep it in stock i have a daughter that cant have caf. or black teas if it wasnt for this tea she would never get it and she loves and drinks by the gallon and she is 15yrs and her friends like it too they say the splenda gives it a little after taste and why dont you make the decafe with honey ????? over i give this product a 10 the kids like it and company cant tell its decafe but they can taste the splenda??? \<br />thank you for selling this on line you gave ice tea back to my daughter thank you<br />sincerely<br />Ms Toland
5.0	I love these chips!  These are a great dip chip since they are a thicker, firmer chip. I love these with hummus. They are less salty, not that you would notice, then a name brand chip. They have a nice, rich corn flavor.  I also find that these chips fill me up faster and leave me feeling more satisfied then other corn chips.  They have a nice crunch and are a wonderfully filling snack.
5.0	very good has lots of flavor
5.0	Our deployed service members LOVE this beef jerky, and so do I. I've been a WorldKitchens' customer for a couple of years and have purchased this for myself and guys in Iraq. It's good stuff and a great deal!
5.0	Good salt, delivered promptly, no complaints!
5.0	this is the best shredded coconut I have had. I use it to make coconut milk, it is sweet and fresh
5.0	I love popcorn.  We have popcorn about 4 nights a week. I started out looking for popcorn on the cob as I had that this year and it was lovely, and then stumbled upon India Tree.  It's the closest that I can find to the dried on the cob popcorn and I love it. It is so fresh and natural tasting.  I've been using it for several months and ran out the other day and had to use a popular store brand.  Though the kernals popped up larger, the taste was stale and processed...not to mention, the India Tree popcorn is actually cheaper than the store brand.  I'm placing my order for more India Tree right now!
5.0	I like it best with some 2% milk which smoothes out the flavor.
5.0	Exactly what I wanted. The toothpicks are separated into small plastic containers. They should keep that hot cinnamon taste for a long time!
5.0	The box of tea came very quickly, as do all Amazon products. It was packaged very well with wrappings outside the box, plastic inside, and all tea bags individually packed. It tastes good and makes a great iced tea, too. I'm using it for the health benefits of increased energy (without jitters). A nice product!
5.0	Best Peach Tea every sorry they quit making it! A long way to go getting it from China but worth it.
5.0	This is the best 5 minute oatmeal. Tastes delicious with a steel cut texture. I first found it at Costco, but they do not carry it anymore. This vendor was great!
5.0	These are great! So many uses.
5.0	Chocorooms are fun, tasty and a delight to munch on.  The boxes are a big hit in our house.  Everyone who comes over love our Chocorooms.  Looking forward to my next batch![[ASIN:B003N0T23U Meiji Chococones, 2.71-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 10)]]
5.0	Very good price. Tastes good.
5.0	Is very good I use every day
5.0	Great pasta, good consistency, cooks easily, good shape, 4-pack is a good quantity to maintain a decent supply, I will buy again and try some of the other shapes.
5.0	This teriyaki bacon jerky is phenomenal. I was a backer on their Kickstarter campaign and the product is absolutely incredible. The only thing I could think of that is bad about it, is there is an unfortunate end to the bag :( Easily ate 3/4 of the package in one sitting... My fiancee barely got any to try but she agrees that its freakin incredible. Definitely goin to be ordering some more. Beats out any other bacon jerky I've ever had -- or any jerky, really. Good job to Banzai.
5.0	"I've only started enjoying spicy foods over the past 2 years or so.  I try to take it easy because I have had many acid reflux and stomach difficulties over the years.  I usually can't handle anything hotter than hot giardiniera or sport peppers...even jalepenos is pushing it.  So my husband made a large crockpot full of chili and used about 4 drops of this sauce.  What ensued was the most intense and scorching feeling I have ever felt.  Every bite was painful.  Spicy isn't a strong enough word to describe this sauce.  But I loved it!  Granted, I had to eat my chili with bread and a few tall glasses of 7up....but it was SO tasty.    One day later - well I'm certainly not feeling normal, but I expected much worse.  I've seen my husband and his friends play \\""chicken\\"" with ghost chili pepper, and that's insane.  But \\""chicken\\"" with this sauce is practically suicidal.  Do NOT eat this straight; it must be diluted in food.  I truly believe this stuff is dangerous...."
5.0	Love these, they arrived nice and soft!
5.0	It is near impossible to find a beverage that is sugar free and free of artificial junk like aspartame and food coloring. I think the lemonade tastes great, but I am not crazy about the other flavors.
5.0	We love this flavorful gum as an alternative to the asparatame-laden substitutes on the market today. The flavor lasts and great for our daughter who is learning to blow bubbles. Amazon delivers it right to my door quickly at a great price which is even better!
5.0	Nice packaging. Good product. Boyfriend addicted!!
5.0	I love this tahini, and I will constantly be ordering more of it!
5.0	It's not easy to find bomba rice in the stores, though Sur La Table typically has it for a reasonable price.  Williams-Sonoma also has some, but it's a bit more expensive.  We make paella a fair amount, and using real bomba rice really makes a difference.  I've started ordering it from Amazon to avoid having to drive around to several stores to find it.  You use less than you would think because it's so absorbent, so it's a better bargain than it appears.  If you want to make authentic paella, go with bomba rice.
5.0	we have been getting these for years and the only place we can find them anymore is on line.  they are really great tasting in comparison to some of the other brands.  They are a little spicy but not too much
5.0	I ate these, my older son ate these as a child and my younger son eats them.  They have been around for so many years.  We had not had them in awhile. They seem to have less sugar than when they originally came out, which is good. We love em here and will order again. They taste good and  are a little good for you too!
5.0	I love them ! They are great for breakfast . A perfect mix between a cookie & cracker ! Taste so good you won't even notice that's its so good !
5.0	This goes great on bone in chicken and pork chops. I like buying the big eight pack because it takes awhile to run out.
5.0	I have enjoyed every cup and will continue to buy. It has helped me lose weight! :)
5.0	This stuff is wonderful! I'm a huge fan of herbal tea but have never bought this brand before because it is so expensive. I decided to give it a try after constantly seeing it get good reviews in health magazines and as it is becoming more available in more stores. I ordered two kinds, and LOVED THEM. I've tried 4 other kinds just this week. They truly do SAY what they are going to do. This one truly is so relaxing. I also recommend the Get Clean, Get Gorgeous and Get ZZZ's. I can't wait to try more of them! Spend the $10, you WILL NOT be disappointed.
5.0	I bought it on a whim a few days ago and was quite surprised by it. I use splenda as a sweetener but even a single packet was too much, so I tried it alone and it was wonderful. Something about the licorice (real licorice, not the stuff we're used to which is mostly anise and sugar) is already sweet, but in the strangest way. You taste the sweetness more at the back of your throat than on your tongue, almost as an aftertaste, which makes it much more interesting as a flavor than anything I've ever had. I've been giving it to coworkers to see how they react and everyone loves it. I'll definately be going back for more.
5.0	Some did really  well  and  the  other  not too good. I am  always over from your  I think  I should  get  something  fee or off
5.0	Lovely! This is the bomb when it comes to British teas. Love the aroma, flavour and strength. Add Heinz Beanz on toast to this and even a Monday feels like a Friday night out on the town.
5.0	I love this stuff just wish I could get it in the 15oz. size. Great for a quick snack anytime.
5.0	I LOVE POPCORN BUT HATE THE HULLS. THIS HAS A FEW BUT THEY ARE VERY SMALL.
5.0	Hi this is a great salad dressing and has a tangy taste and would be great used as a marinade for meats. This is a great product and a winner for anyone on a diet.<br /><br />Brenda Jones
5.0	Great cinnamon  flavor
5.0	"Russian researchers say, no, not by itself but vinegar (acetic acid) increases the deadliness of any cancer-causing nitrosamines in our diet.  Salt and sea salt always contain nitrosamines.  Beef, pork, and poultry always develop nitrosamines (and heterocyclic amines) when they are cooked in normal ways.  Processed meats contain nitrosamines even before they are cooked.  The only way to avoid creating nitrosamines in bloody, raw meat is to boil it in water without adding any salt.  (Please click \\""Comment\\"" below if you want to read what scientific studies from Russia say about vinegar).  Balsamic vinegar is by far the most delicious of all vinegars but it contains a substantial amount of lead, which is toxic.  The lead comes from the oak wood casks used in Italy to manufacture balsamic vinegar.  Distilled white vinegar is made from corn and is very low in lead.  French's Yellow Mustard, Worcestershire Sauce, Heinz Ketchup, and many other commonly consumed foods contain substantial amounts of distilled vinegar in their ingredients."
5.0	favorite especially for birthdays and of course the whole month of February.
5.0	My favorite bagged tea. I'm completely spoiled and won't drink anything else.
5.0	This IS great soup, especially if you want something meatless. My daughter LOVES it and eats for BREAKFAST almost every day!(she's not a kid) By the way, she also recommends the Italian Wedding soup...
5.0	We used these during Christmas time for a holiday treat.  If you like cinnamon these are a great k-cup.
5.0	A customer of mine recently bribed me with a package of this.... now I'm hooked! Jacobs has ruined all other coffees for me, but that's OK - for something this good it is beyond worth it!!<br /><br />Incredibly smooth, has an amazing flavor and isn't bitter. Add in a dash of peppermint creamer (the Girls Scouts Thin Mints or the York Peppermint Patty) and VOILA! you now have coffee sex, guaranteed to give you mouth-gasms!<br /><br />I just wish I had a local store to buy it from... *le sigh*
5.0	Excellent for sugar free..Very good  Root beer flavor, now it's not bursting with the flavor however, for sugar free it's pretty darn good...
5.0	I read all the reviews and was of a mixed feeling on ordering these, I had never purchased Medjool Dates and these are fresh moist and not too sugary sweet, I eat a couple of them when I feel like a snack and really enjoy them! Will order again for sure!
5.0	This maple syrup was delicious on my pancakes.  It was wonderful having it shipped to my door and not having to drive to the grocery store!  I will certainly buy it again.
5.0	I use this in a lot of different dishes but I LOVE using it on fried chicken! It is such a great multi-seasoning & has endless possibilities! I haven't found a food I can't use it on yet!!! :-)
5.0	perfect complement to my morning coffee!
5.0	Fresh, all in one big box! Yum
5.0	This is the best chicken stock you'll ever find without going to the trouble of making it yourself.  Could not recommend it any higher.
5.0	I've used Promax Protein bars for about 3 years.  GNC stopped carrying them - so I order them online now.  It's a good protein bar with a light amount of protein for those that like lean, flexible muscles.
5.0	I mix this syrup (Sugar Free Peach) with my glass of unsweetened tea for that peachy but not overpowering taste.  Great flavor but you can purchase the same size bottle from the Da Vinci site for less  money.  Might be a difference due to shipping costs but on the D site, this syrup is $7,99
5.0	[[VIDEOID:mo3M8QL8XA0PFJ6]]Manuka have has a very distinctive taste and this honey tastes like Manuka honey. Describing how something tastes is difficult but I will try... Manuka Honey has a very interesting undertone, almost slightly bitter (in a nice way, like a dark chocolate has bit of bitterness). The honey flavor is different for say Clover honey both in taste and texture. The taste is stronger and more complex.  I really like it.  This honey has a very nice aroma. The texture of the honey is thicker and darker in color. In the included video I use a spoon to demostrate the thick texture.<br /><br />This honey is 100% Manuka honey. Manuka honey comes from the white flowers of the manuka bush, a native bush to New Zealand. To be labelled mānuka honey, at least 70% of the honey pollen content should come from the manuka bush.<br /><br />Manuka honeys have ratings 5+, 10+, 15+, 20+ which indicate the level of Peroxide Activity. All honeys can be eaten but the ones with rating of 10+ can also be used for treating wounds and burns. The Manuka Honey in this listing is rated 5+ so it is not the rating recommended for treating burns and wounds.<br /><br />When I use honey in baking, I substitute half of the sugar with honey. Since honey contains liquid I reduce the recipe liquids by 1/4 cup for each cup of honey, I also add 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda for each cup of honey I use. I also reduce the oven temperature by 25 degrees Fahrenheit because honey browns more than sugar.<br /><br />To keep my honey tasting good for a long time I did some research on the best way to store honey. I found that recommendations are to store honey at room temperature. Refrigeration is not good for honey because it causes crystallization. If honey crystallizes warming the jar in warm water dissolves the crystals. To preserve the most of the flavor it is best not to microwave or boil honey if your goal is just to melt crystals. Warm water bath and stirring is the best way to get rid of crystals.<br /><br />Many thanks to Pacific Resources International for their request for a taste test and an honest review, be it positive or negative. I really like the unique flavor of Manuka honey and will be buying more when my jar runs out. I hope the attached video will give you a little better idea of this honey's texture.<br /><br />Ali Julia reviewrystals.<br /><br />Many thanks to Pacific Resources International for their request for a taste test and an honest review, be it positive or negative.

5.0	On auto ship. Family loves these.
5.0	Friends don't let friends drink flavored coffees!!!  LOL.  Royal Vinter: hmmmm. Simply the best combination of fine beans from around the world to achieve the best possible combination of body and aroma, with low acidity.  Gevalia rates this one as 4/5 on Intensity. 4/5 on Body and 3/5 on Acidity. It's truly a unique blend & eventhough Gevalia describes this as 'spicy', I didn't feel it to be overwhelming. I guess definition of spice/spicey varies from individual to individual.  In my opinion, there's probably nothing I would add nor subtract from the overall taste/aroma of this blend.  It is as close to perfection as the best cup of coffee can get.  I take my coffee french pressed with coffee mate & sugar. For those times when I feel over-indulgent, I take with Half & Half, but only when coffees tend to be a little stronger.     This is by far the best bang for the buck when it comes to gourmet coffees though you can get coffees from Gevalia for as much as $80/pound.   This Royal Vinter may seem over-priced when compared to grocery store blends.  However, this is one of the finest coffee names in the whole world - good enough to be appointed to his majesty the King of Sweden.  In actuality, you can spend $7 easily in Starbux and get one serving.  This in comparision is a great value considering you get over 30 servings for an 8 ounce brick (7grams for rounded Tablespoon/6oz Water) of Gevalia coffee.  From one coffee lover to the next, cheers!
5.0	love the flavor of this coffee and it tasted good even cold...
5.0	One of the best coconut waters. If you are looking for a healthy treat for your family, finally this is one. We enjoy  it's refreshing, good light flavor.
5.0	I use this on EVERYTHING - steak, eggs, hamburgers.  It is one seasoning I simply can't do without.  I used to be able to buy this at the grocery store, but when they no longer sold it, I did an Internet search.  Ordering 2 at a time, now.
5.0	I love being able to order this quantity for this price.  The coffee is very good and enjoyed by the staff.
5.0	Love the early morning taste of this tea. My tea with scones, starts my day.
5.0	There are my favorite! This is my 2-3p snack and I am satisfied until I get home for dinner. The fat content is 15g, but that is because of the almonds. The sugar content is only 6g. These are fantastic if you're busy and need something to take the edge off.
5.0	This was a good choice for what I need the item for.  Worked well, price is decent, seeds are strong in flavor/etc.  Not much else to say about something this simple...
5.0	Best whole wheat pasta available.
5.0	Atkins got it exactly right with this product. In my opinion this is far better than any other advantage product (or any other low carb bar for that matter). I wasn't really a big fan of the regular advantage bars, but I'm glad I decided to give the new Morning bars a chance. They are creamy, peanut buttery, with chocolate in the perfect combination. They are heavenly.
5.0	Excellent product to use in your coffee.  Mixes well and taste great.  I have been using this product for the last 5 years and the quality is consistent and the calories are few.  Highly recommend to anyone who uses cream or milk in their coffee.
5.0	The jar of spice arrived quickly and was well packaged for protection, and most important, the spice mix was wonderful and fresh! Will certainly order from USimplySeason agIn.
5.0	Sal's sauce takes me back to my college days in Rochester. This is a regional favorite that provides the perfect blend of sweet, savory and spicy to complement your fried chicken.
5.0	Wanted to try these brownies and I found them quite tasty. They were moist and we're individually wrapped.  Highly recommend them as a treat and source of fiber.
5.0	This is the best chocolate for holiday candy.  It melts smoothly and does not require any additives like shortening or paramount crystals.  Has excellent flavor.  Cheaper and better quality than other chocolate melts.  Highly recommend this great product!!
5.0	Love all the products from this company (everything is organic).  We put this cinnamon in our smoothies, on toast, bake with it.  It's wonderful!
5.0	Came today (soooo fast!)  DELICIOUS! I had to open and taste them---so fresh!<br />I'm trying to take better care of us....and this is one of the allowable foods in our quest to live Clean!
5.0	I loved these cookies when I first tried them, but found that in the humidity they will get soggy and gross if left open for too long.  Easily fixed with a Ziploc, but one time I tossed them in the fridge to keep them extra fresh.  That was when I fell IN love with these cookies.  When cold the creamy layers really hold up against the crunchy wafer and make a wonderful combination.  They are truly addicting.  Also, because we keep our entire house allergen free for my boys, these cookies are some that I can confidently serve when entertaining gluten-eating friends.  They often ask where they can get their own!
5.0	These are much higher quality than normal &#34;Bulk&#34; beans and are very reasonably for Organic. We use them to make Soy Milk and get great results. We eat the Okara in Pancake form and it's all very tasy.
5.0	Tasted great!!! Was pleasently surprised at how refreshing it was...not as sweet as other lemonades out there which i really enjoyed. Will be buying more!
5.0	First tasted pumpkin seed oil on a trip to Croatia.  They use it primarily for dipping bread in it;  I use it in place of olive oil in my favorite salad dressing recipe (pumpkin seed oil, organic tamari, lemon juice, and dijon mustard). Now all my friends who've tried my salad dressing use the same recipe.  Don't bother with the other, cheaper brands; I've tried them and they're really not good.  This one is delicious.  It's a dark green color, so don't splash it on your clothes.  Supposedly this pumpkin seed oil is good for your health;  don't know about that, but it is so good, who cares?
5.0	"What more can I say, this is the best candy bar I have ever had. Some have compared it to Butterfinger, but that's not a fair comparison, this is much much better.  Only downside is that it tends to crumble when trying to bite into it, so it's best to eat it over a napkin or plate so you can retrieve the pieces that \\""get away\\""  It reminds me of the Jerry Seinfeld episode where everyone started eating candy bars on a plate with a knife and fork.  Don't need a knife or fork with this, but a plate or something to catch the parts that crumble off (to avoid wasting them) is pretty much a necessity.  It is so good, that putting up with the crumbling isn't any kind of deterrent to enjoying this."
5.0	"\\""There is a garden overlooking the Yangtze River gorge where an elderly man contemplates his life while sipping a cup of Green Ginger. Perhaps you would like to join him.\\"" ~on each tea packet<br /><br />A friend sent me this tea and I've been in love with the slightly bitter flavor. It is quite exotic and fragrant. The ingredients are green teas, natural flavors, ginger and lemongrass.<br /><br />This tea begs to be blended with orange blossom honey.<br /><br />I've tasted many teas and this is by far the most exotic tea I've tried yet. This is pear ginger bliss.<br /><br />For more information on the myseries of Tazo Tea, read the review for the Tazo Assorted Teas.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review"
5.0	Can't get enough of 'em.  Also can't keep em in the house.  My wife also loves them.  Any my great grandson..  Highly recommended.
5.0	Without beating it to death - If you like a full bodied, but mellow brew this might be for you.  It is hearty, but not at all bitter.  It holds a nice full body, even when the Keurig is set to the oversize setting.  It's now my favorite blend.
5.0	Quite Delightful! This particular grape flavor was heaven-sent from our Cyborg Sugar Overlords from Planet X - there just isn't anything like it on earth!
5.0	Hard to fine in the stores, this was a life saver.
5.0	I love this alternative to conventional cornstarch!  When I found out they produce GMO corn to make bio-fuel, I was thinking... that's not good for us to eat, right??<br /><br />The product works well and food comes out smooth.  I gave some to my hard-to-please mother-in-law and she loves it too.  It passes the test!! Well worth the price.
5.0	Gotta love for once organic is cheaper than regular stuff! Lol I love this brand!
5.0	Takes to long to get them by regular mail but they are great
5.0	It's like eating steak in a bag. Flavorful and just the right tenderness. Most jerky taste the same but Desoto Gin has high quality flavor.
5.0	Great Product! thank you !!
5.0	This makes really very good pancakes.  It is a favorite of my youngest son who currently lives in Tokyo.  Now, I either have to ship it to him, or he takes some home with him when he comes to the US in the summer or for Christmas.  It would be nice if Amazon could ship this to Tokyo for me.<br />One of my daughters  has a very good recipe to make pancakes from scratch but I haven't yet  persuaded her to share it with me.  However in any event it is probably more time consuming and would not beat having the ingredients already mixed except for the egg, oil and buttermilk that one adds to this product.  I try to avoid using low fat buttermilk but nowadays all you often can find is those tasteless low fat or no fat products that serve to increase your appetite.  No wonder we are turning into an obese society.
5.0	I purchased these — as so many others did — for the bulk pricing. I am making orange/clove and lime/clove pomanders for the first time and didn't want to skimp on the quantity of cloves I used. This is a lot of cloves! But they are fresh, fragrant and just what I wanted . . . I will be using these for years to come (plan to vacuum seal what is left for the future).
5.0	Best prepackaged popcorn going. Just like theater  popcorn.
5.0	These taste really good, are pretty addictive. I have to say I like the combination of dark chocolate and almond butter.
5.0	The syrup is awesome. I use it to make vanilla latte, shakes, cream sodas and every other drink that has vanilla and sweet syrup in its recipe. It is very yummy! Will definitely buy more once I go through all the three large bottles :) .
5.0	Just picked up a box of these Promax energy/protein bars from my local discount nutrition store and they are great.   The only other all natural protein bars I was familiar with was the Clif brand's Builder bars. Being cheaper than the Clifs ($12/box vs. $18/box), I thought these Promax bars would not taste as good, but I was soon surprised after eating one. Good source of vitamins and minerals, and around 5g-30g-20g of fat-carbs-protein (about 280 calories per bar).    Bottom line is that these taste great and don't contain any artificial sweeteners or preservatives. And with flavors like peanut butter, mint chocolate chip, cookies and creme, etc. I may have just found my new favorite energy bar.
5.0	"The grownups in the house eat mostly gluten free, and I love this granola.  It is really filling and hearty, as well as being yummy.  I usually have it as cereal with almond milk.  It is wonderful on it's own, being \\""Really great\\"" rather than \\""Really great for gluten free\\"".  I don't feel deprived!  I feel nurtured.  It's definately worth a try, but you may find yourself addicted!"
5.0	These darn things are expensive, will be glad when someone comes up with a cheap knock-off or they become a part of subscribe and save.  The only flavor hat I didn't like was the peanutbutter cup and chocolate, yuk.  However, everything else is pretty edible.  I think I got lost in the strawberry, raspberry cream/cheesecake flavors-----all the same to me.  I've since been stuck on the chocolate chip cookie dough flavor, yum but I think it's time to move on to some on on chocolate flavor.  This is a great way to figure out what you like, splurge for yourself and your health.
5.0	I am the only coffee drinker in my house and I love a full-bodied blend. This is it. No added flavors; no hints of anything but good brewed coffee.
5.0	One of my favorite green mixes.
5.0	I found this seasoning on a recipe blog and it is my favorite spice for soups, fish, chicken, beef and veggies.  I bought 6 of them so I could share with my neighbor, daughter and coworker.  They also like it.
5.0	Good service and really good tea.  I enjoy it.
5.0	I saw this brand being used on a vlog I watch (Madrosed), and the pizzas always looked so good, not to mention their praise for Chebe. I decided I had to try it & I have been making pizzas almost daily! This is actually my 2nd shipment in 2 weeks. It's so easy to make, about 30 minutes including oven time. And the pizzas are better than any pizzeria in my town! Delicious!!!
5.0	Very good especially mixed with lemon and a little cinnamon.
5.0	When we got our Keurig, this was our favorite from the sample pack by far and the only one we continuously buy. Not that dirty dishwater taste that some lighter roast coffees have but also not a coffee that is going to put hair on your chest. Just the perfect medium. I would recommend buying in a store if you have the chance.
5.0	We bought this after reading about it on Dr. Sear's website. Our son has had no problems at all with the formula, we add brown rice syrup per our pediatricians recommendation (to add calories) Our son was a preemie, and was EBF for the first 7 months until stress from work affected milk production. Our son took to the goats milk right away, we mixed the first couple bottles with breastmilk until we knew he had no digestive issues with it, then were able to give him goats milk by itself. The goats milk smells and tastes better when warm than cold. I grew up on goats milk myself, so the taste doesn't bother me, but my husband isn't crazy about. Good thing our son loves it, because that's what really counts! It's 1/3 the cost of convential (cow's milk based) formula and is easier for tiny tummies to digest. It's a win-win all around!
5.0	Tastes fresh and delicious.  Can't wait to get more.  When I was in Iceland, I purchased the most amazing caviar and this is pretty close to what I bought there.  Can hardly tell the difference.
5.0	Bought for mom on mothers day and she loved them! She stated they where really chocolatey and great in coffee.
5.0	We've tried them all, artificial and natural. This is the by far the best!  Just wish I could get it in a bigger bag!  You don't even realize you're not eating/drinking sugar.  Made great muffins, iced tea, coffee, and even brownies!
5.0	Love these. Good clean ingredients that taste great together. Sweet but not to sweet.
5.0	If you aren't using this sauce for your ribs you are missing out. The perfect sauce for the perfect rib. Yum!
5.0	Do NOT put a loaf of banana bread in front of me or it WILL be gone!  I'm *that* much of a banana bread lover!  This White Post Farm banana bread is the stuff I've always admired the most, but I'm particularly fond of the homemade stuff too.  Seriously, an Amish store downtown was selling several loaves of banana bread in a giant bin.  I noticed them the moment I walked inside.  I nearly cried with excitement... and cried more when I came back a few weeks later and they were all gone. Banana bread is my best and only friend.  It just goes down my throat so well.
5.0	This healthful, tasty mix of garlic and rosemary will add lots of flavor to bland soups.<br />So, instead of dumping a lot of salt into soups, add this blend and ENJOY!
5.0	Have always loved this flavor, but could never find it at the store.  Now I have a good supply!!  Will purchase again
5.0	No idea how these taste - they are for a toddler birthday party.  They are so stinking cute, I cannot wait to add them to the gift bags.  :-)
5.0	I LOVE this product.  I frequently use k-cups, and I have tried many varieties of coffee, tea, and other hot drinks.  This is by far my favor k-cup of them all!<br /><br /> What sets this product apart are the &#34;froth packets&#34; that come in the box.  You simply tear open the packets and pour the froth powder into the bottom of your mug(before the coffee goes in).  Then, you use the k-cup as normal.  The end result is a very delicious and frothy cappuccino that could have easily come from a &#34;real&#34; coffee shop.<br /><br />While they are a bit pricey, I believe the cost is worth it for such a great product.  I would definitely recommend!
5.0	Great item but you can get this same box at costco for $9.99. Highly recommend these though!  Better than greasy potaoe chips anyday
5.0	Bought this as a test of hemp seeds, in general. I trust nutiva brand, have purchased their products before. Based on initial sampling, I think I will be buying more of their hemp seeds, to supplement my diet.
5.0	I put this In my coffee every morning  . When you get it; put in microwave for about 1 min. (with lid off. )stir until the oil at top is mixed in well. you can mix with chocolate to make candy<br />,etc.
5.0	"This is the best tasting mint green tea. After hearing so much about the health benefits of green tea, I want to drink more of it. I have always found straight green tea to have a bit of a \\""fishy\\"" taste but the mint really makes it taste much better."
5.0	"I found these at Big Lots - $1.50 for a 5 oz. bag of kettle cooked chips - no bargain, but they are very tasty and contain all natural ingredients.<br />The ingredients are:  potatoes, sunflower oil and/or corn oil, sugar, salt (270 mg), citric acid, natural flavors, parsley, spice, onion powder, lime oil and extractive of turmeric.  Of course, \\""natural flavor\\"" can mean many things.  These chips have an excellent salty and slightly sweet flavor.<br />Big Lots also has another variety with a dark orange label."
5.0	Am thrilled they sell this in the larger bottles!!  Have been drinking this (and other flavors) for some time now - no calories and a real thirst quencher!!
5.0	Nice roast, pleasant taste. No bitterness at all, very slight acidity. Makes wonderful crema'. Perfect coffee for any time of the day.
5.0	Product is awesome, but the size is too small
5.0	I had to give up my latte's and turn to tea instead. With this quality matcha I look forward to my afternoon macha latte as I ever did to coffee. So much better for you and a wonderful, high quality product.
5.0	I love love love these seeds. The bad is plentiful. and added to a bottle of water and shaken they are the best! I don't know if its true or all in my head, either way i feel more energized after a few days drinking these.
5.0	Big flavour, 1 teabag makes the tea strong enough for my 18 ounce travel cup.  This is a nice change from Earl Grey, similar falvour, but softer.
5.0	My first time brining a turkey for thanksgiving and WOW am i glad i did..it was a 26.5 lb turkey so I needed a bag large enough for this size turkey..it worked perfectly...brined it overnite in an ice packed cooler in our garage and cooked it thanksgiving morning..i couldnt believe how quickly it cooked.....4hrs and it was a perfectly browned, cooked SUPER MOIST turkey. It actually cooked so much faster than i anticipated that i had to keep it on warm in the oven for about 2 1/2 more hours..i was so worried it was going to dry out but it didnt...everyone remarked about how delicious and moist this turkey was. I will always use this bag for brining my thanksgiving turkey from now on!!!
5.0	Was very very delicious, just not enough.
5.0	This has been my favorite coffee for years.  But now I can buy it from my favorite place to shop.  So handy and right to my door.  I am a Medical traveler and to always have my coffee it a treat.  Thank you
5.0	I have used different coconut oils from the grocery store, but this brand is the best.  It smells like coconut, melts like a dream and comes in a convenient container.
5.0	Got tired of paying the high prices for small jars of peppercorns in the grocery store so decided to try these.  Quality is great and also a great value
5.0	Wow! What this does for potato dishes and fried chicken is wonderful and I'm sure I'll find other uses very soon. Highly recommend.
5.0	I love these healthy bars
5.0	Purchased as a gift for a bourbon lover! He's a hard guy to buy for but this worked out perfectly!
5.0	This is one of my favorite K-Cup coffees -- just right for my morning cup of java -- and no waiting.
5.0	yummy crackers and paleo too!
5.0	Probably the best bring kit I've used.  Simple instructions, great results.  I smoked a turkey breast and it was A-M-A-Z-I-N-G
5.0	It's Fiji and cheaper than the grocery store with Subscribe and Save.
5.0	I tried this because I saw an episode of America's Test Kitchen on PBS where they blind taste tested a variety of tortellini, including the fresh type you buy in the refrigerated section of the grocery store.  The results of the test was that the Barilla dry tortellini was hands down the best (I don't remember if it was the same filling as this).  As a result of that, I've been searching for it to try.  None of my local stores carried it, so I was happy to find it here.  The upshot: tried it tonight in a Tortellini Al Forno.  It was fantastic.  Will likely buy again.
5.0	Great soup - this is much better than most brands, and the size is &#34;hearty&#34; for a surprisingly nice meal.
5.0	The Near East Natural Pilaf is great for someone who lives alone.  It is fast to make, taste great and the extra servings I can put in the snack size bags and freeze them to use later.  My favorite is a stir fry with shrimp, but it goes great with any food.  Anne
5.0	I became familiar with this product when I lived in Switzerland. I use it primarily when making vinegarette salad dressing, but it is also wonderful for white sauce-based dishes, and any vegetable in place of salt.
5.0	I love this product. I savor each little bite. It's hard to find, it's often out of stock. I feel a bit panicky- I don't have that much left. The seller was great, the product came on time and in great condition.
5.0	A great comfortable tea
5.0	As many have stated in their reviews it is so hard to find in all of my local grocery stores!!!!  I don't understand why they took it off their shelves as it was originally well stocked in all the super markets that I shop.  So thrilled to have found it here on Amazon.  I ordered one case.  I sure hope McCormick doesn't discontinue this wonderful pepper.  I use it on steaks, chops, chicken,fish, vegies, salads and all the egg dishes that I make.
5.0	We have been getting whole bean direct coffee for awhile now, never disappointed we have gotten a few varieties it is always fresh and great tasting!
5.0	Really tasty. I boil water in the microwave at work and then I add the oats and dried fruits and yogurt.
5.0	I have not been a bh fan of Doritos many new flavors but the moment I tasted Flamas I was hooked! For the spicy lovers it gives you that and for the folks who love a little tang w/ their flame this for you! Good job Doritos! 5 stars!
5.0	Only broth stock that I can find that my daughter can use!!!! As she is gluten-free, dairy free, soy free, garlic free, tomato free!! Thanks
5.0	We love Illy coffee, and regularly use it in our espresso machine. We like the black can (espresso) the the green can (decaf) roasts, each in fine grind. Each cannister is vacuum-sealed and has a twist-lock top. It has a long shelf life if not opened, so feel free to take advantage of a good price and buy several cans at once.
5.0	I will never buy any other oats again! They are very smooth and taste wonderful! So happy to have found them!!!
5.0	As I have gotten older and my face drier, I am on a constant quest to find a good face cream. I have had limited success. Other creams may be good moisturizers, but they are heavy and greasy. Or else they have a strong smell. If a cream isn't heavy, it doesn't really moisturize my skin.<br /><br />Why I love this product:<br /><br />* It works without being heavy or greasy. It sinks in to my skin and leaves it feeling smooth and moisturized.<br /><br />* No scent. So many creams have heavy, cloying scents that really turn me off. Not so this product.<br /><br />* The Vitamin E in the cream. Vitamin E helps protect skin against the cell damage from sun and pollution. Who knows if that is really the case. All I know is that my skin looks better after using this product.<br /><br />* It's a great value. One jar lasts me almost a year.<br /><br />I highly recommend this cream to anyone wanting to have better looking skin.
5.0	I am quite pleased with this item.
5.0	This is great for a gluten, corn, soy and casein free cheesy cracker.  The orange color and spice mix really fools you into thinking you're eating a cheddar flavored cracker.  This is our replacement for goldfish crackers and cheesy chex mix.
5.0	These are by far the best pastel dinner mints I have consumed. Much better than your average $2 store-brand bags for a couple ounces. Unit price seems about the same, but these are much tastier and will last longer if you don't eat them like candy and kill a fifth of the tub the day it arrives. There are about 300 pieces (based on the nutrition facts) and the ingredients are simply sugar, peppermint, and coloring. I appreciate that it is made by an American company as well.
5.0	I love Celtic sea salt.  It is the only salt  I use!
5.0	Delicious and healthy
5.0	Love the montebello product line.  It tastes good, holds up nicely and is great with sauces.  My favorite pasta in the US.
5.0	Popcorn plus Flavacol plus coconut oil with clarified butter on top equals yummy goodness! I bought this salt for myself and I don't even make popcorn that often. It is so worth it.
5.0	This maca is just delightful! It smells and tastes so delicious and makes me feel so good! The best part of this product is the hand written letter by the couple that makes this product. That is the kind of thing I am looking for when buying anything! I was very very pleasnatly surprised I got such a nice letter espeically since I ordered this through Amazon. These people are amazing and I will definitely be ordering from them all the time now. Thank you!!!!
5.0	I haven't used much this time yet. But if this is the same stuff I had last time, it is good.  Thank you for good service as well.
5.0	We keep ordering it and ordering it!
5.0	Ordered this to take on a trip.  Very neat, just add<br />hot water and eat.  This was a good deal to have<br />with us and not have to eat every meal out.
5.0	As far as I'm concerned, this is one of the best sugar-free chocolates available.  I love that it is sweetened with Stevia as this  is my favorite sweetener.  The chocolate is good quality, and even though, as are all chocolates, it's high in calories, it is very satisfying and is a nice treat with a small amount.  I haven't tried it yet in S'mores but have a feeling it would work well.  Now if someone would make a stevia sweetened marshmallow​, I would be very happy.
5.0	Neither one us likes strong coffee! We find the balance of coffee and chocolate raspberry to be quite delicious. Highly recommend this one!
5.0	Thought we would start a new tradition.  It was a hit!
5.0	I love this stuff in the summertime. Quick and easy to make and far cheaper than getting it at a coffee stand. Try the Coffee mix. You won't be disappointed.
5.0	This is the same as my other reviews.  I am unable to purchase where I live so am appreciative I can usually find it on Amazon.  I get bunches when it is available as it is my drug of choice. hehe  I have told my friends and have even ordered them things from time to time.  So I have spread the word so if they have something they are having trouble finding they look here too, Thank you Amazon.
5.0	Taste so good and fast delivery
5.0	I love the taste. It is a mild flavor but I enjoy mild better then the darker versions. I order this on subscribe and save.
5.0	These are spicy, with loads of flavor. Great size for a quick lunch. Love the packaging, tear off the metal  lid and cook with the plastic one.
5.0	This was very soothing when I had laryngitis so I think you'll find it this is a nice product for you to use I will always keep some in my cabinet
5.0	Great stuff! You don't need too much to steep because it is a strong tea! Good price for the amount too!
5.0	The teabags came much quicker than originally scheduled.  The box was wrapped in beautiful paper and arrived from Ireland without any damage at all.  The tea steeps wonderfully and I am never disappointed with Barry's!
5.0	We love our Keurig coffeemaker; it's convenient, makes great coffee, and we don't waste partial pots of coffee. But sometimes keeping a lot of cups around feels like stockpiling supplies for the apocalypse. These cups are great! They take up less space in our cupboard, the coffee tastes great, and there is less waste for us to throw away.
5.0	I like both Zack's  dill pickle and the regular.These are the best sunflower seeds Ive ever had and Big Lots quit carrying them!! Now I am so addicted!!
5.0	Low calorie snack that tastes great.  I am not sure how nutritious it is given that it's only 40 calories but it helps me in times I am craving food out of boredom
5.0	A pleasant tasting Earl Grey when brewed in our pod coffee/tee maker.
5.0	Good tasting, no after taste.  Satisfies the sweet tooth without sugar.
5.0	Bought this to make some New Orleans Black Muffins.  I had some Brer Rabbit molasses in the cupboard and did a side-by-side taste test.  What a difference!  The Golden Barrel is clean, smooth, rich.  The Brer Rabbit has a harsh metallic aftertaste.  Gonna feed the Brer Rabbit to my horses, they aren't as picky as I am.
5.0	These are great for at work, just pop the instant bag in for a minute then make your coffee. This is the best tasting coffee. It's easy to make without a mess.
5.0	Outstanding. Very fresh tasting and delicious. An interesting aside: I bought them hoping they would have a laxative effect similar to Haribo sugar free gummy bears (as sometimes the only way you can get those up here is for a 30 dollar five-pound bag). I was pleased to discover that they have the same effect but are much milder. And they taste much better than the Haribo bears, in my opinion.
5.0	I'm a vegan and I like to hike. I also do not like granola bars, so for me this was a delicious and worthwhile investment. It's food that can be eaten quickly or savored, it is well packaged, and the company is reputable. I was impressed by the food's quality and how filling it was. I would recommend it to anyone whose idea of trail snacks is not candy and beef jerky.
5.0	I love this stuff - you can't always find it in the shops and it's expensive, so this is a great price. What's more amazing - my 6 and 10-y-old kids, who are the absolute pickiest eaters, have decided they love it, too. It's ideal for travel and camping, but I keep a few packs in the car for when they are really hungry and grumpy and I need a lot of nutrition in a little bit of time.  I also love the pepper, but the kids won't eat anything spicy. I took a packet of this camping and shared it with friends - kids and adults - and all six people wanted more (but we ran out) - so it appeals to a variety of tastes.  This is chewy and textured and dry like regular jerky (tho not quite as hard). The seasoning is strong but not at all overwhelming - a hint of smokiness, saltiness, tasty. Some tofu jerky's are moist or even wet, but this is not. Each packet has  8-10 little round pieces, about the size of a thick half-dollar.   I'm online reordering, b/c my kids begged me to. Normally, their favorite food is mac and cheese. I'm thrilled they want this. So do I. It's a treat.
5.0	I was skeptical when I saw this, but wanted to give it a shot due to the good ingredients.  I was completely surprised and extremely happy to discover this.  I will never look at a normal vess tonic and gin the same.  Close running to be my favorite cocktail and highly recommend!
5.0	Every time i visited India, I would bring some peanuts for friends and family. Although all appreciated the Virginia Peanuts, the Indian Peanuts have their distinctive and (for us) superior taste; it is sure nice that when the Indian Grocery stores run out ( and that happened yesterday) these peanuts can be ordered from Amazon.
5.0	This pasta is fabulous!  Great tasting and easy to make.  The price was great too!  I would highly recommend this item.
5.0	Bought as a gag gift so not sure how it tastes....lol
5.0	Works much better in my Breville espresso machine then Lavazza espresso pods. Has a slower draw which makes it much richer tasting. Lavazza pods pull a shot in just a few seconds for a weaker shot. If you have a Breville 800ESXL CXafe Borbone is the way to go.
5.0	Thank you. Good price…good product…great service.
5.0	Good value for the money with super speedy shipping
5.0	We received this as a housewarming gift from a friend, who is from the Big Island. We have our espresso roast custom blended, so we are a little bit coffee snobby. This coffee on its own is yummy, but when made 1/2 Kona and 1/2  our espresso roast - it makes me want to sing a song on first sip. The smell just oozes out of the bag and will put a smile on your face. Darn, now I am totally hooked on ordering this as a pantry staple :)
5.0	GREAT STUFF NO REALLY THIS IS SO GOOD
5.0	I'm a member of Crowdtap’s JOHNSON’S® Baby Partners, and JOHNSON’S® sent me a sample of its JOHNSON'S® oil gel with shea & cocoa butter to review. After using Johnsons Oil gel with Shea and cocoa butter on both myself and child I am really in love with this product. I used to stay clear of other baby oils becuas eof how greasy it left skin and if you got some on their hair it looked very oily. Since this is a gel it didnt leave that greasy oil feeling. It left our skin feeling soft and mosturized. The scent is light and clean and doesnt leave you smelling like your wearing a baby product but still light enough for baby! Both my daughter and I have very sensitive skin and this did not cause any reactions to our skin! Definitely a great product for both babies and adults!
5.0	Nice yummy cold or hot!! Light and not heavy on the tummy! Add a little whipped cream and you are all set!
5.0	This is the best addition to any dish ever.  It adds flavor from mild to very hot depending on amount applied.  The best part is it doesn't change the flavor profile of the dish as much as a hot sauce would.  I am going to be getting more of this before they change the recipe.  Blairs has done it again!!
5.0	Very good, reliable bean. The price fluctuates, so I keep my eye on it for my subscription and buy low! It's much cheaper than many other espresso whole beans and the quality is great, so it's my go-to bean.
5.0	I have gotten these twice, love them.
5.0	This has nice texture and flavor.  My favorite pancake mix of all so far.  I also just made waffles with it and it makes wonderful waffles.
5.0	That is good tea. Love the smell and taste. This is the second time I have use Harvy and Son, love the brand.
5.0	I have used this coffee for at least three years now. It is smooth with a pleasant taste. No bitterness. I'll be drinking Diedrich Colombian until I find some better coffee - but I doubt that.
5.0	****UPDATE 9/05/15****<br /> STILL #1 KEURIG COFFEE!!!!<br />  Brooklyn Beans coffee is still the household's favorite coffee.  I personally enjoy Maple Sleigh, Breakfast Blend, and Express-O.  Each coffee pod has it's own unique experience, and it tastes like it should; delicious coffee!  Some Keurig pods taste chemical or bland; not so with Brooklyn Beanery Keurig K-Cup pods!  These are delicious and a real treat.<br /><br />****UPDATE 3/21/15****<br /><br />The variety pack I received most recently had a new flavor, black and white cookie!  Each coffee still stayed true to form; taste was superb, each coffee lived up to it's name/style, and Brooklyn really knocked 'er outta the park with this new flavor!<br /><br />This variety pack is hands-down the best value for the best tasting coffee I have ever had!  I  was surprised at the variety of flavors, and each one offers something new and interesting from the others.  They are all very tasty so far, provide a great caffeine kick (I don't do Decaf so I cannot rate those), and are true to their names.  As a Yooper from the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, I was pleasantly delighted to see a maple coffee: Maple Sleigh!  DELICIOUS!  Keep the price where it's at, and you will have a lifelong customer in me.  I can never go back to any other coffee, this is just as good if not better than getting coffee from a barista!<br /><br />TASTE: They are all excellent.  Some reviewers stated &#34;watered down&#34;, but I have not found this to be true.<br /><br />Value:  40 K-Cups for a great price, I am pleased with the pricing of Brooklyn Beans coffee.<br /><br />Overall:  Brooklyn Beans coffee is a treat.  I look forward to having it in the morning, ten minutes later, etc.  It's that good to me.  And with the K-Cup Variety, as well as my own additions (I use a lot of cinnamon), it's always new!
5.0	"This is the oatmeal my father's family regularly sent us from Puerto Rico when I was a child, and boy am I happy to have found a way to buy it myself all these years later. Even if you haven't taken any Spanish language classes you can probably pick out that \\""avena instantanea\\"" is, in fact, \\""instant oatmeal,\\"" and Quaker is, of course, Quaker. The same brand you see every time you walk down the cereal aisle in your grocery store. Yet this oatmeal is substantively different from the oatmeal you can buy in Illinois. It's smoother somehow, creamier. I've purchased many varieties of American Quaker oatmeal and cooked it in the method that I learned as a girl, but it is not the same. It does not make a bowl of \\""Puerto Rican oatmeal,\\"" as my sister and I came to call it. This, however, does.<br /><br />If you grew up in the Caribbean and have tried to reproduce the oatmeal of your youth, here it is. If you have no idea what I'm talking about but you like oatmeal, give it a shot. I like to cook it with skim milk (and a splash of half and half, as the milk fat makes it creamier), then dump cinnamon and blueberries into it so I can feel all smug about my healthful breakfast. Delicious!"
5.0	"I've been using the Pamela's Baking and Pancake Mix for years and absolutely love it.  I have found this to be a wonderful substitution to convert \\""regular\\"" recipes to be gluten free.  I've been pretty successful for a 1:1 substitution of the mix in most recipes, but make reductions to the baking soda/baking powder and guar/xantham gum mix if using it in a GF recipe that also has that included.  I can't recommend this mix enough!"
5.0	I bought the vanilla flavor.Taste good. Great to carry in your lunch bag or purse.
5.0	"These noodles have always been my favorite. They are \\""light\\"" in chew and taste. I have tried others through the years and when I found I could purchase them here I was thrilled. I make my tuna fish and noodles with them and even my daughter-in-law who was reluctant to try them with these noodles says these are much better."
5.0	Best tasting almond butter ever, and the price is right.  I recommend this brand.
5.0	I love this flavor.  Just the right amount of blueberry flavor.
5.0	Easy to make, minimal packaging so it stores and travels easily and tastes great! Great price for 3 boxes.  It was much easier to order this as I have a hard time finding it in local stores.  Definitely recommend it!
5.0	I have to drink this, and it is not bad.  It's not real milk, but it doesn't taste horrible either.
5.0	I first was introduced to this cheese spread in the Go Picnic lunch packs. I loved it so much I ordered it directly without the picnic lunches.
5.0	I really love the gum! its tasty and are good for your teeth.
5.0	Came out better than we thought
5.0	This is a must..trust me! Snappy has made it pure and cheap! People never believe me when I tell them that there is no butter on my popcorn, all it is is coconut oil, flavacol and popcorn! This lasts our family of 4 quite a while too, you dont have to use very much. At a 1/3C every use its a no brainer at this price!
5.0	Great product and I can't find it at any store in my area.  I was glad to find it online.
5.0	this stuff is great. tastes better than soy and its g m o free. Cant go back to soy after using this its too good
5.0	I love this stuff. I wish i could get like a case but its not cheap. I get them for my nephews to take to school.
5.0	Just like the headline says. Pure nostalgia.
5.0	Fast delivery and they arrived fresh - yummy little fish ;-)
5.0	Came quickly in a well shrink-wrapped six pack. The juice is good, appropriate pure passionfruit flavor, compares favorably to the fresh passion fruit I have had in Hawaii, but lacking obviously the crunch of the seeds and clingy pulp (could be a plus or a minus).<br /><br />Makes decent passionflower juice when diluted (thought for good reason, only the brave drink straight passionflower), can be mixed with other juices, or delicious poured onto deserts as a sort of syrup... or mixed with something to thicken it, like cream.
5.0	Yummy! Nice heathier snack  for the mid afternoon workday.
5.0	Have used once to replace Tenderquick in a cured pork recipe. It allowed me to reduce the salt level in the final product and still have the degree of cure I wanted. Also, it eliminated the nitrate, which was in Tenderquick but not in this product, and was not needed in this curing method.
5.0	I was pretty impressed by this pancake mix.  I'm always looking for high fiber products and some don't seem to taste as good as I would hope.  This mix on the other hand, was great.  The pancakes turned out nice and fluffy.  I'd definitely buy it again.
5.0	These bars taste wonderful and only have 190 calories. That's great considering all of the nutrients they contain and how healthy they are. Great for dessert or a snack anytime of the day or maybe even breakfast. Oh yea, you can't beat the price. Can't wait to order another box!
5.0	I picked up this gum because it was inexpensive and I needed some gum to keep in the car. I ended up really liking this gum. It has a strong flavor that does act as a good breath freshener. And the flavor lasts as long if not longer than other brands.<br /><br />The container is big and non-flexible compared to other gums, which might be an issue if you want to carry this in your pocket (it won't work). But I keep the container in my glove compartment and being larger makes it easy to grab without having to scrounge around to find it.<br /><br />Overall, I was surprised how much I like this product. I'l definitely buy again.
5.0	I dislike the taste of regular coconut water and I am not a big coffee person, but I LOVE these! They are so smooth and I like that it is all natural ingredients. It does give you some energy too. They really are delicious! I tried heating one up today, to have with my breakfast, but I would not recommend that. It tastes much better cold.
5.0	Big fluffy popped kernels.  My favorite
5.0	I purchased and baked these when my newborn was 2 weeks old.  I was searching for assistance with increasing my milk supply as we initially had to supplement with formula due to our daughter's high billirubin level.  Not only did I witness an increase in my milk supply but I also enjoyed the flavor of the cookies.  My husband did as well as evidenced by the consumption of the entire batch, between the both of us, in less than a week.
5.0	"This tofu is delicious.  I use it for many things, blended for a cream soup, is my favorite!  I also blend it to make \\""creamed spinach or broccoli\\"",  you'd never know.  I like that the product doesn't need to be refrigerated until opened."
5.0	This could easily become an expensive addiction. Loved the smell, the taste, everything. Took some to work and got everyone rolling on a caffeine buzz. While years of Jolt cola and Monster has rendered me immune to caffeine, they all seemed to be moving.<br />Buying again, and again, and again.
5.0	This is the best strawberry jam ever.  We've tried all the gourmet brands as well as homemade jams from the farmers market but this beats them all by a mile.  It tastes less like sugar and more like ripe strawberries.  The texture is also better because the fruit is puréed so it spreads smoothly.  AND it's organic. :-)
5.0	Nice and sour, like a warhead, but it keeps the sourness almost throughout the entire candy.... not just a sour, powdery coating.
5.0	I purchased this cheese and fruit basket for a friend who was recovering from spinal surgery, and they loved it.  It was delivered when promised, and my friend and his wife couldn't say enough about how good it was, and how it lifted their spirits.  THANKS MUCH!
5.0	Awesome gum.  I order it by the boatload
5.0	"After eating two oat bran muffins every day for a couple years, I became so sick of them that it became difficult to choke them down.  After becoming fond of Jamba Juice(tm) smoothies, it occurred to me that Oat Bran was the ideal \\""Fibre Boost\\"", and I developed the following recipe, which I consume daily as maybe 50% of my entire diet! (The odometer on my K-Tec blender currently reads 2267).  At 66 grams per day, a 50lb bag of Honeyville Oat Bran lasts just about a year, so keep it in airtight container! I mix 2 parts Oat Bran to one part hulled hemp seed (Nutiva organic) and keep the mixture in 1/2 gallon (1kg) mason jars in the freezer.  Then I add 100 grams of the mixture into the blender along with the rest of the ingredients.    Rick's Anti-cholesterol Oat & Hemp Smooothie Recipe:    Add the following ingredients to your blender:  (a digital scale makes it easy!)    1 cup plain lowfat yogurt (225 grams) (refrigerated)  1 cup soy milk (Vanilla flavor suggested) (241 grams) (refrigerated)  1/2 cup (66 grams) oat bran (frozen)  1/4 cup (33 grams) hulled hemp seed (frozen)  1 sliced up banana (frozen)  2 Oz (50 grams) frozen orange juice concentrate    In a bowl, weigh out 300 grams of frozen berries (Strawberries, raspberries, mixed berries, peaches, whatever)    Start up the blender, and gradually add in the frozen fruit as it is assimilated into the mixture.  When smooth and frosty like a milk shake, you're ready!"
5.0	This is the best brown basmati rice I've had. It's easy to cook but takes me longer than the 15-20 minutes called for in the directions.
5.0	good sprouting rate, this is a mix, and to my surprise they grow rate is similar and taste fantastic with salads and on sandwiches, yummy!
5.0	Great healthy snack option for when you are on the go. Especially if you get tired of always eating a bar. These are a staple in our house.
5.0	Loose tea is not the most convenient, but I feel it is the most satisfying. This tea fills the bill.
5.0	Excellent value and tastes really good. It is actually a fruit and not a grain.
5.0	"Ok, yes, I USED to work for Gharardelli and that's how I ended up trying this chocolate years ago.  I picked up a bag the other day on a whim to help my sweet craving while on a diet - one piece a day.  I forgot how lovely this chocolate is! One piece can be savored for 15 minutes because the flavor of each small nibble can last for several minutes.  The experience is super smooth on the tongue (not grainy at all as someone mentioned. If that happens, the chocolate must have been in a batch that wasn't temp controlled and it \\""bloomed.\\"") With this chocolate you'll experience a tangy, fruity flavor that floods the mouth leaving your chocolate craving fully satisfied.  Delightful!"
5.0	I got these during a snapchat deal for a discounted price from Amazon. It was amazing while it lasted. :)
5.0	Spicy, and crackly with pop rocks. I like the subtle smokiness of the chipotle.  I can't wait for this item to become available!
5.0	I have used this product in the past, but I have not been able to find it locally.  It is great for gravies and also in gumbo.
5.0	Just what I expected, and great service.
5.0	It's too bad I can't buy Coach's Oats from Costco anymore, but I'm glad they're easily available on the Web.  It's a great product that's been a weight-reducing staple of mine for more than 6 years.  Like a nervous twitch, as soon as my present bag is half-empty, I reorder for fear I might wake up one morning and find the cupboard bare.  Addictive?  Possibly.  Okay; I'm hooked!  This is not a bad thing.
5.0	Dear Dr. Oz said good things about this rice so I decided to try it.<br />It tastes great, especially mixed with Sesame Seeds and Chicken.<br />I have bought this Rice several times now.
5.0	Best Bloody Mary mix you will ever have no need to search anymore!!!
5.0	Delivered on time, great gift, about right for the price. I recommended it to my friends, fresh fruit, cheese and nuts.
5.0	THESE ARE TRULY THE BEST!!! BUY THESE!!!
5.0	This coffee is similar to the Donut House K-Cup--for a fraction of the price & a fraction of the waste.  The design of the cup is really clever, drastically cutting down on the plastic needed per cup.  I looooove these so much that I would still use them even if they were the same price as the traditional K-cups, so the cost savings is just a fabulous bonus.
5.0	We've always bought Maple Chipotle sauce, and really liked it for flavor, etc.  We decided to branch out and try Bourbon Molasses Barbecue sauce.  Wow!  Really great flavor.  We'll mix it up and have two favorite sauces now.
5.0	Fantastic value for a very high quality saffron. I was amazed with the aroma, it's very strong, yet balanced, not too grassy. Best buy I found on saffron!
5.0	I keep a few of these in the diaper bag for my boys.  Both the baby and the toddler.  They both love them and these are their first choice for a snack if we are out.  The toddler I can just open and hand it to and he'll suck it all out.  The baby is starting to get the hang of sucking it so I don't need to squeeze it.  No spoon, no mess, easy snack, and no added sugar or high fructose corn syrup!!
5.0	My hands can't stay out of the bag. This company is missing out on revenue by not making this a product in the store on an annual basis.  It should not be seasonal.
5.0	It is taste is smilar milk chocolate.No allergy. Taste is good. We love it. The child love it. Perfect. She is happy
5.0	I have never tasted something so buttery on my tongue.  Melts better than any other cheese I have eaten.  Worth at least a try, you have never tasted anything so delicious.  I bet you buy another!
5.0	This is my favorite brand, better than the Paul Neuman.
5.0	As someone who can't have any soy products, Glee Gum is a God send! I've loved every flavor I've tried.
5.0	Used to make capresse with fresh basil and tomatoes, wonderful. Fresh and cold on arrival. Worth buying if unavailable in your area.
5.0	These give me a great boost when I need it.  I buy the tangerine and mint flavors, and am happy with both.
5.0	I have been looking for dried fruit that is unsulphered and with no sugar added, then I found this brand and I decided to purchase. I was pleasantly surprised by the taste. The colour is a little off putting since the majority of the mangoes were a little dark. But the taste is great and just sweet enough. I would recommend anyone not wanting a no sugar added and unsulphured dried fruit brand.
5.0	These are weird, funny looking, paper thin, made out of seaweed.... I shouldn't like these, but I do.  I can't explain it, I ate an entire box (and the whole thing was 60 calories).   Now, I wasn't full or anything, but it is a cruncy spicy flavor that is very different.
5.0	I used it to make mizo soup and it taste great
5.0	I love this coffee.  Full bodied and smoky.  Strong enough to get me going in the morning and very satisfying so one cup will do the trick.
5.0	Delicious clotted cream fudge, delightfully smooth, lovely clotted cream flavor -- about as good as it gets!  Thank you for making this wonderful stuff available to us!
5.0	I was skeptical at first about a 'sugar free chocolate' but so glad I tried these. The flavor and texture is deep and rich, definitely is some of the best chocolate I've ever had. Will buy again!
5.0	"This is our G-F go-to \\""flour\\"" for baking.  We use it for muffins, for pancakes and waffles, for pie crust, cookies and more.  It makes gluten-free baking easy and delicious and our wheat loving family and friends don't know/care that they're eating G-F.  This works just fine when substituted in our old favorite \\""wheat flour\\"" recipes.  It's a little pricey but has become our favorite brand, worth the cost because it doesn't disappoint.  Buying by Amazon subscription is a bargain."
5.0	I enjoyed it. I was looking for a cheaper alternative to Blenheim. It's a ginger ale but not Blenheim. That, being said, it is a tasty drink in its own right and I support anyone's trial of this drink.
5.0	I think this is one of the better tasking, healthy microwave popcorns out there. I keep it at work for the munchies and with me in the hotel while I'm traveling. As a whole, I prefer air popped to microwave but when I need microwave I do think this is one of the better choices out there. BTW, I have found with this, as with other microwave popcorn brands, that it helps if you heat a glass of water first in the microwave to warm it up (about a minute) and then put the popcorn in. I find the same thing with my hot air popper - I let it run for a minute or two to get hot then I add in the popcorn.
5.0	Delicious and fresh!  Shipping was fast.  If you like these, this is a better option than trying to find a brick & mortar store that carries them.
5.0	I was very pleased with both the taste and texture of these One Organic Seaweed Sheets.<br /><br />When making sushi, it was very easy to work with and didn't disintegrate before I had a chance to finish the roll like some other brands I've tried. The texture stayed firm but not too chewy. No dissolving in the mouth. My kids like to eat them as whole sheets. I have even taken to packing them in their lunched, folded up into ziploc bags. Their friends think they are nuts. However, the taste is not too heavy and the roasting makes all the difference. I was surprised they weren't more salty but thankful that they weren't.<br /><br />I will but these again! I was given this package to try and then honestly review. I am so glad I did!
5.0	This is an amazing product.  I was loyal to Nutiva coconut oil for years, but we're stationed overseas and can't get it shipped to an APO address any more.  The Viva Labs coconut oil is perfect for both cooking and skin care needs.  It has a nice, subtle flavor that we use for everything from stir frying, topping popcorn, diaper rashes, and hair masks.  We go through a container every few weeks, so the price on this is perfect.
5.0	One of the best new products on the market.
5.0	bit pricy, but great to have around in addition to bottle water.  surprisingly this has a lot of vitamin C in it... so it's good for you too!
5.0	These come very fresh and of course are delicious. Love them.
5.0	This is a very good product and the six and twelve packaging delivers it at a great price point.  Will definitely continue to order as I have in the past.
5.0	THE TEA IS AMAZING, CURVES APPETITE, PROMOTES WEIGHT LOSS AND WORKS GREAT FOR MANY HEALTH ISSUES/BENEFITS!!!  ADD FRESH LEMON TO YOUR WATER FOR AN ADDED BOOST OF WEIGHT LOSS. RESEARCH FURTHER OR ORDER &#62; TOTALLIFECHANGES.COM/5027791
5.0	I have a chronic cough and I like to suck on these when I am around people.  It just helps cut done the cough a little and taste great.
5.0	Love the oriental flavor udon. I actually make stir fry<br />With this. Onions and stir fry mixed veggies and i add this<br />Noodles plus soy<br />Sauce it taste really<br />Good.
5.0	My spouse is on South Beach Diet and loves these.  I portion them out in ziplock bags( 15 nuts each) and they are grab and go.  Lots of protein, some fat and very little carbs.  Fresh and tasty.
5.0	as long as you cook them fast and a few at a time, they are delicious!! they do get mushy if cooked too long..
5.0	These were gone within a week.  The kids love having these in their lunch because its like they have their own bowl of soup at school.  The wife loves these because she can pack them in about five seconds.  Overall these make for a far more convenient experience than the traditional experience of a can of soup.  They are similar to regular chicken noodle soup so no surprises there which is nice.
5.0	Three boys said &#34;these brownies are awesome!&#34;  My wife and I agree - nothing wrong with these at all.  As a family, we're not really into health food too much, and we don't have any food allergies, so we just tried them to see if they are good.  And they are! They're pretty simple and straightforward regular old brownies, but they don't have all sorts of strange ingredients.  I noticed they are pretty spendy, but this is a quality product!
5.0	I am on a low calorie diet. I eat soup until it is comming out my ears. Eros Pista - I love hot sauces if they have flavor - is the best addition to soups that I have ever tasted. I can't get enough of it.
5.0	For the dark chocolate and coconut lover, this does the trick... I order this once a year.  Recommend to ALL.
5.0	I can't imagine there being anything bad about Necco Wafers. They are a life long favorite!
5.0	McCormick Granulated Garlic is THE ONLY BRAND I USE. No other granulated form even comes close for flavor and consistency. I use it in almost every dish, sauce, and most meats. If I cannot have quality fresh garlic, it's GOT to be McCormick's Granulated Garlic.
5.0	Yummmmm!!!  Amazing flavor!!
5.0	I stumbled upon Fog Chaser while searching for single serve coffee. I ordered a box, and this coffee quickly reached the top level of my favorites list! The biodegradable feature of the one cups and the responsible and fair practices of the Rogers Family Company make it even better! The one cups work perfectly in my Keurig brewer!
5.0	I had heard of Tiny Footprint Coffee while doing a project at the Carlson School of Management.  I love their mission and their coffee is great too!
5.0	I had talked with my sister many times about Chef Paul Seasonings and how good they made everything taste.  I finally ordered for her birthday- a variety pack of seasonings to try. Made a nice gift.
5.0	"Tastes great and powder disolves with no problem. I no longer drink soda of any kind or caffeine. Just wish the powder was easier to find and more \\""green\\"" - would be great if they sold it in tubs with a scoop."
5.0	The best coconut oil I have ever tried, and it is such a great price. I would recommend this to anyone who is wanting to cook with coconut oil for an healthier option.
5.0	This stuff is great! One dash goes a long way! Great with muddled strawberries, agave syrup, and seltzer! Or any other fruit juice spritzer.<br />I tried some of this at a friends house. Went home and wasted my money on a cheaper extract that had only 10% the flavor. Blech! I should have bought Scrappy's from the get go. Accept no substitutes. Can't wait to try the lavender next.
5.0	I love these cookies. I am a fitness junkie and this is one of my few indulgences. However, considering how low the calorie count is compared to other popular boxed brands and the avoidance of unhealthy ingredients; someone concerned about health and fitness can eat them in moderation with no regrets. I know I have never experienced a set back in my fitness program even when having these occasionally.
5.0	I bought this tea on a whim when I found it on clearance at my local grocery store. I cannot even begin to explain how amazing it is. I make an earl grey tea latte every morning, and this is a lovely change from my normal earl grey. The lavender is very subtle and absolutely delicious with just a tad of sweetener. This is now my favorite earl grey, and I will definitely be stocking up on Amazon when I'm done with my current box. This stuff is a great start to my day and I absolutely love the aroma in the morning.
5.0	It's rare for me to enjoy a cup of coffee without need of heavy cream and sugar but this stuff definitely satisfied my craving. With just a splash of creamer, I was ready to take a mug of to-go and enjoy another beautiful winter day.
5.0	great tasting tea and great service
5.0	I was very happy with the flavor of this jam, I will order again because of the Health benefits of this product.
5.0	Hard to find in my area; great way to get it.
5.0	Be prepared for lots of compliments and questions concerning your Salt Lamp.  I love mine, I have it in my office.
5.0	These were  a good amount for a fair price. It is hard to find good gum balls for our gumball  machine.
5.0	Fast shipping!! Great value 😄
5.0	Goes wonderfully with anything Fish, Cheese or Beef!!  Tip - try it in a simple sandwich of shredded Cheddar and tomatoes on wheat bread spread with pure creamery butter (the kind Betsy the Cow had something to do with).  Enjoy!!!
5.0	Excellent Coffee, good taste, aroma, etc.<br />Pat N.
5.0	love the cereal and on our packages, we bought 5 cases and there was some issue with the expired date (only 3 months).  when i contact Amazon team they got our issue resolve in less then 3 hours.  GREAT JOB, Amazon.
5.0	Some dried vegetables seem to lose some flavor but these green beans are the opposite. They're very tasty. I use them for a dry snack. Same with most of the Mother Earth products
5.0	This stuff is great for making any kind of chili. I've used with beef as well and lentils and either way you get a unique Texas chili flavor. The quality is excellent and unchanged over the years.<br /><br />I have modified recipes over time to include sautéed onions, garlic,  diced tomatos and roasted red peppers to keep things interesting.
5.0	Powerade Zero is my go to for the gym. This is my alternative to water when I want something to hydrate with. I love the mixed berry flavor, wish they sold the 32 oz bottles for a better deal.
5.0	I am so pleased I bought the Mr. Coffee Keurig and the K cups as well. The single cup size is just about perfect for us.
5.0	These bars are amazing.  Very filling. Just hard to believe they could be gluten free as they taste just like a blueberry muffin.
5.0	I was pleased to find I could order this product here as I first found it on a trip back home (England) Even though it is expensive I am willing to pay the price for a decent cup of instant coffee.
5.0	product was seemingly unwashed and it yielded a product that got the nod from all my peers.  Earthy taste with nutty aroma and when washed a ton of debree.
5.0	This soup is very good and has excellent nutritional value.  It is easy to prepare. I just wish it was cheaper.
5.0	They are delicious and goes with just about anything.
5.0	Best gravy mix I ever used.
5.0	Add a little Chambord and it is fantastic on ice cream, waffles, etc!
5.0	If you can't eat wheat this is a great alternative!  The flavor is very good and the consistency is excellent!
5.0	My favorite Tazo flavor. I keep buying it over and over.
5.0	I highly recommend this coffee for anyone. I live in a house with 3 other people and buying coffee in bulk is a must - we've tried other brands and this one is the best quality for the price by far
5.0	I have been diagnosed with the disease Celiac.  These bars are truly gluten free.  And it is made on a gluten free facility.
5.0	It tastes kind of nasty but it helps male fertility, or so I've been told.
5.0	Bought this tea for a very dear friend far away who is living it so much! Thanks for yummy teas, Kathie
5.0	I ordered this product and it was an amazing buy and the best coffee I have ever had thru my Keurig.  This was shipped very quickly.
5.0	Sometimes it's hard to find specific S&B mixes in my local asian markets, so I finally broke down and ordered a lifetime supply :)  Arrived quickly, exactly what I wanted.
5.0	Shipping was easy and quick.  The products were delivered as expected and when expected.
5.0	Love this product..GREAT mixed with apple or orange juice....Gives terrific energy boost!  However, chocolate is still my favorite.  Comes in Chai too but it has stevia which I don't care for...
5.0	This year I took a chance on this chocolate. I normally use a block<br />of chocolate but the callets are so much easier to work with and<br />melt even more easily. The one kilogram bag is enough to make<br />one recipe of truffles. You will have some left over for chocolate<br />chip cookies.<br /><br />Ingredients: unsweetened chocolate, sugar, cocoa butter, soy lecithin, natural<br />vanilla flavor. May contain traces of milk protein.<br /><br />Here is the recipe I made up for chocolates during<br />the holiday season. The addition of cinnamon is really delicious.<br /><br />Fresh Cream Truffles with Cinnamon<br /><br />A double boiler is not recommended for melting the chocolate. Use your crockery cooker for the best results. The creamy ganache (ga-nosh) is dipped in melted chocolate and should be stored in the refrigerator. Bring the truffles to room temperature an hour before serving.<br /><br />Ganache<br /><br />6 ounces Callebaut semisweet chocolate callets<br />3/4 cup whipping cream<br />1/4 cup + 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature<br />1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract<br />1 teaspoon Saigon cinnamon<br /><br />Dipping Chocolate<br /><br />1 pound Callebaut semisweet chocolate callets<br />Parchment paper<br /><br />2 tablespoons confectioners' sugar<br />1 teaspoon cinnamon<br /><br />1.  Place the 6 ounces chocolate in a medium sized bowl.<br /><br />2.  Heat the cream just until it comes to a boil. Pour over<br />  chocolate. Stir until the chocolate melts. Cool to 90 degrees.<br /><br />3.  Cream all the butter in a deep bowl with a wooden<br />  spoon. Stir  in tablespoonfuls of cooled chocolate,<br />  beating well after each addition. Mixture should be<br />  creamy. If the butter starts to melt, the chocolate is<br />  still too warm. Lastly, stir in the vanilla and cinnamon.<br /><br />4.  Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.<br />  Fit a piping bag with a size 807 decorating tip. Pipe a<br />  round the size of a quarter onto parchment paper,<br />  start piping second level then lift. Place in the freezer<br />  to chill for 20 minutes.<br /><br />5.  Place the one pound dipping chocolate in a 6-quart crockery<br />  cooker, heat on low. Stir a few times until all chocolate<br />  has melted. Turn cooker off when chocolate<br />  has melted. The temperature should not go above<br />  120 degrees. Pour chocolate into a medium bowl.<br /><br />8.  Mix the confectioners' sugar and cinnamon together.<br />  Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.<br />  Use a truffle fork to dip chocolates. When all<br />  chocolates have been dipped use a sifter to sprinkle<br />  cinnamon confectioners' sugar over truffles.<br /><br />9.

5.0	This is the first time I have used a this style of &#34;K cup&#34; without problems in my Kuerig.  I read one review that mentioned leaking, etc but I have had no problems.  Best of all, this is the best strong, dark roast I have found to date!  Will definitely buy again!
5.0	This works just as well if not better than Brioschi, at a fraction of the price.  My local Trader Joe's used to carry it, but they cut it so now I order it online.
5.0	Great Tasting! Very Healthy With Protein!  Reasonably priced as well!    I always reorder before running out!    Patricia
5.0	This is a fantastic product, but not worth anywhere close to $35-  If you will not sell it for a fair price, I will shop elsewhere.
5.0	Very satisfied with product.  Shipping was fast.  Product arrived sooner than expected.  Will purchase from Barry's Farm again.
5.0	Exactly as described, shipped perfectly!
5.0	Tastes to me like an asian cheetos, very fatty though so I don't eat too many of them eatdelicious!
5.0	These weren't available locally and I had to try them. They are very tasty. You wouldn't ever mistake them for real pumpkin pie, but they make a very tasty poptart. You can really taste the pumpkin--not like some of the tarts that just taste sweet.<br />I wish they were available all year long.<br />I won't be buying them again--too pricey for a schmear of pumpkin wiped on a frosted cracker...but they were tasty.
5.0	These are a Christmas present but I got the same thing last year and he loved them.  He loves orange!!
5.0	Really easy to make and tastes better than canned Skyline chili.  Not haute cuisine, but it's a fun dish with spaghetti, cheese, and purple onions.
5.0	Better than others.  More crisp and none of the gooey stuff from okra.  Great as a garnish in a Bloody Mary or Martini.  Or just eat them out of the jar.  I ordered two cases.
5.0	Have been looking for a rice that cooks easily and never sticky.  This is it.  We use it a couple of times a week and I like to boil it in broth.  It is always perfect.
5.0	This is the only espresso I purchase. Having tried many brands, this is the brand I like best. It has a robust flavor; using it with my espresso maker, it always produces consistent crema. This espresso is also, never bitter. After having traveled to Italy numerous times, this brand and LaVazza are pretty much the only brands you will see while there. The Italians know their espresso!!
5.0	Great tasting and very healthy if you hear these
5.0	perfect candy; so pleased I could find them available; fresh, well packaged; quick shipping. I will order in the future.
5.0	This jerky is delicious. Even my meat eating friends think it's tasty!
5.0	So much better than marmite, though I have never tried South African marmite, which is apparently different. I toast wheat bread, put some butter on there, and the scrape some Kraft Vegemite on top and it's a delicious and wholesome treat.
5.0	My favorite blowpops!!! Yummy!!!!!
5.0	Needing to be gluten free has presented problems for eating on the run.  Schar rolls solved this problem as they make terrific sandwiches that are soft, taste great and hold together like gluten full rolls.  Thank you Schar for terrific quality!
5.0	I've only recently started eating granola because it was available at my office for free.  But now that I'm addicted to it, I want to buy some.<br /><br />At first I tried the Sweet Home Farm French vanilla Granola, that was such a disappointment I didn't think I'll find yummy granola again.  Then I came across Peace.  I was skeptical since it only had one good review.  But I figured I'll give it a try anyways.<br /><br />WooWEE!!! It's delicious.  The flavor is fantastic and the texture is perfect!<br /><br />The vanilla flavour is not overpowering but it's there to help enhance the flavor.  I seriously recommend that you give this one a try!!
5.0	This Kashi cereal is excellent.  Many flavors and textures that don't compete.  Trusty banana really makes this cereal stand out.  Seems to have helped us lose some weight as well.
5.0	We've been really interested to try this type of coffee.  Seeing XMas on the horizon, I ordered 3 bags, 2 for gifts and one as a treat for my husband and I.  OMG is it good!!  I could smell the wonderful, full bodied coffee smell through the shipping envelope!  We didn't wait for Xmas, and I have to say that I'm going to have a hard time drinking other coffee now.  Its so very delicious.  Its an expensive type of coffee, and I have priced it out several times, and this brand was reasonably priced enough I felt comfortable going for it.  It unfortunately won't be my every day coffee, but I love the idea of having something for special occasions.<br /><br />I was pleased to read as well about the ethical treatment of the animals that do the important, albeit strange, work of making this coffee so special!  They aren't in some sort of factory cage, but rather Luwak Star has found a way to gather the coffee beans that they eat naturally in the wild.  They roam freely and eat away at the little beans.  I am a long time supporter of animal rights and a life long animal lover.  Its important to me that products I purchase do not harm special little creatures in any way, and this coffee fits that criteria.
5.0	I love this flavor and I'm grateful it comes in a sugar-free, decaffeinated form. I drink a cup every single day, sometimes two.
5.0	Love this coffee! Love my Keurig so I am always looking for an economical way of using it. I usually use a brewing cup and my own ground coffee but like the added convenience of a K-cup but dislike the plastic tossed in the land field. When I first noticed San Francisco Bay One Cup I was excited for more than one reason. 1. Economical Price 2. Less &#34;packaging&#34; brewing pod and best of all 3. I Love this coffee. I prefer Medium to Light roast and this coffee is perfect for my taste and very smooth flavor. I will most likely begin to subscribe to this coffee. Additionally this company makes the packaging in such a way to preserve the flavor of the coffee. They seal pack in groups of ten and provide a canister to store your opened pods in. They did it all thus the 5 stars! This is also a great gift for all my Keurig owner family members which is over half of us.
5.0	I have been happy with the Neuro brand drinks since I tried them the first time at a deli in Manhattan.  I bought a stray Sonic and Sleep or two a few times to help me study and sleep and found them both to be very effective.<br /><br />I am a medical student in the middle of my clerkship year with an old habit of sleeping at very odd hours that really do not match up with my clinic schedule.  When I feel groggy and crabby after getting too little sleep, getting up early, and then having to stand quietly through a 4hr surgery, lecture, or conference, a Neuro Sonic at lunchtime totally gets me ready for the rest of the day when beforehand all my body wants to do is crash.<br /><br />Also, regarding the taste (I read the 1* reviews that complained about it), I find it to be very tasty, but then again I like the taste of Red Bull too.  The two don't taste alike really as Sonic is sweeter with a little more fruit flavor to it, but it's a similar type of 'energy drink' phenomenon where the taste isn't 100% like snapple or orange soda.  Bottom line is that if you're interested pick a single up somewhere and give it a try -- like I said I personally find the taste refreshing so there's more than one opinion out there.  I came here to order a case because buying singles is somewhat of a hassle and I'd rather have them ready to go in the fridge.  It kind of stinks that I can't get them at my local grocery yet, and for cheaper than $30 no less, but I like the product so okay.
5.0	This is the most amazing Fajita seasoning we have ever used! It has an excellent blend of seasonings and works great on beef and chicken.
5.0	This is a great, versatile sauce. I use it as a marinade for chicken or pork chops -- just needs a little salt, pepper and garlic, and you're good to go.
5.0	This is my first smoked paprika and I like it.  I prefer fresh peppers find regular paprika pretty useless except as a coloring agent, but this smoked paprika shows me something.  Not quite sure how to best use it yet, but it will be fun finding out.
5.0	This is a very good mix of nut with cashews being most prevalent. I'm thinking about reordering. It's nice to taste the pure flavors of the nuts without any additional seasoning.
5.0	I've tried other brands of spearmint extract, looking for the perfect enhancement for iced tea, and this is the best. Potent and intensely flavorful,  a little goes a long way. Highly recommended.
5.0	Very good, will purchase again
5.0	I sent these to my daughter, who is a grad. student, for quick and easy meals.  She enjoys them over rice and can make 2 meals from one package.
5.0	These tetra packs make traveling with formula so much easier. I wish I'd known about them when I first began supplementing, it would have been much less a pain. Goodstart Gentle was the only formula (after trying so many) that didn't give my son eczema.
5.0	I was pleasantly surprised with the SF Bay Dark Roast. I prefer a dark, bold blend, typically drinking Starbucks or Seattle's Best, and I would put this right up there. The cups are like little sealed baskets with a hard plastic top, but they work just fine in my Keurig. I used to keep my k-cups in a drawer, and this made me get a large glass counter-top jar for storage, but it works so well, I wish I would have thought of it sooner. I also got the fog-chaser and will try it and review that later. At 36 cents a piece, they are as inexpensive as you can find and cheaper still if you make it a recurring order.
5.0	Best coffee available, I drink it on the middle setting of the five our maker has and one cups is enough.
5.0	I was completely satisfied with this  purchase and will be buying from them again
5.0	This is a wonderful cup of coffee to have after a long day at the office. The taste and aroma bring a great soothing sensation while preparing dinner or as an after dinner treat.
5.0	This alfredo is so good! I always add a little sprinkle of granulated garlic and onion and some pepper and its PERFECT! Mmmm
5.0	So hard to find this product where I live. Was not sure it was what I was searching for, as the packaging has changed.
5.0	Very great tea. Taste great. It gave me great energy but I also thought it flushed the kidneys well too. Highly recommended if you want to shed some water weight.
5.0	Be warned.  If you buy this coffee once,  all coffee will be obsolete.  The flavor is amazing and it isn't going to crank you out like you'd expect.  I can't stop drinking this stuff.  Perfect.
5.0	These are the &#34;real deal&#34; Jasmine tea bags.............has that amazing aroma one often only finds in a great Chinese food restaurant.  Bar none our family favorite green tea.  You'll simply love it.  Not cheap, BUT worth every tea bag!
5.0	First off, I am not a Paleo butt-nut. I used to be, now I just eat real, non-processed foods: meat, vegetables, some tubers, etc. However there are things I miss, like mayo and thousand island dressing. Finally, here is a mayo that is actually made with NO soybean oil and is quite tasty. It doesn't contain 90% soy and some avocado oil like others, it is 100% avocado oil. All I can say is WOW, someone was actually blessed with a monolith from an alien society containing the technology to create this mayonnaise. Unlike other mayos claiming a healthy oil (E.g. 95% soy and canola and 5% olive oil) this is actually made with ONLY the oil it states. UNBELIEVABLE! Some things to note:<br /><br />1) The jar is tiny. Its like the tiniest jar of Hellman's you can find in the store.<br />2) Super rich. You only need a fraction of a typical serving. Not sure its really cost effective to use for thousand island dressing unless your last name is Rockefeller.<br />3) Tastes a little different than standard mayo and a little oilier, but thats to be expected as its not full of crap.<br /><br />The only drawback was that it was shipped via that bogus UPS &#62; USPS method which guaranteed my mayo sat in a hot mailbox for a day. Luckily it seemed unaffected. I wish UPS would stop that useless crap. And the shipping was very expensive, but hey, if it were Amazon Prime it would be twenty-two bucks anyway.<br /><br />Despite the paleo price this is great mayo. If you are looking for real food, you've found it.  Definitely worth the price for eating clean. Also, I've only reviewed the mayo as I have not yet opened the ketchup. Honestly, I wish this was just 2 jars of mayo for the price as its much easier to find clean ketchups.
5.0	Was packaged very well!  The plant arrived very healthy and has stayed that way!  It outgrew the bonsai glass vase and I transplanted it into a planter and it's still doing excellent!  Love it!
5.0	I love these no sugar added hot cocoa's. I am on a low sugar diet so I drink these to get my chocolate fix. It does have a sugar sweetener and that isn't always the best to heal IBS however, my sugar addiction is pretty strong so I work my way down off of sugar with these. I add half and half to make it creamy.
5.0	My boyfriend bought me a Keurig to cheer me up, and of course my mom was instantly thrilled to have one! We have a big family. It is my mom, my brother (18), my little brother (9), myself (23) and my boyfriend (27). So naturally everyone except me drinks coffee but I was excited to try the different flavors of teas, ciders, and etc that Keurig offers.<br />Well, I did my research and paying 1 dollar for each container was a little pricy so I found this item. The reviews were very positive for the most part, and seemed to be the best option for my family.<br />I have had it for several days now, and it has worked perfectly. We go through about 10 of these a day because everyone drinks a lot of coffee, and the fact that you can use any store brand coffee in it is awesome.<br />I have made my teas right after their coffee as well and I do not taste any after flavors or anything. This item stays closed, doesn't overfill my Keurig, and makes a wonderful cup of coffee according to my family.<br /><br />So I would definitely suggest it to try. I think it is the easiest item to clean, just like a filter you pour out the old coffee, and rinse it out briefly. I haven't had any issues with it opening except once where my 9 year old brother overfilled it with coffee trying to surprise my mom.<br /><br />Update 4/25/2013<br /><br />So I initially purchased this item a year ago when I first got the Keurig. We are still using the SAME one! Isn't that crazy? My mom still drinks 6-7 cups of coffee and she says that it doesn't make the coffee weak. I think it has to do with the type of coffee you purchase cause she uses starbucks brand coffee. And my mom enjoys dark coffee so I truly believe she means this filter does the trick! I still think this little guy is super easy to clean, and filling it up does take practice. However, even if you over fill it, the water still goes through, and just leaves some grains in your cup. If you think your coffee is too watery, something may be wrong with your keurig or your filter. The only other thing I can think of is that you just like mud for coffee...<br />As for the piece breaking, we actually are really rough with ours, and it hasn't broken yet this whole time. If it breaks right away, if may be a defect of the product cause ours is still alive and kicking.<br />I would suggest getting multiple ones though. I use one for regular coffee, one for decaf, and my brother tries using one for teas (not sure if I trust that). Either way, this makes the keurig a great affordable coffee maker.<br /><br />Update 11/12/2016<br />I kid you not, I still have the same ones I purchase years ago. They are still going strong and haven't broken or lost sturdiness. I am not sure if they are the same quality, but proper care and cleaning will let these bad boys last forever!g with your keurig or your filter. The only other thing I can think of is that you just like mud for coffee...<br />As for the piece breaking, we actually are really rough with ours, and it hasn't broken yet this whole time.

5.0	the fruit flavor is nice, i used 2 teasppons for 30 oz water almost boiling point<br />i steeped for about 7 minues, not tannic at all
5.0	This is a gluten-free bargain for those of us that simply cannot consistently find this in stores. A bag usually lasts me a whole week ( x 12 weeks = 3 months).
5.0	Great addition to green tea!
5.0	Love it. Add two tablespoons to my banana choc smoothie == HEAVEN.<br />So good- and it adds good protein too. Very happy with this!
5.0	I love this product.  Some of my medication makes my mouth very dry and the Halls Refresh not only helps my mouth water, they also taste good.
5.0	If your looking for a sweet tasting oatmeal this is it. It has little strawberry bits that re hydrate when you cook it. I use filtered water instead of tap water and it makes the flavor taste better.
5.0	exceeded my expectations
5.0	Out of all the drinks (non-alcholic) that i have had around the world.  Asia, Europe and the middle east this one by far is my favorite.  I am eagerly waiting for the day that i can purchase this locally.  I have my inlaw's bring it back from Slovakia when they come to see us.  And it goes great with meals too.  :)  Hopefully the new Corp. that owns it dosent change the taste.
5.0	I think the mix was good...better than I expected.  Most of my flavored coffees were different and I only had a couple decafs which was good for me since I do not drink it!  I would order again.<br /><br />My package was as follows:<br /><br />Unflavored Coffees (18 total) :<br /><br />Dark Roast (Caza Trail, Martinson)<br />French Roast (Caza Trail, Diedrich, Martinson)<br />Coastal Blend (caza Trail)<br />Xtra Bold Medium Organic (Caza Trail)<br />Columbia Blend (Caza Trail)<br />Breakfast Blend (Caza Trail, Martinson)<br />Donut Shop Blend (Caza Trail, Martinson)<br />Kona Blend (Caza Trail)<br />House Blend (Caza Trail, Martinson)<br />Donut Lovers Blend (Caza Trail)<br />Original - Medium (Eight O'Clock)<br />Morning Edition (Medium) - (Diedrich)<br /><br />Flavored Coffees (14):<br /><br />French Vanilla (Caza Trail)<br />Vanilla Velvet (Martinson)<br />Irish Crème (Martinson)<br />Carmel Crème (Martinson<br />Gingerbread (Caza Trail)<br />Winterfest (Martinson)<br />Hazelnut (Caza Trail)<br />Hazelnut Creme (Martinson)<br />Pumpkin Spice (Caza Trail)<br />Pumpkin Pie (Martinson)<br />Caymen Coconut (Martinson)<br />Tiramisu Twist (Martinson)<br />*Mint N Mocha (Martinson) (not sure if this is a coffee or more like a hot chocolate)<br />*Kahlua (Timothys)(not sure if this is a coffee or more like a hot chocolate)<br /><br />Decaf (2) :<br /><br />Breakfast Blend (Caza Trail)<br />Columbian Decaf (Martinson)<br /><br />Teas (12) :<br /><br />Quiet Time Herbal Tea (Caza Trail)<br />Green Tea (Caza Trail)<br />Purely Green tea (Caza Trail)<br />Chai Decaf (Twinings)<br />Chamomile (Higgins & Burke)<br />Chai Black Tea (Higgins & Burke)<br />English Breakfast Black Tea (Caza Trail)<br />Sunrise Black Tea (Caza Trail)<br />Summers Iced Tea & Lemonade (Caza Trail)<br />Summers Sweet Ice Tea (Caza Trail)<br />Traditional Earl Grey (Caza Trail)<br />Chai Latte (Grove Square)<br /><br />Hot Cocoas & Cider (4) :<br /><br />Spiced Apple Cider (Grove Square)<br />CarmelApple Cider (Grove Square)<br />Irish Crème Hot Cocoa (Grove Square)<br />Cup O'Coco (Martinson)
5.0	I've never actually had raw honey before and saw this in the store.  It tastes amazing! There is really nothing more to say.  It's simply amazing.  Buy it; you wont regret it.
5.0	I love this cereal. It makes a great lowfat healthy snack. You don't have to be a kid or gluten sensitive to love this, it is for everyone.
5.0	What can I say about Special K Original? It's a very light cereal, but is still filling. We all love it and just want it to keep coming.  This is so convenient and we always have it on hand.
5.0	A friend of mine who was stationed in Hawaii was the person who told me about the uses of Huli Huli Sauce and the price and expediency of this order was phenominal, this is where I will order it from now on!!!
5.0	Great tasting Hot Chocolate!
5.0	Was what my wife needed to finish making her cake.
5.0	Very good. Dilvered on time. I will be sure to order again. Will also try other thing from the same vendor
5.0	excellent product, very well packed , really original, thank you!
5.0	The taste is great, salt free....can't beat it!!!  I use this believe it or not on my popcorn and in my meals, as it really enhances flavoring for everything, without the guilt!!!!  Will continue to purchase this in the future!!!
5.0	It is so good and popular that I had to increase the quantity in my automatic shipment. Many in the office love it.
5.0	What a great product. It's about time something like this comes along. I have problems falling  asleep and staying asleep. With this product I can finally get a good nights rest without continually waking up. It's definately worth a try if you are having problems sleeping or are stressed out.
5.0	[...]    This goes a very long ways.  I bought 8 grams and will be using it for several years.  I made saffron bread with it which I didn't love.  The saffron taste was good, just my bread recipe was maybe the wrong one.  Next time I will use a different recipe.  I haven't used it for tea.
5.0	This is an awesome alternative for homemade soda.
5.0	The product was packed well.  The chocolate has kept fresh.  I researched the details on how to store chocolate for a long period of time before I purchased it.
5.0	No GMO grains in it. Used to eat it frequently as a kid, but could not find it in any local stores. Glad to have found it again.
5.0	Good price, fast shipping. Good instructions with tea. Needed since I had neve drank this kind of tea before.
5.0	A timeless classic that provides the 2.7 minutes of enjoyment before you can bite into the candy to get to the gum.
5.0	"I was absolutely delighted when I just accidentally tried these at a Caribou lately, but... I LOVE them!!    A delicious \\""cracker\\"" of sorts, made mostly with sunflower seeds and other seed-nut-type things, though they do have a fairly standard cracker carb load, which is unfortunate. If a bit lower on carbs (I think it's somewhere around 14-16g per small (2 oz?) bag, they might well be the only thing I eat [besides eggs, and lettuce].     I really, really love these things! The combination of salt/pepper on snacks, I find irresistible, and on these healthy, nut/seed snacks... way better than potato chips! While there IS something cardboard ish about their texture (could be what the negative review is referencing), to me similar to [Va-]Nilla Wafers and Saltines, both classics, the flavor of these salt/pepper Somersaults is killer-delicious. I tried another flavor at Caribou but didn't enjoy it at all, though the salt/pepper, well, I personally can't stop eating them. I buy them anytime I see them and am sad they're not at my local grocery.    I'm very, very excited to have found them here, and can't wait to receive them!!!  :)"
5.0	This product was awesome. I have recently become a vegetarian. Not sure which or how far I am going to take this yet, am ecstatic to find such a delectable source of protein and other fine nutrients. Thank you
5.0	These taste more like a treat than a health bar.  It's hard to believe they're good for you.<br /><br />The bars are made of Kashi's wheat mix, but it tastes even better with the peanuts.  One side is covered with chocolate.  Sweeter than other granola bars, not as sweet as a candy bar.  Perfect for most occasions.<br /><br />This is the tastiest Kashi product I've tried.
5.0	Yum. Let me put it another way: The perfect secret hidden treat in the bottom of my desk drawer in my home office. Don't tell my kids.
5.0	I had been looking for a great powdered cheese for a long time, tried several, and then ordered this.  It's the best I've ever had!  It's perfect for popcorn, on vegetables, and in scrambled eggs.  I'll definitely be reordering!
5.0	I think I am officially addicted. I eat one a day, sometimes two.
5.0	If you are looking for tea for milk tea, this is the best for you. I'm pretty sure you can actually find lots of good reviews of this tea everywhere.<br /><br />I normally make Japanese style milk tea which is half water and half milk. Here are details.<br /><br />1) Boil 1 cup of water with 1 tea bag of Yorkshire Gold.<br />2) After 5 mins, pour 1 cup of milk and add sugar (1~2 tsp)<br />3) When you see bubbles around milk, that's the time to turn off<br /><br />If you like very strong milk tea, you can pour less water or use 2 teabags with the same amount of water as above.<br /><br />Again, this is the best tea for milk tea.<br /><br />Tip : When you make milk tea, it will be easier and tastier to use a milk pan.
5.0	Wonderful soft caramels that melt in your mouth.  Mailed some to my grandmother and she loves them too.  Will buy again
5.0	My son LOVES coconut water and relies on it to get him through football two-a-days and basketball tournaments.  For quick rehydration and great taste, you cannot go wrong with Vita Coco!
5.0	I'd never heard of this before, but I like sparkling, unflavored water and it's difficult<br />to find in stores.  This has a far better clean taste than Voss or Poland Springs<br />sparkling water.
5.0	NOT FOR KEURIG 2s! You MUST buy the orange stickers to make this work with a Keurig 2nd edition. But the coffee itself is awesome. Love it.
5.0	Came all the way across the U.S. but arrived on time..Who does not like ring pops?? perfect !!  These won't melt,our sour your mouth.....plenty of fun bling bling !!
5.0	A very tasty cookie and a real treat.  The real lemon flavor of the ingredients comes through from the first bite to the last.  There is a wonderful, very slight hint of tartness which adds nicely to the total eating experience.  It really is difficult to stop at one, two or even three cookies, they're that good.
5.0	Item exactly as described and shipped very quickly, fair price thank you
5.0	Kiss Me Organics' Organic matcha is a fine, milled powder and it has a earthy, aromatic smell and tastes just like it too. I've been adding a small teaspoon to my thermos of hot water in the mornings, and it definitely keeps me awake at work! I like how it has the caffeine with all the additional health benefits it provides. It also comes in a resealable foil bag and it is handy to store in your kitchen, pantry, or to bring it to go.<br /><br />Upon purchase, Kiss me Organics sends a recipe book which you can download, and it covers from making drinks (smoothies) to baked goods (truffles, scones, cookies,) and to even main courses (pizza using matcha flour!) I'm not much of a cook, but I made some sparkling matcha the other day and it was yummy!<br /><br />Disclaimer: I was sent a package to review on my blog but my reviews are honest for my readers.
5.0	Dis some good stuff child....ya'll need to get ya'll some.
5.0	I'm trying to lose weight, and a prepared meal with a lot of flavor and filling for less than 350 calories fits very well into my diet plan. It is just as good as your average fast-food indian place.
5.0	Good cup of coffee for the start of your day and at the end also. Great taste at any time.
5.0	Wonderful taste and texture.  I loved steel oats but this stuff is delicious, filling and satisfying.  Having it come in bulk of 6 boxes keeps a steady supply on hand and no need to run out.  I sometimes add blackberrier, or maplle syrup or a spoonfull of peanut butter or almonds fora great way to nutritionally start the day
5.0	To start with, Amazon is mixing reviews again.  The featured product, which this review applies to, is Kashi Creamy Truly Vanilla.  Other products, such as the Kashi Honey and Cinnamon, have different flavors and different availability.  Reviews for other products are meaningless and should be ignored.  In actual fact, the local Krogers only has the Honey and Cinnamon in their hot cereal selections (they have a vast array of Kashi cold cereals).  This Creamy Truly Vanilla is a basic cereal that you can dress up with other ingredients to your own taste.  I personally add cinnamon, nutmeg, and local fresh honey, along with dried fruit [[ASIN:B002SZWFTO Good Sense Berry Medley, 5 Ounce Bags (Pack of 6)]]  The prepared product can be eaten without milk because it already has a creamy texture - that is an advantage over dry cereals as some people do not drink milk - it is also helpful when you forgot to buy milk at the grocery store.  Overall, this is an excellent cereal, particularly because you can add ingredients to your own taste.  Some reviewers have recommended almond butter and/or bananas, although I have not personally tried those combinations.  I would note that the Amazon price is good, and is comparable to what local grocery stores charge for comparable cereals.  They only down side is that you have to buy six boxes at a time.  I would note that I remember somewhat larger portions when I first started using Kashi cereal.  You can double the portion size by using two packets, but be aware that you need a larger bowl for the microwave to keep it from boiling over the sides.
5.0	This is my favorite tea! It is absolutely delicious. I drink up to 3 cups a day during the winter and it is amazing.
5.0	Supplies the fat your body needs for fuel. I don't recommend drinking it, but you can cook with it or mix with other ingredients to make palatable foods..
5.0	"Delicious, easy and quick!  Kraft Shake 'N Bake BBQ Glaze for chicken and pork.   Kraft BBQ Shake 'N Bake is a great option to \\""traditional\\"" BBQ recipes and brimming with flavor.

5.0	I love being able to feed my child organic food. Earth's Best is a great brand, food tastes great and my child loves it.
5.0	Delicious and good quality. A little too expensive.
5.0	Everyone should be eating whole grains--not enriched. These delicious pretzels are a good place to start.
5.0	I love coconut oil. I bought the smaller size first to try it out and I love it. I use it in the frying pan such as for frying eggs, mushrooms, and vegetables. It smells good, tastes good, and supposed to be great for the brain. So it is great.
5.0	these little berries are excellent for smoothies. They don't tickle my fancy just dry and out of the bag, but blended with other berries it makes a REALLY STRONG health food blend for immunity and energy. Plus Goji is a perfect protein.
5.0	Shipping was very fast and the product was as advertised.  I'm having an interesting time experimenting with this unique powder.  I found the quality to be excellent.
5.0	i use this product instead of junk food and much healthyier,very good pineapple, it does not have that sulfer after taste that some dried fruit has, thank you.
5.0	Sold these for concessions at our theater - the kids loved them - we sold out and they were looking for more!
5.0	I bought two boxes - one for work and one for home. Super easy when you're craving something salty and spicy or when you just need some quick protein.
5.0	I can smell the smoke through the package and that got me going.  I couldn't think  of what to cook. and this is any smoked meat i will have to send my sister.
5.0	I've been trying all different brands and brews available in K-Cups and so far this is the best one I've found that is flavorful but not like jet fuel or water.
5.0	I can't say enough great things about the Oona PMS products 1 & 2.  I use them religiously (and have been for the past ~5 years) immediately before and for the first day or so when bloating & cramps are debilitating.  I can't say that I use the passion flower (smaller pill in the insert). The larger free floating pills in the PMS1 work great for my uber bloated days.  And I combine with the PMS2 (typically taking the max recommended) to help ease the cramps - usually in conjunction with tylenol (which works better for me than advil or naproxen).  These work so much better than midol or any other over the counter/drug store PMS meds I've tried (even some other cramp bark extracts).  I cannot say enough good things about Oona. If you're debating on try it, DO IT!!!
5.0	Excellent!  I will continue to get my enchilada sauce here!
5.0	Delicious. So old-fashioned good..like the caramels that won the state fair.<br />My new &#34;go to&#34; gift to send to the special people in my life.
5.0	Very tasty, and a nice change from plain rice.  Good stuff - the grain combination is an interesting and enjoyable texture and taste. We originally found this at Costco in a huge bag, but it was a one time thing. Disappointed to find they didn't re-stock the 5 grain and were only carrying farro by the same company.  An internet search finds it here on Amazon, of course!  This package includes 6 bags of &#34;normal, grocery store&#34; size, so it'll keep in your pantry.. if it lasts that long. My new go-to starch for dinner.
5.0	This tea is delicious!
5.0	VERY interesting product. Lower fat, higher protein, and convenient to use. I add it to my chocolate protein shake and it gives me an easy way to change it up. It is also really good as straight PB!<br /><br />They have a happy customer! I'll be ordering again.
5.0	I just ordered the cheese from Hy-Vee...the large 2 lb size. I figure friends who are also in love with this cheese will help me get rid of a case (I hope). So if you have a Hy-Vee near your home, given them a call. The store manager also gave me the option to get the smaller size too.<br /><br />I hope this helps.
5.0	came in great shape and is already starting to put out a flower. Very pleased. Will order again. Would make nice gift.
5.0	This is the best grape sparkling spritzer around.  All of our family including the grandchildren choose it over other spritzers.  Again, one of the best.
5.0	If you like mild green pepper sauce, this one is for you!  Excellent product shipped directly to your home.  A definite must have when having the urge to add some spice to your food!!!
5.0	Nice selection variety.
5.0	For one, I love the Harney & Sons Tea brand.  This flavor of tea is delicious!  It is a very delicate jasmine flavor.  It has an excellent aroma.  Try it - if you like jasmine you will love it!!
5.0	...you will love these!  We order them by the case since the price is much better than local purchasing.  Delicious!
5.0	Great stuff!  I use it to make homemade marshmallows, as well as gummy treats.  Sometimes I have to pick out a few small lumps, if I haven't stirred it fast/hard/long enough, but that's no big deal.  Highly recommend.
5.0	They are great.  Love them.
5.0	these are great for on the go meals, or if your like me and single and don't like to cook for one. the best part is they taste great hot or cold, no preservatives or additives, I get these every  month, all 3 variety's.
5.0	very good, just as I remembered it.  soft, chewy, not sweet.
5.0	I have only recently made a switch to dark chocolate, so it took a little while to get used to the taste. So far I have only used the nibs in baking replacing chocolate chips. I am sure that in time I will start to use them in other things, since the benefit to my health is important to me.
5.0	This Smucker's  Red Plum Jam is oh so good! I mainly use this on Peanut Butter and Jam sandwiches, but it also makes a great Red Plum Sauce.
5.0	This rub is absolutely fantastic. Follow the directions on the tin, using olive oil and lemon juice, but make the mixture a day in advance, and let it sit in the refrigerator in a sealed container overnight. This allows the spices, particularly the garlic, to rehydrate. Instead of a thin liquid, which tends to run off the chicken, you'll have a thick paste which will stay put, filled with big savory chunks of garlic. It's not even necessary to rub it under the skin. I don't know of any easier way to prepare great roast chicken. Believe me, people will want your recipe.
5.0	I LOVE this water....there is no aftertaste!
5.0	I love, love, LOVE this brand of protein bars...great taste, not to sweet and a lot of nuts in the bars. I really like this particular flavor.
5.0	great product! perfect for making bread and great value for your money. I will be buying this flour again and again!
5.0	PB2 is my secret weapon as I am on my weight loss journey.<br /><br />I add a Tbsp of PB2 to my chocolate protein shake and suddenly, it tastes like I am drinking a peanut butter cup.  It's heavenly.  You can buy it in smaller quantities in stores like Whole Foods, but since I use so much of it (at least 3 Tbsp per day) I buy in bulk and save a lot!<br /><br />My only complaint would be that the bulk packaging can be inconvenient and messy to open, but once you get the hang of it it's not too bad.  I'd recommend getting a tall plastic container close to the size of a single package, cutting the corner of the package open, and keeping it in the plastic container.  I think the one I have is [[ASIN:B001MNE17M Buddeez Lil Handy Dispenser Scoop]] and it's about the perfect size.
5.0	I have been been drinking aloe drinks for years. This is the best flavor and freshest aloe drink out there. I've tried many brands in different Asian markets. I recommend everyone try this. I bought this flavor 3 times already.
5.0	I now eat this almost exclusively in the morning. Not too long to cook, and very consistent. Bob's may be the best.
5.0	This is a DELICIOUS snack! I love the crunchy, peanut buttery cookies on the outside and the creamy peanut butter filling on the inside. These taste like nothing but real, freshly-made peanut butter cookies. I'm thrilled to find a sweet snack that has 12% fiber (plus Protein). It isn't the lowest snack in calories, but at least it isn't empty calories. I recommend them!
5.0	Great flavor with just enough sweetness.  Love it!
5.0	I picked these up in a local store that specializes in world products. After I got them home I discovered that not only are these fresh with an aroma that only high qualify toasted sesame can give off, but they were intensely flavorful.<br /><br />The seeds were everything I could have hoped for, but the pleasant surprise was the tight secondary seal that kept them fresh, and the packaging itself. I am used to purchasing seeds in a cellophane bag or jar, and toasting them is usually left to me. In this case the jar had a lid similar to pepper or other bulk spice containers where one side of the top was designed for pouring and the other has holes for sprinkling. Since these jars are eight full ounces this is a very convenient feature.<br /><br />Nutritionally there are 45 one teaspoon servings per container. Each serving contains 30 calories of which 25 are from fat. There is no cholesterol nor sodium, and the single gram of carbohydrates per serving is balanced by the single gram of protein.<br /><br />Once opened you need to refrigerate any that you do not consume and expect it to remain fresh for less than a week even so. That is the biggest drawback for me because I use it to make za'atar for dipping breads. It's difficult to go through eight ounces in a week for me because I live alone. If I cannot consume it before it goes stale I make tahini with it in a food processor, which extends its shelf life a bit. However, if you are buying for a family this is a perfect size.<br /><br />Bottom line is this is fresh, fragrant and has that wonderful nutty flavor. At the price - even with shipping - it's a bargain. If you can find it locally it's even more of one.
5.0	I got tierd of getting small bottles of molasses my boy freind love ginger snaps also ginger bread love the taste
5.0	Greatroduct. Bit expensive
5.0	We use this mustard almost every day. The kids like it too.<br /><br />This mustard may not be to Asian tastes though.
5.0	I starting taking these capsule, once I saw the product on Dr OZ to assist with my constipation. I take two tablets twice a day with my meals, and it has been a really great product. It has added more fiber in my diet and when takin with your meals, it also assist with your appetite. I do not have any cravings, and if I miss taking them, and hunger strikes, I know exactly what I am missing for the day. Try it, it is truly a wonderful product.<br /><br />Tanisha<br />Tacoma, WA
5.0	I PLAN TO BUY MOORE.WHAT MOORE CAN I SAY THEY ARE GREAT.  DID NOT TAKE LONG TO USE THEM UP.
5.0	love it,cheessy goodness without being salty,fast ship,as is product as shown in the picture. Good Buy, try it youll love it
5.0	My husband and I love it!  We will buy more of these.  The K-Cups are very expensive and this is a great value, taste and cost.  Thank you SF Bay!
5.0	My mothers favorite coffee, I'm constantly ordering for her!
5.0	If you like chewy spearmint candies these are great,  I bought some for my mother-in-law<br />and ended up buying some for myself.
5.0	Good grief this is yummy! I read an article about the wonderful effects of eating Zaatar, and it's spot on. I like to mix it with olive oil and spread it on untoasted bread along with a thin slice of provolone and a few slices of tomato as a light lunch. Add it to rice as it cooks is good too! Only need a scant amount to taste it - and it's wonderful! Really aromatic and tasty.
5.0	"The Best snack in the world. I'm addicted to Bamba better then any peanut product.<br />\\""Ein Kemo Bamba\\""  There's nothing like Bamba."
5.0	Use almost everyday on toast/bagels. Doesn't run like honey.
5.0	The seem to work well for seasoning a new humidor.
5.0	Been using Ivory liquid handsoap for years.  Good product and this refill both in size and price is the best.
5.0	Although I am still working on strengths and amounts needed, it is a great product with great taste.  I like the fact the little bottles fit well into my small spice rack and it only takes a little to get a LOT of flavor.
5.0	They are so versatile.  They can be used to make a peach sauce,in yougart, ceream cheese, vanilla pudding, with other fruits to make a compote or topping for angel food or pound cake, with cereal.  Your imagination is your only limit.
5.0	I find the flavor to be interesting. I used it when cooking a pork roast and it was delicious!  I also used it for frying eggs and it was delicious!  I used it to pop corn-----well it was interesting!  This was fun to try. I have not ordered more, but I think I should. It is healthier than butter for cooking.
5.0	My family loves the tea. I am sure that I will be reordering it.
5.0	We replaced all of our white salt for this and the taste is noticeable. We really like all the health properties and have been using it for about 2 years now. Highly recommended for the mineral content and taste.
5.0	Like this tea, give me energy.
5.0	We had fun decorating our cookies with the Jack O Lanterns and they didn't taste bad!
5.0	I love reaching for one of these Kind Bars when I want a nutritional Chocolate snack.  Plus they taste great!
5.0	It arrived on time and the product is great. All the flavors in the Solo line are excellent.  The products work well in pastries (like Kolachi), filling between layers of cake with whipped cream, etc.
5.0	This was my first online purchase of gift flowers.  I was a bit reluctant so I read several reviewers' comments.  I liked the look of these flowers and I thought they might add a touch of summer joy.  They were a smashing success.    Although I did not get an opportunity to see the flowers, I received the following message in a thank you card from the recipients.    Dear....    How kind of you to bring much cheer into our home with your visit.    So surprising to follow it up with more delightful sunshine with the magnificient flowers!    What a pleasant memory for us all!    I think that says it all--magnificient.  I will be ordering these again as a gift.
5.0	Frankly I consider oatmeal medicine for me and<br />of all the organic steel cut oatmeals this tastes the best. I eat<br />it everyday so I should be an expert.
5.0	Just remember these are flavored coffees for a single use coffee machine. This can not be compared to a real cappuccino machine. The people in the office seem to like this flavor more than most.
5.0	It makes the best stove top popped corn!!!
5.0	Amazingly fast shipping, thank you so much. A very happy expat!
5.0	I use about 1/3 packet in a cup of herbal tea and it is wonderful.  Really like this product... easy and fast to just pour a little in a cup, and has a nice favor.  Is very strong... 1/2 a packet is usually too much for one cup.  I especially like it with Ginger Aid Ginger tea by Traditional Medicines.
5.0	I LOVE these freeze dried rstrawberries. I crush them and put them into my own Trail Mix and in my morning cereal. Intense flavor, great texture. I'll buy these again for sure.
5.0	love the flavor for my fudge
5.0	Love it made  my avacado,honey cocoa pudding with the Joyfuel and it was delish,knowing there are no pesticides involved is  great,I will be ordering it again. Thanks
5.0	Fiendishly good.  Smooth, rich and ridiculously delicious.  Sweet tooth candy.  Not for someone with a drinking problem, as you can smell the rum when you open the wrapping.  We inhaled three boxes of this fudge in a shamefully short time.  Don't buy this product, it's too good, and, unfortunately, reasonably priced.
5.0	I couldn't believe the bad reviews when I looked this up.  It is selling at target for .85 a packet - much better deal than what is offered here. I enjoy the candy a lot, but I agree it does not taste just like M&M's.  The chocolate tastes more like dark chocolate and the candy shell is less crunchy. I really enjoy the taste because it satisfies my chocolate craving. It is more chocolatey than plain M&M's and more filling. I also have peace of mind because it doesn't have hydrogenated oils, corn syrup and unnecessary sugar.
5.0	Surprising to me, it turns out these filters are the secret of the Chemex coffee rather than the pour over technique.  They're made of a thicker material and do a wonderful job of filtering out any sediment or bitterness.  They're literally just a quarter folded piece of paper-like material, so it's not immediately obvious how or where to put the grounds, but the directions on the box have a diagram and description.  Because of the thickness of the filter, it takes a while to make the coffee.  After the initial wetting to the grounds, I usually fill to about 1/8 inch from the rim of the pot and then let it sit and drain, repeating until all the water has been poured through the grounds and dripped into the bottom of the pot.<br /><br />The are used just like in the picture on the box, so they wouldn't fit a standard coffee maker.  They also drain significantly slower than average percolator filters, which means they can't be used in a coffee machine since the machine would overflow before the water drained through the filter.<br /><br />The Chemex pots these are designed for have a standard/fixed shape to the top portion where the filters go, so these filters will fit any Chemex pour over pot.
5.0	it's way better than I expected. thanks.
5.0	this flour was absolutely fresh and worked like a dream in every recipe i've tried it in. Elana of Elana's Pantry was right when she said this brand of flour is top quality and works beautifully. the grind is uniform and very fine.
5.0	This is a burst of refreshment in your mouth, just sweet enough and you can really taste that lemon zing.  Really great!
5.0	Great for baking AAA+++
5.0	These hard candies are great!  They taste wonderful and are easy to unwrap!  I'll  buy them again!<br />This is all I have to say.
5.0	I love Himalayan salt in general. It is so delicious, really makes food pop. And the added benefit of natural minerals is fantastic. Terrasoul's product seems pure, minimally processed and good quality. I have no complaints.
5.0	Has a nice bold taste just like the one I use to buy, with less recycling needs. Great buy for the money.
5.0	I love red tea and this big bag works for me. I just grab my steeping implementation containers and make jugs of tea.
5.0	I absolutely adore this!!! As a college student, I use it when I'm having a hard time sleeping and I always feel better the next morning. Plus it tastes great!
5.0	Wonderful and fragrantly delicious.
5.0	For the cost, and the amount you receive, this was a very good buy.  I am looking forward to purchasing more in the future.
5.0	Great product and fast delivery.
5.0	These are gigantic whole cashews.  They have just the right amount of salt.  They are vacuum packed and very fresh.
5.0	BEST INSTANT COFFEE EVER
5.0	I bought this as a gift.  The giftee loved it!
5.0	Delicious & so Convient!!!  Love making Quinoa salads & this makes life so easy.  Open package and start adding ingredients.  Gave one set of these to my mom & she loves the taste and time saved also.  Highly recommend.
5.0	I bought these for an older kid Halloween party. I put them all in a bowl and offered up the snack without much interest until I announced the potential for a &#34;trick&#34; instead of a &#34;treat&#34; I have never had so much fun watching tuff teenage boys gag, wince and yes my son even baby barfed after a challenge of multiple rotten egg comsumption. They had an absolute blast and couldn't wait to offer them to the parents at party's end! I ate a few and let me tell you...they taste as one would expect ( I've never eaten a dirty sock but it taste like one smells)
5.0	Very pleased, they were very fresh and would recommend this product to anyone!!!! They have very good flavor, for someone who loves Twizzlers
5.0	"My daughter was breastfed until she was almost 9 months old. When I started giving her formula, I first gave her one of the \\""popular\\"" brands and she did not like it at all. Her stomach got really upset and she had stomachaches every time she drank it. It took us a couple of days to figure out that it was the formula, so we decided to get an organic one. She had absolutely no issues with Earth's Best. As a matter of fact, she really liked it and never had stomachaches again because of her formula. She is now just over a year old and not on formula anymore, but if I have another baby, this is the formula I will use. I highly recommend it!"
5.0	my son loves these and initially they were available at safeway/raleys/walmart/foodmax and then disappeared , I guess due to demand.. and especially this particular flavor.<br />so I ordered from amazon and his next favorite flavor is wild cherry .
5.0	What a BRILLIANT snack?!  Why didn't this hit the market sooner?  High protein, gluten free CHIPS?!  I've been a chip addict my entire life and I'm proud to say that iPS are my new go to.  I'm looking forward to some more flavors.  Can't go wrong with this snack!
5.0	I don't even remember buying this in the store.  I was looking for &#34;the usual&#34; and found this in my pantry.  I don't ever want to see the other brands again.  This is moist, the texture is great and we loved the flavor.  I usually add creamed corn, cheese, sour cream - or all 3! to make package mix cornbread palatable.  This needs none of that.
5.0	And it's a full 2 pounds for $20! We got sick of the Starbucks, and are very happy to have made the switch!
5.0	Great Products, Great Prices !
5.0	This is a great sweetener for just about any purpose .... has far fewer calories than sugar and really good taste -- I can't detect any bitter aftertaste in it, which can happen with products containing stevia.
5.0	I add this to my fruit shakes every morning.  I can feel my core temperature rise after drinking it.
5.0	These took a while to get from China, but when I received them, they smell lovely.  I actually feed them to my parrot because he likes them in his seeds.
5.0	Like most of the jerky that I have found on Amazon it has been real good tasting. If you look around you can find jerky for better prices in your local area.
5.0	I love this tea! I only wished I had found it sooner, this is a nice, strong tea, never bitter and fits the bill on my &#34;non coffee&#34; days!
5.0	This is a blend that my husband and I reach for often. I find it a good medium roast which is what I prefer. I also love the Nantucket Roast from Green Mountain.
5.0	Noodles are great, soft and delicious.  Great for noodle soup, quick cooking about 5 minutes, I rebuy this product often.
5.0	Fantastic taste of Italy, sour and sweet at the same time with wonderful bite.
5.0	I bought these a few months ago you don't get much candy in them. There way cool and make great little tins to keep small odds and ends in
5.0	I always buy my gum on here in bulk
5.0	Those who have spent time in the South will agree this is a wonderful, creamy, sweet peanut butter. Once you have tried it you will never be happy with peanut butters at your local grocery stores. I was very happy to be able to order this a while back I'll need more soon.
5.0	These are just so darn good!!  Always fresh and just the right snack!  Have a little, have a lot!  Your choice!
5.0	What can you say, it's Swiss Miss cocoa?  It's my son's favorite. Works great with putting powder in mug and using Keurig small setting for the hot water.
5.0	"Unlike the 5mil extracts, the 1mil extract is not prohibited by most states. More importantly, you can \\""work\\"" with it. The 5mil extract is awesome too, but the fumes area killer, it will make you cry and choke just from smelling it.

5.0	More concentrate than others, goes a long way  and makes a great martini.
5.0	If you haven't sprouted them then you are in for a Wonderful Culinary Taste Treat!!!!. Just soak 6 hours and sprout a couple days at room temp and use raw on salads or just by the handful. My favorite sprout of all time!!! (They only need a small tail to be sprouted and no cooking is required)
5.0	I do really like spicy food and I found in Sonoran Spice an incredible site to buy stuff I really appreciate it. Everything is perfectly balanced: Customer Support, packaging, price and most of all &#34;the product&#34;.
5.0	A light and dark brown powder that adds or cuts according to your needs. This is not a substitute for any other thing, it is unique in the concoction of a pleasant diet, allowing one to be higher, lower or just right in the middle when projecting your focus.
5.0	I super duper love these! I mixed in some chopped walnuts and I love them! When I went back to re-order, they are no longer available under the &#34;Add-On&#34; Program. Can Amazon put them back there? Ordering them in Subscribe & Save for 12-box per order is a little too much...
5.0	I purchased this tea because its recommended for heart health. I love the aroma. I Filled a 16 oz. tin  in addition to another tin of the same size a quarter of the way all from one bag.( So in my opinion its well worth the money because you come out cheaper ordering from Davidson's tea than purchasing from an other tea supplier with out sacrificing taste nor flavor.) I am pleased with the very high quality of tea, as well as the price. Not even Teavana's teas can match the flavor nor the price of Davidson's Tea. This tea is better tasting than Teavana's tea and better priced.
5.0	We started to buy these in bulk because my kids love them so much. They taste great and the messages are fun.
5.0	I really love the lemon flavor so these bars are a winner for me.  The are not as sweet as some of the other bars and it surprises me that that isn't a problem for me since I am a sweetaholic.  It isn't a problem and I really enjoy the bar as well as the 110 calories.  I will be reordering.  While it doesn't bother me I really don't find these chewy enough to be named chewy.  They are a little chewy but not enough.
5.0	Don't know why they don't sell these in stores. Everybody loves them!
5.0	Great! They are awesome!
5.0	Arrived much faster than expected (~1.5 weeks). Tea is nice, subtle sweet and earthy tones. Sample was included.
5.0	Great on salads and shakes. I know you can add it in as you cook but haven't tried yet
5.0	Absolutely tender and delicious.  The best you will ever try.  You won't regret paying a bit more than grocery store brands.  Thai taste is night and day difference from grocery store brands.
5.0	I purchased Great Northern Popcorn primarily because it is organic and it's important to us to eat well. We were delighted to find that in addition to being good FOR us it was also just plain good. It pops very well and has a really good flavor. We'll be ordering it again!
5.0	Really good. I was missing sandwiches and this is the solution. They also sent me some sample cookies that are very good also.
5.0	If this is really low acid, I can vouch for the fact that it tastes just like regular coffee. Don't miss the caffeine or the acid. My stomach doesn't either. I got this for my husband who has GERD. It's made a huge difference for him. A little more pricey, but well worth it! This is a find!!
5.0	Arrived quickly, bloomed fully the next day! They were beautiful!
5.0	AWESOME SOUP, NOTHING LIKE IT
5.0	Very refreshing taste and every time i drink it especially after big meal ,it let my body feel good.
5.0	For my favorite grandson. Great, as always.
5.0	I received the cinnamon and was very happy.  It was packaged very well and the product is very fresh.  Its nice to actually smell cinnamon.  I have used it and am pleased with the flavor also.  It will last me a while I am sure as there were 3 bottles.
5.0	Really good & tasty chips, can't keep everyone's hand out the bag! I buy them to snack because of my gluten allergy, but my whole family luvs them
5.0	"I've been trying to eat all natural and wanted an all natural m&m alternative.  Before these, I tried the Sunspire sundrops and they were ok, but very brittle (the individual bags were full of broken shell pieces).  The SunRidge Farms Rainbow Drops were not brittle at all and are also much more colorful.  The drops are colored by pure vegetable juice colors.<br /><br />For anybody wanting the ingredients, they are as follows:<br /><br />Chocolate Center (evaporated cane juice, unsweetened chocolate, cocoa butter, whole milk powder, soy lecithin [an emulsifier], natural vanilla), Colored Shell (evaporated cane juice, rice starch, gum arabic, tapioca dextrin, carnauba wax, natural food colorings [vegetable juice colors]).<br /><br />At the bottom of the bag it says \\""(May contain wheat, tree nuts, peanuts)\\"" for anybody that has a food allergy.<br /><br />The one positive SunSpire has over these is that they use Fair Trade certified chocolate.  I don't see anything listed  on the bag or SunRidge Farm's website that says their chocolate is Fair Trade certified."
5.0	By far, this is the best popcorn salt ever.  It tastes similar to something that we would get when I was a kid, but cannot find anymore.  The only problem I had with the order is the glass, not the salt.  They were not packed well, 1 broke completely and 4 had handles broken.  If you get the popcorn salt, I recommend the plastic bottles.
5.0	Quick ship and a tasty juice.
5.0	These are all very tasty--especially the HOT jalepe&ntilde;o! love that stuff--great stuff--great size--great non-GMO!
5.0	Have bought my salt on Amazon.  Easy, inexpensive and a ton cheaper than at the practitioner's office.  Comes nice and moist and then I transfer to a glass jar.
5.0	Taste great and is somewhat more healthy than regular spaghetti. We have to boil slightly longer for al dente, about 12 minutes.
5.0	I love The Spice Hunter products.  Salt free with excellent taste.  This time I ordered the multiple pack for a better price and to share with my friends.
5.0	Lightly sweet with a fruity but rosy taste. Reminds me of Turkish Delight or rose-flavored sweets from the local Middle Eastern bakery.<br />Whenever I want something sweet to calm my sweet tooth, I reach for this because a cup is only 95 calories (one sachet, but can be used for multiple servings in a pitcher). Luckily, I can get this for only $4 at my local Chinese grocers which also sells matcha blends for the same price!
5.0	Delicious! Filled with a ton of blueberries
5.0	These candies are ridiculously delicious.  They're addictive.  I might like the crème center ones a little better but it's a toss up.  They'e so good you can't eat just one.
5.0	"Seriously, I've been using this lovely stuff for donkey years, I think since before there was color.      There's nothing else like it.  I don't know why, I don't know how.    I'm just elated you don't have to travel all the way to Mexico any more to get ya' some, but even if you did, it'd be well worth the trip, even if that was the only reason you went there  ;-)    For real, get some of dat yummy, delicious vanilla juice.    Ok I know this sounds a bit colloquial, but the point is it doesn't have to be \\""gourmet\\"" to be gourmet!!!  So don't miss out by turning up your nose to it's origin, simple packaging, plastic pottle or reasonable price, although if you do go to Mexico you can practically get it for song on the corner, I'm just sayin'.    I think you get my point, so now you're just going to get some vanilla right?"
5.0	My gosh these are very, very good.  I have already ordered 3 packages in the past 2 months.
5.0	Hey it's clean coconut oil. Enough said.
5.0	These are our favorite pretzel sandwiches and very difficult to find locally but the item is listed as 10 oz packages (12 packs) but what we received was 8 oz packages (12 packs). We are missing 24 ounces. It makes the price a little high but they are hard to find. We notifed Amazon about the issue and are waiting for a resolution.
5.0	I love to top my muffins with these sugar crystals--they are great! I will order these again when I run out. Thank you
5.0	I love this juice, but its hard to find.
5.0	I am glad I spent my money on this. I remember eating these when I was a kid, and they are still addicting. They made me order more!!!
5.0	Works well with the soda stream.
5.0	All flavors were very tasty; BBQ is now my favorite. A great way to get some extra protein and satisfy your &#34;chip&#34; craving in a low calorie snack.
5.0	Love pumpkin..haven't received this...going on old flavor
5.0	Fantastic product!  Wonderful for overall health!!
5.0	Love Cholula, and we put it on everything from eggs for breakfast to soups, chicken, and more for supper...you can't ever go wrong with this stuff and we eat it by the half-gallon!
5.0	Ever since discovering that I had Celiac disease, I have become quite thin(which is nice) and quite resigned to my sad, cakeless fate. I have tried a number gluten free cake mixes and have been profoundly disappointed by all of them. Some fall to pieces when you slice them, some are gritty, some have an awful aftertaste from the unfamiliar flours used in making them.<br /><br />I was browsing the shelves at my local Target store when I saw this mix. It was the last box in the back row of the top shelf, and it was on sale. In short, it was calling for me. The employee who had to help me get it down turned out to be gluten intolerant as well and had good things to say about it. She recommended I use only egg whites, as the cake was a bit heavy otherwise.<br /><br />I baked up a batch last night and it made 17 normal sized cupcakes and might have made eighteen if I hadn't spent so much time tasting the batter. Mixing it up was a breeze and the Betty Crocker website has no-butter variations on its website if you're concerned about that sort of thing. If this keeps up, I probably will be in a while.<br /><br />The cupcakes came out moist and not even a little bit grainy or dry. They came out looking and tasting exactly like glutinous cupcakes. My gluten-loving boyfriend ate two and said they were excellent. The next morning they were a little dryer and firmer, but still very good. Microwaving them for a few seconds restores them to their fresh-baked state.<br /><br />I got my first box for just under 4 bucks, about the same as it is here only I had to drive to get it. For 4 bucks I got 17 cupcakes that taste better than the baked goods at the gluten free bakery in town. The bakery charges about as much for one pastry as I paid for this box, so I figure I got a good deal. I don't understand everyone who is complaining about how you don't get as much cake as a conventional Betty Crocker cake mix. Don't you all remember how much cake you get from a similarly priced Bob's Red Mill bag? Or GF pantry? Or how much a flourless chocolate cake costs at the natural foods store? A hell of a lot more.<br /><br />As much as I want to support the smaller specialty companies and their small, ethical companies...I'm going to have to pass and go to Betty Crocker for my cake needs. Sorry folks.how much a flourless chocolate cake costs at the natural foods store? A hell of a lot more.     As much as I want to support the smaller specialty companies and their small, ethical companies...I'm going to have to pass and go to Betty Crocker for my cake needs. Sorry folks.
5.0	I purchased these for Indian recipes that I frequently make. They're much more fragrant and flavorful than the usual supermarket variety, not to mention more economical!
5.0	Love the hazelnut.  I make iced cappuccino with it
5.0	These are great candies & when you take one & take one of the Lemon drops at the same time, the flavors liven up your taste buds.  Everyone I've given them to loves them.
5.0	very good flavor and not too sweet.  Closest to a good cup of coffee that we have tried.
5.0	I loved these chips. They were exactly what I had been looking for. They are not fried/greasy or baked/dry they were great-tasting, satisfying, and healthy alternative to regular potato chips. You can feel good about eating these chips. Can't say enough, you'll have to try them for yourself! I am ordering more now!
5.0	Tasted well and was nice to help kick off my new diet :)
5.0	The best curry powder you must try it.
5.0	As a vegetarian, I really do not go to Japanese restaurants.  But, sometimes I get tired of eating the same old thing at home every day.  I decided it would be fun to make nori rolls.<br /><br />I found a recipe online with marinated tofu, avocado, and julienned carrots and cucumber.  I made brown sticky rice (there are recipes online) to go with it, and bought wasabi and pickled ginger and even chopsticks so I could get the authentic experience.  It was definitely a fun dinner idea.<br /><br />These nori have a fairly strong seaweed smell when you open the package, but the flavor is mild and not at all overpowering.  They rolled up well without tearing (even though I am totally inexperienced at rolling them up and overfilled the first few) and they stayed closed.  I liked that they were scored at 1-inch intervals so I knew where to cut the rolls without making them too big or too small.<br /><br />Seaweed has a lot of vitamins and minerals in it, including vitamin A and potassium.  If you are watching your sodium intake, you may want to be cautious about what you fill your nori rolls with, but the actual sodium level of most nori is pretty low.<br /><br />At any rate, these were a fun (if somewhat complicated) dinner idea.  I thought they were high in quality (appreciate that they're organic) and I'm glad I had a chance to try them.  (The included bamboo mat definitely helps with the rolling and can be hand-washed and reused.)<br /><br />Product provided by the manufacturer for evaluation purposes.
5.0	Tastes just like sugar!  Love it in my tea!
5.0	I just have to recommend this product to anyone who hates to chop garlic.<br />This really tastes like fresh garlic - actually, it's a little better, as it is stronger tasting than the real thing.<br />Try it - you won't be disappointed.
5.0	Never have lamb without.
5.0	Delivered as promised
5.0	Product was delivered promptly and undamaged. Excellent purchase.
5.0	fun for teenage partys!
5.0	This is for fifteen one liter plastic bottles of LaCroix berry sparkling water.  LaCroix is the best selling domestic sparkling water brand in the USA.A true American favorite for over 30 years, LaCroix has the distinction of being the number one sparkling water brand sold in cans. Pronounced &#34;la-croy&#34;, No Calories - No Artificial Sweetners. Each Plastic bottle is a liter
5.0	DEEEEEEEELISH!!!! ADDICTIVE!!!
5.0	"Very dark chocolate. Very smooth chocolate. Very necessary chocolate. This is the type of chocolate that is as good for your heart as red wine. And it definitely does not hurt your feelings to eat it! We have developed the habit of eating 3-4 pieces after dinner in lieu of dessert. Since we've been doing the 17-day diet, this makes it bearable as well as adding the anti-oxidant and flavonoids that are important to health. It's such a great signal to \\""end\\"" the day's eating, we seldom eat anything after that bit of Dove! BONUS: We've each lost about 20-25 lb in the 3 months we've been using this practice."
5.0	Tasty dried pairs. Chewy but still a bit moist, which is just like I like them. A little pricey but you get what you pay for. I would recommend these to others.
5.0	A household favorite! I pack these in the kids lunch and they love them. I like them for a quick snack too. Pretty good!
5.0	I ate 8 bags in two days and could not feel my bum for like a week. Defiantly something i will get again
5.0	Loved the brew - had tried it in Windsor Colorado and just had to get some of my own.  Thanks it is great.
5.0	Well made and does not take up a lot of space !
5.0	A friend introduced me to Calbee Snacks.  They are $2.50 at the grocery store, but only $1.00 through Amazon.  The serving size is &#34;about 22 pieces&#34;.  I was satisfied after eating half that amount.  I'm looking forward to trying the other varieties.
5.0	I've been giving these freeze dried broccoli's to my baby probably since she was 10ish months old. As soon as she was ready to move from pureed veggies, to picking up small things I started with these.<br />There really great because these little 'green treats' are not only setting a foundation for healthy eating, but the finger usage needed to pick them up off the highchair is great for her fine motor skills.<br />I'm a fan..and my now 13 month baby loves broccoli!
5.0	"I used to only make coffee with k-cups in my Keurig. I would make tea, but just used the hot water and my own tea bags...figured that it wasn't worth the extra cost. Boy was I wrong! I was at a hotel and they had keurig machines and had a few K-cups of tea there...I took them home to maybe try...and was very pleasantly surprised when I did! Why was I fussing with bags and steeping times, when I can have a perfect cup with the touch of a button? I mean, I bought the machine for the convenience, why wasn't I doing that with tea?<br /><br />I liked the Celestial Seasonings Earl Grey the best from those samples, but took a chance on the Bigelow here because it was cheaper, and found I liked it more. It has a nice sweetish, flavor...and Earl Grey IS supposed to have that nice citrus flavor from the infusion of orange...this does. I found the other brand to almost be slightly spicy which I DO like (especially in Constant Comment which I am STILL waiting for in K-cups), but it didn't seem \\""clean\\"" like the Earl Grey I know. I even use the large size button and the tea is still good...though obviously not as strong as the small. I like mine with sugar only...but this flavor lends itself well to honey, lemon...or even (yes!) maple sugar (or even syrup!)<br /><br />Just a straightforward, easy-to-like cup of tea.<br /><br />Edit: You may want to keep an eye on the price of this (and most k-cups) here because the prices and sellers seem to change."
5.0	I ordered these for a baby shower and they are beautiful. Also, they taste great. Customer service was beyond excellent from candy machines. Perfect!
5.0	I continue to order Zevia soda.  It is a very good vegan product.
5.0	This coffee has been a favorite of ours, and we had difficulty finding it. the price and the quality were great
5.0	This is the most gorgeous presentation. In addition to being pretty to the eye, the teas are all marvelous. My friends have loved the opportunity to select their tea from the gift box, and each cup has brought compliments. I plan to order this set of teas again.
5.0	Amazing fragrance.  Now I know what Cinnamon really smells like.  Love it.  Gave some to my brother.  Definitely would buy again.
5.0	I ordered these and a can from the more expensive seller on amazon.  They are exactly the same as far as I can tell.  Delicious flavor and great texture, perfect for pasta/pizza sauce.
5.0	I have just placed my second order for this. I now most always use Bran Oil over Olive Oil.  It is much better for you and I love the taste.  It seems to give my vegetables a much crisper taste.
5.0	These are, hands down, THE BEST SNACK BARS I have EVER eaten. Nice dark chocolate with it's slight bitterness, tart dried cherries and natural ingredients... what more could you want? Like their name, they're nice and chewy. Nice taste, great texture, and it actually fills you up! Even my husband (AKA The Bottomless Pit) agrees. The price is okay here on Amazon, but if you look in Target or Walmart, you may be able to find them for as little as $2.25 a box.
5.0	Amazing Product!!!!! Will purchase from again.
5.0	fancy little candies  - great for a little gift or a treat for yourself.
5.0	Just as described. Would buy again.
5.0	Great favor. Great value.
5.0	Artuso  is pure IS PURE Italian. everything I BOUGHT FROM THEM I GIVE IT AN A+. everytime I think of Artuso I thing delicious and quality.
5.0	Love the tea. It is wonderful tasting and I dont add any sugar....which is where I can get myself in trouble! All natural flavor!
5.0	very nice and convenient.  i always purchase this in bulk.  do so much baking and packing.  great deal.  thank you
5.0	"I can't really compare these to other similar products (Slim Jim,etc.), as I had never had jerky-type snacks before I got these.  I decided to take a long road trip (4500 miles round trip), and I have a tendency to get drowsy if I don't get enough protein.  I decided to carry these plus some string cheese in the car to tide me over between meal stops.<br /><br />I really like these.  The flavor is good, the texture is fine, and the \\""damage\\"" from a diet standpoint is minimal (these are 60 cal apiece, based on the Jack Links site).  They're not too salty, either.  Having them on the trip from Bellingham, WA to St. Louis, MO and back was a huge help.  One or two of these provided just the right amount of tasty protein.  The size and packaging is handy, too, and easy to open when driving.<br /><br />I now keep them on hand for when I need a little pick-me-up."
5.0	"I have been ordering from this company on autoship- I will be so happy when the shipping is not as costly- This is by far the most amazing product-Pasta with NO and I mean NO calories- Rinse(the slight odor is NOT the noodle but the fermenting water- Place in microwave to \\""dry off\\"" about 3 min. then make your favorite pasta dish- I am a SIZE 4 AND STAY THAT WAY BECAUSE OF THIS STUFF MY HUSBAND IS DIABETIC AND IS SOOoooHAPPY HE CAN HAVE \\""PASTA\\"" DISHES all he wants and NO yes NO carbs- This product has changed our lives- really!!!!! My children have yet to realize they are not eating pasta!!!:) Maybe I'll tell them some day!!!"
5.0	I loved this sampler. The added flavors were well balanced with the coffee. But what I love the most is the pull tab for the foil lid and the easy removal of the filter so everything can be recycled or composted unlike other brands that can't  or are difficult to disassemble.
5.0	This was the first time I purchased the Apple Cider and will do so again, when needed.  I definitely enjoyed the flavor.
5.0	I love my mixture of Kix and Multi-Grain Cheerios each morning.  I am a creature of habit.  I have trouble finding the large 18 oz packages.  Love to be able to get a small case of these, delivered right to my door, and have them ship with Prime, to boot!  So convenient!
5.0	Pink salt, who could ask for more?
5.0	I bought these crackers to use with soup and I think they are excellent.  Great taste and they arrived in fresh and crispy condition.
5.0	I decided to try macha after I had read an article about its supposed benefits. I was shocked at how expensive this stuff is! So, I started reading all the Amazon.com reviews of the various offerings in this category. Two things became obvious, most of the products offered are brown upon arrival, and are products of China. So, when I came across this particular offering, I decided to give it a try for two reasons. One, they say it is from Japan, not China, and two, it was less expensive.  So, I ordered it, and even though I used Amazon Prime's two day shipping, I received it four days later, but, at the time I ordered it, the date was given, so I at least I knew - I guess the 2-day shipping days are over with Amazon. Anyway, when the item arrived, I was very pleasantly surprised to find that it was very fresh in its heavy-duty pouch, and the tea was a brilliant shade of green! I made myself a cup with a slightly heaped teaspoon, and it tasted like strong green tea, a flavor I like. I didn't find it to be bitter, but I toned it down a little on the cup I had the next day. The caffeine content must be high, because I react to too much caffeine with a feeling of over anxiousness, which is why I don't drink coffee.  But, in this case, I can control the amount so I will simply use less at a time and probably have two cups a day instead of one strong one.  It tastes great, and if the stated benefits are true in terms of anti-oxidants, etc., then I'll consider that a big plus. I have not tried the other similar products on Amazon, but judging from the reviews, I think I happened on the correct one to buy, I do recommend this item for those interested (I just wish this stuff wasn't so pricey).
5.0	This is good enough to subscribe to. I especially like it hot on a salad. 1\2 can hot on a salad with a bit of grated cheese or sour cream and you have a quick great lunch or dinner. Taco chips or Dorritos on the side for an extra treat.
5.0	This product arrived as described and on time for my son's baseball themed birthday party.  The portion size was perfect for a little snack (and little hands) and our guests enjoyed them very much.
5.0	Great deal and I love the subscribe and save! Can't wait to make more delicious recipes with these.
5.0	I had the good fortune to find these bars of Madagascar chocolate with Sakay & Cinnamon at a Burlington, VT discount store that specializes in gourmet cheeses & wines and other delicious things.  The bars are small but so was the price: $1.99 so I splurged and bought 3 of the small bars and now I wish I'd bought more: Those small bars pack in a huge surprise in terms of taste.. the chocolate itself is great.. I love Madagascar chocolate.. but the sakay pepper made it even better.. not too hot, not too mild.. just the right balance between spice and sweet.. and the finish is great-- sorry, I just can't put words around it so you'll have to try it for yourself and see what I mean.. but believe me.. if you like exotic chocolate with a touch of spice-- go for this one!
5.0	Love that it's decaf.  Love the flavor.  It's nice that it's sold in this quantity as I run out frequently.
5.0	Good quality.  Varied sizes, some quite large.  Rehydrated well.  I made my first recipe with the Morels tonight:  &#34;Madeira Chicken with Morels&#34;, and it turned out great.  Just be sure to strain the soaking liquid through a coffee filter.
5.0	Cool limited edition flavor! I personally love dark chocolate better than milk but the creamy white chocolate centers made these taste great! Worth the spring purchase!
5.0	Very acceptable coffee for a fraction of the boutique blends!  We have a couple of serious coffee drinkers in the house, but paying $1 a cup just doesn't make sense in today's economy.  We felt the Grove Square product was as flavorful as the Brand X coffees, and a much more sensible price point.
5.0	makes mixing even and smooth only downside keep the bottle of Torani wash it out this pump only fits the Torani Bottle
5.0	Swerve really is the best. It does not cause an insulin response and the taste is fantastic! No weird aftertaste. Perfect for my coffee and baking.<br /><br />The only con is the price. Hopefully the price will come down soon.
5.0	I had never heard of this brand, but I decided to give it a try. I'm glad I did! I liked all but a couple of the flavors (they were too strong for me), especially the flavored cups. My friend (who likes strong coffee) loved the two flavors I didn't and agreed with me that we will definitely be buying this brand in the future. It is worth a try.
5.0	Wonderful product highly recommended.  Everytime I give to my 2yr old daughter the strawberries she thinks she is getting a special treat, she does not realize that I would give this to her all day long.
5.0	not loaded with salt like some spice blends.  we enjoyed it quite a bit.
5.0	I am extremely happy with this product. It s hard to find in the stores, or it isn't always stocked. The price is fantastic, so I got 2 lbs! And got free shipping! It tastes just like the product I store bought in a smaller shaker bottle, so I just refilled that for convienience. I use it on popcorn, pasta & olive oil tossed with fresh tomatoes and Basil, on top of Baked potatoes, and sometimes on top of salads.
5.0	This ramen noodle is the best out of all.
5.0	Great Snack, low carbs, and individual pack to watch calories and portions while curing the munches in between meals!  tasty too!
5.0	Love the dark roast for my Senseo! I feel like I'm having a low-foam cappuccino!
5.0	Love this product - all natural and a great price!
5.0	Right price, tastes great!
5.0	"I was looking for something healthy to eat during work, since the fresh fruit machine was taken out of the building because &lt;yelling>everyone else at work eats candy bars and chips all day long!!&lt;/yelling> I can't blame them, the fruit was kind of expensive, but anyways I found this bar on Amazon. Saw the reviews were positive so I bought it. I have to admit the bar isn't the prettiest thing to look at and has a slight shine to it (probably because of the fruit in it). The taste though is great. It's not too sweet and the nuts have a nice firmness to them. If you're looking for a little \\""pick me up\\"" during your long day that does not involve tons of caffeine and sugar(14g per bar), and still tastes good I would recommend this product.<br /><br />Next I'm going to either try the Wild Blueberry bar or the cranberry orange."
5.0	Yummy yummy smell. The aroma is super power and it makes my whole house smell like vanilla. Very good price for the big bottle. It will last me a while.
5.0	came fast and the work just as they said thay would.  thank u we tryed everything to get rid of the roaches and this the only thing that got rid of them highly rekamened.
5.0	Tweaked it a little and made delicious cornbread.  Organic ingredients.  Will definitely buy more.
5.0	These coconut chips are amazing! I tried a sample a while pack through my old Hammock Pack subscription and fell in love with them. Now I enjoy ordering them from Amazon.
5.0	These are excellent pastes! I prefer them to the Mae Ploy curry pastes* which all taste the same to me. The red really stands out and is actually Thai level of heat (really spicy for most people).<br /> Traditional Thai curries can take a long time to prepare and depending on where you live, you might not have access to some of the ingredients. Does your neighborhood market carry galangal and lemongrass? If not, pick up these pastes and some coconut milk and you'll have a very quick and delicious start to an excellent Thai curry.<br /><br />*disclaimer - It is only the Mae Ploy curry pastes that I have this issue with. Their other products are very good, in particular their coconut milk, it is by far the best available in a can.
5.0	My mother now lives in the USA but she's from France and makes a super salad dressing. When I complimented her, she said &#34;It would be even better with<br />a REAL French mustard.&#34; So I bought her this one and she was thrilled!
5.0	Works great in my bread-maker.  Cannot beat the price.
5.0	I sent it to my son, who is in the Navy, he lives on protein- and I always like to include jerky in his Care packages.  I tried this to add something different.  He said, and I quote; &#34;really good, good flavors, buy it again&#34;.  A simple recommendation....perhaps the flavors are not for everyone, but to change around your jerky ..give it a try.
5.0	I don't know how people can eat milk chocolate M&Ms after eating these.  They are so much better.  The bags that I received seemed very fresh and the shells were nice and crispy.
5.0	These are always well received and are perfect to go with hummus or other dips. They are crunchy, not fried, and since the flavor is neutral they go with everything.
5.0	When we purchased the Keurig unit, we began the long search for the very best coffee available in K-Cups.  As we appreciate a truly excellent cup of coffee, we spent considerable time and money in 'THE SEARCH'.  Finally, FINALLY, we tried this Tully's and our search, by now a quest, came to pleasurable end.  On any level, this is the best of the best!  This is no ad...just a note to you from coffee lovers in the Northwest!
5.0	Merckens has to be the best company for their coatings. Wilton's are just o.k. but Merckens are GREAT. I have never had a batch of merckens seize on me while melting for cake pops or candy. They don't get lumpy either if I have to use a microwave to quickly re-liquefy them, etiher. I am a huge fan of Merckens (and they've never melted in transit either!)
5.0	Love this flavor!!! So glad it comes in sugar-free as I am diabetic and I don't have to worry about sugar content!!
5.0	I've had many different types of maca powder over the years, and this one is my favorite overall because it's organic, a great price, and works great. If you don't know about the many benefits of maca then I suggest you read about them online or in one of the more detailed reviews, but I can tell you this brand gave me positive results within just a few days.
5.0	These fruitcakes are always the best!
5.0	My mom LOVED her flowers!
5.0	I agree that the new packaging also seemed to reduce the strength of the french vanilla, but it is still my all-time favorite hot chocolate, and it needs to be sold in all groceries!! Even my husband, who's only a chocolate milk drinker usually, and doesn't like hot chocolate, likes this.
5.0	Best way to buy my favorite candies and be able to share with many others. I take as much or as little as i want with me while traveling.
5.0	Starbucks rarely has it in stock. Great price on Amazon. You know it is available . It is delicious. You add  half tea and half milk the tea is concentrated it goes a long way. I also buy the syrup not on line due to delivery charges but with prime there is no delivery. So one click it is. Then had whip cream. Heavenly.
5.0	Love, love, love it.  I use it to make my roasted dandelion coffee and it's sooooo good I'll never go back to coffee again.  This is so much more healthy and nutritional and better tasting.  I would highly recommend this product.
5.0	delivered in a timely manner and as described.  Well packaged, good price, what else is there.  I highly recommend.
5.0	I bought a sampler pack of Riehle's varieties and this was my favorite of the lot. Once popped, you get a lot of variety in size, flavor, and color -- some popped more large, some smaller, some bright white, some more yellowish, some had a stronger corn flavor, some a little more sweet... I like eating it one kernel at a time so I can really enjoy the differences. Also, Riehle's has excellent customer service. 2 of my packets arrived partially open, somehow. I emailed them and within a day they had dispatched not just 2 replacements, but FOUR. Thanks, Riehles! You guys are great!
5.0	I have purchased two packs of these bars over the last few months. The first time I got the old style, and most recently I received the &#34;New & Improved&#34; bars.<br /><br />I liked the old bars pretty well. They had a good taste, but were so dense / compressed it was like chewing a wad of bubblegum.<br /><br />The new bars are a big improvement. They are a little &#34;fluffier&#34;, not as compacted or stiff, which makes eating them less of a chore. The added soy crisps add a little more texture and flavor variety in each bite.<br /><br />The price here is great. At my local store these are about $3 each.<br /><br />I will order again when I run out (which won't be long).
5.0	I sent these to my 95 year old father and he loved them.  They make a very nice gift.  Yum
5.0	I can buy  big bags of these at my local Sams Club but I needed small bags for my boys lunch box.  They love all the Stacys pita chip flavors.
5.0	saw these on slickdeals, thought I'd give them a try, they're actually really good. My favorite is probably the clementine and least fav is the green apple. But they're all really good. a little on the expensive side compared to other beverages but that's expected I guess.
5.0	I was served this coffee by a cousin I visited in Boston and was totally hooked.  I like strong coffee and I had to add an extra scoop for that. The taste is so pure and no bitter flavor.  Very happy I tried it.
5.0	Decaf usually tastes funny or at least different from regular tea.  I almost enjoy this decaf better than the regular.  Highly recommended.
5.0	I love this little box of Numi assorted organic teas. Will buy again.
5.0	Yum! New flavor every day.
5.0	Great value.  I hestitated a bit to get this, thought it was just too much Truvia for my own good.  But the price pulled me in, eight at $50 total.  Even on sale in the store it isn't that low.  It's closer to $8 each normally.  I use it only for my morning coffee, but it goes faster than I think.  If I want to make desserts guilt free, it can be used in place of sugar...it has a chart on back of the bag with amts of Truvia to use in place of sugar--basically you use half the amt of Truvia for the same effect of sugar, but it has a whole lot less than half the calories.  It arrived today and all the bags are dated one year from the date of purchase, that's fair. Glad I got it.
5.0	Just used this product for the first time in a recipe that I got from the internet (http://www.heathernicholds.com/recipes/matcha-lime-chia-pudding?awt_l=I6fOw&awt_m=3XB.4HHELocO_ZW).  Final result was that we were very satisfied with the result.
5.0	Favorite candy but an acquired taste. Good to have available online since they are very difficult to find. I like the small packages as it does not encourage one to eat lots of them at a time (but you can always have two). A little bit like Smarties but not quite.
5.0	Used beans to make homemade vanilla for Christmas presents. Great quality!
5.0	The stand and stuff taco shells are better than the regular shells, at least in my opinion, in that they give you more room to put your favorite taco ingredients. In general, we just like them better. These nacho shells are even better. if you like nacho Doritos then you will like these.  A bit of extra flavor added to your taco is nice right off the bat. And in my house we have to fight to get anything in them. My wife just likes to eat them right out of the box. You will have to think about your filling because not every filling will be a perfect match for these shells. But for a classic taco filling these will be perfect. Enjoy.
5.0	These are great! You really taste the fruit,much better than most other fruit bars I've tried. Strongly recommended! Shipping was fast and they were fresh tasting.
5.0	This seller has fresh and tasty product. I think I have found the seller from whom I will be buying again in near future. They are rare in today business world, these sellers who offer tasty and fresh products like these. I have selected him and urge you to try him too, you will not be disappointed.
5.0	If you like your coffee like it is supposed, Strong, Dark and flavorfull without being bitter, this is it! Great
5.0	i love turkish figs!  and these take me back to istanbul!
5.0	Good taste for instant.  Simple to use and tasty!
5.0	I have the subscribe and save on this item.  Can't beat the price anywhere!  Very pleased, and all I have to do is make a few clicks and it arrives at my front door.
5.0	can't go wrong with Mandarin orange
5.0	Wow, it tastes just like carbonated pussy, everyone who has tried it agrees, I won't purchase any more, I was just curious, but my friends are purchasing cases of it, lol, it's just as pictured and described, try it you may like it.
5.0	I thought that this product would be water with a hint of flavour. But, much to my taste buds delight, it is delicious and goes down very easily. You must try this product. And to add a little variety, put it in the freezer for a refreshing slush drink.
5.0	I hate the taste of regular quinoa, but quinoa is supposed to be good for you, so I'm glad I tasted this marriage of quinoa and brown rice in garlic. Sometimes this is all I have for lunch with a dab of butter. It's not only filling, but it tastes divine!!!! And I feel healthier for eating both brown rice and quinoa, and garlic's good for you too.
5.0	Fast service and excellent product.  The really do taste better than other brands of Dry Roasted Cashews I've tried.
5.0	It is the best tea i have had in a very long time.I make it every evening right before dinner.It is also less expensive than tea you get in restaurants,and much tastier.
5.0	This is by far the best flavor for SodaStream and great that it's only 5 calories per glass. The lemon taste is a bit strong, but if you love lemon flavor (e.g. lemon candy) this will be great. You can add a bit less syrup than usual so it won't be so strong, but highly recommended flavor!
5.0	Excellent product...it doesn't get much better than this!
5.0	Perhaps its just me. Mmm just got my 1st batch, great tasting, earthy, and has many medicinal benefits, it was recommended to remove aluminum toxicity & ammonium from my blood, by my neurologist, which is rare these days, as most docs are always at the ready to take out the prescription pad. Love it, taste great will buy much much more
5.0	Love it! Very happy with this purchase. Thank you.
5.0	Fast delivery.  Good value.
5.0	Fresh, chewy and delicious.  This medley of dark chocolate and milk chocolate covered nuts is the perfect thing for anyone who enjoys nuts.
5.0	Hazelnut is one of my favorite flavors of coffee beans! These beans are by far the best for your money!  Highly recommend!
5.0	These tortilla crumbs are superior to most all other types and brands of crumbs/breading we've tried.  We love using them on all types of fish and were dismayed when our favorite local grocery chain stopped stocking them.  Fortunately we're able to order through Amazon and they qualify for the usual free shipping offer when buying $25+ of items.  We don't really need six cans at a time but so far they seem to keep very well in their airtight containers.  The online Amazon price (without shipping) is very similar to what our in-store price was.
5.0	What can I say? I love Milky Ways!<br /><br />Definitely my favorite candy bar. Dangerous to have them so readily available! We had very few trick-or-treaters this year, so this was overbuying.  :)
5.0	It is great.  I have been drinking it for several months and I like the taste and it makes a big difference in my acid reflux.  Matter of fact, I am fixing to order more.
5.0	cooks perfectly every time and is a real treat if youre not into the cakey taste of ordinary brownies but really want something fudgey that you dont have to eat too much of. perfect straight out of the oven over mint chocolate chip ice cream!
5.0	BEST COFFEE - GO NUTS WHEN I RUN OUT!
5.0	The Chia seeds blended well into food I made without changing the flavor.  Perfect for sneaking extra nutrition into the family meals.  It looks like spice you might add.
5.0	I like that I can now buy Irn-Bru in the US.  I was going to give this three stars because I am finding far too many bottles with very little carbonation; but I decided to give it four stars for convenience. (bottles are sealed)<br /><br />In the last shipment, all 24 bottles seem to be flat; Irn-Bru should be full of carbonation just like they sell it in Scotland.<br /><br />I though shipping may have something to do with the low carbonation, but I brought 36 bottles back with me this summer and all were highly carbonated.  Not sure why these bottles are like that<br /><br />UPDATE 6/19/14<br />Cannot remember the last time I had a bad shipment with low carbonation, the last 6-8 months have been great.
5.0	"Popcorner chips taste great, but don't be fooled by the \\""low calorie\\"" bit.  They are low in fat compared to regular potato chips, but the calories are fairly close.  For example, the calorie count for 1oz of Popcorners is about 120.  The calorie count for 1oz of Kettle Chips is 150.<br /><br />That being said, if you aren't thinking you're eating them for health reasons, they're great and tasty as a snack!  You can buy them at your local Costco too."
5.0	Great flavor, easy to prepare, a click above the competition!  My family has tried many options and flavore of coffee, but this is the one we come back to.  It is on auto delivery so we never run out!
5.0	I bought this many time to send to my nieces in college! It always met with rave reviews.
5.0	Love the product. Have used it for many years. It's delicious and one of the &#34;healthier&#34; snacks.<br />My two dogs expect their treat along with me every night at 7:30. So funny. They can tell time.<br /><br />Highly recommend you at least try it. I do believe you will want more.
5.0	Hi everybody, I ordered this k-cups and besides the good service of Amazon shipping, it is a wonderful product, it is what they say, it is a wonderful coffee, I just tried my first cup and I think I will be buying this product so often, it is amazing!!!
5.0	A nice sticky rice with a high starch content.  Reminds me a lot of Diamond G calrose rice I grew up on in Hawaii.  Very sticky after a light rinse, starch can be controlled some with multiple rinses prior to cooking.  Good stuff!
5.0	Tastes delish. Makes perfect Kettle Corn.
5.0	What more needs to be said? It's Ghirardelli!  Their quality makes baked goods fabulous!  ❤
5.0	What is a day without a espresso, Illy has the best, I have tried many many before, and for the last three years Illy is my choice, and will be in the future.
5.0	I love this flavored coffee, it is so complimentary to the various creamers I use!!!!<br />I love it soooo much, I have shared it with my family members!
5.0	My favorite; love it!
5.0	Great sauce, just a little expensve
5.0	I tend to grind my own coffee (which arrives in the mail every two weeks, freshly roasted), get water to the exact right temperature, and do a timed press in my [[ASIN:B0047BIWSK Aeropress]]. I'm a bit of a coffee snob... or, rather, I like my coffee to taste *good*.<br /><br />My daughter got a Keurig for her birthday, and it's become the family Keurig. I snubbed it after trying the sampler coffee that came with it... it was just not very good. I tried a few others over the following weeks, but decided I'd never like it... until my wife bought these. I've always liked Peets, and this is true to the taste I've enjoyed from their locations.<br /><br />Is it as good as fresh-ground roasted-a-few-days-ago coffee just pressed with perfectly hot water? No.<br /><br />But it is really good nevertheless, and a lot easier when I'm in a rush, or, more often, when I'm out of my every-two-weeks coffee and need my fix.<br /><br />By the way, you can peel off the top when done, dump the grounds (outside, if you compost, or in the trash), tear out the filter, and recycle the plastic cup and the little disk that's inside on the bottom... makes me feel less landfill guilt.
5.0	My son was getting married and his fiance had to have gluten free cake.  So I tried this to make the wedding cake and everyone loved it.  They said it was the best gluten free cake they had eaten!  I was very pleased with this product.  I bought 16 cake mixes to be sure I had enough because most gluten free things don't rise.  But they baked up like a regular cake so I only had to use 9 cake mixes to make a three tier wedding cake.  I was very pleased with this product.
5.0	It's difficult to understand why there are negative reviews.  I have purchased the Angel Hair and the Fettucini noodles, they are wonderful.  No weight gain required to enjoy these noodles.  They really don't have any taste as some have complained about.  They pick up the flavor from the sauces you use.  Such as spaghetti sauce, Asian stir frys, etc.  If you follow the instructions & keep your sauce in mind, you'll love them.  Thanks Miracle Noodle, they truely are a miracle.
5.0	All are excellent products! We loved each one of them and ordered individual boxes of our favorite ones.<br />If you need a protein bar this is the one.
5.0	This is the best coffee Nespresso made.
5.0	Excellent product; delivery a little slow, but free.  Definitely would order again from Amazon.[[ASIN:B000H27NWO Bear Creek Country Kitchens Creamy Potato Soup Mix, 11.0 Ounce Bags (Pack of 6)]]
5.0	These almonds are by far the best Marcona Almonds available. I first found them @ Williams and Sonoma and absolutly loved them. Williams and Sonoma no longer carries them :( Try them you'll love them.
5.0	This is an excellent deal with Subscribe and Save!
5.0	I am seriously addicted to Krave jerkies despite the price and somewhat skimpy quantities,  The pack contains one each of Garlic Chili Pepper Beef Jerky, Sweet Chipotle Beef Jerky, Chili Lime Beef Jerky, Pineapple Orange Beef Jerky.  My favorite is the Chili Lime Beef which is sweet, tangy and pungent.  Great food and I can make a meal out of a pack. Also check out their [[ASIN:B00A8QVEHY Krave Basil Citrus Turkey Jerky (4/3.25 oz)]].
5.0	My family and I love these Turkish Delights! We went to Turkey twice, and sampled many of their delights. The ones we bought from Marmara are better than any of the ones we tried there.<br /><br />It's not overly sweet like other brands, so you can taste the light hints of flavor without it being overpowering. It goes perfectly with their Turkish Black Coffee! Highly recommend this brand.
5.0	great product...arrived quickly and tastes yummy!  This is a healthy choice to chocolate products and it tastes great as well.  Thank you for providing healthy products that taste great as well.
5.0	These are delicious!  Just wish there was more in a snack size bag and/or that they came in a full size bag!  Has a bugles-like flavor.
5.0	I absolutely love these they really taste better than the peanut butter cups at the grocery store the only thing I didn't like was it wasn't enough but I will be ordering again!!!
5.0	This is a very good product for seasoning beef, chicken and other meats. It has a good flavor and I use it on just about any meat that I prepare.
5.0	Super tasty and had been great for calming my motion sickness. Used it on a cruise with family and I think my brother became addicted to it. 3 Lbs of ginger is a lot so there was plenty to share. This has a fair amount of heat as compared with some of the other dried ginger varieties. Too strong for some that tried it but I thought it was great.
5.0	The BEST K-Cup out there. We only buy this flavor. Amazon's price can't be beat anywhere!
5.0	Ireally like black licorce and this is my favorite brand.Much easier to order on line then to go from store to store looking for it! Cheaper too!
5.0	served a purpose even though a bit dull and did not taste or smell like Sesame Seeds like mine does when I make it at home?
5.0	I often use these extracts for baking and this one went into a soda I was making from scratch, using yeast to carbonate it. It is so delicious. I also put a few drops in hot Earl Gray tea and that was fabulous!! The obvious choice will be to use it for a whipped frosting for some lovely spring cupcakes. But even in plain club soda, its a winner, pure and natural tasting lavender essense!
5.0	Good all around quality product. I have become a big fan of white pepper over the traditional black pepper. The flavor it adds is superior to black pepper. This particular product is very good guilty, finely ground and very tasty too; all at a good price.
5.0	Excellent quality at a very good price. Service is excellent.Arrived n time.
5.0	I love the deep bold flavor.
5.0	I have ordered this assortment a couple of times and have always been pleased.<br />This one has the bars that are getting harder to find.Usually its the same old<br />standard candies..Not this one....You get<br />8 Hershey Cookies and Cream Bars<br />8 Reeses Pieces<br />4 Rolos<br />4 Whatchamacallit<br />Always fresh and arrives packaged well with fast shipping..<br />Hope this one stays around...
5.0	Anyone who has gone vegan or vegetarian knows how much you miss tacos. I tried this and I just can't believe how good it is! I made hard shell tacos with this today and soy cheese and I just can't believe how fabulous it tastes. The falafel this company makes is pretty good too!<br /><br />Please don't ever stop making this stuff! None of my carnivore family can even tell this is soy....If you are on the fence about this, don't hesitate-try it! The people who are saying it's too salty are entitled to their opinion, but this has no more salt in it than any other taco I've had in my life.
5.0	These cacao nibs are so healthful! They are non-GMO and also grown organically without harmful pesticides. They contain lots of important nutrients such as crucial flavonoids, fatty acids, and minerals. These little nibs are also rich in theobromine which keeps my energy high all day, without caffeine! I like munching on small handfuls, knowing I am adding wonderful, healthful things to my diet. I am eager to try them in my homemade breads. They do not melt in cookies, but add texture and crunch! They are good in salad. So, find lots of ways to incorporate these valuable nibs into your diet! Great price too!
5.0	These fig bars are moist, fresh and delicious. It is nice to know there are some healthy yet tasty snacks available.
5.0	this coconut oil tastes really good. It is creamy and feel very pure, almost as if you are eating a fresh coconut.
5.0	Everything as described was in the box. My personal favorite are the Jalopeno Cheddar Chettos, and the Spicy Nacho Doritos. I take them in my lunch, and gave the other non-appetizing flavors to my siblings. (haha)<br /><br />And, to the people saying that they're receiving the wrong product, try and order from BiceWholesale, that's where I got mine from.
5.0	When you make ice coffee in a K-Cup machine it has to be strong in order for the ice to melt and not ruin the coffee. This is the only decaf I have found that passes the test and makes a damn fine ice coffee.
5.0	I love this mellow vanilla coffee. I even bought a coffee grinder so I could use it. I don't like &#34;burnt&#34; tasting French Roast coffees, nor do I want an insipid flavorless brew. I'm adverse to bitterness, but want a true coffee taste and smell. The vanilla in this coffee doesn't hit you over the head or taste artificial. Preferences vary, but if you like medium roast flavored coffees, give this one a try.
5.0	The chips were a gift for my husband. He had tried for months to get these favorite childhood chips from someone on Amazon, but there were so many fraudulent sellers.  This 5 stars is for the seller we ordered from (Premiere Life in London). They shipped the chips in less than 2 weeks. They were perfect and he was thrilled.
5.0	Delicious. I buy repetedly. Lots of chuncks apple and cherry. I treid the straberry and bluberriy and they are as good as this one.
5.0	This sugar is good all the way around - less processing, tastes good, no down-sides that I've found.<br /><br />One thing, though...we first tried it because I found it at our local Walmart in the Latin foods section - and it was less than three dollars for a four pound bag.  You may want to check around and see if it is carried locally, because there are better deals on price.
5.0	Oops scuse me -- got peanut butter stuck on the roof of my mouth. Skippy - I LOOVE you!!!<br /><br />I've been consuming Skippy ever since I was a little tiny child who just BARELY knew how to slap peanut butter on a slice of bread and then slap jelly and another slice of bread over it and then head for school (Mom NEVER made our lunches). Truth be told, I once even slapped some sardines under the jelly -- I never did that again.<br /><br />I have seen MANY competitors come and go and even -- gasp!! -- tried some of those products, but always came back to the familiar taste and texture and comfort of Skippy -- whether Chunky or Smooth -- I LOOVE Skippy.
5.0	I love bacon and I also love Cheddar.  So, that's why I love this seasoning.  I sprinkle it on things like chicken strips, fries, chicken quesadillas, velveeta rice and velveeta pasta.
5.0	I've never bought fish sauce before so I don't have much to compare this off of. However, I find this sauce extremely good. To me it actually smells good and provides an excellent flavor profile when used in small amounts on white rice. That said, my pregnant wife finds the smell revolting. It may seem a bit pricey to some, but it's a huge bottle and you'd have to use it all the time to think it wasn't worth the price for how much you get. Try it in your hamburgers, it provides that extra punch and kicks them up a notch!
5.0	Yummy as hell but not to be confused with something good for you. These are like less bad candy bars. Getting a box is also dangerous because they are so good you might wind up killing the whole box in two days (or maybe that's just me).
5.0	This stuff is great. My wife bought it for me and it looked kind of weird but I ended up loving it so much I came on Amazon to see the cost of a case
5.0	If you hate eating, you'll love these things.If you don't have time to eat, these are great.If you are feeling hungry all the time and don't know why, these are great.If you run out of food sometimes and can't get to food supply right away, these are really great.If you're a bodybuilder, these are also truly wonderful.I will buy more.
5.0	These nuts are very good, as mentioned in a previous review, they are a perfect blend of chocolate and a thin layer of toffee surrounding the macadamia nut.<br /><br />They are a little rich... if you're not in possession of a sweet tooth, you can only do a few at a time.
5.0	I've been using this bean for the past year when making my own dark whole bean blend.  It has a rich, warm taste and never a hint of over roasting.  It is great by itself as well, but when blended with other beans it allows me to create a complex flavor.  The price is reasonable as well.
5.0	I have tried many K-cup varities since getting my Keurig machine, but this was by far my favorite.  I love the flavor and the fact there there is no bitter aftertaste with it.  If you like strong coffee, definitely try this!
5.0	These are a family favorite! It is nice to get a big box of them! A huge hit for everyone!
5.0	I love this mix.  I take it every morning with 8oz of almond milk and it tastes great!  I started noticing that I &#34;wake up&#34; faster after I started taking this.  I still drink one cup of coffee every morning (mainly because I love coffee) but I don't feel that I need too for a pick-me-up.  My wife also takes this after every workout and has not noticed any adverse effects.  I get this container delivered every two months and plan on continuing this.  Great product!
5.0	I am on my second 5 Lb bag of beans from Palouse, and I will keep coming back as long as the price is consistent. The quality of the beans is high: they are delicious, cook well, are packed nicely, and arrived with Amazon Prime shipping-speed (two days). I don't take advantage of the QR code identifier (to see which specific fields the product comes from), but it's a nice touch, and builds my trust in Palouse, the manufacturer.<br /><br />Palouse is now my preferred option for both these garbanzo beans and brown lentils.<br /><br />Also: I have found one pebble going through 7.5 Lbs of beans--this is a very good ratio, and means they properly sift through their beans before packaging them. Worth the price.
5.0	I do not like the taste of water, but I know I need to drink it, so I was looking for something that gave the water flavor yet was still natural without a lot of added sugar and chemical names. I love these! They give the water just enough flavor with one quick squeeze and I can add more to give more flavor. They overall taste great. I do not however care for the black tea and lemon. It has too strong of a lemon taste which overwhelms the black tea. I wasn't expecting to like all the flavors so, other than that, I love the other flavors and definitely will purchase again.
5.0	I try to eat as best as possible , organic is the only way to go who needs to eat chemicals<br />I keep them in the Fridge and they stay fresh
5.0	This plant is in excellent condition. Roots are nice and healthy and the bulbs are gigantic. Will definitely purchase more in the future.
5.0	We love this product, eat it everyday.  Taste great and healthy for you, lowers cholesterol, according to my wife.  I only wish they hadn't raised the price late in 2011, especially without notice.  We are Subscribe n Save customers.
5.0	Good flavor. Long lasting.
5.0	Very tasty I love it ! My daughter ask me to buy it for herself but I cheated and snacked on few ! Great taste !
5.0	I am upset about the Pepper Pot being discontinued but double whammy just finding out about the Scotch Broth - the Oyster Soup will be next - the shelf will be left with kiddie soups....Bring these soups back!
5.0	"We LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this Rub!  It's so handy to have around the house!  Whenever I'm having one of those \\""don't know what we're having for supper\\"" days I pull this out and end up getting compliments from both my husband and young boys!  Tastes great on turkey, chicken, pork, and beef.  Our favorite use?  Ribs.  H&K's BBQ rub makes ribs explode with flavor!"
5.0	My family didn't know it was gluten free and it was very tasty!
5.0	My 7 month old daughter loves the fruity flavors! I can mix it in with her cereal or with a vegetable to make it more palatable.
5.0	I love the larger size bag and freshness of these walnuts.  I eat them almost every day and add them to many recipes.  Too bad I'm so far from Costco.  Thank you Amazon.
5.0	Consistently excellent. Absolutely delicious with teh Kirkland, or New Amsterdam gin from Costco.
5.0	Don't buy these.... they're for me :)
5.0	These are delicious, healthy, and affordable!  The perfect snack.  Navitas sells a lot of healthy snacks and reasonable prices.  I will def keep these in stock.
5.0	Kraft no longer makes this particular &#34;flavor&#34;.  I don't understand why.  It is my wife's and my favorite.
5.0	Good Fruit. Good Value. Thanks you Broadway! Lots of everything. Taste is good. Nice gift for friends, family, and yourself.
5.0	I use these candies to calm nausea and provide moisture for my mouth. I have many diseases which cause a multitude of problems and these are a Godsend. Flavors are good and I've tried them all. Coffee is my favorite followed by apple and peanut butter.
5.0	I have been giving these to my baby since she was about 6 months old, she loves them. They are individually packaged which makes it easy to stick them in a purse or diaper bag and they're easy for babies to hold and eat by themselves which they really enjoy. Just make sure to watch young babies very carefully since they can break off big pieces and try to swallow before the biscuit disintegrates in their mouth. By the time they're around 9 months it's not as much of a problem anymore.
5.0	Great rub.  Now I can buy pork that's on sale and now know what to do with it.  I'm not creative enough to figure out what spices go well together beside salt, pepper and BBQ sauce, so this is awesome rubbed on it.
5.0	Best jerky ever! I can't get enough of it :). Perfect amount of sweet and savory. Quality of meat is spot on. Easy to bite. Not overly chewy... happy customer!
5.0	Taste like Soy Sauce with only a fraction of the sodium and calories!  Wow!
5.0	This is a great product.  I've been drinking it almost daily for over 40 years.  Carnation changed the vanilla flavor a few years ago.  They received a complaint from me, and apparently many others, about it. It tasted good, like butterscotch, but I wanted vanilla.   They eventually returned the vanilla to the original recipe.  I use it mostly in protein shakes.  But I do like the occasional frozen mug with just the powder and cold milk.  Remember to put the powder in first.  Always leave enough room to stir vigorously.  Try really hard not to drink it all without coming up for air.  It's hard to do but you can do it.  In other words - savor and make it last.  The energy boost is almost immediate.  I don't use the sugar-free.  Hence the immediate boost.
5.0	This and the &#34;Once Again&#34; brand are my favorite almond butters. They're both really tasty and high quality, not thin or runny, just nice and smooth, with a rich consistency and fantastic almond flavor. 100% raw organic almonds, nothing else. Will repurchase (already have).
5.0	We received the salt in a timely manner in nice packaging. A nice touch to the packaging was a note from the owners thanking us for our purchase. We had never bought salt online before. I saw it on Amazon and decided to give it a try. I'm glad I did! Thank you!
5.0	I'll have to admit up front- I haven't had it hot.  But served chill, this tea will replace any sugary beverage such as soda - and therefore will improve your health.  It's Delicious.  Buy an iced tea pitcher (with filter) as this is Loose Tea.
5.0	"This product is perfect. I had trouble weening son off of his bottle. This is a nice way to \\""fool\\"" him. Love that it's organic and has veggies."
5.0	great deal on these nuts. whole family loves these nuts. nuts for nuts. arrived fresh and tasty. great for a snack or packed in a lunch.
5.0	I love these! Its a good sized bag too. Lasts a good while! Tastes good. No complaints!
5.0	I love this stuff.  I tried it earlier this summer while on Cape Cod and immediately had to go find some upon returning home!  It is like drinking chocolate!  It is dutch chocolate mixed with red wine.  mmmm.  New fave!
5.0	best meat sticks ever
5.0	Since I cannot enjoy caffeine like so many others, this is my &#34;go-to&#34; coffee.  Everyone who tries it loves it!  I find Amazon bulk pricing to be the best value any where.
5.0	This product can not have any flaws - as long as the package is unopened - I am not sure if there is an expiration date
5.0	I LOVE THESE PATTIES. I HAVE BOUGHT THEM SEVERAL TIMES.
5.0	It's wonderful to be able to get my favorite coffee!!  4 full pounds at that!!! :)<br />I will buy again
5.0	I absolutely love this syrup. I made the mistake of buying the Monin brand a few times back, because franky, I was feeling cheap, and shipping prices to Hawaii get expensive on top of the prices for this liquid bottle of dragon tears. But, the Monin brand syrups in Lavender, Rose, and Violet (three flavors I use to make my girly Italian sodas), are just not as good. The 1883 Routin brand does not leave an artificial taste behind in your mouth after you finish your beverage. It actually tastes beautiful, and delicate, and like everything it should... at least in the two flavors of Rose and Lavender (which are my top two favorites).<br /><br />My favorite recipe:<br />Fill a glass with ice, pour in cold club soda, then about a shot glass full of this syrup (more or less depending on how sweet you like it).<br />Sometimes I live on the edge and add milk or cream. Sometimes I muddle some mint in the bottom first. It's also lovely with tequila. Go crazy.<br />My sister calls it my old lady drink, because she thinks the scent of damask rose should be confined to a nursing home. However, I love the delicate floral taste and aroma. What can I say, I'm a foodie. Enjoy.
5.0	These cookies are so good. They remind me of the York peppermint cookies that were discontinued years ago. Although they are pricey, they are worth it. Trader Joe's only sells them during the Christmas season for cheaper. But I think they are worth it!
5.0	I love these! I used to get them at a little store in my hometown but when I moved I was unable to find them. They arrived really fast and I'm happy with my candy! :)
5.0	Delicious and good for my teeth!  I love being able to buy this in larger quantities than the single packs I had been buying!
5.0	Always try to use this brand in my home espresso machine.  Have tried other brands but I always return to this brand.
5.0	They said the quality of the chocolate was very good, the pretzels crisp and the gift was enjoyed. I would send it again.
5.0	Have tried many beverages to switch out  with water and found bai to have all the components of a great addition to or substitute for water.  The flavors are strong and delicious.  There is no artificial sweetner aftert taste, it's thirst quenching and I definitely recommend bai.  So nice to have a new great drink...try it, you'll like it.
5.0	beautiful tin, loved it
5.0	Good but not any cheaper than store.
5.0	Love these! The crunch is perfect and the sweet barbecue flavor is terrific. Try and you will be back for more.
5.0	The best strawberry/chocolate ever
5.0	I was diagnosed Celiac and this is the only bread I've found that doesn't taste like cardboard or a Brillo pad. Grab a bread machine from the thrift shop for $20, set it on basic, and you have honest to goodness BREAD!
5.0	Anyone who has had fresh morel mushrooms knows why you are willing to pay so much for them.  Sadly, they are only available fresh one time of the year and then the only option is to make do with dried.  These are one of the best dried morel mushrooms I've been able to find.  Yes, they are expensive, but so are the fresh and if you really really want morels in the summer, fall or winter, then this is what you'll need to use.<br /><br />These can be reconstituted in water, but I prefer to use red wine.  I use them as I would fresh morels--in stews, with eggs, with rice, with baked steak and onions, or just in a saute with all kinds of mixed mushrooms.  They have a flavor like no other mushroom, rich and wonderful and earthy.  They are also great if you chop them up fine and incorporate them into burgers.<br /><br />The morels in this bag are not the uber large morels you can sometimes get straight out of the woods.  These are fairly small, even taking into account their dehydrated nature.  They will not plump back up enough to stuff...not that I would.  With fresh morels, you can just dip them into an egg wash, roll them in cracker or bread crumbs, and fry them in butter...OMG, melting in your mouth gold!  I haven't tried doing that with reconstituted morels like these, but the point is that if you want to stuff mushrooms morels are not that kind of mushroom.<br /><br />Some people sing the praises of truffles, but I think morels beat them for taste any day of the week.  Buy a bag and try them out for your next fancy dinner party.  Or give them to someone at the holidays who will appreciate the expensive nature of this gift of the woods.
5.0	Having a lactose intolerant in our home that loves sweets, this Kit Kat Dark Chocolate is a godsend.  Just as a precaution they also take medicine before eating yet, I'm not sure that's necessary.  Anyway, with low or no lactose in this treat, they can eat without fear of food related discomfort.  It would be swell if more items of this kind were easily available.  Oh, did I say that these Kit Kats are delicious?
5.0	Yummy with a cup of coffee.
5.0	Just  put in the broiler and yoire good to go, just loke you bought them in the store, will buy again
5.0	I'm amazed at how few stores stock this on the shelf, given the widespread use of tapioca flour as an ingredient in GF recipes. I know the BRM all-purpose GF flour includes tapioca, but it also has some bean flours mixed in. And when a recipe specifies different types of flour, you'd do well to use that (or find a flour of a similar weight and texture). I would have signed up for the recurring purchase, but I'm fairly new to GF preparations and need to assess how long it takes me to consume each type of flour before putting myself on a schedule for ordering it.
5.0	Tasty and powerful. Be careful. It is HOT.
5.0	This is by far the best  honey I have ever used,  the taste says it all.....no additives, no corn syrup, just terrific.
5.0	For those that cannot eat pasta this is a good substitute.  Less calories than pasta.  Gluten free product.  We liked it.
5.0	I buy a bag about every month.
5.0	This popcorn is awesome.  This is the second time of purchasing this product.  My grandchildren and I really enjoy the taste.
5.0	So yummy!  The brown rice triscuits are much crunchier than the regular type.  I love the flavor and texture! These pack quite a taste punch that makes a bland bowl of soup an enjoyable, flavorful meal.  Great price on this bulk package.  50% of what you'd pay at the grocery store.
5.0	This is my favorite Chai!! When I lived in Colorado it was served at several local coffee stores, and I had missed it moving to California.  Now I have it on subscribe and save and can enjoy it whenever I want!  I also like their other varieties, but this is by far my favorite.  It has a good level of spice and is not too sweet.  At the same time it doesn't taste too spicy like some of the potpourri tasting Chai that is out there.
5.0	These are so delicious. I've not found anything like them, except in Scotland, where they are made. I wish they were more readily available in the U.S. Until that happens, the Nanobits Limited of Birmingham, England, did a great job getting the order to me promptly.
5.0	We purchased a few of these as Christmas gifts in 2010 and everyone loved them so we sent out the California Gourmet Baskets to everyone on our list. It is so easy to send with Amazon. I Just order and they mail it for me. Everyone we sent one to loved it. We even ordered on for us this year and it was gone in a very short time. We will be back to order more. Thank you so much for you yummy and fun filled baskets!
5.0	Love, love, love this mix.  Pork chops and even beef taste really good and it is very good and tasty.  Easy directions to follow. Came very well packaged with no damage noted.
5.0	It was just the way I thought it would be
5.0	Excellent strength if you need it which can sometimes be difficult without ruining the flavor.  Not too bitter or acidic.  Definitely a great coffee
5.0	This is the favorite drink of my grandchildren and the stores are always running out. Buying in large quanity like this and they have it for months.
5.0	As always, the cereal came on time and perfect. SSL on doing this review
5.0	Wish I could find this in the stores more readily!  My entire family loves this dressing.  So easy to make and super yummy!
5.0	Came in in great shape and way earlier than projected. So glad to have this olive oil from Spain!!
5.0	These are great chips, the taste is a little spicy but not bad.  Think original Doritos with a little bit of spicy and chili flake.  The quality from this seller: The chips were a great price, arrived on time, and were in great condition when they arrived. As not all stores may carry this size bag, it is worth the purchase.<br />These chips are good for dip as they hold up a little better than some other brands.
5.0	I really liked these grains because they were much larger than grains I had previously.  It always takes kefir a while to establish itself in a new environment and these were no exception, but they are doing great now.  I've divided them many times and given some to friends because they grow so rapidly.  I use them to make goat milk kefir.
5.0	Im VERY pleased with the whole leaf graviola bag of 50 &#34;large healthy leaves&#34;
5.0	Great jelly!  Have purchased this in Alaska for years and was delighted to find it could be ordered online.  I use it for cooking as a little dab on a pork cutlet or chicken breast adds flavor when used with other seasonings.
5.0	These work great with my ketogenic diet. I'm not sure how the &#34;original&#34; tastes, but the spicy one is excellent! It definitely satisfies me when I need something crunchy as a potato chip substitute. Will buy another one when my stash runs out.
5.0	These are convenient, tasty, and not laden with sugar like so many fruit snacks and products are.
5.0	Sugar-free, tasty, versatile - what's not to like? :) I also have the chocolate and the vanilla, both great as well.
5.0	I adore these, and they were really well packed and very FRESH!!
5.0	Price was right and the bulk large size is the way to buy with this everyday condiment uses. I use it as a all in one, instead of three different shakers ingredients.
5.0	I recently purchased the stroopies and was very pleased. My daughter really enjoys them. It would be great to get recipes for using them also! Would definitely buy again. I also appreciated getting a call from the company asking me to rate the sweet snacks without knowing what I would say :)
5.0	1 8 2015<br />Yes, you CAN buy it IN SO CAL, BUT NOT if you live outside!  I grew up in So Cal and yeah, it's everywhere THERE !
5.0	An excellent blend of Guat. Antigua lovers! I order several varieties online, and this one was excellent! Would recommend if you like the variations of Antigua.
5.0	"90s SURGE PRODUCTION    Somewhere on a studio lot, Danny Tanner and Al Bundy stand above a cast-iron cauldron. Using an oar left over from the infamous Bayside High School rafting trip, the two take turns stirring the bubbling nectar and prepare to let it cool down.    Zack Taylor, the black Mighty Morphin' Power Ranger, is kind enough to stop by regularly with his Mastodon Zord and flash-cool the liquid. On his off days, Sub-Zero's assistance is elicited to expedite the cooling of the process. What a fine Lin Kuei gent.    After some insults from Al to Danny due to his neurotic methods of cleanliness -- they send the cauldron down the conveyor belt. This belt was bestowed upon them by the fine people at Supermarket Sweep.    Boy bands await the other side of the belt, working like slaves in canning and bottling the green liquid. Timberlake, Carter -- they're all there. The recipe must remain guarded closely so naturally, high-level members of Death Row Records watch the door. Not even a Game Boy Color Camera could get a snapshot of what's going on in production. Talkboys and YakBacks are strictly forbidden from the premises.    Time for distribution. High atop a horse, the deadly Walker Texas Ranger waits outside the loading dock exit. He has his team loading the product into big semi's, directing from under the brim of a Stetson. The distribution path and schedule was handily sent over via AIM earlier that morning, thanks to the help of a dial-up 56K modem which whined endlessly to connect.    Carson Daly counted down the MTV TRL Ten, and the product was then off to every corner of the globe.    *******************************************  Now Coca-Cola -- since we have SURGE, can you do Hi-C Ecto Cooler next on \\""sell-by-demand\\"" via Amazon?? Re-releasing Ecto to the world is the best way to ensure Vigo can't mood slime the world again.    Ecto Cooler = glorified happiness."
5.0	Yes, this is very hot - but very good. Use in sauces to add a bit of heat - don't use to much.
5.0	Item was fresh, and actually arrived a day early. The beef jerky is not as salty as some of the people state. Way better than anything you'll buy in the stores.
5.0	great tasting great price per pound
5.0	If you think that whey protein you're eating is good for you then you really should try this stuff. I have been using this for a while but I recently started infusing it with fruits and veggies in a high powered blender. 2 weeks and 12 less pounds later I can tell you I'm probably going from a crazed carnivore to probably vegan. It truly is a Superfood! It even tastes nutty and delicious in almond milk. Try it! Commit to it for a while. You'll feel the difference!
5.0	I had to dramatically cut down on my fat intake, but I love peanut butter.  PB2 saved me by making a great tasting product that really does taste like the real thing. I make up big batches so that it is always on hand.  I also will sometimes mix it directly with the jelly to make it even better. I cannot taste much difference between the regular and chocolate, but I really do not care.  Truly a lifesaver.
5.0	I had these snacks in a pit stop in a marathon that I ran a couple months ago. I don't know if I was really hungry or if these things are really good. No, but really these things are really good. Highly recommended for those long jogs or bike rides or any activity really. The only thing that I have to complain about is the price per package for Sharkies. Other than that, these are great.
5.0	This is delicious! That old lady was right you can put this on anything! I keep reading that people have a hard time finding it, I buy mine at my local super target for about $4. So they might be stocking it in stores again depending on where you go. Best hot sauce I've ever had! Glad they still make it. :)
5.0	This is the easiest, best tasting, most versatile pancake/waffle mix..  My son has grown up on this product and we never tire of it.  We use it for blueberry waffles, pecan pancakes, etc.  I love that it is wholesome, healthy and nutritious.  I even appreciate the simple, environmentally friendly packaging.
5.0	love these balsamic vinegars!
5.0	Sahale Snacks are some of the best around.  They are great to pack along anywhere.  We love to sprinkle them on our salads for an extra special treat.  I prefer the pecans over  the other varieties, but I bet they are all great.  Hope you enjoy them as much as my family does.
5.0	We've been using this exclusively for the past few years.  It grinds very well, even on the finest settings.
5.0	This is a delicious little meal.  The crust is wonderful and the gravy is delicious with just enough meat to satisfy.
5.0	Perfect 10! Taste Great! Packaged well, fast shipping, thanks so much!
5.0	I found this tea while trying to shake a cough and sore throat. It seemed to help a little for the sore throat although I have found other things that work way better, like hot orange juice for example. Hey, don't knock it til you try it. However, I would still highly recommend this tea. Not just for when you have a sore throat either. It's great anytime. Normally I am not much of a tea drinker but for this stuff I have made an exception. I love it. It has a nice mildly sweet, delicate flavor, and the smell, oh the smell. To me, it smells like springtime, happiness in a cup. Sometimes when I'm kind of down I will drink a mug of this as a pick me up. Even just the smell perks me up.
5.0	Absolutely delicious!  The kids LOVED it!  Just bought a couple more for fun and yummy weekday meals - at home! :)
5.0	A bit pricey, but delicious
5.0	"I LOVE DEL MONTE KETCHUP!!  I\\""ve tried a few others, but no others compare for me, in fact I wont even use the others if I can't have DEL MONTE.  I called 800 info to find Del Monte's company to ask where I could find it in my area (there are many big nice stores here) as I couldnt find it at all in my town.  Thankfully, good old reliable Amazon HAS IT!!  THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU!!!       OH NO!!!!.......... SURPRISE AT CHECK OUT!!!  WHEW!!!!!!!!!!!!  OOPS, NOW SO DISAPPOINTED, tried to order 3 bottles to have on hand since hard to find in my area, but the SHIPPING AND HANDLING WAS  \\""THREE TIMES\\""   the cost of the bottles!!!  THATS RIDICULOUS!!  NOONE is going to want to pay that much for a few bottles of Ketchup to be shipped!!    SO DISAPPOINTED!!!    I leave the 5 star for the product only, nothing else."
5.0	This is my third order of this stuff and it's basically the powder from boxed mac and cheese.  I stir it into greek yogurt for a fat free cheese dip or stir it into popcorn.
5.0	This is the second time I have purchased this as a gift and both times the recipient found it to be a great selection and the price is right.
5.0	When I think of a hazelnut-flavored coffee drink, I generally think of the type produced by a barista with a syrup. By definition, my expectation of the Tassimo pod was therefore relatively low. To my pleasant surprise, the mild hazelnut flavor already emanates from the machine during the brewing process, and the result is a perfectly balanced cup of coffee with an intense but not overbearing hazelnut flavor.
5.0	My wife has found a number of recipes that use chia seeds in place of other common ingredients. This has allowed her to keep us on a low carb program without having to sacrifice some of the tasty stuff we like.
5.0	I don't know what it is about this dressing, but it makes me want to eat salad all day! I love it and I was so excited to see that it's being sold at my local grocery store now! I wouldn't buy anything else!
5.0	I really recommend people to get this, I think its a very lovely gift for someone special. This product is as described and looks like the image shown.
5.0	This is  a great k cup. It takes so yummy and really like a cinnamon pastry, or roll. It is a light coffee but we love it alot.
5.0	I love these Smoked Tomatoes.  I am addicted to them.  If you can find the Julienne cut, try them with Frito's Chile Cheese Chips.  They are also great in salads, salsa and tomato sauce. I like to blend them into my tomato sauce.
5.0	My husband fell in love with this flavor while on a family vacation in DC several years ago.  We have purchased this pack for his birthday each year ever sine!  Delicious and comforting flavor; reminiscent of a time and place in the past!
5.0	I was introduced to Douwe Egberts decaf coffee in a restaurant, and like it so much that I asked the waitress what brand they were serving. Decaf coffee tends to be a pretty watered down version of the real thing, but this coffee has a real coffee taste to it. I will definitely be buying it again!
5.0	love these clusters. my kids take them to school for snack time. worth the money. both healthy and tasty. no chocolate to melt in the hot summers here.
5.0	These are addictive and perfectly delicious.  They rival Sees candies for my all time favorite sweets.  You seriously can't stop eating them...for that reason, the 5 pound bag is dangerous.  You better have friends to share with (On that note, a perfect party/candy dish food-pretty and scrumptious.  You will be the office hero.).
5.0	If you're looking for a change from oatmeal, this is a fantastic alternative.  They aren't kidding when they say &#34;Mighty Tasty Hot Cereal&#34;.  I have mine with vanilla, honey, and blueberries.  YUM!!
5.0	Costa Rica Tarrazu is one of the distinguished coffees Starbucks carries. Delicious, premium, rich, quality coffee. We relax and enjoy it at least twice everyday.
5.0	The only snack like it that I feel good about giving to my grandkids.  Tastes good and isn't filled with poisons or preservatives.
5.0	Mmm, mmm, good!  This is my favorite coffee!!!
5.0	This item is very tasty and filling and is low carbs.  I would say it's a winner.
5.0	Excellent Hot Chocolate!
5.0	I can't believe Amazon can offer such good tasting corn in a can so cheap! Named brand cans of corn is roughly $1.00 to $1.30 for 15 ounces where I live. I can buy off brand and generic brands for $75 to $1.00, but at the time I ordered, Amazon came to about 72 cents a can.     Thank you Amazon!! You made me a believer.
5.0	I think Crunca ma-me is fab!  Tasty, crunchy, guiltless and you get protein.  Can't ask for too much more than that.
5.0	These candies are very nice. They have just enough Kava to take the edge off a stressful citation and give you some confidence without affecting mental clarity.
5.0	The nut mix contains some nuts not usually found in a mix, such as macadamia and cashews. An excellent, delicious and balanced nut mix.
5.0	If you like Thai food this is a great product.  It's quick. It's easy. What else do you want? It's good stuff.
5.0	Tasty grapefruit juice. I love grapefruit juice but it is getting hard to find in the supermarket. This juice ships and can be stored at room temperature. Put it in the refrigerator and it tastes as good or better than the best chilled supermarket brand.
5.0	"Less sugar, more protein, etc. I wondered, \\""Is it edible?\\"" OH,YEAH! This variety is kind of like a Mars Bar, which would have been my junk choice. There are a couple of other varieties that I haven't gotten to yet, but this one was truly impressive. I got my first taste from a cash register display @ CVS. I'm hooked! A bit of history: a determined, candy-loving 12 year old loses war over Halloween candy with his stubborn, health conscious mom, the ideas was born to \\""un-junk\\"" candy bars by removing the trans-fat, high fructose corn syrup, artificial colors, GMO ingredients and other nasty things. Common sense reigns st last! Guilt free yummy!"
5.0	Yogurt Burst Cheerios Cereal Strawberry 12.2 oz (Discontinued) http://www.generalmills.com/ProductLocator.aspx
5.0	The real deal, not mushy like Quaker, very easy just pop in the microwave.
5.0	great item, shipped quickly
5.0	"A most delicious tea!  I love it in the evening while watching TV.  It is very \\""Asian\\""."
5.0	So far the best coconut milk out there. I love that it is organic and the can is BPA free.
5.0	I like the price!  very robust , no bitter after taste.. on my 5th box
5.0	priced right for what you get.  Will never go back to using sugar again.  Tastes great!!  A keeper.
5.0	My first venture into the Harney world of tea, will try others after this. Excellent, earth nutty flavour, Would buy again
5.0	Great for baking low carb. This price is half as much as the stores charge.
5.0	I tried the Jalapeño Salsa and the Pacific Sea Salt varieties. The Jalapeño Salsa are delicious! Such a great healthy snack. My husband and kids loved them too. Would be nice if the bags were resealable, but that won't stop me from buying them again.
5.0	Our favorite for chicken!
5.0	A great product wonderful taste You should try it at least once.
5.0	Good fuel.  Good taste.  Good price.  Definitely on the repeat buy list.
5.0	Really great addition to making supremely delicious popcorn. This salt arrived in fine condition and I don't think I could consume popcorn with a lesser, courser grained salt.
5.0	This is an excellent tasting instant coffee that is getting really hard to find at the grocery stores where it used to be readily available.  It is and has been my drink of choice for a quiet cup of coffee when I am not going out to the local latte shop.  I hope Maxwell House continues to produce it and I will continue to buy it.
5.0	I love this. Very economical. Using my Prime account, it's shipped free. I love the coconut smell and taste. I use this in tea, coffee, baking, frying, etc. I made triple chocolate brownies and used it instead of vegetable oil and they were fabulous. I make the best popcorn using white popcorn, coconut oil, salt, and a couple of pinches of sugar. I love the health benefits of using coconut oil. I also make a body scrub using it and sugar and essence of orange. I wash my face in it and people always ask if it causes breakouts. No, it doesn't. The sugar exfoliates my skin and the coconut oil leaves it silky smooth. I shave my legs with it. I'm going to make body scrub gifts for Christmas. This stuff is awesome.
5.0	Excellent coffee,  totally satisfied with my purchase!  Will continue to use these pods, much less expensive than Nespresso and equally as good!
5.0	These are amazing!  They are a luxurious, almost decadent treat, except they are full of health-promoting flavonoids, fatty acids and minerals such as iron, calcium and magnesium. Right now I'm using them in a smoothie. Earlier I tried them sprinkled on ice cream. Delicious!  Just a very light crunch. They can be used in cookies instead of chocolate chips. Since they are unsweetened,  whoever is preparing the food has control over how sweet their masterpiece is supposed to be. In my case, I don't like overly sweetened food, so this is a perfect solution.<br /><br />Since I'm not the best cook in the world, I'm sharing these with a friend of mine who at least should be in the running for great cook status. I always benefit from her holiday cooking, so it's only fair to help with some of the ingredients. These look and taste scrumptious, so the possibilities for new recipes are endless. She's has always wanted to try them and is having fun researching different recipes she can use them in. It's a large bag and these go a long way. She'll get to do lots of experimenting.<br /><br />I recommend these highly.
5.0	Quality gumballs don't get stale quickly but some purples change color in the sun and you know what that is cool. A++ would chew again.
5.0	Delicious tonic though expensive
5.0	It's the best coffee ever! I only drink San Francisco Bay French Roast. Full of amazing flavor!
5.0	I'm a big fan of mint tea - particularly peppermint.  Sadly, most mint teas are weak beverages.  In order to get a strong, clear minty flavor one has to steep tea for a long time or use more than one sachet; but not with this tea!  The Bigelow k-cups are terrific, much better than the other mint tea k-cups I've purchased in the past (Gloria's and Celestial Seasonings) in offering a bright and brisk cup of tea.  But please note: these might be a bit too vibrant for those with a more subtle palette.
5.0	Our family uses this for hair and as a moisturizer.  It isn't greasy, and absorbs quickly.  Use just a dab on wet hair to make it shine.  Haven't tried it in cooking yet.  This product has a light fragrance, and doesn't contain pieces of coconut flakes (as so many products do).
5.0	taste great, i'd buy again
5.0	Love this flavor of Zevia.
5.0	Best price I found for dried blueberries. Tastes pretty good too. I like to eat them as snacks from time to time.
5.0	This is good stuff.  I've always liked tea and I have a bit of a sweet tooth... so throwing in the black cherry/berry flavor was an almost sure winner for me.  The flavoring is pleasant, not overwhelming and the tea itself is caffeine free so it's a great late evening/relaxing drink.  I even used these to make iced tea and that was very good as well.  If you try it I hope you enjoy it as much as I did and thanks for taking the time to read my review.
5.0	Who cares!  It's the prefect drink for flavor when you don't need a wake me up coffee or a milky hot chocolate.  perfect!
5.0	Love the pecans  they are delicious will order more  they are good size too  and  melt in your mouth yummy
5.0	Great powered ginger! Strong and pungent.
5.0	this is the best  a great price and its so nice to shop for groceries on Amazon!
5.0	"I love this tea.  I've never had issues with what Amazon sends.  What I don't get is why the 24-pack is $13.94 and the 48 pack is $39.38.  The tea is great, but the pricing has never made any sense.  Buying in \\""bulk\\"" won't pay off this time."
5.0	Great gum. Stays with the flavor for a long time. Perfect pack for your pocket. Great price for what I received.
5.0	Great product and arrived  on time in  great condition these beans are great tasting and easy to cook
5.0	These are great! This is the only Konpeito I could find on amazon that is actually flavored instead of plain colored sugar. Tasting each of the five packages I can't really pick out a specific flavor, but each package does have its own unique taste. The candy is super cute, I put mine in glass jars and set them on my desk as decoration.
5.0	I bought this because I needed pickling spices.  At the store, the small containers are expensive- this gave me enough to last forever at the rate I actually pickle things.  I pickled jalepenos and some other peppers I grew in my back yard, and they turned out great!  I can't wait to grow more and make bigger batches next year.
5.0	This plant was shipped immediately after the transaction was approved. I received the plant rapped with a purple plastic bag. It came in a very healthy condition. It come with five closed buds which have bloom in less then a week. I love the color, its exactly as described intense red with black outline. This is one of my favorite plants. I order a few more and I am so excited to receive them.
5.0	The K-cup style makes this product very convenient to use and it brews the tea just right every single time. The flavor is pretty good, it's not too strong, but it's strong enough where you can taste it. And it's certainly not too bitter. Overall, I think it's a pretty good product and if you're a tea drinker, I think you will like it.
5.0	What an amazing hot sauce. It literally makes you feel like your on fire. One note, its good for blending into recipes.
5.0	my usual drink of choice only drink 2 flavors tried most of others, store does not have any in stock
5.0	Great taste! These are wonderful
5.0	These bars are delicious, and travel well. Handy to have in your backpack or purse for a quick snack. Love the variety pack because I get to taste all the different flavors!
5.0	my husband and i really love the coffee maker and this coffee its great
5.0	Bonsai tree is as described in listing.  Packed with TLC. Love the shape and is a beautiful addition to my collection
5.0	perfect size for lunches.
5.0	Worked great - almost immediate improvement
5.0	Shipment arrived quickly and product was fresh. This candy is my kryptonite!
5.0	They came quickly and were super delicious!!! They are very small, so they were gone really quickly, but they tasted so fresh!!! Will buy again!!!
5.0	This was given as a gift. I ordered it rather last minute, but it came in the expected delivery time. The quality of the chocolate was very good.
5.0	I usually like to drink coffee first thing in the morning before working out.  I like trying different type of instant coffee to see which has a bigger impact with a great taste.  Colcafe is smooth and taste great.  I wake up at 4:30 a.m. prepare me coffee and by 5 a.m. I am ready to workout.<br /><br />Also one of the containers came in broken, I contact the vender and they replace it with one day shipment.  I would wait for the price to drop it was not this pricey when I purchase it.
5.0	Thanks for sending K-Cups so quickly their my favorite
5.0	These were for my thirteen y/o grandson who loves them. He gave me one to test and I thought it was a bit chalky but apparently kids really like the taste. They're a funky shape and the colors are nice, so if you have a young teenager in your life, I can guarantee these will be appreciated.
5.0	With so much exposure to toxins in our environment I was dismayed to discover that parchment paper also is treated with chlorine.  However, this parchment paper is unbleached. I feel very comfortable knowing that it is safe for my food to come in contact with it.  Additionally, If You Care's Parchment Baking Paper is very durable, and food does not stick to it. I have proven this to be the truth time and time again. Most definitely, I will continue to purchase this product in the future. What a huge relief it is to know that there is a safe alternative to bleach-laden parchment paper.
5.0	OK. Just think about it. Macadamia nuts- it doesn't get any richer and smoother, nut-wise. Then they are coated with smooth, rich and not too sweet dark chocolate. An unbeatable and irrisistable combination! Yum Yum Yum. The only problem with this Hawaiian candy is how fast you can plow through the box! Makes a fantastic gift. We decided to order from Amazon to send to family/friends, as postage to send from Maui was way more expensive for the same Hawaiian Host than ordering and sending through Amazon.
5.0	Tastes great - not bloating - Almost as good as the chocolate which tastes just like really good hot chocolate
5.0	Again, this brand is wonderful. I am a chef, and is the a wonderful product at an excellent price. Will order again for sure!
5.0	Absolutely LOVED this!!!! Savory is hard to find sometimes where I live so I was very much excited when it arrived. My mom loves to make Angel Biscuits and the recipe calls for savory. This tasted so fresh it was wonderful!!!!!
5.0	We order this coffee for work every month.  The guys in the office love it and it is the first coffee I have been able to have a standing reorder for.  It is medium roast that works for everyone and has no bitter aftertaste.
5.0	Did some shopping around for some good Jasmine tea. Decided to give this a try and am so glad I did. Honestly the smell alone is something I crave. I love it! I would definitely recommend this to anyone. Check out the companies website too, (Summittea.com) they give free samples with orders and are pretty legit about their products. All of their tea also comes in a tall canister that seals very well!
5.0	This thing grows sprouts in a hurry! Enough for two people and you'll love how easy it is. Don't waste money at stores.
5.0	Delicious, satisfying, and nutritious! I keep re-ordering them over and over.
5.0	Love, love love these mini cans. Portion control, portable,delicious!
5.0	Good quality.. Product shows a very high level of freshness...
5.0	The Yarrow Herb product is cut & sifted and organic which is safe to use by all individuals. Even the Marines are required to keep it in their Ruck sacks for cuts..
5.0	I bought one of these, very cautiously, at a local quick mart type store. I know it SAYS its naturally flavored but I was sure there had to be something &#34;bad&#34; in it because it smelled good, tasted great, and my 2 year old guzzled it down! It was $2 at the store and once I realized it really was just good water (with some vitamins BONUS) I came to my favorite place in the whole wide world and sure enough I was able to get a case on subscribe and save. Booyah!
5.0	We all love parmesan cheese on pretty much everything and love this big container because it lasts a little longer around our house. shipped great and taste great. thank you
5.0	"This is truly the \\""real deal\\"" I have had other brands of coffee with kahlua as the flavor, but nothing compares to this. As soon as you open the bag, you know you are going to experience a real treat, especially if you use an amaretto creamer."
5.0	I bought these for my daughter as a healthy snack for her. She loves them, I love them. We easily went through all 30. The flavor, texture and health factor are all good. I would suggest these to anyone. =)
5.0	For some reason this product is no longer sold at any of my local markets. I find that there is no artificial after taste and tastes exactly like pure sugar.
5.0	As always, exactly as expected
5.0	This makes perfect yogurt every time. Very smooth and creamy.  Works perfectly with the Yogourmet Yogurt Maker.  I've been using it for over a year now.
5.0	Have tried numerous brands. As prior posters have commented, this is the best product I have found.  Glad to see it more generally available online now.  Some organic markets beginning to carry also.
5.0	These are the best cakes ever, and the lemon vodka is superb.  They aren't the healthiest cakes out there, but they are some of the best-tasting ones.  If you want to treat yourself to a little decadence, this cake is for you.  It is so rich, that you only need a small piece at a time.  Delicious!
5.0	I am allergic to pretty much everything, especially corn syrup and that's in just about everything. I have been struggling because I can't find anything sweet & good to eat that will satisfy my sweet tooth and won't make me sick. THESE ARE THE ANSWER. They are INCREDIBLE! They have so much flavor that I actually would choose these over regular ones if I had the option. When it comes to candy, I normally have a couple favorite flavors and I eat all of those out of the bag first, but with these, I really do just love them all. HIGHLY recommend this product not just for anyone with allergies, but for an anyone and everyone with a sweet tooth!!
5.0	I have been buying this water in the 5 gallon size at our local Lowe's store for the past 6 months.  I have been very happy with the taste. There is no plastic taste from the bottle.  We have a large family of 7 and we go through a lot of water! I am happy to have my children drink a lot of water and I feel it is better for our health than juice and soda. When we are finished with a bottle we recycle it at Lowe's. I believe it is $12.99 initially and $5.99 a bottle when you return a bottle.
5.0	Great product with a host of uses!
5.0	My fav brand. Wish it came in Kcups.
5.0	When I discovered Tealandia offers fair trade, organic tea at a very fair price I ordered a few sample sizes directly from its webpage.  Of the green teas I tried, this is my favorite.  It reminds me a little more of an oolong tea than green (more robust/less grassy), but the fruit flavors mellow it out.  Plus it has rose hips - a great inflammation fighter.      A quick summary of the other flavors I tried:  Jasmine green - very nice, but Rishi Organic Jasmine Pearls is still my favorite Jasmine.  Zen green - I wanted to like this tea, but it was too minty for me.  If you like spearmint in your tea, definitely give it a try!  Apricot brandy black tea - Delicious hot or iced. I don't usually drink black tea because of the higher caffeine content, but this one was so good, I had to make an exception.  I ordered the two pack on amazon this morning.
5.0	Product was what I expected was happy with shipping.It has the perfect blend and is perfect for snacking. I throughly enjoyed this blend.
5.0	THE BEST SPLIT PEA SOUP ON THE MARKET
5.0	I wanted to find a good Almond oil for salads. So I tried this one, and 'Sweet Almond Oil' by Oleic Bovera (more expensive) and 'Alive, Organic Almond Oil' by Living Tree Community Foods (less expensive). I like Jean LeBlanc French Almond Oil the best because it smells like almonds. The other two really don't. I'm guessing that the one that actually smells like almonds has to be better for my health (wider range of oil soluble vitamins and less extreme processing methods).<br />I'm only going to buy this one going forward!
5.0	these are hard to find in the stores for me. I love the chocolate one a lot and would definitely plan to order more in the future. only downside is that one container doesnt make a huge amount of peanut butter.
5.0	Yummy & fun for the family to share.
5.0	We were first turned on to this mix by our uncle. He had asked at a restaurant what kind of mix they use. They showed him a container of Carbon's Golden Malted. The pancake and waffle recipes included differ slightly. One (pancakes) uses milk or buttermilk, and the other (waffles) water. If you love buttermilk pancakes you will love it used in the recipe. The waffles are also delicious and turn out golden brown. I use a little vanilla when I make the waffles for a little extra flavor.
5.0	In the interest of full disclosure:  I'm a coffee drinker.  However, I can enjoy a cup of tea, especially in the evening after dinner.  I found that this tea with a little milk hit the spot!
5.0	Pecan pie, pecans alone, any way you slice it, I love them....these crackers have enough pecan in them to give you that flavor fix.  They are also wonderful for whatever you want to put on them.  Serving sizes are very generous, so you can munch without guilt!
5.0	This selection from the great purveyor of sinful pleasures is one of their very best. Buy it, and enjoy sins of pleasure.
5.0	son is a jerky perfectionist and he says this is one of the best. And he has tried just about all of them
5.0	I actually didn't realize these were t-disks, and I have a k-cup machine (my fault for not reading the description well enough!). But I have a universal adapter thing, so I poured this coffee into it and to my surprise it was very good. I had always thought Tassimo was like a step higher than Folgers...that is, not quite bargain brand, but not up to the standards of the good brands either. This coffee is making me reconsider that assumption. This is good coffee. I like dark roasts, and it has a rich, bold flavor. Color me impressed!
5.0	This has been a very good deal.  We had been ordering Jack Link Pepperoni links in the normal retail packaging via Amazon subscriptions.  They started telling us this was unavailbable when I found this product.  Given the choice, I'll take this one. They're longer and tastier.  Keep better too..  Now these are being listed as not aviailibl.  We'll keep an eye out and order them again.  They're really good.
5.0	Perfect size for homemade syrups.  The cap helps keep product fresh.
5.0	Lovely quail eggs had ones on ebay, but had flavored to them all original taste great will recommend it to others.
5.0	I like this gum, also like the packs. The gum is easy to open by simply tearing the foil or pressing a piece through it.
5.0	I am picky about my coffee and I  love this stuff.  i have trouble finding the French Roast locally.  Here it is and for a good price too.
5.0	Sumatran Reserve has been my favorite coffee for 2-3 years.  We recently bought a Keurig so I was very glad to see this flavor of coffee was available for our new coffee maker as well.  Of course, organic is always a preference for us.
5.0	Very good in the morning when I want tea.
5.0	These exceeded my expectations, especially the pizza ones...so yummy!  Great job Enjoy Life!  These did not last long in my house and the whole family enjoyed them!
5.0	Product as advertised.
5.0	This is the best hot sauce ever! It is the only one I use or buy anymore. It is no longer available locally so I am glad Amazon carries it. Some sellers only sell by case loads though which is far more than I could ever use within the expiration dates, but this one sells two bottles at a time.
5.0	Great, hard to find reminds me of childhood visits.  Wish they were available locally in St. Louis, Missouri .  Great product!
5.0	Yummmm, what a suprise.
5.0	Had this at a restaurant and needed to order it!  I highly recommend it!  A perfect addition for the holidays but I love cinnamon all year round!  Makes are great gift in the decorative tin.
5.0	I've tried many gluten free crackers and these are the best. A tender crackers with a satisfying crunch. Good by themselves or with    soup, chili, cheese or jelly.
5.0	My husband's favorite treat and says these are the best, will definitely order again.
5.0	boyfriend loves hot stuff and he is obsessed with the sauce he put that on everything he eats love love love
5.0	Good deal and good quality Himalayan salt, I have used this for pickling and sauerkraut and it works well, as it is or was at one time sea salt so contains no iodine.  Definitely recommend this seller.
5.0	Good price and tastes great.  Not overly salty like most almonds are.
5.0	This item was purchased many years ago and want off my screen. Product must have been ok, otherwise I would have given it 1 star. Great product, I think??
5.0	These are a good snack if you're eating clean and need a snack during the day. Not 100% paleo but better than most alternatives.
5.0	This is one of the only companies that make offers this flavor
5.0	Great product. Exceeded all expectations.
5.0	I love the pumpkin spice K-cups!! They are delicious! I drink it all year round!
5.0	This Mie Goreng (means: Fried Noodle) is great, my teens love it. My favorite one is the satay flavor which has a peanut sauce and sweet soy sauce. It has a lot of  other flavors too such as : curry (is the original package when they first launched it), it also has tuna flavor. For the curry flavor, I always boil the noodle and at the same time making sunny side up in it, add kale or spinach, or buk choy, and some Indonesian ABC chili sauce (sambal), and fried shallot..., that is my winter dining getaway..
5.0	I actually bought a box from Kroger to try it out before I spend the money for the 6 pack here on Amazon. Wow, you can just smell how good it's going to taste.  Very spicy in a good way.  I am typically more of an ice tea person but I think I've been converted.  I could drink this all day and the fact thats its an anti oxidant just makes it better. I am going ahead and purchasing the 6 pack from amazon.
5.0	Very good , bold taste
5.0	I am usually not a pomegranate fan, but gave it a try anyway and now it is my favorite flavor.  I would tell anyone to try it today!
5.0	I'm addicted to these snacks, they are so good!
5.0	This is super delicious, I like that its low in sugars. A nice substitute for Nutella (which I love) and fill you up quickly for that extra boost when needed.
5.0	Really yummy - doesn't taste at all like a mix!
5.0	I love the taste of the eggnogg.  It's better than dessert.  It's only on the shelves in stores for the holidays so I order it on.
5.0	Boyfriend drinks this all the time and loves it. I've stocked up his stash and now is happy as can be.
5.0	This product has no contaminated soy. It's organic and therefore healthy. My hat off to Kikkoman.
5.0	These chips are fresh, lime flavor is just right,  crunch is perfect, and its organic origins make for a plus.
5.0	These are like candy and I can't find them anywhere in town.  Glad that I am able to purchase online.
5.0	I had never eaten steel cut oats before and didn't realize that they took 10-20 minutes to cook. We usually eat them on weekends when we have more time in the morning. They are very tasty!
5.0	We have ordered 2 cases in last few months, it makes the best ice tea.  We have a pitcher going constantly.  Wasn't a fan of green tea previously, but this tea won me over.   Great refreshing drink for the summer!
5.0	I bake a lot and have found this vanilla to be my favorite and it was so easy and convenient to get it from Amazon!
5.0	Excellent tasting coffee - love it!  I love the Amazon option of getting regular shipping so I never have to worry about running out.
5.0	Sure makes a good paella!
5.0	these are not greasy and have great flavor. they come fresh and don't last long in my house. perfect size for a snack.
5.0	Great texture and taste. Other flavors are ok too.
5.0	"The Better Oats Dark Chocolate Oatmeal is a great oatmeal I feel good about eating.  It's not made with partially hydrogenated *anything* and doesn't look \\""chemically\\"" when you pour it out of the pouch.  The oatmeal has flax seeds in it, and the chocolate taste is rich without being too overdone.  Initially I worried that the chocolate would have a greasy or strange aftertaste, but it has none of these things.  It really has a wonderful flavor.     There are 5 long pouches per box.  On the back of each pouch is a measuring line for liquids, so once you pour your oats into a bowl you know exactly how much water to add to the mix.  Sometimes I also add a bit of 2% milk, which adds a nice creaminess to the oatmeal.    Here are highlights from the box that may be helpful:  - Made with 100% whole grain oats and flax seeds  - 160 calories, 0g trans fat, 0mg cholesterol, 220mg sodium/serving  - 28 grams of whole grains/serving  - 170mg ALA OMEGA-3/serving    I bought these on sale at my local grocery store for $1/box.  I'm hoping to see them on sale again!  It was a great impulse buy  :o)"
5.0	Have used and loved  SweetLeaf packets and liquid drops and now enjoying the shaker jars.  Love the fine consistency of the powder which dissolves well in drinks and great for shaking on grapefruit, etc. Will definitely buy again.
5.0	my every day travel to work cup of coffee, no suger  no cream  make and go.....Big caramel  fan this is so good....recommended to many and share some k cups.
5.0	If you are using a drip coffee maker, I suggest using two filters, or the taste will be poor. With two filters, to slow the drip process, the taste of this coffee comes through.
5.0	While you can't make bread like it looks on the cover, you can make simply awesome bread with this mix.  You don't even have to toast it, or slather it with butter or other toppings.  I LOVE it.  It's also so easy to make.
5.0	I was so pleased when I received these.  They are exactly as discribed by the seller.  They are adorable on the cookies I made for Christmas, they taste good, and they are easily eaten, not like some candy decoration that almost break your teeth.<br /><br />I'm very pleased and would order them again, and yes they arrived promptly.
5.0	Haven't tried all the flavors yet, but the caramel, hazelnut flavors are very good so I expect them all to be just as good.  No aftertaste, except good coffee flavor.  Bought the pump dispenser top and this was a good buy also as it allows you to use the same amount each time.
5.0	Definitely a must have staple in anyone's pantry.
5.0	these are my favorite kind bars by far.  overall kind is still expensive
5.0	I'm hooked on this flavorful coffee after a visit to Canada. Best deal found here on Amazon.
5.0	Healthy small plants arrived promptly. They were still wet and package contained item to keep them warm. They have already grown in one week.
5.0	As a Vegan, I found this product exactly what I needed.
1.0	Too high for amount of noodles
1.0	The flavor is very mild, but to have a nice cup, you have to use twice the amount of beans!  Not strong at all, practically decaf!
1.0	It contains MSG so I will not buy any more.
1.0	Very poor quality.  I'm extremely disappointed with these mushrooms especially since they were so expensive.  The mushrooms were sliced from really large Shitake.  The problem is that they were so large that they had gone woody. Even after soaking them for over an hour and then further boiling them for another hour they were still uneatable.  The caps are fine but most of the stems are completely useless.  So about 50% of the bag is usable.  I won't buy this brand again and if you're wise you won't either.
1.0	This coffee isn't worth the savings!  It is just bad!!  All the flavors in the variety pack are terrible.  We threw ours away.
1.0	My wife has been on a GF diet for a few years now, and recently our son was diagnosed as well. She found and ordered this product to try out and we all loved the taste right away. I was a little dismayed at the price per bag, but I soon found out that pretty much all GF specialty foods were on the pricey side and I needed to get used to it, especially b/c she had to order most of it online (add S&H).    But then they opened up a Trader Joe's right down the street from us this past year and we discovered a near-identical cereal product for half the price!!! Same flavor, same ingredients, same GF assurance...but only $2.99 a bag.    They even started carrying this product in our local Kroger grocery stores recently, but it's still $6.99 per bag!!! So no S&H, but you're still paying crazy $$$ for cereal.    No contest for us...TJ all the way.
1.0	It's extremely salty, and colors everything black. What does this thing have to do with caviar?<br />I bought the 2 cans but couldn't even finish one. Tried offering it to friend and after one taste, no one would want any more...
1.0	this dressing has phosphoric acid in it all of the name brand ranch dressings do if you look even the H-E-B store brand ranch dressing here in south texas has it a lot of sodas have it to its not good for your teeth and if you are getting a bad taste in your mouth after eating this stuff its because of the phosphoric acid
1.0	Crapy Halloween Candy and in small packages.  Nothing like picture and was not well described.
1.0	I loooooooove matcha in all forms and was hoping to have found a way to make a quick green tea latte without paying tea shop prices. But this mix is quite a disappointment. Even after putting 4+ spoonfuls in (3 are recommended) the green tea flavor was barely perceptible. I will keep looking for a better mix and give this Trader Joe's product a thumbs down.
1.0	the product hade the funniest smell and taste...it was awful!!!
1.0	All I can imagine while eating this was the old &#34;Wheres the beef?&#34; commercials from wendys.  Its a can of beans, no meat to be found in it.<br /><br />False advertising and I will not be purchasing again.
1.0	Absolutely awful.<br /><br />After opening the can I was met with a smell that I pretty much expected, fake smoke smell. Next I heated it up in a pot on the stove and a giant grease puddle appeared floating on the top of the soup. I spooned off the grease and with some amount of resignation decided to give it a taste. Couldn't be that bad, could it?<br /><br />DISGUSTING. It was so gross I threw it right down the sink. The chunks quickly clogged up the sink screen which meant it drained slowly and left a layer of grease and smell coating the entire basin. I really don't think that I've eaten anything worse and I've tried some questionable things.<br /><br />I'd only recommend serving this &#34;soup&#34; to someone that you really hate.
1.0	Too small and too few. for a company of four you would need minimum 4 - 8 packages. Trader Joe's sells excellent small pancakes, very gentle and tasty.
1.0	I have purchased Russell Stover sugar free chocolates directly from their site and never had any problems.  I decided to order this product from Amazon and was extremely disappointed.  The candies had at some time melted and stuck to the paper, so I can only conclude they were stored in extreme heat.  They also had that white residue that  appears on chocolate that has been frozen.  Really no break in the price, but I would definitely NOT buy these chocolates through Amazon again.
1.0	I'm generally a big fan of the Crystal Light products, like to mix mine in 24 oz water, rather than the 16 oz suggested. This flavor had an off, 'soapy' taste. A much better choice are the two hydration flavors -- lemon and raspberry.
1.0	very upset about this purchase, after opening the and eating one realize item expired one year ago ended throwing the whole box to garbage. vendor should be more aware of what they are selling.
1.0	I was thrilled to see that I could get our favorite tartar sauce on-line--our local shop had stopped carrying it.  Not so thrilled with the separated mess I received--looked a little like blue cheese dressing!  Also not so thrilled that it could not be returned.
1.0	Great sauce, but bought off SaltLick's direct website and got 2 bottles and rub for $19.95.  Someone is making a ton of money on these chumps reselling them stuff they can bet directly for a fraction of the price.
1.0	Real oily of gives you heartburn and I don't get heart burn!!
1.0	They changed the formula and it is horrible !! Why???<br />Please change it back.... Nasty, very thick shell on these.
1.0	These are the worst apricots ever, dry and tasteless.  I specifically ordered Turkish because they are suppose to be some of the best.  Didn't get sulphur free so they would be more moist and flavorable. I threw them out, they were not even a resemblance of apricot.  Order someplace else.  Dr. Zenia
1.0	Not any thicker than regular caned coconut milk. 6 of the cans arrived dented in the middle. The box was perfect, don't know how this could happen. I am concerned that the lining will be cracked. Pay attention the cans are tiny, like a bottle of baby food, 5.4 ounces. I will go back to the Trader Joes coconut cream. It is much better. This is overpriced, my mistake, I didn't read the can ounces.
1.0	"I don't often review products, but after buying this peanut butter and discovering its strangely fishy taste, I felt the need to search \\""Smart Balance Peanut Butter fish\\"" with Google. Sure enough, plenty of consumers agree that this peanut butter tastes like fish. It's likely the five star reviews you see on this and other sites are paid for by GFA Brands, as it doesn't seem possible that anyone could miss the fishy taste, which closely resembles fish oil capsules. You may also notice that most of the positive reviews here and elsewhere take the, \\""That other reviewer is crazy,\\"" approach. Another clue that these reviews probably aren't real."
1.0	Beware! This is only THREE BAGS of the hot and crispy, you can buy a whole case (18 bags) for less money. DH didn't read the ad, Make sure that you don't make the same mistake. What a rip-off!!
1.0	the almonds were soft and stale and had a bad taste i had to throw all of them away.  will never order them again.  the walnuts i ordered from this same company were fine.
1.0	Poor  quality. ..taste is just blah...just  disappointed. ..
1.0	"The Kraft Foods company contributed $2,000,500 to defeat the California Prop 37 also known as \\""The California Right to Know Genetically Engineered Food Act.\\"". Do you really want to buy from a company that does not want you to know that GMO is in your food?"
1.0	The packaging was a joke - there were 16 dented k-cups in a brown paper lunch sack.  The k-cups that arrived were not all Grove Square brand, and not all of them were even cappuccino.  I received 8 pumpkin flavor, 4 of which were a completely different brand, and the caramel flavored k-cups were missing altogether.  Heaven only knows where these have been, and who handled them, in the garbage they go.  This is bait and switch at it's finest.<br /><br />Kudos to Amazon for painless refund! The k-cups are ineligible for return because they are a food item. Amazon fulfilled the order for folks that sold the pack (Deals On Call), and took care of it for me. Do not waste your time with this seller or this product.
1.0	This is a good idea but after 10 attempts and fails I gave up.  I tried three different coffee grinds and tried filling the pod different each time.  The adhesive did not stick.  The coffee had to be packed firmly to get the holes punched but then the coffee would not flow through the capsule and would cause the machine to shut down.  The only thing I accomplished was wasting more coffee.
1.0	Completely flavorless. It neither tastes nor smells of vanilla, although it is dark in color!<br /><br />It recommends that you use half the amount of extract that you normally would in a recipe. To you, a fellow consumer, I ask: how much of the (liquid) extract would you put into a 16-20 ounce drink -- more than two tablespoons? I ended up putting over a tablespoon of this powder into a shake that was primarily soy milk and unflavored protein powder, and if I had been given it blind and asked to identify the ingredients, would have said &#34;Soy milk and protein powder. Why, there's something else in here?&#34;<br /><br />The packet claims that they offer a 30 day money back guarantee - when I go to return it through Amazon two weeks after purchase, I get the error message 'This item isn't eligible for return.'
1.0	I'll give the product one star just because it is a Keto friendly sweetener and that is what we were looking for. Unfortunately the taste is quite bitter so now we have two jars of this stuff taking up room in our cabinet (luckily they're quite small).
1.0	If you like chocolate that smells like a childs sick and tastes as if it is made from expired milk, this is for you.
1.0	Shipping is way overpriced for this item.  I can get a similar product at efooddepot for a flat $4.99 no matter how many bags I order.  Here I get charged for each bag, even though they will go in the same shipment.  I think they should revisit their shipping charge mechanism.  I placed an order for 6, and the shipping turned out to be $15.99.  I just looked at the shipping tracker and it says it will take almost two months to get to me via USPS.  Doesn't sound like priority shipping to me, so they are making a bundle from shipping.  I'm waiting to see if they appropriately bundle my order, and if they do, I will return with a positive review on how well they manage their shipping prices.
1.0	This is so gross. I've had other protein shakes but this one just taste so bad. I tried it with milk and water and ice and I can never drink the entire  glass
1.0	I received the pods and after several days am very disappointed. Several of the pods I've used are defective.......they do not brew the appropriate size coffee (pressing the largest cup size I get less than a quarter cup), it comes out in single drips from the very start of the brewing process and many, many grinds in my cup. Now,I don't want to us the remaining pods (I never know which will brew as described) for fear of breaking my Keurig brewer.<br />Having grown up in Brooklyn I was very anxious to try these Keurig pods. I loved the packaging design and the fact that it was  avariety pack. That's where it ends.
1.0	I bought the chocolate one at my local health food store and just had to write a review on here, please don't waste you're money on this flavor. Not sure about the others but this one has no chocolate flavor whatsoever or even any flavor at all. When you first drink it it tastes like water but when you take a couple more sips it kind of taste a little bit like a vanilla. I put it for the longest steep time and this has no taste at all. I'm really disappointed because I heard really good reviews on this particular one but it taste just like chocolate but it really doesn't.
1.0	I thought I'd give it a try, but was very disappointed! The popped corn is very small, which I could live with since there is, as advertised, very little if any hulls that result. The unfortunate thing is that the taste is just bad. It even left a bad after taste! I do NOT recommend this popcorn. Try Great Northern NGMO popcorn. It leaves some hulls, but the taste is very good and pops almost all the kernels.
1.0	The darn thing drips constantly, so for that reason it's a fail.
1.0	I'd like to add fiber to my diet but this product tastes like sawdust (or how I imagine sawdust to taste)
1.0	Just read in the paper today that these contain dangerous amounts of lead! There's a lawsuit, but Trader Joe's hasn't pulled the products yet. Shame on them!<br /><br />There are other ginger and prunes imported from Asia sold at a variety of stores that were also named. Target was the only store reported to have pulled their items off the shelf promptly.
1.0	I bought these thinking they would become a staple food in my diet, replacing pastas for virtually low calories. I don't know if I just haven't figured out how to cook them properly but I can't stand them! And I have tried multiple times. The consistency is WAAAY too slimy and I am not even a texture person! It smells like fish, which goes away when you rinse it. But I can't figure out how to cook it so that it stops being so damn slimy.
1.0	started to turn moldy in a very short space of time - used maybe 6 beans and they were great - nice fragrance - great flavor - stayed soft and pliable - just the balance of the order went bad
1.0	No coffee taste at all, wish I had not purchased them
1.0	I won't buy it. I saw some of it. It is not as described. The shipping cost is outrageous.
1.0	I love coconut water but this brand tastes awful. Bad smell, funky aftertaste, and the bits of coconut taste old.
1.0	Barley IS gluten. This item is NOT gluten free. People with allergies or Celiacs Disease DO NOT EAT THIS PLEASE! It WILL make you sick. Also, this company could get sued for selling things that will make people ill. Claiming your bars are gluten free when they are not is stupid. Don't be dumb. Take this off of the gluten free list.
1.0	These are not actual Kona coffee beans, the name &#34;Kona Blend&#34; is deceiving. If you use a ton of coffee and very little water you could get a good cup, I do pourover brewing and as the first water hits the grounds a nice aroma comes out but very shortly this aroma is replaced by a cardboard smell which ends up as the overwhelming flavor of this coffee
1.0	I used to live in NYC, where it was easy to find good figs. Organic Turkish figs were my favorite, being juicy & flavorful. After moving to NH, suddenly finding a source of organic figs became a challenge. I decided to check Amazon, and was pleasantly surprised to find this well-reviewed product. I placed an order for two pounds, and was excited & looking forward to getting my figs.<br /><br />Boy, did my excitement disappear in a jiffy after receiving and tasting these figs:<br /><br />1. These figs are dry. Hard and dry. Not succulent, soft, and chewy as they should be.<br /><br />2. There is a distinct aftertaste that I can't quite identify. Possibly a preservative.<br /><br />So, I threw them away.<br /><br />How disappointing.
1.0	This was one of the worst K-cups I've ever tried - and I've tried quite a few. This &#34;Sweet Mint&#34; tea tasted like I was sipping fluoride or toothpaste. On top of that, it was way too sweet. Definitely would not recommend for anyone who enjoys real tea.
1.0	It has artificial sweetner in it and is kind of gross if you do not like fake sugar.  I originally was just looking for a sparkling water with grapefruit essence/flavor, no sugar.  I ended up throwing out most of them a couple of years later because I never drank them.
1.0	we received this item and had the first 4 cups not operate correctly and forced grounds and water out of the cup and did not brew correctly.we had to clean the grounds out of the machine 4 times and did not try any others.we contacted customer service and they were very helpful  and are reshipping replacements to us.we would like to say this is the first problem we have had with the k cups.we do love the taste of this flavor and are awaiting our replacements!!!!
1.0	I should have returned these bags, but decided not to.  Both my wife and I noticed that after chewing this gum for a few days, that the tips of our tongues were a little numb and I myself lost a good deal of taste buds.  I've never had this happen, but I would imagine that whatever makes this gum hot(cinnamon), it can really wreck your taste.  It took about two weeks after I stopped using it for my tongue to feel normal again.  I'll never buy it again, that's for sure.
1.0	"Chips were broken into small pieces. Problem isn't amazon's, it's Stacy's. Stacy (or amazon) needs to pack the original box of six better, the bags move around too much. There was room for at least two more bags in the box.<br />Amazon packed the Stacy's box in their box very tight and good.<br /><br />I tried to complain to Stacy, they make it very hard, no luck.<br />Chips taste great though, maybe I'll pour them in a bowl with milk for breakfast.<br /><br />!!!WATCH THE PRICE!!!<br />I've ordered these chips several times now, still great even if broken but have found the amazon price to be all over the place.<br />$23 with free shipping all the way to $40 with $12 shipping. Come back the next day and prices and shipping has changed.<br />The $23 batch were in plain white bags that said \\""Not for retail sale\\"" on them. After I clicked add to cart I thought boy this is a good deal, I better order more. Just a minute later and the $23 option was nowhere to be found, closest price was $40 plus $12 shipping.<br /><br />My advice is be patient and persistent for a few days to get the best price.<br /><br />BTW, the $23 chips were hardly broken, exact same quality."
1.0	"People who rate this product have not seen cardamom before I guess.<br />It had lots of molds and bug marks. It was so bad that I didn't even open it. You cannot return it too!!!!<br />I knew something should be wrong because cardamom is very expensive if I buy it from Iran (they have the best ones) so when I saw this, I thought \\""wow, what a good deal\\""."
1.0	This popcorn cost as much for postage as it did for the purchase of it.  I was not at all pleased with it.
1.0	Seriously - in real life, the size of the container (light and flimsy, by the way) and the amount of food in it are underwhelming for 40 bucks.  I'm going to guess about $10, retail, for the food and you could throw a couple of bucks for the CARDBOARD like container.  This isn't your truly re-usable for a long time, metallic container you typically find holiday treats in.
1.0	My sister in law had a delicious crunchy bar and I thought these were them.  These are so gross, I can't  eat them. UGH.  I hate when I waste money like this.  These are truly disgusting. Mushy and gross.
1.0	Could not work with this product, it came  broken up and it would decintegrated.
1.0	I had to come back to edit my review down to one star due to headaches.  I can't recommend it. After a Web search I discovered this is a fairly frequent problem with people using this daily. This sensitivity built up for me over two to three weeks of use to the point where even small amounts trigger robust headaches. I only used about 2/3 of the can before this was firmly established. Some people may be more sensitive than others. Interestingly I still can eat Jell-O without issue. Buyers beware.<br />_____________________<br /><br />Completely soluble, but I have no idea how effective it is for soft tissue regeneration. I've been using regular jello for months now with pretty good results, so I'm not sure what the advantage is of this more expensive version, except obviously it can so easily be incorporated in almost anything liquid without any taste.<br /><br />Seems high quality, and high price.
1.0	Terrible taste and smell.
1.0	I don't know what to rate this. Normally I love (and my baby loves) the Turkey flavor. He has been eating them and we have been buying them for months. But the last box we got had gone bad. It was separated, watery and clumpy. I was trying to feed it to baby from the pouch and he wouldn't eat it - then I realized why. Amazon refunded my order, which was great, but Plum didn't seem to care. I want to know how much if bad - it should be recalled. Really disappointing because I want to buy more.
1.0	love the product, but poorly packed, damaged upon arrival.
1.0	I am sorry to say this product does not live up to its positive reviews that are listed.  Lipton makes better ice tea products.  The worst part about this product is you can NOT get a refund or even a credit.  Once you have bought it.... it is yours!  I did not like the taste or brewing instructions. Amazon obviously knows something I didn't about this product......Probably explains why there isn't any recourse......or refund.....
1.0	Very delicate. Arrived broken. Would think there would be extra padding for shippment. Infuser was inside pot. The infuser is very delicate and rim was crushed. I would not use this pot. Would be more for display. And it is very small. Could not find a size  on it when ordered.
1.0	Hoping to buy 100% sunflower oil. This page tells NOTHING about the item, not even the quantity!! Please, more information.
1.0	Product arrived in one giant chocolate ball. Everything has just melted together and was not edible. Big disappointment. Sent it back.
1.0	Got this recently thinking it would be nice to have to store more K-Cups on top of the counter. It was a total waste of money. The drawer would not come out, and in the process of trying to force it open, I broke several holes in the top of the foil on the K-Cups. The rough wire on the drawer cut my fingers. I ended up throwing the whole unit in the trash. Not good for anything.
1.0	This truffles cream contains more champignons (white mushrooms) than truffles. This is stated on the label of the jar, but not in the description.<br />And the seals of the jars were broken and oil leaked of both jars.
1.0	I have been buying a drink from Whole Foods for months now, which contains chia seeds. It's expensive, so I wondered if I could buy it online and make my own drinks with it. I saw this product and ordered it. After it arrived, I realized the seeds were spilling out from the sides of the package. Then, worst of all there were 5 small ants that came out of the package. I quickly put the packing outside to not let the ants invade the house. Due to bad packaging and ants, I did not even open up the box. I still want to try this product, but will go with another seller since I'm not the only one who found insects in their package.
1.0	I was so excited to open the package and prepare my first cup of Chai. It was a busy, crazy morning with kids running around and I was looking forward to sipping on it and relaxing. However, I could not even finish my first sip! This Chai must be made differently than the kind I usually get in smaller canisters. Either that, or I got a bad batch. Either way, I am going to end up throwing out this entire package. It is such a shame, especially considering the amount I paid for it.
1.0	Very teeny tiny not worth the money. Box stands not taller than a deck of playing cards.
1.0	"These bars are not what I expected from the Kashi brand.  They taste AWFUL (easily the worst bar I have ever tried) and I agree with other reviewers on the \\""burnt bananas\\"" taste.  They just taste strange aside from that, not at all like what you think of when you think of bananas.  The bars are also very dry.  Never, ever again.  I hate to waste food but these were so bad that I took one bite, spit it out, and threw the entire box away. :("
1.0	Not very good and definitely not worth the money. There are other way better vegetarian alternatives. I tried the Taco filling can today and although it was edible it definitely wasn't worth the cost. Instead of that you should buy Tofurky brand Chorizo Taco Filling in the refrigerated section at the grocery or health food store. It's really hard to find but it's totally worth it. It's a billion, trillion times better than this company's attempt.<br /><br />The mock Tuna by this company was so bad I just threw the rest of the can in the trash and am putting the second one in the trash too. It smells like real tuna which is not a plus for me and it just looks and TASTES gross.<br /><br />I haven't tried the chili yet. I'm expecting it to taste fine but it still wouldn't be worth the money.<br /><br />The chicken sliders tasted fine to me but that's only because I'm used to eating lots of weird vegetarian mock meat products. If you are or ever were a carnivore you will probably hate them along with everything else. Even though they tasted fine to me since there are only 2 in a can it makes it ridiculously more expensive than even other vegetarian products that aren't very cheap either but are a much better value than this.<br /><br />To sum up: Please do not buy this because it sucks!!!!
1.0	Appalling.<br />It is my fault for not reading the ingredients.<br />For some reason I thought there was dried apple juice. 5th listed is apple juice solids.<br />However I do not taste that.  First ingredient is sugar. That I DO taste.<br />I've tried to give them away with no takers. :(
1.0	I bought this item with such great expectations but I am disappointed in the taste.   Yes, it is true that it smells great, just like peaches, and it has no calories but when you taste this beverage, it reminds me of alka seltzer (yes, the pop-pop fizz fizz medicine).  I don't recommend this product.  However, if you can get past the bitter taste you may like it, buy with caution.   You may want to buy only one case, (24) cans, for about $12.00 on subscribe and save to make sure you like it.   I have tasted the Talking Rain kiwi strawberry which is five calories a can but it tastes great; the calories are probably because of the juice and splenda added but I don't mind the five calories per can to have a great tasting beverage!
1.0	IT ARRIVED SPOILED -OBVIOUSLY HAD BEEN IN STORAGE FOR FAR TOO LONG -IT REALLY OLD MERCHANDISE<br />AND SHOULD BE DISCARDED
1.0	If you are looking for a cup of tea with no real flavor, please buy this. I am an avid tea drinker; Oolong tea has a pleasant aroma of oriental spices and good flavor that dosent require added sweeteners. If you enjoy a good cup of tea, this is not the product. This tea seems like a combination of cheap teas, none with a hint of oolong. The tea even gave me a headache! The price of Oolong tea usually ranges between $5.00 to $7.00 for 20 tea bags depending on geographical area of the country. I should have known that $4.95 was too good to be true. They wont go to waste; tea bags are great for soaking tired aching feet after a run or treating foot fungus.  Certainly not organic!
1.0	WAY too packed with sugar. This is more sugar on top of sugar than the Turkish Delights I've had that were so good and varied that I couldn't tell what it was made of!
1.0	I've actually used ProFlowers before, but I won't be any longer due to their ongoing support for Limbaugh.  What girl would want flowers from a company who supports this guy?
1.0	I usually keep several packages of rice and noodle mixes in the pantry to use when we don't want a potato.  This is the first and last time I will buy the cheddar broccoli.  The SMELL is awful.  I cooked it according to package directions, but the minute I took the lid off the pot after simmering the smell hit me and made me sick.  I'm not sure how a dried mix can &#34;go bad&#34;, but this one certainly did.  Sorry Bear Creek.  I won't be spending my money on any of your dried mixes again.
1.0	This product lists its ingredients as 100% protein powder but it is not.  It is hemp protein and fiber powder.  All fiber if you ask me.  The taste is awful, I really can't think of anything to use this with unless you just need fiber and choke it down with a little water everyday.  I think it is nastier than straight psyllium husks.
1.0	The cooking time seems to be twice what is required by the box instructions.  Therefore my assessment is that the product is out of date.
1.0	The packaging must be very poor because it did not survive the trip to my house. So I do not know whether it would have enhanced my soup.  Too bad. I was hoping that it would have worked magic. I am afraid to give it a second chance. My UPS driver would probably kill me if it happened again.
1.0	"Bought this at a local retailer to try before I considered buying a \\""bulk\\"" qty on Amazon. Glad I didn't waste my money on a larger purchase.  I should have guessed from the \\""rattle\\"" the coffee made in the container that something wasn't right.  As the product header here on Amazon says \\""Instant\\"" in parenthesis, I wish I would have paid closer attention.  At least I'm only out about $6 for the one box I bought locally.  This is simply instant coffee, and even calling it \\""coffee\\"" is a stretch.  Doesn't really taste like any other coffee I've ever tried... and I've tried a bunch.  In a nutshell, little to no flavor, no aroma, and doesn't cost that much less than a \\""real\\"" coffee K-cup.<br /><br />Grove Square does not say anything on their packaging that this is an \\""instant\\"" coffee, other than a fine print \\""soluble and microground Arabica coffee\\"".  Again, shame on me for not seeing \\""soluble\\"" in the print.<br /><br />Starbucks proved you make instant with some bold flavor in their Via line.  And honestly, if you want a good instant, don't buy the Grove Square... buy a box of Starbucks Via and just run hot water through your Keurig.  You'll be much happier.  Otherwise, buy a different brand of K-cups that have standard \\""brew\\"" coffee in them."
1.0	Very disappointed in this less-than-robust tasting coffee.  It was bland and weak.  I even tried using more of it with several different methods of brewing.  Don't waste your money.
1.0	This stuff has the distinction of the only coffee I ever had that tasted as bad as it smelled and now I have an air freshener going to get rid of the smell.  I know Baskin Robbins has 30+ flavors for a reason but this product stretches the limits of my imagination when I try to describe its smell and taste as anything but sickening...not smoky, burnt, or anything else, but whatever it is I truly regret purchasing.<br /><br />I do not know if this is how this coffee is supposed to taste, but I will not even risk a return and replacement.<br /><br />In one felt swoop, this has jumped into the sole place of the worst purchase I ever made on Amazon.
1.0	Quality was poor.  The chocolate portion and the mint portion fell apart.  It was if they were old or the formula changed.
1.0	People all over the net talk about how amazing these are. Maybe I'm immune. Maybe it's because I'm not pure of heart. Maybe it's because one time I saw Mrs. Crabtree changing clothes with her windows open when I was 8 years old. Maybe it's because I once spilled salt on the table and instead of tossing a bit over my left shoulder I stabbed a Dwarven warrior in the eye with a Lady Bic (I'll be sure to leave a comment on that product as well, but that's a different story). Maybe it's because I haven't washed my hands in 6 years (Thanks Monica Groplowski). Maybe it's because I've never seen a rainbow. Maybe it's because I brush my tongue to vigorously.<br /><br />Anyways...these didn't work. I don't know why.
1.0	It's all about the taste, isn't it? I did not enjoy this beverage at all and in fact could not even finish it. Enough said.
1.0	This is some of the most unappealing, unpleasant, unsmooth, and bitter tasting chocolates I have ever encountered. The consistency and texture is also bizarre. If I said what I actually felt about this chocolate, I would probably have my review censored.  I am fairly confident that humans are the only animals on earth that would even come near this substance.  The survival of this company is also making me wonder if a large percentage of humans were born without the capacity to taste.  I have yet to meet anyone who likes this product, but obviously some do, which is actually a bit mind blowing. I would describe it as paranormal.
1.0	Received 6 bags of 2.6 oz chips, when listing clearly says 14.1 oz. Filing a claim.
1.0	2 pieces of gum, with a declared value of $3.99? REALLY? Perhaps they were combining the cost of the two pieces (.10), to the cost of the bubble-lined envelope and postage ($3.89) to get the total?!? Granted; it was a free sample with purchase, but still, it's deceitful to place a $3.99 price on what should be declared a free sample with no monetary or resale value.<br /><br />This &#34;New Gum&#34; Juicy Fruit tasted exactly how I remembered it to taste; full of flavor for the first 30 seconds, then the flavor is gone and you are left with a wad of softened rubber in your mouth. Hardly worth the risk of ingesting all of the chemical additives they put in the stuff...
1.0	sticky, sugar like tar
1.0	The first ingredient is corn syrup!  Yuk!  Shame on you ALAGA!
1.0	Didn't come with base so all water would spill out the bottom , very disappointing... it was such a nice tree
1.0	these pickles are too bitter, and needs more salt. I didnt like them at all. They are too plan for my taste bugs. I wish I'd known what the pickles taste like before I purchased them. I think I'm more interested in the dill and sour pickles with a bit of crunch. I think I should order them in a store before I purchase them online for now on.
1.0	No good for me  I have and I,pad 4 don,t work for me but it would work for I.pad 2. And 3 sorry no good for I,pad 4
1.0	Truly vile stuff!  Sorry.  I have been vegan for twenty-two years, vegetarian for fifteen years, before that. I have tried just about all dairy alternatives out there.  This product tastes like the grass on your front lawn smells, after it's mowed, absolutely no lie.  I cannot imagine that the five-star reviews, on here, are genuine, but who knows.  I do know that I can chug wheat grass, for its benefits, but that's a quick deal.  Drinking this as a regular, sipped beverage, or having it with your breakfast cereal takes a stronger anti-gag reflex than what I have.  I honestly poured the whole container down the kitchen sink after my first few spoonfuls of cereal.  It's really that bad.  NOT RECOMMENDED.
1.0	Every single can was dented.
1.0	I finally gave up using my Senseo and gave ti to Goodwill because it was always such a hassle and expense finding and buying the pods.  The coffee tasted great, especially the dark, but they are too hard to keep in stock and too expensive now.
1.0	Not what I expected.  These are TINY, HARD cookies.  I was looking for medium sized, semi-soft biscotti.
1.0	Not only do I agree with all the negative comments from other posters, but I'll add that this crab as NO flavor. In a blind taste test I probably couldn't have identified this as crab. I'm well aware that this isn't lump crab meat. If you're looking for something that is good crab without the expense of lump, try the Trader Joe's brand.
1.0	I have purchased this product for many years locally but could not find them this past Christmas.  They were purchased for my husband and both of us were extremely disappointed.  I could not tell from your ad that they were irregulars which means they were not acceptable for normal gift boxes.  The price was extremely high for what I got and I will not purchase again and that is why there is one star.
1.0	My order for this candy was very disappoiting.....I am allergic to mint so I go to great lengths to find cinnamon from candy, toothpaste, mouthwash & etc.....I get my candies in the mail yesterday to only find out after I put it in my mouth that it is cinnamon mixed with mint the mint taste is stronger then the cinnamon, NOWHERE on the package did it say it was cinnamon mixed with mint. I paid $10.95 for two pounds which is expensive but worth it if I would have gotten what I wanted to only give it away to someone else.
1.0	Arrived totally crushed and powdered  and unusable. The plastic bag had a whole in it with crumbs all in the box.  The only thing I can use this for is a crumb crust for coating food with.  Very disappointed!
1.0	I've tasted truffles: black summer, white alba, fresh, infused (salt, risotto), fake (oil). This smells and tastes nothing like truffles. It does have specks of something in there, and it does have a mushroomy smell, but it's a harsher, cheaper mushroom smell.  I would rather use a truffle oil which doesn't even have real truffles in it.
1.0	WHAT A DUMBA$$ I AM!! they don't put the weight in the add and I figured it had to be a five pound bag for the price.  Boy did I get taken!!!! Geuss I should send it back for a refund and it took like 10 days to get it.  Seems like for that much money someone would show up and offer to pleasure you within 24 hours with the coffee.
1.0	it pains me to even give this product one star, but that's as low as your star scale goes. Unfortunately, it's not beyond the makers of this unacceptable product to market and sell their unusable, below a star level manufactured  Anti-Wrinkle  Cream. Surely you jest when you gave it this undeserving title.<br />Obviously, the Olivella company focusses more on it's clean, neat packaging and handsome glass container than it  does on the actual cream contained inside. Unfortunately for me, the box that it arrived in was accidently shredded in the compactor or I would have return this product post haste.<br />And, even though the first application of this cream (which was equivalent to spreading Velveeta cheese on my face), sucked the moisture from my skin faster than a bee can drain the pollen from a flower, out of fairness, I did try it for several days. To my surprise and horror, It actually produced more crinkled wrinkles than upping its &#34;anti&#34; as described in your advertisement.<br />I have used olive based products in the past and was thrilled when I spotted your product on Amazon. It arrived on time as promised. The packaging listed mostly natural ingredients. However, the only ingredients that seemed to be performing was the sodium based ones.<br />So, to some up my feelings concerning your Anti-Wrinkle Cream in a nut shell; I would have to be a complete nut job to ever consider purchasing or recommending any of your products to anyone.
1.0	I have tried three different types of Timothy's k-cups and couldn't figure out why the coffee was spilling out all over the counter during the brewing process.  I de-scaled my machine 4 times, and then tried again, still happened.  So my husband looked at it and discovered the seal of the cups (most of them) comes unglued and coffee overflows the pod holder, with coffee grounds.  It makes a disaster of my machine.      I am disgusted that I have $40 worth of Timothy's coffee left and cannot really use it.  I will give them to my daughter and see if she has the same problem, but Emeril's Jazzed-up Decaf works great and actually tastes better.      Timothy's lost my business completely, and I was an Amazon subscriber.  Now it's all Emeril's, all the time.
1.0	I am rating this 1 star but my mom likes it so for her I will give it a 5 star for her because she liked it but for me I am giving it 1 star because I tryed it and I didn't like it I would recommened this to anyone who likes just cappuccino coffee
1.0	I am not a picky eater all, but I find flackers to be really gross.  What you should realize before purchasing is that these crackers are literally just whole flax seeds pressed into cracker form.  The seeds are held together by a glue-like substance.  The overall effect is not appetizing.  The texture is weird, as is the taste.  I was hoping these would be good low-carb alternative to regular crackers, but will have to keep looking.
1.0	There is no indication anywhere in the package in reference to this product being non-gmo. Most likely it is GMO, I will have to discard mine or give to a junk food eater.
1.0	The leaves were turning black when I got it, and it died.  I looked up how to care for it, and used distilled water and made sure it was always moist.
1.0	Would not give as a gift.  The basket has a piece of cardboard to make a false floor even with the top of the cardboard box.  There were only 3 cashew roca pieces in this huge box.  There was a tiny bag of pistachios in the larger box leading you to think there were more pistachios.  Small bag of mini ritz type crackers with peanut butter, four tea bags.  This is a rip off, do not buy it.  If the thought counts....
1.0	It's supposed to help with dry mouth but all the strawberry did was make my mouth more dry once the drop was gone.  The lemon raspberry flavor actually worked so I assumed the strawberry would too.  Boy was I wrong!!
1.0	The vita coco I received had a very strong and horrible taste, so I went to Kroger and bought a carton of vita coco off the shelf.  To my surprise, it tasted great!  Clearly my amazon vita coco is spoiled or bad from the start. I only tried 3 out of 12 cartons, but they were all consistently bad.  The expiration date of my amazon vita coco is Dec 2013, and the one I got from Kroger is Nov 2013, so no issues with date.<br /><br />Anyone know if there is a way to request a replacement for an order that is clearly spoiled?  Amazon does not do the normal return service with grocery items.
1.0	You only know the soul of a company (or a person for that matter) when something goes WRONG. Well there was a mix up on my order. Unfortunately the woman on the phone was unfriendly, accusing and rude! Wow! How can people run a business like this? How can they think it is okay to talk to someone, much less a customer, with such an attitude? Needless to say I did not receive my order in time for my event. It is time to find a different brand of gluten free flours, any ideas?
1.0	I purchasrd a packet of creamy wild rice soup mix. I couldn't eat it because it was too salty. WHY OVERSALT SOMETHING? PEOPLE CAN ADD SALT TO TASTE. I had to throw it away.
1.0	Rated 1 star for this seller gouging people!  These are $1.99 per box at your local grocery store.  $11+$5 =$16 per box?! Geez.<br /><br />On the note of taste, they are just ok.  The taste of green tea is very light, mostly taste of cookies.  Not really worth the $2 per box, much less $16 per box.
1.0	The package arrived and the contents were all melted together into a big blob of pumpkins. I had to send it back.
1.0	I tried several times and so has a friend of mine from India. The seeds never grew. We will try to buy locally. Save your money, they do not grow.
1.0	This seems expensive....I really just want the glass jar.. So I can make a cleaning spray bottle, but for this price I might as well just buy a glass spray bottle!
1.0	This is absolute BS that its $70. I got it a few weeks ago half the price.
1.0	Make sure when you shop for Kopi Luwak that you are getting the actual 100% Kopi. There are a number of blends out there that sport a whopping 2% or 3% of Kopi beans mixed with something else. The true Kopi has a remarkable smokey, silky character with a wonderful caramel finish that coats your mouth long after swallowing. I just shared some with my veteran coffee roaster (his first taste) and he remarked that it was the best coffee he had tasted since the old Kona before the quality dropped in the early 90's. Real Kopi should be treated like gold and with respect by: Using a burr grinder on the fine side of medium grind; making a single cup at a time; and using water at about 190F (boil filtered water and let it sit for 1 minute). Wet the grounds (about 2 standard coffee measuring scoops) with a little water at first, then pour just enough for one 8 oz. cup. BTW I discovered you can reuse the grounds from this process one more time with only a little reduction in quality if you make the second cup right away. You can stretch your Kopi dollars this way since you are spending about 7$ a cup.
1.0	While I admire the company itself and the ingredients they pride them selves on, this is hands down the worst &#34;movie theatre&#34; popcorn I've ever had.<br /><br />The buttery flavor is non-existent. Don't even try to heat it up because it burns quick!<br /><br />I was so unsatisfied by this, I had to throw the entire bag away.<br /><br />If you're into movie theater style popcorn and don't want to head out to the movie theater, do yourself a favor and avoid this product.<br /><br />Trader Joes brand movie theater style popcorn ain't half bad but it's gmo.
1.0	We purchased a live Bonasi from another retailer last spring and love it. When I saw this on Amazon, decided to purchase a Christmas gift for our neighbors. The first one came in losing about 20% of its leaves and very small and wimpy looking. Had to toss it out. Definitely a Charlie Brown look. Called Amazon and they did get another out to us in 2 days free of charge, but it is worse than the first. Time is up now to give prior to Christmas which is a major disappointment. This would have been a great gift if handled properly. (Just posted a PICTURE of this sad bonzai. Please scroll way down on the lower right side for customer pics. Amazon has moved the location for customer photos.)
1.0	nope. This tastes like sugary dirt. Eww.
1.0	I tried these the other day. Last I checked oreos ARE cookies and cream, they taste no different. They are gonna have to try better than that. BTW why on earth would you pay $13.43 cents for one pack of oreos???
1.0	This is a TOTAL rip off. Very small items. Just thrown in a basket with cellophane and a bow. You would do so much better going to a dollar store, buying a simple basket and fake grass. Then go to the grocery store and buy a couple bags of trial sized jerky and a disgusting candy bar that breaks your teeth. You will have saved at least $30 from their $42 price. Shame on Amazon for allowing such deception!
1.0	This has to be the worst. Tastes like burnt bitter chocolate. I will never buy this again
1.0	I would not recommend purchase of this product. The quality is not on the level of other Gynostemma purchased with other companies. Please be careful of the &#34;weight&#34;. I hope this company gives back to some community cause in Thailand. At least I will feel like I am not being totally taken advantage of.
1.0	the title says it all. I tried three at once, and it still didn't work. Lemons still tasted like crap. Waste of my money. I was excited too......
1.0	Really just a one use product.  The large one broke the first time it was used.  Don't buy these unless you are looking for a high price one use item
1.0	I bought this because I like to start a new beverage style with a kit before buying piecemeal.  I've done many many other fermented beverages such as cider, beer, tepache, so I'm not new to fermentation, but either this kit shipped with dead yeast or the instructions were completely wrong, because after 8 days the measured gravity is so high, it doesn't even read on my hydrometer.  I added up to the 6 gallon line exactly as the instructions said but it's so incredibly thick I couldn't get it through my racking cane without using it like a manual pump.<br /><br />I don't know if the yeast was bad or the instructions were wrong but I do not recommend this kit.  If other people had really good results then be suspect of the incredibly varied quality!  Buy it for the must + extras but get your own yeast!
1.0	Please do not buy this junk. It is the worst coffee you could possibly get. Produces no crema at all and tastes like burnt bitter coffee. The pods have residue coffee on the side not cleanly packed.
1.0	taste was horrible. Won't be ordering this again, my apologies
1.0	I ordered these chips because of the prime shipping and jalepeno-lime flavor.  They cam packaged just fine.  However, they smelled and tasted like cardboard.  Plus, no jalepeno or lime flavor!  Just couldnt taste them.  Terrible.  I am in Afghanistan and so I left all the chips out for other people to eat because they were that bad.  I'll never order these again.
1.0	Maybe I just got a bad batch, but these smelled and tasted very old.  But they were not out of date!
1.0	I'm glad I tried one of these at home before taking it to work for lunch because I would have gone hungry. It was inedible. If this was a post-apocalyptic world and this was all there was left to eat I could probably manage it but even then.... gross.
1.0	I bought a huge bottle of this from GFS in order to have it on hand for cooking. Big mistake, this stuff is more savory than sweet and sour. We are not fans. I will use it up, but it sure won't be eagerly!
1.0	Bai5, 5 calorie Malawi Mango, 100% Natural, Antioxidant Infused Beverage, 18-Ounce Bottles (530mL) (Pack of 12), by bai.<br />This is tea? It has a fruit punch taste, and a strange chemical aftertaste. It contains a sugar substitute Carbohydrate called Erythritol and another sugar substitute called Stevia, and why I don't know, as a mango contains sugar of its own and does not need these chemical additives. It also contains unspecified &#34;natural flavors&#34;. This is another misguided attempt to produce a tea drink. It certainly does not taste like tea, and the tea (extract) is way down the list of ingredients, when it should have been at or near the top of the list. Sadly, this drink is just another form of belly wash, that may give you gas pains and diarrhea. It happened to me the next day, after I drank it with a late evening full meal. No thank you. One star for this tea(?) drink.<br /><br />According to mercola.com (http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2010/04/20/sugar-dangers.aspx):<br />&#34;*Sugar alcohols like xylitol, glycerol, sorbitol, maltitol, mannitol, and erythritol are neither sugars nor alcohols but are becoming increasingly popular as sweeteners. They are incompletely absorbed from your small intestine, for the most part, so they provide fewer calories than sugar but often cause problems with bloating, diarrhea, and flatulence.<br />*Stevia is a highly sweet herb derived from the leaf of the South American stevia plant, which is completely safe (in its natural form).&#34;<br /><br />The Nutrition Facts, and INGREDIENTS, as listed on the bottle label:<br /><br />Nutrition Facts:<br />Serving Size: 8 fluid ounces (237mL), Servings Per Container About 2.<br />Total Fat 0g.<br />Sodium 5mg.<br />Total Carbohydrate 9g (Sugars 1g, Erythritol 8g).<br />Protein 0g.<br /><br />INGREDIENTS:<br />Filtered water, erythritol (natural sweetener), mango juice concentrate, natural flavors, organic coffeefruit, citric acid, ascorbic acid, organic stevia extract, white tea extract, beta carotene for color.<br /><br />Bai 5 Proprietary Anti-oxidant Blend: Organic Coffeefruit and White Tea Extract.<br />70mg of caffeine per bottle (like two cups of green tea).<br />Contains 4% Juice.<br />No Artificial Colors or Preservatives; Gluten Free; Low Glycemic; (U) Kosher, Vegan, Soy & GMO Free; PRT 1(BPA-FREE); UPC Code: 8 52311 00400 6.<br /><br />Ships from and sold by JUNGLEBLAST.<br /><br />Manufactured by Bai Brands, LLC, P.O.

1.0	I've ordered this product three times.  This last time, the bag was sealed but the chocolates were all melted and squashed and there were chocolate stains inside the bag.  I returned it.  YECCH!  Never again.
1.0	"I love this cereal and have not been able to find it for years. It turns out it's here on amazon as well as only in walmart super stores, which sucks because I hate walmart with a passion and won't go there unless it's something I can't get anywhere else or it's late and I need it.    However the problem here is that this products description says it's a pack of 4 but I only got 1 box and it says that it's package 1 of 1 and completes my order.     When I seen the normal sized box it came in, I thought \\""well I'm the noob for not reading. It was probably 4 travel boxes\\"" but it wasn't when I opened it and it was just 1 normal box, bot 4 as described.    5 for the cereal, 1 for this service."
1.0	Everyone swears by this tea but it didn't work for me.. I've drank it 2 times a day for at least two weeks before coming to the conclusion that it want working. I know it says drink 3-5 cups but I doubt it would make a difference if 2 cups didn't make any.. I didn't want to depend on his tea if I had to force myself to drink sooo much with little results since its pricey. Instead I tried fenugreek and blessed thistle together and that worked wonders! My milk is finally back!
1.0	I grew shiitake mushrooms in two big oak logs last year . It didn't grow until now. I may have done something wrong with growing or taking care process. I am still hoping it will grow this year.
1.0	I've been trying to find the actual Biter Biscuits they made when my oldest was a baby.<br /><br />These are not the same thing.<br /><br />These are just cookies.<br /><br />The others were hard and stayed in one piece until they were gummed down or gnawed away. These things break and crumble into countless bits almost immediately.<br /><br />Instead of the individually wrapped ones you used to get, these are all just loose in the bag. Out of the 18 or 20 you get, only 2-3 cookies are not already broken into pieces too small for a little one to even hold in their hand.<br /><br />If you're looking for a bag of expensive broken cookies as a snack for a 5 year old, these might fit the bill.<br /><br />But these are NOT for babies and younger toddlers still learning the mechanics of eating, chewing, swallowing, etcetera.
1.0	The salsa lacked flavor, Was very watery , lacked spices. My family were very unhappy  with the salsa . I  purchased six jars. Not Happy.
1.0	Not appealing in any form, old, stale tasteless<br />I would not order these or recommend them to anyone<br />not worth your money to buy
1.0	I am a huge fan of Jasmine Green tea but this one is just plain awful. it tastes like if they would have just spilled a bottle of cheap women's perfume all over the green tea bags. the smell is totally artificial and so is the taste. would not recommend to anyone unless you like the idea of drinking perfume!!
1.0	Maybe it's because it's my first experience with Stevia... but I thought this soda tasted horrible! I had one can and can't bring myself to drink another one. We're donating it to the food pantry, but honestly I feel bad for the people that will have to drink it. I'm normally not harsh with reviews, but I have to say this product is BAD.
1.0	I googled for this flavour in the Keurig K cups and when this came up I thought I was ordering the K cups, my fault I suppose for rushing and not reading carefully enough but I was dismayed to discover that they could not be returned. All I did was to open the carton they were posted in so they are in a completely saleable condition. The company should make it very plain that they do not accept returns.
1.0	I ordered this in December and got it in early February. After two delays I finally got it. It was shrink wrapped and noticed dried fat where the legs joined. Yuk. If you're going to shrink wrap a pre cooked item, make sure that you drain it so that there's no fat trapped. I've tasted smoked before and I'd never tasted anything so salty. It was so salty that I couldn't eat it without warming it up. Maybe most people eat their food warm or hot, but if it's pre cooked, I prefer it cold from the fridge. I shouldn't have to warm something up in order to cover a nasty taste, in this case a taste that reminded me of something either soaked in brine or salt water. I waited so long for this turkey and had a craving for smoked whole turkey that I wasn't about to either cancel after the first delay or toss it  out after the first bite. Unfortunately the only whole turkeys in the stores here, you have to cook. Pre cooked is perfect for me. The only pre cooked smoked turkey in the store are just single legs which are few and far between. From the store I bought a smoked turkey leg to get used to the smokey taste. It didn't taste like it was soaked in brine and then shrink wrapped. I didn't have to warm it up to cover any taste. I could just take it right out of the package and eat it, so when I got this  turkey I thought I'd be eating the same thing. Instead it was like biting down into a salt water soaked piece of pre cooked meat.  I feel a little misled because it didn't taste smoked, but overly salted, I feel a little misled because the picture makes it look bigger and lighter than it really is, and the picture conveniantly doesn't show how its legs are held by a metal thingy which wasn't that easy to remove so I had to cut the meat around it. I'll never buy anything this expensive from one of Amazon's shippers who don't think they're accountable to anyone. They didn't have the food in stock, and they took their time answering Amazon who asked my question to them of when I'll get my turkey.  Amazon should've dropped them and found a smoked turkey supplier who ships when a product is ordered and returns inquiries to Amazon promptly, and makes it their business to deliver to their shipper. If they can't produce, Amazon should drop their supplier who thinks they're unaccountable or lose customers for that item.  This was awful.
1.0	Doesn't taste like pumpkin at all.
1.0	Yuk! Tastes gross. Texture not like peanut butter.
1.0	"I ordered this \\""thinking\\"" it was the Brach's Fall Festival Mellowcreme Mix.  This sounded very similiar, but it wasn't.  The various candy shapes/colors all tasted the same.  They were supposed to have different flavors for the various shapes.  The service from the provider was fine.  Just disappointed that the candy wasn't what I had expected.  Also thought the candy was a little pricy"
1.0	Absolutely horrible.  How does something like this make it to a shelf?
1.0	it's a gag gift and a certain fabric store has these for about one third of the cost that they have them here....... funny gift but would never pay this much for it....it's small...about the size of a regular computer mouse..... and is very cheaply made...... but none the less funny for the right people....
1.0	Are they serious?  These are half-size tea bags.  This should be labeled 50 count, not 100 because 2 bags definitely needed to make a decent cup!
1.0	Why does this product come up when I search for white chocolate?<br />Chocolate has never been near this product.
1.0	I probably would have liked these very much except they are very brown and have a burned flavor.  Apparently since the other reviews were good, they have a problem with quality control.  I will not be buying again because I don't want to chance another box like these.  They have lost a customer who probably would have bought regularly had these not been overcooked.
1.0	I should have ordered from Renfroe these were crusty. Not good. not worth it. cant eat them. they are no good.
1.0	Since Brach made the original A&W root beer barrels, and since I can no longer find the A&W ones, I figured that these, made by Brach, would have the same flavor, but they do not. Very disappointing.
1.0	I was really looking forward to trying these unusual BBQ Sweet Potato Chips, but when I tasted them, they were just terrible.  I returned them to amazon,since I couldn't even eat one.
1.0	This was the second order sent with the food product spilling out due to inner packaging being split open.  This was a replacement order because the first order arrived in the same condition.  Honestly, I don't think Amazon should be selling consumable items if they can't package it in a way that keeps it intact.  Who wants to eat something that arrives spilling out of the package.  I can understand why food is not a returnable item, but I can't understand why Amazon has not resolved this issue.  I was willing to accept a replacement item, if it arrived intact.  But since it did not, I expect a full refund.  The only reason I gave it one star was because it was a good price.  However, due to the unsanitary condition that it arrived in, we will not be eating it, so even one star is too much.  We spent over $15.00 for nothing!
1.0	The pineapple tastes HORRIBLE. the o lay way I can get it down is to hold my nose and chug.
1.0	When you want to call that certain woman in your life a slut; proflowers, the misogynists choice. Thanks proflowers, with so many choices this coming Easter, thanks for making it a little easier for me by removing yourself as an option.
1.0	I used the Bac-Out on a pair of jeans that smelled like fish oil.  I had tried numerous things to get the odor out, and was told that the Bac-Out would remove the fish oil odor. It did not take out the smell at all,<br />so I was totally disappointed in the product. I would not recommend it.
1.0	WAY OVER priced!!!!<br />Would never order again because of cost<br />Enjoyed item very much will buy in store
1.0	"The FDA made it illegal to sell RAW Almonds in the Fall of 2007.  There are people who believe that the cure for cancer lies in the raw almond, and when the FDA got wind of it, they took them off of the market for 2 cases of food poisoning.  I don't see cantaloupe being outlawed and we had how many deaths recently from food poisoning?)<br />You can google the ruling and the outcome(s).<br />[...]<br /><br />The fact that this company advertises these as \\""RAW\\"" almonds makes me angry.  This is false advertising.  They are steam pasteurized.  See the email below from the company to me, after I emailed them asking if these were truly \\""raw\\"" almonds:<br /><br />------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />customerservice@berginfruitandnut.com<br />Customer Service to me<br />show details 10/20/2011 12:09 PM<br />Kristin,<br /><br />All our raw almonds are steam pasteurized.<br /><br />------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />So, if you're looking for truly \\""raw\\"" almonds, you must look at your local Farmers' Markets, or grow your own."
1.0	This is the worst plush ever. it looks horrible, face would just peal off,arms and legs and head broke off in 1 second  DON'T BUY IT
1.0	This Goji powder, I don't know... I feel like it was super heavily processed or something, and stripped out the life force and nutrition out of the Goji Berries.  I DO like Goji berries.  I think they're a powerful food.  But this powder is just complete garbage.  I noticed absolutely no benefit in taking it.  Not only that, it doesn't even taste like Goji.  It tastes odd, mixes weird, looks weird.<br /><br />I'd steer clear of this supplement.  Your money is better spent elsewhere. Maybe on some actual goji berries.<br /><br />How this review got 5 of 10 helpful votes is beyond me! What do I have to gain by writing a biased review? Some of you people rating these things are bonkers.
1.0	As mentioned in other posts.  This product was recently changed and is nowhere near as good as it used to be.  The new product is sticky and starchy and the spaghetti just clumps together in just one large starchy mass regardless of how it is cooked.  The previous product was excellent individual strands stayed separate and it tasted just fine so much so that I didn't feel that using gluten free dried pasta was any real sacrifice compared to wheat pasta.  My wife dug out an old box and there were clear visible differences between the two (color, opacity and diameter).  I hope they change back.
1.0	It smells bad but far tastes worse. I cannot recommend this product in any way even to my worst enemy.
1.0	The espresso roast is great but it's getting one start because two of packs of coffee were French roast not the espresso!
1.0	Was very disappointed, there was no real cheese flavor. Had to add our own extra sharp cheddar to give it pop. Also, cheese sauce didn't cover the noodles well.
1.0	I love mocha, but not this. The flavor is horrific!  I have a huge box and dread trying to drink it.  Anyone want it?  I think I will leave it by the coffee pot at work.
1.0	No orange essence at all, cannot use for anything other than plain olive oil.  Very disappointed.
1.0	NO GOOD! Picture isn't what I ordered! Anyone who likes these would no the glass jars are better! That's what I thought we bought! Rip off!
1.0	Outrageous price is highway robbery. Get friends to ship you some boxes if you can't find them locally; supermarkets usually carry them for maybe 5 or 6 dollars a box, last time I bought some. Crumbs are no good, but if the cookies are just broken in two or three pieces, you can still use them to make the cake: just position them in the whipped cream as if you were making a mosaic. Once the cake is frozen, it will taste just as good. I promise.
1.0	Grotesque! Yes, the actual capsules worked PERFECTLY in the Nespresso machine but the off-label or let us call it &#34;generic' GOURMESSO coffee inside the GOURMESSO capsules I can only describe, based on my recent experience, as downright grotesque. The coffee was 'old' and 'weak' and tasted as if someone had just left it exposed, out in the open for weeks. Yet, the plastic outside packaging and the capsules were intact. However, the coffee was downright disgusting. I suppose that there is some reason that genuine Nespresso coffees and capsules are still well in business and cost a tad more. My experience with GOURMESSO was much, much less than disappointing.<br /><br />I did try one (1) sample (capsule) from all three (3) packages. Both intensity '9' and '10'. Same. All &#34;bad&#34;.
1.0	Nope. Not worth the dough.
1.0	This coffee tastes like mud when u put it in water :( Too bad I bought a big box! Would try another brand...
1.0	This stuff is a sopping wet mess. Unusable as is. Dry it out and you will have 14.5 oz. of salt, not a pound. Dark tan-gray color that is not appetizing. The real French salt guys will be ashamed that this is labeled as such. Stick with the DAS or Le Paludier products they are the REAL deal.
1.0	Flowers were small and half brown. Totally disappointed. I wished they had sent fresher flowers. Not what I paid for.
1.0	I thought this was an entire 5 boxes for the price, but nope...it was 5 packets. Terrible price for amazon. I called and complained though and got refunded
1.0	The photo shows the 1250 g product, but what arrived was the 250 g product at a price that was higher than that of the 400 g product.  We do not recall seeing the weight info on the order and in fact this item now does not appear when we now do a search using the key words, Pick salami.  Oh well, live and learn...
1.0	horrible.. the chocolate was separate from the crackers.. the crackers were STALE and MUSHY, the chocolate had little to no flavor and was &#34;white-ish&#34; instead of rich and dark like creamy yummy chocolate should be!<br /><br />DO NOT TRY
1.0	Ordered from their site directly. They tasted Terrible.
1.0	Just a warning:  These Cashews came re-packaged in ziplock bags.  No safety seal or anything - just normal ziplocks.  I am not comfortable with that from a retailer, which may be coloring my impression that the nuts smell bad (though a friend smelled them and agreed).<br /><br />The seller will only refund me $1 unless I personally pay shipping to send the ziplock bags of nuts BACK to them, presumably to be resold. They were explicitly concerned about not being able to recoup costs if i did not return the product. They want me to bear the costs of their bad product instead.<br /><br /> Do NOT buy these - who knows how many times they send these nuts through the mail, have them returned, and resell them, with NO way to assure they have not been contaminated.  Very gross.  I plan to throw these away.  Sad.
1.0	This stuff is gross.  I have never tasted a product substitute that is soo far from the real thing.  The texture was gross, the flavor was gross, the smell is gross.  We passed it around work to see the reactions of all our co-workers when they tasted it.  Nobody liked it, it was so funny seeing the reactions when they tasted it.  It is great for a good laugh.  seriously this stuff is bad.
1.0	The whole box of Twinkies from the seller DeValley stunk so badly of like moth balls or something that I was right away worried and unfortunately they tasted badly too. Gross.
1.0	The descriptions says what comes in but definitely didn't get those brands. Got off brand coffee flavors. Only positive thing is I did get a variety. Please heed the warnings and don't buy this product unless you want to be disappointed.
1.0	Did exactly what the directions said and all died. They didn't look healthy when I opened it
1.0	Im very unhappy with this purchase. I am not sure if the product is defective or if it just doesn't work on the first ipad, but I am definitely displeased.
1.0	They didn't attached a phitosanitary permit...so the US agents destroyed it at the US port of entry ..i tried twice and both times they destroyed the seeds
1.0	I gave this &#34;All Natural Soda&#34; a second try and by first impression was correct. This All Natural Ginger Ale tastes awful to me. It has a pretty strong chemical taste and there's nothing natural tasting about it. Plus there's just a mere hint of ginger taste. The truly disappointing part of this product is that it costs twice as much as other sodas. I would rather drink the real deal with sugar and then just spend the 20 minutes on the treadmill to work off the calories rather than drink this medicine tasting potion.
1.0	While they replaced the completely wilted flowers that were originally delivered the bouquet was still short  stemmed and very scant. The blooms were weak and died very quickly just the same.
1.0	These berries have the weirdest taste and after taste. I had to throw them away because no one in my family would eat them... I haven't tried Goji berries from any other brands to compare.
1.0	Terrible after taste with these cookies. I purchased these looking for something nut free for my son who's allergic to nuts.
1.0	My bottle arrived with too cracked off and only half full. Most of the oil was in the bag and all over the bottle. Spent way too much for this!
1.0	Not even close!!!!! Can't be used in cooking and the substitution ratio would make it so expensive as to be prohibitive even for coffee
1.0	This rice is terrible. It smelled like rotten chicken while cooking. I gave it a chance after it was done cooking, but just couldn't eat it. I threw it out even though I had planned on having it for a couple of meals. I hope the Broccoli Cheese is better or I'm going to abandon this brand.
1.0	I tried this product because it sounded good for a diabetic, but it has such a terrible texture and taste, I thew it away.
1.0	BUT the rest of them when opened had mildew in them! GROSS! Will never buy these again..
1.0	"The way this is shipped, the four bags are sealed within the manufacturer's boxed packaging which is sealed in plastic and all of this is packed up in an Amazon box for shipping. My first order had a lot of powder loose that was trapped in the plastic and coating the outside of the manufacturer's box, both of which were sealed and showed no signs of damage or tampering. I opened it up and found that three bags were in good condition but one had a modest puncture that spewed like baby powder at the slightest squeeze. I didn't feel good about consuming anything that had been compromised, even if the outer packaging was intact, so I contacted Amazon to request a partial refund for the one bag I was going to throw away. Amazon went above and beyond what I was asking by sending out a replacement order at no cost. I thought that would more than take care of the issue, but not so much.<br /><br />Upon opening the replacement today, again the outer packaging showed no sign of damage or tampering. However, you could barely make out the box underneath the heavy layer of powder. Three bags had punctures similar to the bag I'd received prior. The fourth bag was not sealed whatsoever. It looks like someone took a knife to it and slit it open just above the \\""cut here\\"" line. It does not appear to be a manufacturing issue. I don't know how to explain a slit like that other than tampering, even if the box and plastic were sealed. I strongly recommend no one consume this unless out of a perfectly sealed package. Unfortunately, odds of receiving one appear to be very slim.<br /><br />Like other reviewers who had similar issues, Amazon gave me a full refund, so I cannot complain. Regardless, I will not be ordering this again."
1.0	Awful tasting k-cups.  I cannot even give them away at work.  Smells old.  Taste bad.  I will never buy again!
1.0	I'm very disappointed with the chalky consistency of this powder. No matter how I make my smoothies, if I put anything more than a tablespoon in (suggested serving size is larger than that), it gets a truly unpleasant consistency. This would be a well-priced protein powder if I actually ever wanted to use it. Instead, it's a waste of money.
1.0	I'm not allergic to anything except milk but this caused me to break out in a horrible rash all over my back, neck, ears, chest and underarms.  I ended up in the ER.  Be very cautious using this product.
1.0	"This \\""hot wings\\"" flavor jerky is like a horror show in your mouth. The texture, while tough and spongy, wasn't even the worst part. The flavoring was bitter and weird. Almost rancid or vomit-like. I can't quite explain it, but I never want to taste it again. My friend and I each tried two pieces and threw away the package. Yuck!"
1.0	I'm sorry, but this product was not what I expected, and it does not smell like the fresh catnip at all.<br /><br />I will not buy it again.
1.0	I'm a huge fan of Kuerig and the K-Cups, however all of the Hot Chocolate varieties from all of the vendors are over priced and sub-par.  There is no filter and no real brewing that occurs in these products.  A hole is punched in the top and bottom of the K-Cup and hot water is run through the instant hot chocolate mix.  You can see what I mean by removing the foil of one of the sample k-cups provided.    Since the cocoa mix sits on the bottom of the flat k-Cup, all of the instant cocoa is not dispensed into your cup.    Save your money and buy packets of hot chocolate and run a water cycle trough the Kuerig to add the hot water (much faster than the microwave).  You are doing essentially doing the same...the only difference is that the hot water comes into contact with the cocoa in the K-Cup instead of in the bottom of your mug.    Hope this helps.
1.0	Very disappointed! Bought this for a candy buffet with navy blue and white theme. Not only where they not dark blue as featured in the picture, but they were  not just white, but shades of light blue in the swirl. Paid money for shipping too.  Same thing for the swirl sticks.
1.0	I was disappointed that these were like little tea bags filled with coffee.  I tried throwing them in my drip coffee maker in place of a traditional filter and coffee grinds, but the hot water flowed around the bag and so I ended up with hot water with a hint of mocha and that was not the least bit appetizing.  I don't know what one is suppose to do with these things.  I've been tearing them open and just using the grinds, which makes a decent cup of coffee.  But what a waste with all of the useless packaging!
1.0	Several years ago, we got these patties at Halloween time. We tried them, only to discover that they had no taste at all and were incredibly chewy, so much so that you would have to be Andre the Giant (RIP) to masticate them. Anyway, we decided that they might be stale. Throughout the past years, we have always tried the patties when received at Halloween time, as Valentine's Day treats, etc., wondering how a cute concoction such as this can be so weirdly terrible. Yes, it is true- they are not stale, just inedible, which is a shame for a product that is supposed to indeed be edible. Your teeth and taste buds will thank you for not purchasing these patties.
1.0	Every one of them, was broken an unusable.
1.0	Received this item October 15, 2013 and was looking forward to sampling a childhood favorite. What I received was a variety pack of almost sell by date products. Potato chips sell by date was October 28, 2013, cheese doodles sell by date November 4, 2013. I think you get the picture and I will not purchase any other product from this vendor.
1.0	I remember ordering these cakes years ago and was so happy to find them on Amazon.  They were the best as I remember, don't know what happened this order was not up to par, had an off taste, inedible, I  threw them out.
1.0	My office of 4 women tried this coffee. Every single one of us thought it was disgusting. Some of us checked to see if the beans had mold on them because it tasted SO bad.  And the SMELL! We didn't notice it when we were making the coffee but if you take a little sniff from the bag, it almost makes you want to vomit. A couple of us decided that it smelled like a filthy behind/tush.  I seriously can't believe that any business, let alone Starbucks, would sell this!!! FOR GOODNESS SAKES DON'T BUY THIS! It's HORRIBLE.
1.0	Love this flavor, but PepsiCo has taken it off the market where I live.  I realize it is heavy to ship, but I paid over$5 a bottle.  That sucks
1.0	This isn't even vegetarian never mind vegan.  Fruit jells are made with gelatin.  Yuck.  Please read label before you purchase.
1.0	Many WF products are great like their thousand island dressing but no one could stand the flavor of this.  Choose anything but this.
1.0	The box arrive all torn. Shipment a little slow. I have to throw away the whole thing due to the box destroy and the hondashi not safe to consume.
1.0	Vita Coco Coconut Water tastes really bad.  I purchased it after reading reviews on line, which shows more than half of all reviews positive.  The taste bares a strong resemblance to that chemical liquid you must consume in preparation for a colonoscopy.  It's not sweet, (despite the 15 gram load of sugar in it) and it's not bitter, just foul tasting.
1.0	Extremely sweet, barely any chestnut taste!.....not worth the money!
1.0	i am not a big fan of life cereal especially cinnamon life cereal. I mean cmon this cereal is just plain old gross. I wish I could recommend it, but doing so would simply be cruel.
1.0	What a joke!  I should have read the other comment before I bought these tiny little minuscule bottle wannabes.  Total rip off for $17.  Save your money and buy something else!
1.0	I have not been this incensed in a long time about a product's misrepresentation.  The primary advantage of a Keurig is not that it heats water, which can be used to make tea, hot chocolate, etc., it is that it can make real, BREWED coffee by the cup.  This product advertises itself as dark brew coffee, at an attractive price.  It is instant coffee and should be labeled as such!
1.0	these took forever to get here, I paid horribly high postage for these that weigh next to nothing and the bags were EXPIRED when they arrived!  Not happy with this purchase at all.
1.0	Does not even come close to the taste of real egg nog. I love, love, love, love....,did I mention that love egg nog. This stuff does not fit the bill. It is very watery, lacks the cinnamon spice flavor of real eggnog, and drop kicks your taste buds with a what the hell is this  flavor. I recommend that you skip this product and buy the refrigerated stuff in the store. If for some reason you are faced with the choice of buying this product and nothing else, do yourself a favor - go online, grab an egg nog recipe, and make it yourself. You will be better off.
1.0	Put in order for 10LB. Of red hots thinking they would be the 1/4 in . Size. Well I Was Wrong Big Difference, And Don't Find Out Till To Late.
1.0	I paid $10 for 50 pieces ($0.20 each). I bought the same product $5 for 40 pieces (0.125 each) at  my local store.
1.0	Just received the Melinas peppercorn blend.  Have not used it yet, but visually I am very disappointed. It is mostly black and white peppercorn, very little pink or green.  Will not buy it again.
1.0	There were two different labels on these kcups. Only one style would work in my machine even though they looked the same physically. Won't be buying again as half wouldn't work.
1.0	Sour lifeless taste. Have used other Douwe Egbert blends and found them decent enough; this was described as suitable for all makers, but it was far too coarse a grind for an espresso machine, so unusable this way; in a French press it was better, but not pleasant, so disposed of. I will stick to Lavazza decaf for those times when I want coffee without the buzz.
1.0	This tortellini is dry and grainy and comes in small boxes. I couldn't eat it... the flavor was very strong, but not very good. I ended up donating all 11 remaining boxes.
1.0	its not worked for me. so cheap material.<br />it only worked for like 5 minutes than no more. i got ipad2 for reference
1.0	This pack of 16 cost me a fortune; however, in making the decision to send it back (I had to pay the postage) and was not reimbursed for any of the postage. I did not read it correctly. I like Diet Caffeine Free Pepsi, but the bigger bottles are impossible to find in Tucson, AZ
1.0	These taste very different and were almost dried out. Will not buy again.
1.0	"I'll begin by saying I've only tried the Cranberry, that was entirely enough for me!  I usually won't buy something listed as \\""organic\\"" without nutrition information listed. (They may have added it, it wasn't here at the time of my purchase or review.) I'll list what was on the wrapper after my review. I was disgusted by these bars.<br /><br />I had to \\""peel\\"" the small things out of the wrapper as they are so gooey and goopy that my fingers were covered with honey. Waaaayy too sweet and it tasted ONLY like honey and peanuts, you couldn't taste ANY fruit at ALL. Very small, not satisfying, not a great taste and the texture and sickly-sweetness made me immediately hand the bar to someone else after the first bite as I couldn't take it. Also mine expire in AUGUST of '09. I bet I won't finish the box before August of 2010. I don't recommend at all.<br /><br />Ingredients: Peanuts, honey, flax seed, raisins, dried apricots, dried cranberries, (apple juice concentrate infused cranberries, sunflower oil).

1.0	item is good buy amazon is going crazy.<br />i was buying this item for $10.10 in subscribe and save, and then boom in few days they raise price to $15.25 in subscribe and save.<br />this is more that 50% raise in price.<br />i have not seen any retailer to do things like that.
1.0	I wouldn't recommend these. Kind of chewy. I have learned that the gluten free foods made from rice are the best. Not sure what these were made from but I've had better. I get a different brand from the local health food store.
1.0	I didn't realize I paid this much for only 3 boxes of cereal.<br />I could have gone to walmart and got them for 6.00.  Teaches me to pay closer attention to what I am buying.<br />COMPLETE rip off!
1.0	This was the first time using the Fondarific brand and I wasn't impressed. I'm a cake professional and I'm very proficient in covering cakes with a smooth finish on the first try. It took me four times before I could get my cake covered with Fondarific. I had tearing and elephant skin problems which I never have when using other brands. I will not be purchasing this product again due to the lack of performance.
1.0	What a rip off instant coffee in a k cup someone made a lot of money  Do not buy cheaper to get a jar of instant from the store
1.0	This a good product, but this one is one bottle at 3 times the price you can buy it anywere else...
1.0	"Do not know what everyone is raving about concerning these almonds but the ones I received today and just returned back were horrible. They arrived cracked chipped and totally broken. I tasted two of them and not only were they tasteless but they left a metallic after taste. Being born in Italy and having tasted many Jordan Almonds--these were not authentic. The real Jordan Almonds are truly sweet, with a sugary coating and they just melt in your mouth. These also smelled \\""plasticky\\"" when they are supposed to have a hint of vanilla in the smell--which is heavenly. I rarely write reviews but I just had to with these almonds. So you may save $2-or-$4--the extra cost is worth it to get truly delicious and authentic Jordan Almonds. I gave this product Zero stars but it would not let me so that is why you see one star."
1.0	Oh my GOD!  Do not buy this crap, you will be kicking yourself.  I love jerky, but this was like eating dry tasteless meat in a WAY overly flavored (but not well flavored) sauce.  It-was-nasty.  I had to take the jerky and wash it to try and make it edible because I hate to waste food, especially if it came at the sacrifice of an animal.  Even then it was bad, but more tolerable.  I love to cook, eat out, and rarely come across anything that I can't eat or at least respect what the creator was going for.  But, I had to throw half this away - my raccoon-like stomach couldn't take any more abuse.  This isn't Krave, it's krap.
1.0	My family used this product for over 4 years, but last year the recipe was changed, sugar was added. That decision was probably driven by Cascadian Farm's desire to increase profits (cheaper production, more appealing to mainstream sugar junkies). Unfortunately, there aren't many choices right now for nutrition-conscious individuals. Even the so called organic/health cereals are loaded with sweets (all sorts of syrups, juice concentrates). Starting a morning on that note sets you up for a roller-coaster ride of high-low blood sugar. I had nothing else to do but to start cooking whole grain cereals (oatmeal, millet, buckwheat). It takes a bit of planning - you have to allocate time for cooking in the morning or cook the nigh before, but in the process you can save a ton of money. For instance, a pound of organic millet costs from $0.99 to $1.79 depending on the retailer (or $0.06 to $0.11 per oz). In the process of cooking grain absorbs water and increases it mass at least 3 fold. That makes the price of cooked cereal go down as much ($0.02 to $0.04).  Compare that to $0.48/oz price for Purely'Os! Then maybe the recipe change introduced by Cascadian Farms is truly a blessing for your wallet, if you are willing to wait 20 minutes, while you cereal is boiling on the stove. This time is not lost, but gained - you can use it to practice sun salutation to make your morning even more glorious!
1.0	I did not use this mix as just the vanilla cake, but I used it to make the coconut cake recipe that is on the Pamela'e website. We love the chocolate cake mix but this one is not as great. The cupcakes that we made turned out bad and as my brother in law said, it was like eating saw dust. The texture was horrible and we probably will not buy this mix again.
1.0	Not work :(<br />I don't want to say more because it not work what they say :( :(<br />I am not recommend to buy this , so....
1.0	well,i thought it would taste good considering the description. sorry, it is just a yukky product and i threw it away after preparing according to directions.  the sad part is that i bought 2; waste of money yall.  does anyone actually TRY products before selling to us unsuspecting consumers?  good grief.
1.0	This is horrible!  The pancakes did not turn golden, but stayed totally white. Also, the mix does not totally mix in the bottle even after much shaking. I've made gluten free Bisquick pancakes and they were much better.
1.0	This was horrible fish.  I bought two, opened one and sent both back.  The salmon tasted like tuna fish exactly.  I can buy tuna in the can 3 for a dollar.  I expected high quality Salmon and this is not it.   I don't recommend it to anyone.
1.0	I was disappointed in these K-cups.  Maybe I expected too much, but I did not like the taste of these.
1.0	No tea flavor at all.  Tastes like watered down lemonade.  I drink a lot of tea and this stuff is so bad that I am returning the opened box for a refund.
1.0	The description says it is a 1 pound marbled chocolate turkey.  What I received was a 4 ounce marbled chocolate turkey.    I'm sure it is tasty and it is beautifully made but I spent $27 for this?  I want my money back.
1.0	"I wish I can give 0 stars!!!! I saw this product and that it was \\""all natural\\"" and \\""low fat\\"", so I decided to give it a try. I have an 8year old Maltese/Poodle mix. Not even 10 minutes go by and my baby is foaming at the mouth and gasping for air! She was rushed to the animal hospital nearby, had to be sedated and hooked up to I.v's and had to get a tube down her throat to get part of the bone pushed down to her stomach. After the doctor started worrying about her throat that the bone had done damage to her trachea. Again, she had to be sedated to get examined and an x-Ray. A long day and $700 later we are home, she pukes bile every 5minutes and won't eat. She better be okay! DO NOT BUY!!!!!!"
1.0	SERIOUSLY PEOPLE ???    $7.00 S&H on a $3.00 product ?????    250% of the product price for SHIPPING ????    I have had heavy text books delivered for WAY less
1.0	Yuck. Smells amazing, brews like coffee tea. Poor Showing gents!
1.0	What I received had 49 carbs!!!! returning today. this is crazy!! do not order if you have medical restrictions. false advertising
1.0	I purchased the 24 pack of monster for $45. A week later the price dropped to $29. I am about done with amazon for this very reason. The packaging was also ripped when I received it which makes me think some of the drinks were dropped especially considering that some of the cans had dents. I'm not sure if the drinks went flat or not because I haven't drank any of them yet because I'm debating returning them. I am not happy at all paying so much for something that looked used.
1.0	i bought these thinking they might be comparable in some ways with the regular cookie.<br />unfortunately there is about 70% too much tasteless wafer for the amount of peanut creme inside.<br />you could easily choke on these if you are not careful.<br />the long strip is kind of a turnoff as well.<br />not good
1.0	They arrived reeking of mildew!  Seriously - the moment I opened the front door to retrieve the package I was hit by the almost overpowering smell of mold.  I ended up taking it right out on the back patio to open, couldn't have it in the house.  The outer box was smashed, clearly heavily water damaged, and smelled as if someone had tried to compensate for the mold smell by subsequently dousing it in some kind of cleaning fluid. The actual product box & wrapping was also reeking of mold & cleaning fluid.  Also... the product was already nearing its expiration date!  Unsafe to eat, had to throw them all away.  A disappointment, but it's not worth mailing it overseas for a refund.  Bought these from &#34;British Grocery&#34;.
1.0	To me, it tastes too artificial and nothing exceptional to make me buy more. I will probably take it to office.
1.0	Fyi ..... Does not fit in the Keurig 2.0 , this needs to be in the description!
1.0	I have been using curry powder for years. I used this twice, and got sick twice. Never again will I buy this product.
1.0	I should have listened to the other reviewer who said s/he received a dead plant. I learned the hard way. I took the plant out of the box (which seems an ineffective way to ship a plant) and all the leaves and buds promptly fell off. I thought I might be able to revive it but to no avail. I tried repeatedly logging on to 9GreenBox's website. This was again to no avail. I wrote to 9GreenBox asking for my money back or a new plant and never heard a thing. Lousy customer service + dead plant = never again.
1.0	I bought these for my daughter because she loves pickles.  She only ate half and threw it away.  I tried one and could only make it half way before I tossed it.  Yuck!  The tossed the whole box. Waist of money!
1.0	Ok, they get the star for taste as the taste is delish. However the shipping was beyond slow and they majorly screwed up my order. Due to allergies I can only eat 2 of the quesos, ultimate and voodoo. I ordered a 4 pack of the ultimate and a 4 pack of the voodoo. I ordered it on March 12, paid a hefty shipping charge to get it in 3-5 business days as they advertised and it arrived here today march 26. I received a total of 4 voodoo, 2 ultimate and 1 fire roasted which I cant eat. So I just got shafted on the order and the shipping. I will try to contact them but from what I have seen, and this was my first order with them, their service is lacking.
1.0	Arrived just before Christmas -  The pieces were so badly broken, we could only put together a &#34;shed&#34; with foundation problems, i.e., cracked walls, etc.  Unless you're out in the boondocks and can't get a kit any other way but mail delivery, just buy one at groceries or Target/Walmart store next year!
1.0	I thought this would be a good deal but I didn't expect to find fish skeletons inside. I opened the first can and was so disgusted that I donated the rest of the cans. I ended up wasting money instead of saving it.
1.0	Very stale sour chews.  You need to keep an eye on the expiration.  Candy is just like food...it gets stale.
1.0	The candy was not consumed and immediately tossed in the trash, everything had melted.  The box was picked up immediately upon arrival, but the contents were melted.
1.0	Oh my gosh these things are gross. Weird flavors overall. It's like they changed them. Don't try them - stick to the original ones.
1.0	This is a good brand of sugar. But my problem was with the packaging and shipping. I ordered two bags of this sugar and a few other things. When I received the box, I opened it and first thing I saw was one entire bag of sugar opened and spilled all over the entire box. I like this sugar more than any other but will not be wasting my money with this seller any more. The cost of this bag is also outrageous compared to being bought and any store. I paid almost $12 a bag and only received one usable bag. Not worth it. I can get this same exact bag at Wal-mart for $6 and some change or at Sam's club for $4 and change.<br />I just contacted Amazon and they gave me a full refund. Thank you Amazon for taking care of your customers.
1.0	I ordered edible ink and they sent regular ink like I wasn't going to notice.  Thanks for damn near poisoning my customers!
1.0	This tasted like bubble gum.  I did not taste strawberry or Lemon of any kind.  I disliked it.  If I had purchased locally I would have returned it.
1.0	Bewley's Dublin Morning Tea has to be the worse tea I've ever tasted. The flavor is weak. I was most disappointed.
1.0	This came in a brown box, tea jumbled together, all of the cups marked &#34;not for individual sale,&#34; and the tea was stale.
1.0	I am writing  review for my Mother. For health reasons she prefers Cafix to coffee. Totally satisfied.
1.0	I gave the coffee one star just out of pity.  I made it double strength and it looked like weak tea.  The price of my  favorite coffe went up so I thought I'd try Yuban.  Amazon, I'd like to send this shipment back to you please.  Thank you,  E.W.
1.0	It's not pure it has fillers and additives
1.0	Just like others have said, the description states quantity of 48, but you will only receive 24.  This is a big rip off.  I will not order k-cups from Amazon anymore.  Buyer beware!
1.0	This is NOT the Nestle's milk chocolate I had as a teenager growing up in the 70's, which started my lifelong love affair with milk chocolate!  Nestle's changed and cheapened their formula!  What once was a creamy, rich, delectable, world class milk chocolate is now a cheap tasting mess.  Thank God Boyer hasn't changed their 'Mallo Cup' formula (one of my other fave candy bars).
1.0	Totally disgusting, nothing like CHAI tea, its taste is more like cheap old black tea. Don't waste your money on ordering this tea. Just feel totally duped, can't return it!
1.0	"I love almost all Tabasco products and living in Louisiana, I can buy them local.  However, this specialty hot sauce was not done right.  Unfortunately, the first ingredient of this stuff is high-fructose corn syrup.  Notwithstanding taste, it pours thicker than any sauce I've ever seen that it looks \\""gummy\\"" almost.  For a Louisiana company, you'd think they would support their local sugar farmers and at least use a sugar syrup instead.  I'd stay away from any product with high-fructose corn syrup, and this is one of them."
1.0	This could not have been authentic... the taste was horrible and much different than what I usually order from my local supplier (who was out of this flavor). It tasted nothing like the Café Supreme I normally get.
1.0	I didn't like the flavor of this tea at all! I'm a real tea drinker and enjoy various teas everyday. I don't care much for the Bigelow brand.
1.0	This product is all filler with no thriller. Seriously you could eat this with a spoon and you would barely notice a fait hint of blueberry. Actually more like the faint hint of the synthetic berry flavor some children's cough syrup might have. Since the labelling is basically non-existent I have no idea what all the white poder is in the bottle. After consuming a few servings I just hope it is not toxic. Eitherway don't waste your money this stuff, how this company can get away with advertising this as blueberry flavor is beyond me. If you took a single unripe blueberry and crushed it into a few pounds of rice flower you would probably get a more convincing and stronger flavor out of that, than out of this product.
1.0	Well, I should have known better. You get what you pay for.
1.0	The noodles were tiny and never reached the full size and they were still crunchy after following the directions to the letter.
1.0	As far as the product goes, it's great. But like many jack links product reviews from Amazon I've seen, they contain mold in a lot of them. It's really just a risk you take whether you get mold or not. Not worth it!<br /><br />You're better off buying it only if you can see the product before purchase to inspect for mold!
1.0	I contacted the company and had a hard time reaching them by phone. I tried ordering online only to be told that they do not ship to canada. I phoned again and was told they do, they asked for my visa number to to email the address and name. I did and was told they once again do not ship to canada but intially wanted me to pay 50 dollars for shippin??? the operators were very hard to understand on the phone as they did not speak english very well, over all I was not pleased with this company or service and do not recomment it, sorry. No product was sent to me.
1.0	"\\""did you know this coffee is actually eaten and excreted by animals? Most people would never imagine that such a product exists, but it does--and Amazon.com is selling it! To make kopi luwak coffee, Asian palm civets (* comment mine- imagine small chipmucks/squirrel-like critters..you know Chip n Dale) are snatched from their homes in the wild and imprisoned alone in tiny, barren cages. They're deprived of everything that is natural and important to them including excercise, food and freedom.\\""  this quote is from the PETA website. (people for the ethical treatment of animals) [...]"
1.0	the title says it all these must be YEARS old. They are totally unedible and moldy. Nothing else to say.
1.0	I hate to disagree with most of the other reviews, but this tea tastes flat, bland and a bit bitter.  I've searched for a decent decaf tea and finely found three, two here on Amazon, and for less money than the Taylors.  Bigelow Organic Breakfast Blend is the best.  It has a rich, deep, aromatic flavor and goes well with a bit of sugar and milk or just plain.  Higgins and Burke decaffinated Orange Pekoe is lighter in flavor than the Bigelow, but still offers deep amber richness.  The third isn't sold on Amazon, but hopefully they'll add it as they carry the Peet's brand coffee.  Peet's decaffinated English Breakfast loose tea is decent, too.<br />I use the Bigelow for single cup enjoyment and the Higgins and Burke for making ice tea.
1.0	Tastes good. Tough kernels.
1.0	I've bought pistachios from 2 other companies threw Amazon and was very happy so I decided to try this company and was shocked and dismayed that their pistachios were horrible, not even palatable.  These pistachios were hard, flavorless, and stale, I couldn't imagine how terrible tasting a pistachio came be.  I will never buy this product again!
1.0	Flowers do not arrive in bud form as described; they are already bloomed. Plus 4 out of the 5 were brown and starting to wilt. Poor quality; would not order again.
1.0	I tried this same beignet mix that I had received as a gift from a relative that resides in Metairie. Delicious! So I wanted to give this to my niece for her to have in her home. She had cooked my box at my home and loved it. So imagine my surprise when she told me her mixture did not rise, tasted funny and her box was dated 2013. Really! Who checks this stuff? How could this happen? I don't ever again want to receive food products from a company emptying out their warehouse. By the way, this purchase through Amazon was recent (2015). So for that, this product and company who sent it gets one star. My sister just returned from New Orleans and gave me two fresh boxes; I guess you need to take a trip to get what you want.
1.0	Better there are other sugar free options that taste A LOT better.
1.0	Purchased these for Mother's Day the week before, figured they might arrive a day late or so with the extra holiday traffic.  Flowers didn't arrive until 10 days after the longest of the standard shipping date time window and then wilted after just a couple days.  I e-mailed to discuss my unhappiness with the order to which they promptly replied they'd send another out no charge, I found that suitable and figured I'd give them another shot.  I still have yet to see those, now promised over a month ago, so I'm not holding my breath.
1.0	My wife and I found these candies at a German Deli. I only purchased one box there thinking I could purchase as many as I want on Amazon.<br />Upon receiving the candy, they had leaked the contents and we're sticky in the box . Also the taste was nothing like the ones I purchased in the German Deli. So sorry, I can't recommended them..
1.0	I purchased MaraNatha Coconut Butter, got halfway through the jar and found a latex glove fingertip embedded in the butter.  Yuck.  I have written to the manufacturer, but received no response other than that they received my email.  I have concerns about the quality of the manufacturing process.  Will not purchase from this MaraNatha again.
1.0	Read the ingredients they are chemical sewage with Yellow 5, Red 40, Blue 1  Absolute fake garbage nothing natural about it!!!  Nasty!!!  Glad I read the ingredients!
1.0	OK this was rediculous!!! I got this Belgian truffles and some Frensh ones also. The french truffles were ok and Delisiouse. I finaly get to these ones and to my supprise, IT IS A SOLID BRICK!! This sucker has been melted, at the distriputers place. I had these things in my bedroom on the floor and there is no way it could have melted in my posestion. B/c it is in a box I had no way of knowing what was up inside. I contacted the dealer and told him what was going on and That was over 7 months ago. Im a little ticked off that I have waisted so much money and got ripped off. Ill have to see .
1.0	The last order I received I was not happy with the bars.  They tasted very old and not fresh at all!
1.0	"I ordered this item and received the \\""grains\\"" today.  I was shocked that's what was in the package because they arrived regular mail in a padded envelope (I expected a jar).<br /><br />I opened the envelope and expected to see two professionally sealed pouches.<br /><br />Nope.<br /><br />What was inside?  Two cheap ziploc baggies full of mush.  That's not what was pictured in the listing.<br /><br />Secondly, regular ziploc baggies? SERIOUSLY?  Would YOU ingest something that came in the mail via plastic bag having no idea of truly what's in there or the possible level of contamination?<br /><br />How can this stuff be sold this way? Is there no quality control?<br /><br />I'd upload a photo of what I received here but I don't think Amazon allows links within reviews. If not, I'll upload to \\""user images.\\""  I'll first contact the company to give them the opportunity to offer a refund first.<br /><br />UPDATE:  I uploaded a pic on the main photos section.  The representative from the company was very gracious (although taken aback at my displeasure over what I received). Excellent cusotmer service and resolution despite a bad experience otherwise.  I ended up ordering kefir (factory sealed) from another company based on their YouTube videos and web site."
1.0	Taste bad, maybe stale.
1.0	NEEDED SUGAR FREE LOUSY SUGGESTION TO POUT IT OFF
1.0	"Don't waste your money purchasing this item.  I was very disappointed to get them in today and find out I could have done the exact same thing (with a cuter font) on my home computer.  Most of the type wasn't even centered on the label. So save yourself the money and the shipping(!) and just print out some cute labels at home - I may even do that myself because I am not happy with what I received.  **So as an update - the owner of the company contacted me right away and offered to replace the labels.  After reading other reviews for their products, this company is very concerned with making things right for its customers.  I still would not recommend purchasing this particular item, but I do appreciate the great customer service and I wanted to give them credit for that in my review.  The contents of the email I received are below:  \\""I am sorry you received labels that were not up to our standards.  We have had a batch of labels that were not lined up correctly and I apologize that you got one of them.  As far as the font, we have not changed anything on the form for over 2 years, when the photo was taken (basic Veranda font).  Can I send you a replacement sheet and a few blank ones for you to try to print your own?  Thanks,  David Leach  Chef / Owner, SpiceCubed\\"""
1.0	Very, very expensive!
1.0	I bought a bag of these to give to my kids at Easter, but when I tasted them I had to go out and buy some Jelly Belly's. Literally every flavor was just awful, I mean awful. Each one I tried was stranger and more disgusting tasting than the last. I have no idea what flavor any of them were supposed to be. This is not a joke review, they were really that bad. I threw the entire bag in the garbage. Avoid these things at all cost.
1.0	I got these a week ago and put them in my pantry (approx. 60 - 65 degrees, dry conditions).  I've opened at least one every day since.<br /><br />Of the twelve, three had grayish-green mold (typical bread mold) and the last three I just threw out unopened.<br /><br />These weren't old...had a good expiration date...stored (by me) appropriately.<br /><br />It goes without saying that I won't be buying any more Glenny's brownies.
1.0	Not what I expected!! Don't like it at all.
1.0	Not all K-cup packets had the Keurig seal and are therefore not usable in the Keurig 2.0
1.0	This is the most disappointing product I have ever ordered. The experience was like chewing a rubber band. They have no flavor and are not palatable.
1.0	Was very hopeful, but tasted like eating chalk-covered sugar cookie. Way sweet, not flavorful, and too crumbly.  Not good at all.
1.0	The product was stale; peanuts had a rancid taste.  They arrived quickly, but they were so far from fresh that we ended up throwing most of them away.
1.0	The bag I got was stale, bad quality.
1.0	While I am well aware that Cadbury does make some excellent products, the Curly Wurly's are not one of them. These candy bars are NOTHING like the original Marathon Bar's from the 1970's, except in appearance. The chocolate coating is much to thin on the Curly Wurly's compared to the original Marathon Bar's and the caramel has a distinct buttery taste which the Marathon Bar did not. The Curly Wurly's  are ok if your just looking for a chocolate candy bar with a different taste, but I personally will not ever buy them again.
1.0	I ordered what was supposed to be the best brownie I ever tasted. What I got was a very expensive container full of grease! :( Think I paid something like 15 bucks to ship one tiny very melted brownie.
1.0	I spent alot of money to order this product and it is hard as a rock and stale.<br />What a dissapointment this was
1.0	I was sent an expired package. After trying to send it back online and being told it was not eligible for return,I called Amazon. They were very helpful and credited me the money back. It did take my time and extra effort as it was able to be corrected online.
1.0	The store was out of Nutella so I tried this one.  My kids spit it out and I couldn't eat it. More expensive for lower quality. Blech!<br /><br />It has a gritty heavy texture, not very smooth. It also has a weird flavor. I can't describe the weirdness of the flavor, it's just not good. It has less sugar than Nutella, but not that much less for what you sacrifice in taste. Nut butter with chocolate is going to be a treat food anyways, so you might as well get one that tastes good. I had to return this because nobody in my house would eat it. We are healthy eaters. We eat lots of live raw foods and my kids drink green juice and smoothies with a lot of green in them, so it's not like we are people who live on McDonald's and our taste buds are ruined from eating garbage. This product just didn't hit the mark for me. I don't plan on buying anymore of this company's overpriced and underflavored food.
1.0	I love chips...and have been noshing on the regular Popchips for months now...love most of the flavors. So when I saw the multigrain, I thought, why not?  UGH...it wasn't crispy and the taste was bland and dull. I am so disheartened to have 23 bags left, that I don't know if I will continue my regular subscription.  Do not get these unless you want chips that would be better served as packing material
1.0	I did not like this stuff.  It doesn't taste like chimichurri at all.  It almost tastes like a horrible olive tapenade.  I wound up scraping it off my steak.  Will never buy again.
1.0	very nasty tasting.....taste and smells like fish....totally gross....hated it and will never buy it again....just gross and horrible..and will let everyone know
1.0	I had been reading about Gulyian chocolates online for a long time and was dying to try them, i finally took the plunge and was sorely disappointed when I tasted them.  I would rather have a gas station candy bar.
1.0	I used this product in my coffee and absolutely hated it. Not only was it TOO sweet (and I like sweet), it tasted chemical-y and when I got to the bottom of the cup, there was a bunch of sludge from the undissolved product! I thought maybe it was a one time deal, so tried it again and received the same results. They break apart into crystals, but do not dissolve like sweetener packets do. I gave a tin to some friends to try and they had the same issue. I actually had to throw them away and I HATE wasting anything.
1.0	I didn't think to look at the ingredients first... shame on me. It's apple juice with some blueberry puree thrown in.  If you're taking this as a cancer preventative, then you're wasting your money.<br /><br />On the bright side, it tastes really good.  Buy it only for the flavor, not for the health benefits.
1.0	For the price, I was expecting a lot more. For $39.99 it was not worth it, the capsule held about $5 worth of merchandise. Highly disappointed and embarrassed to have given this as a gift.
1.0	King Arthur is a brand name that I trust and it normally produces excellent baked goods (e.g., bread and biscuits). With that in mind, I purchased this mix with the hopes of making soy free brownies. The brownies were dry and hard. Since baking is an art rather than pure science, I tried a second box. Unfortunately, the same hard and dry results.
1.0	I ate two pieces of it and threw out the entire box. The taste is well -it tastes sorta like cheap bird food smells. The texture is ok but the aroma and flavor are very off putting.  Its like chalk, asparagus, tomatoes and apples tried to cross-pollinate.
1.0	NO!!!! they were not the original tim tam's!!  some type of knock-off!
1.0	THIS IS NOT GLUTEN/WHEAT FREE!!!!! BEWARE!!!! It is very good, but advertised as gluten free when it has wheat on the ingredient list.  Whoever advertised this as gluten free is careless and cannot realize how dangerous this can be to people.
1.0	I recently bought scharffen berger chocolate from the store near my house.  It tasted yummy.  However when I was sampling it, I almost broke my tooth.  There was a metal button in with the chocolate.  It was hard to get hold of them to tell them of my problem.  If you find something they want to get it away from you fast and give you a small amount of money.  I didnt like how they handled it.  Customer service is really unsatisfying so dont bother.  JUST BE CAREFUL
1.0	Got them late so I had no use for them so I guess I will just pass out on Halloween
1.0	This was a disappointment, advertised as pomegranate molasses but was actually pomegranate sauce and more expensive than available elsewhere.
1.0	When I called to ask about this product, the representative at their toll free number said it was made with GMO free ingredients, however, rice products are very often made with GMO rice. So when we noticed there is no mention of being GMO free on the actual package, this is a common false advertising method. The package should say it if it is true. My 13 yr old son and I had a bowl of this brand of Ziti pasta last night and within a few hours we both had terrible stomach aches that lasted into the morning. Watch out, this pasta must be made with genetically modified rice, with cancer causing glyphosate in it. When I called their toll free number I got a recording. I have never had such a stomach ache from anything I have eaten, I have always had a &#34;cast iron stomach&#34;, but I have been eating almost entirely organic and gluten free diet for years now, so I am more sensitive to the glyphosate poison apparently.
1.0	I ordered this gift basket for my father-in-law's 60th birthday.  He is a golf lover and loves snacks and such like the ones in this box.  However, when it arrived I was pretty disappointed in the size.  Granted it does give you the dimensions of the box, but it is still much smaller than what I had hoped.  It will still be a good gift for him, but I am definitely disappointed with how much I paid for it compared to the size.  I wouldn't pay more than about $25 for this basket if I were you.
1.0	Saw this on the shelf at the gas station and figured I would give it a try..what a mistake
1.0	The description says 12 bags but was it actually is is only one bag. I feel that it is falsely advertised and a huge rip off!!!! Even at the movies it would cost half that price!!!!!
1.0	The noodles are clear looking and have a 'gummy strange' feeling in your mouth and so I didn't like it.     IF you purchase these noodles know this:    There is a 10 day return from purchase date and  and a restocking fee of 15% restocking fee.    I will NEVER buy from them again.
1.0	not as low carb as i thought it would be, did not work in a bread machine
1.0	Read the ingredients - Water + HIGH FRUCTOSE CORN SYRUP... TERRIBLE... Yes it's cheap, but it's just water and high fructose corn chemicals...  Only reason it's cheap is because powerade doesn't even put this crap in their drinks anymore.
1.0	Buyer Beware - NOT AS ADVERTISED!!!!!  Product description specifically stated &#34;Solid&#34; deodorant and not &#34;Spray&#34;.  Photo showed a stick and not a spray can.  It would be more trouble than worth to return it but beware, I did NOT get what I ordered!  Not a happy customer.  Decent price, if you wanted spray, which I did not.
1.0	The product had the candy coating all chipped off. It looks like the candy was heated and then cooled. It's winter so the candy wont melt, but It doesn't look edible.
1.0	I thought this was THEE product for me, I love my coffee hot and it cools off too quickly in my travel mug.  I don't think the joulies made any difference and they were very expensive.
1.0	Are you frigging kidding me?!?!?! $15 plus $8 shipping!?!?!  I absolutely love this bread and would rate it 5 1/2 stars every day of the week... But, at $23 for 2 loaves the price is insane.  I buy this exact same 2 pack of bread for under $6 every day of the week at BJs, or spend $3.29 at the local grocery store.  Get off your butt and run to the store, you'll save a pile of money!  The few exceptions I can think of to this review are perhaps if you live in Antarctica, remote areas of Alaska, and perhaps some unpopulated islands in the Pacific Ocean.
1.0	Can't comment on the quality of oil, simply because the way the bottle is designed, it's not possible to open it. The cap just keeps spinning. tried everything including pliers to get that thing off but it's a problem with the design of the bottle top. This item needs to be be pulled from the shelves before someone gets hurt trying to open the damned thing.
1.0	I only received one bottle and description stated I should get a pack of two. I wish i would have gotten what was described in the description.
1.0	although admittedly rich, it wasn't bold enough and was far too bitter to get my vote.
1.0	This was absolutely horrible. It was a bunch of cider, decaf, cocoa, lemonade, gross instant flavored coffees, and teas. There were only about 10 unflavored coffees in the whole order and it was disgusting coffee by some cheap brand I have never even heard of before. I would have been better off putting my money straight down the garbage disposal. This was a total waste of money. You do not get any green mountain or rev or any known brands of coffee as shown in the product picture. It comes in a crumpled brown paper bag which I should have immediately thrown in a dumpster. This is the absolute worst order I've ever gotten on Amazon.<br /><br />Thank you for refunding me Amazon!
1.0	Don't know if it's deliberate, or just a bad batch, but the diameter of these cups is a different size from  all the other brands we use. The grounds consistently got into the cup ruining the coffee, and causing a mess in the machine to clean up. We threw away the last 10 or 12 pods.
1.0	I received this chicken treats almost expired
1.0	I don't have any dietary restrictions.  I bought these because of an price reduction.  I wouldn't purchase them again.  They have very few chocolate chips.  Like you have to hunt for them in the cookie.  That isn't what chocolate chip cookies should be about.    The oatmeal version of these cookies is much better.
1.0	I received these as a gift since I am known for my love of good coffee.  They just don't work. They even get in the way of drinking out of some travel mugs. It's better to purchase a high quality travel cup and maintain it well. The metal beans bouncing around in the cup aren't nice either.<br />Interesting idea put it doesn't work.
1.0	Epic disappointment! There's nothing 'natural' about it - the taste and texture are horrible and it reminds me of crisco or some other hydrogenated concoction that is really , really bad for you!
1.0	I'm not sure if mine was mispackaged or what, but my Maui Melon Mint doesn't have any melon taste whatsoever - it is strictly mint.
1.0	plant arrived weak and quickly died
1.0	Either I don't like macadamia nuts or this product was old. The nuts have a musty smell and taste almost rancid. A few are crunchy but most are not. I would not order this product again.
1.0	There's no denying the Senseo is easy to use, and 'greener' than any of the other pod brewers out there. But the Dark Roast coffee was stale and dry, with the same aroma and flavor of a canned coffee that's been left sitting out too long.<br /><br />A pod brew will never be AS GOOD as drip - I get that. But that won't stop me from looking for something close.<br /><br />If you want easy and are not picky about taste, this pod's for you. If you want a pod brew that is at all reminiscent of a decent cup of coffeehouse java, keep looking.
1.0	I consider myself a &#34;coffee connoisseur&#34; drinking an average of one gallon daily for thirty years and I have tried virtually every major, minor and locally brewed beans and the various blends within each.  Folgers is capable of making a very good roast, namely the Gourmet Supreme, Black Silk and 100% Columbian are all well balanced, without bitterness and with a pleasant after taste.  However, this blend is a very ordinary, mediocre roast with weak flavor, bitter undertones and a slightly dirty aftertaste. This, along with the Breakfast blend, are barely worthy of considering given their finer blends are the same price. That said, I consider the Gourmet Supreme Dark roast and the beautifully smooth bold Black Silk blend to be the best off the shelve coffees available, with Maxwell House among the very worst. Many specialty brew houses, such as the watery Dunkin Donuts coffee, I find to have a burned, overcooked weak flavor with poor aromatics and poor flavor. Aroma Joe's is an exception with a full bodied brew.  I feel it fair to inform that I use a Bun coffee maker which brews very fast (full pot in under 3 minutes), with pre-heated water tank that maintains at 200 degrees  (considered the perfect temp for getting the best out of the bean and always with a completely full filter of coffee for maximum strength and flavor.  A slower cold brew unit such as most every other machine (I believe Cuisinart makes a unit that has a water tank pre-heated to 180 degrees which does not extract the finest undertones, but does much better than 20 dollar Mr. Coffee) and can be a bit bitter depending on the bean) will offer a different flavor that does not extract the fine undertones that make a good coffee stand out nor a bad coffee quite so bad.<br /><br /> I cannot recommend this blend of Folgers when they cook infinitely better coffee at the same cost, try the Colombian, Black Silk or the gourmet supreme.<br /><br /> This is THE highest price I have EVER seen for this coffee, Insane really.  It sells in the markets for around 8 dollars and I very often purchase it a Rite-Aid pharmacy at a cost of 8.99 and buy one get one free with a Rite-Aid member card.  Other times it will be two for 14.00 or some such.  I am in awe at the price of food products on Amazon.  For example a 4 lb. container of domino sugar for TWELVE DOLLARS!!!.  Seriously??? even at my local convenience store it is only 4.49!!!  And that is a pricey store...Amazon needs to work on this to make it a viable option.  If the price on food and household staples were reasonably close to store prices, I would purchase all non perishables from them..

1.0	I accidentally ordered this extra bold coffee when I meant to order Newman's Own Special Blend Decaf. The decaf is so much better to me. I'm not sure why they are so different. They are both called Special Blend. The Decaf is Medium roast. Just be careful which ever one you like because they look so closely the same But taste a lot different.
1.0	Headline says 8 Oz x 2 but product description says 4oz
1.0	"It has been a while since I have had a piece of juicy fruit gum. I bought some today and got a big suprise! They have totally changed the gum! The gum is now colored bright yellow, the texture is much softer and the wonderful sweet taste that it used to have is gone! On the package it says \\""NOW LONGER LASTING\\"". To which I say... \\""Who would want a gum that tastes this bad to last longer?\\"" I am very disapointed with Wrigleys. Why can't at least one thing from our childhood stay the same? Is it so much to ask? I tasted one piece... and threw the rest of the pack away..."
1.0	Micro pack is just that. Micro, is much much smaller than the image makes it out to be
1.0	The coffee isn't bad, but for the price, it isn't worth it. I buy a lot better tasting coffee at Walmart. And it's a lot cheaper. Walmart has one that is called Viennese that is wonderful. Try it, you won't be disappointed with it and it won't cost you an arm and a leg.
1.0	Ok... the coffee is great. I drink it every day.<br />But $24 for 1 pack of 48 pads is crazy. Someone makes gold out of this pads. In Holland they cost $6.20 a pack.<br />This is 4x as much.
1.0	I did not know this was &#34;pickled&#34;.  I  tried everything to remove the flavor of pickles but had no success.  There is nothing on the label about what it is packed in and nothing about whether they are ready to eat or need to be cooked.  I found them not ready to eat as the peels could not be chewed.  Also they can not be put into any kind of hot dishes.  Only good for salads.  The product may be OK if you like pickled type salads but since I ordered it for hot dishes and there is no decent label, I must give it one star.<br />I am going to have to throw them out.
1.0	"When so many reviews are over-the-top about vanilla beans... doesn't it make you question the integrity of the reviews? To be frank, they are all from one source: JR Mushrooms and Specialties.<br /><br />If you buy from this company, you'll receive a pile of mediocre or rancid beans. And technically, you can't return them, though if you contact Amazon they might let you.<br /><br />One. HUGE. Scam.<br /><br />Stay away from these rancid \\""vanilla beans\\"", DO NOT LISTEN TO THE FAKE REVIEWS, find quality elsewhere."
1.0	These taste like ashtrays. They are horrible. I love most of Trader Joe's pumpkin spice stuff, but these were disgusting.
1.0	Plant your money, at least you will have something green coming out of the ground.  12 seeds, two tiny tiny pots, weeks of care, and so far no germination at all.  Not real pleased,
1.0	Picture putting dried up peas with no seasoning in your mouth.  These taste like putting powder in your mouth.  Nothing.  I should have known because they had no sodium.  No sodium usually means no taste and these are right on with no taste.
1.0	Whoever thought lemon flavored fiber one bars would taste good was clearly missing a few screws. These things taste horrible, I simply cannot stand them.
1.0	this coffee was to be variety of coffee well you get the same coffee of the same kind.that what is showed on the page is not what you get not at all
1.0	I've tried to use this numerous times with USB and SD cards but nothing happens. When you insert the device it glows red but nothing happens. I do once in a while have the iPad respond with it not recognizing the device. Over all it's a piece of junk.
1.0	A few days ago, I purchased a bag of these and fed them to my two 4-month old Lab puppies.  They went crazy over them and devoured them in less than 1 hour.  A few hours later they had terrible diarrhea and vomiting.  This went on for 2 days and I took them to the vet this morning where over $300 later, she attributed it to these treat sticks.  The xrays showed inflamed stomachs and large intestines filled with small bits in each dog.  Normally after not eating for over 15 hours, a dogs stomach should be black and filled with nothing but air, but my puppies' stomachs were all white.  They are now on special medicated food and assorted medications to try and combat the effects from these treats.  I have also done some research and discovered that this company (Nestle) had treats recalled in 2007 because of the number of dog deaths from consuming these products that are MADE IN CHINA.  DO NOT BUY THESE-save your dog from the suffering!
1.0	I WAS SO HOPEFUL, AND IT WAS AWFUL!!  tASTED LIKE RACOON PISS!  sORRY, I HAVEN'T TASTED THE LATER.  BUT I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE.  llOVE YOU FOR TRYING, BUT NO, YOU HAVE A WAY TO GO.  aNNE gILBERT.
1.0	no flavor and coffee taste
1.0	Bad stuff I don't like it no recommend for anybody don't trash your money.thanks
1.0	I love coffee. I get up early - 05:15 - to get ready for work. By six AM I've had about 32 oz of coffee. That was getting expensive with the K-cups, so I was interested in getting something refillable. So I bought one of these. The first time it didn't work, I attributed it to my inability to use it right. So I reread the instructions. Tried again....failed again. Used it a third time, failed a third time. What do i mean by fail? Coffee grounds in my coffee, weak coffee, awful coffee. It doesn't make good coffee no matter how fine I grind the coffee. Waste of time and money!
1.0	This box of Cella Dark chocolate covered cherries had a powdery grayish look to them and they tasted off, very stale.  Saved 5 dollars by buying from Amazon but would have been better to spend the extra money and order from the manufacturer who is the Tootsie Roll Co.
1.0	"How do you make $400 Million dollars a year with 1 product? Sell imported irradiated, pasteurized \\""fruit juice(?)\\"" as a nutritional supplement.  Where are the ingredients on this product? Shouldn't they be listed on this page?  My chiropractor pressured me into buying a $40. bottle of \\""Xango.\\"" I got out my magnifying glass so I can tell you the  ingredients: citric acid, natural flavor, pectin, xanthum gum, sodium bensoate. Citric acid, yum, natural flavor,yum, pectin to thicken it up, and irratiated xanthum gum, and sodiom benzoate, an ingredient in fireworks which is used as a preservative, which combined with ascorbic acid (vit c such is found in fruit) forms benzene a known carcinogen. The additive sodiom benzoate is also thought to contribute to hyperactivity in children.  Like I said, I bought a bottle of this to please my chiropractor, drank it at the medium dosage, and as I was finishing the bottle, fell sicker than I have been in years, with summer cold and flu symptoms.  Well there's a sucker born every minute. I'd pay $40. for a bottle of something to cure my gullibility."
1.0	This product tastes great, but after the popcorn kernels, the #1 ingredient is partially hydrogenated soybean oil:<br />This version of oil is unhealthier to the consumer because of its unnatural use of hydrogenation which forms trans-fats that the body cannot breakdown. Trans-fats are solid fats produced from oil by unnatural methods and interfere with metabolic processes such as increasing LDL or bad cholesterol. Partially hydrogenated oils have a tendency to be used by food companies because of its cheapness, stability, improved texture, and ability to oxidize to provide a longer shelf life.<br /><br />Convenient...? yes, but if you're concerned about heart-health, pop your own ;-)
1.0	Looked like a good idea when I standing in the store looking for something to send the son who's deployed in Afghanistan. Pop it in the microwave for 90 seconds and you have red beans and rice. Luckily I decided to try it for myself before mailing them. Close to the worst thing I've eaten in a long time (same for the Jambalaya version). Strange flavor that you try to wash out of your mouth with anything you can find that will combat the aftertaste. Why on earth is Zatarain's putting out something like this with their reputation? I've noticed a burnt flavor in their boxed red beans and rice dinners, so I quit buying those. Now this is definitely off my shopping list.
1.0	"Something about the texture of this cereal... once it's in the milk, it quickly becomes so soggy and mushy that it feels and looks like cat food. it is also very lacking in taste- it's VERY slightly sweetened and lacks the toasted aroma of other \\""honey toasted' cereal.  Granted, this product is probably a lot healthier.  I wish I liked it since I bought the Costco pack... and I usually LOVE other the other Kashi products (go lean crunch, energy bars), but unfortunately this cereal is not one of their best."
1.0	These grinders are poorly made.  I ordered 3 different ones and all 3 broke within a week.  The grinder portion is a very light weight plastic
1.0	Hated them!  They tasted terrible.  I threw them out to the birds and they wouldn't even eat them.
1.0	All the candy canes were broke
1.0	I would not be able to recommend this product to anyone because of the way it arrived for me. I just received it and it was a bag of mush. The chocolate was all liquid form. I thought this was suppose to be chocolate covered hemp seeds?! Not chocolate syrup!
1.0	This is just instant coffee in a k-cup container.  Very overpriced for what you are getting.  A jar of instant would be half this price and and least honest about what it is.
1.0	This stuff is kinda funky.  I'm not sure if it's supposed to taste how it did, but either way I did not (and neither did my family) enjoy the flavor of this Larabar.  As other reviewers have said, the taste is a little rancid.  The texture is similar to other Larabars in that it's chewy and has bits of fruit/nut/coconut in it.  I do not recommend getting 16 of these without trying one first!
1.0	I have tried several different K-cups (Timothy's, Van Houtte, Gloria Jeane) and flavors/roast (bold, light, medium, etc) but this is the worst tasting coffee I ever had in my life.  I don't think there are too many reviews as people don't always leave a review when something is bad or if they have tried this coffee already, they know not to purchase it again which leads to a review not being done.  I will never buy this again though I love and prefer the columbian medium and kenya kil. roast from Van Houtte.
1.0	"As it was \\""sea salt\\"" I expected a nutritious salt, but this is obviously highly refined. This \\""sea salt\\"" does not even have iodine. Very disappointed- and have a bucket-full to use! A better (clearer) description of this product would have been appreciated."
1.0	Sorry but it was uneatable. Both of my kids love pasta pick-ups, but it was something wrong with those, the texture was totally different then when I bought those in store and they were some kind of dry. See photos - I opened one from here ( left) and one from store (right) at the same time, there is a significant difference. I tried all of them and all of them ended up in garbage :(
1.0	I thought I was getting a box of 40 Kit Kat bars for $49.  I ordered these 3 weeks before Chrismas and they came after New Years and I only revieved 5 bars. After rereading my order that says chunky KitKat bar 5 x 40, I has no idea that is be spending $9.80 per candy bar and not 5 candy bars weighing 40 grams each. I wish this was advertised a bit clearer, especially since I can get the same candy at at my local store for only $2, I feel cheated, but I suppose it's my own fault in the end. In any case, I don't understand why would anyone charge $9.80 for a Kit Kat
1.0	It doesn't say it anywhere on the product description but it is DECAF!!!
1.0	If you're looking for something to drink since Chamba Chai is no longer produced, DO NOT LOOK HERE!  The tea flavor is MUCH stronger, the sweet and smooth quality of the drink is gone, AND this is not a low caffeine drink.  VERY disappointing product of Big Train which is advertising this to be a replacement of Chamba Chai.  Now I have to make my own chai blend of spices with decaff tea.
1.0	Tuna soup  -- who woulda thought???  Not chunk light tuna, rather brown mush.  You can't rinse it because it all goes down the drain as a liquid mess, and if you are lucky enough to squeeze the water out, you wind up with less than half a can of mush.  Even my cats won't eat it.  You're better off paying a little more for solid white cause you not only get a full can, but cost-wise it's a better deal.
1.0	Medaglia D'Oro has to be the worst coffee I've ever had. It had an old musty flavor and odor. You get what pay for.
1.0	somehow this last &#34;soursop organic tea leaves&#34; don't seem like soursop leaves plus there's no coloring of tea when i boil it!! like just plain water: even when i put more soursop leaves in!! been ordering soursop tea leaves for over 3 yrs. i do know what am doing and drinking!! besides soursop does grow where i come from, island of &#34;GUAM&#34;!!!
1.0	We don't have an older Keurig, it's a basic sized machine and these DO NOT fit. Plus, by the time we would end up shipping them back, we'd still loose half of our money. So we took the grounds out of each one and put them in zip lock bags that I take to work to use in a drip machine. The coffee tastes ok but I really wanted it for my k-cup machine which it doesn't work in.
1.0	Do I have the choice to not give any star at all?  This brand been around too long to be excused from making such an awful product. Don't waste your money on this one.
1.0	I love coconut water but did not like this brand. To me it had a weird taste like the pulp on the outside of the nut.
1.0	not packed correctly and the outside of the box is covered in salsa. These last seven words serve no purpose
1.0	I dont know what the other reviewers are drinking...This stuff is like drinking day old 3rd wash coffee. I really cant believe Kruger is selling this stuff with their coffee maker.
1.0	It is not a 4.8 ounce canister. It is 1.6 ounce canisters. I could have gotten it much cheaper elsewhere. This is false advertisement!!!!!
1.0	These cups DO NOT work with Kruieg one-cup brewers. They appear to be the same dimensions but do not work. The hot chocolate is pretty good but not for the price if you don't have the convenience of k-cups.
1.0	People who thought this coffee had a high caffeine amount after drinking it either got a completely different batch than I got or they are susceptible to coffee placebos. It wasn't just me, three people who drank this coffee with me agree... it's a dud.
1.0	"Have tried the regular teas(Original and Green Tea Citrus) from this company and thought I'd give the diet one a try. Big mistake! I had hoped it being diet that they had just omitted the sugar that the regular tea has. Nope. They added sucralose (Splenda) instead. My family must be sensitive to it because we all got nauseous drinking it. Thankfully I am well aware of Amazon's great customer service and had them contact me so I can tell them my issue. They gladly refunded my money. I will no longer buy the diet version but will keep buying the Green Tea Citrus version of the Sweet Leaf teas.<br /><br />TIP: Best way to get in contact with Amazon.<br />Go to \\""HELP\\"" on upper right corner. Then go down the right hand side to where it says \\""Get Express customer service or contact us by e-mail or phone\\"". Click on \\""Contact Us\\"" and then proceed to follow the directions. You have the option to be contacted by phone. It's the ONLY way I ever deal with them. Hope that helps everyone for future problems. :)"
1.0	The items came in a brown paper bag.  Half of them were decaf which I threw out.  So far I have also thrown our numerous ones because they have no flavor.  Very disappointed not what I expected.
1.0	Look aspartame is awful for you, read on it. I had tremors and awful headaches on this stuff. Don't use it!!! Try xylitol it's much better for you. Please consider your health, this stuff causes brain tumors in rats.
1.0	"I ordered \\""1 of Vitacost DGL Deglycyrrhizinated Licorice Root Extract -- 750 mg - 100 Capsules\\"" from VITACOST (paying for the item and shipping) and received an EMPTY box!!! I am very upset, this has never happened to me on amazon."
1.0	Finally found a coffee I consider really good. Bold, yet nice and smooth. I highly recommend for your Tassimo coffee maker.<br />Edit: After making this review I decide to purchase some more.... Well, now Amazon.com decides they aren't going to ship it to an APO anymore. I bought this a few weeks ago and had it shipped to me, now it has changed on me. More and more I find Amazon not shipping items to us who are at Military APO addresses. Why is that? Well, it sucks.
1.0	I can't seem to get it to go down my throat it is that dry, and I have half and half mixed with it. As close to cardboard as you can get.
1.0	Bad tasting crap. Dont buy.
1.0	GROSSSSS! Sorry Green Mountain brands = &#34;FAIL&#34;..<br />These gourmet names sounds so good...<br />&#34;too good to be true&#34; so end up gross stuff, I am not happy with the purchase - Sorry not recommends.....<br />RECOMMENDS: Stay away from the brand of &#34;Green Mountains&#34; they fail the quality of coffee beans....<br />Not sure if it is too late to return them. :(
1.0	I'm a raw food chef/instructor and LOVE to use coconut oil in my creations. I purchased this oil based on the label information. At room temperature the liquid turned brown - a sure indication that this oil HAS been heated at high temperatures. The label says &#34;&#34;organic cold pressed,&#34; which leads the buyer to the unwise conclusion that the oil contains all the whole food nutrition and living enzymes one would expect when they buying an &#34;organic&#34; coconut oil. This oil HAD to have been high-heated at some point to dry the coconut meat before it was cold pressed. Do not buy this oil if you care about the nutrient value of RAW food.<br /><br />If you are a raw foodie or you are wanting to use coconut oil as a medicinal product, I suggest you purchase Skinny and Company's coconut oil. I know the owners of this company and can verify that they NEVER heat their oil over 100 degrees. (Skinny's coconut meat takes three days to dry using their special patented process) It is absolutely clear in appearance and tastes amazing. It's quite healing too...great for diaper rash, psoriasis, eczema and more. Yes, it is more expensive, but there are 18 whole coconuts in each jar - and it tastes amazing!<br /><br />Do not buy this oil if you want a raw coconut oil product! In its liquid state it is amber in color. (I do not work for Skinny and Company, I just enjoy their product.)
1.0	"I made the terrible mistake of believing that these were the same Bon-Bon's found in local Walmart's a long time ago from when I was a child. I had excitedly bought two bags of them recently because I assumed after doing some research into the history of the Sweet Enticements brand name that they were the same thing I had when I was a child:    [...]    These are not the same thing even though they are made by the same original company Arcor. These happen to be from a company in Argentina which produces many types of candy but they are certainly not even remotely similar to the Bon-Bon's produced by Arcor under the Walmart brand label \\""Sweet Enticements\\"". The chocolate in these is very bland with no crunchy outer wafer shell which I used to remember, and the peanut butter inside has some kind of filler substance mixed in that tastes like olive oil which kind of destroys the entire point of the flavor.    That's not to say there was anything technically wrong with the company or the product, just that I personally felt they were some of the worst Bon-Bons I've ever had in my life ever and they found their way directly to the trash bin after trying just one of them. If you are from a country which is not used to American chocolate and American Peanut butter you may have a different experience, but I really doubt it. Save your money and make em from scratch."
1.0	These were so bad...my kids would not even eat them. The expiration date was only weeks away from when I received them. WOuld not recommend from this seller. We have had these nuts before and really liked them. Saw them on amazon and decided to try...big mistake.
1.0	I bought two of these &#34;Golden State Fruit Citrus Duet Gift Fruit Boxes&#34;. I have never been SO embarrassed in my life! There were six navel oranges, 2 little mandarin oranges about 1-2&#34; in diameter, and two oranges of some other variety, These were gifts, and I am ashamed and embarrassed to say they came from me as Christmas gifts! Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me.<br /><br />The price was totally outrageous. I not sending them back, but I will NEVER buy again. Would have gotten a better selection at my regular food store. Because I am handicapped, I don't always have the &#34;luxury&#34; of going to the grocery store.
1.0	This bundle does NOT contain what it's advertised to contain... and YOU CAN NOT RETURN IT ONCE YOU BUY IT...<br />I will give Amazon credit for handling my situation... but they shouldn't have to!<br /><br />I was looking forward to the Green Mountain Blueberry, but now I'll just have to do without. Not going to risk buying anything else from them EVER again.<br /><br />Apparently I'm not the 1st person to have this problem... I should have heeded the advise of other reviews.
1.0	THE CAKE WAS MILDEW ,IT WAS BAD, IT WAS A CHRISTMAS GRIF THAT I HAD APOLOGIZE FOR SO IWOULD NOT BUY AGAIN
1.0	This is the furthest thing from the taste of Wintergreen that you can get!  It's more Peppermint with some other unknown flavor that was added to TRY to give it a Wintergreen flavor, but it misses!  Skip this if you're wanting Wintergreen!
1.0	Don't Buy This Coffee!  It's weak and flavorless.<br /><br />I've been trying various variety packs to see what's out there for my Keurig K-Cup.  I brewed three cups and poured all three down the drain.<br /><br />So far I've found Tully's brand to be the best, it has a rich bold flavor.
1.0	I opened the box and pulled out a packet.  All of the contents spilled out into my lap and the floor.  I examined all of the packets and they all were opened down the side.  Possibly a glue defect, but still, not useable.  No return policy, no telephone number to request a new order or credit; not a good experience.
1.0	The information says this is organic. It doesn't say organic anywhere on the label. That should be taken off the description.  Plantation does have organic but this is not it.  If I had known, I would not have ordered it. I will not order it again.
1.0	Worst licorice product I ever tasted. The smell, I think, is what really made this hard to drink. The taste is certainly &#34;licorice-y&#34;, but not the smell. Combined, it just doesn't make me think of licorice. Lawn clippings, maybe. Seriously, I hated it (with or without sugar), and I LOVE licorice!
1.0	Warning! This product will not work with the Keurig 2.0 coffee machine.  Error message: &#34;Oops! Use only Keurig brand.&#34;  It will work in the Oder model Keurig coffee makers, but we were still disappointed with the lack of flavor.
1.0	this tastes like regular powder made iced tea.  it tastes nothing like the real thing.    props to amazon for a speedy delivery as usual
1.0	"Allergic to soy flour, & MSG, or SULFITE ?  Avoid THIS. It is loaded with MSG...listed in a way which disguises it.  MSG is an appetite STIMULENT. MSG  is listed  on small print label ...as \\""vegetable protein (soy)\\"",  \\""SOY protein,\\""  \\""texturized vegetable protein\\"",  \\""Monosodium Glutamate,\\"" and \\""Monosodium Glutamate;hydrolyzed corn protein, and yeast extract.\\""  This is not a misprint. Each time it is listed on label, at least EIGHT times--indicates another DOSE of MSG. It is in the sauce, in the manicotti, in the filling of the manicotti, and in the \\""meat\\"" which also contains \\""PORK crumbles,\\"" which probably accounts for some of the sodium metabiSULFITE.<br /><br />Sulfite is a preservative, and chemically a \\""salt,\\"" so it is bad for people w/ heart trouble; hypertension; OR SULFITE ALLERGY ( triggers severe dangerous  asthma attacks in allergic persons, including children). It triggers migraine headaches in a large percentage of people also (Chinese Restaurant Syndrome). The product also contains two other preservatives (also \\""salts\\"") , and table salt. Wow, ladies....wonder why you \\""retain fluid?\\""<br /><br />ASK an M.D.-- all the above is pretty accurate.<br /><br />This is a fairly large group of folks who shouldn't eat this product...and I bought a couple cases- and gave them away because I have SULFITE allergy, and MSG allergy. I wish I had been able to read the ingredinets online-- I wouldn't have bought any.<br /><br /> Monosodium glutamate (so-called flavor enhancer is a chemical/DRUG  which crosses blood/brain barrier and stimulates appetite! ( Just what we need to sabotage weight control in a fat nation).<br /><br />Even with loads of MSG --the sauce is very acidic. I think the manufacturers know it is inferior, or else WHY all the MSG?<br />Their Dinty Moore stew tastes better, and isn't a chemical cocktail.<br /><br />I wish I could have said this was a great product. Over a period of years, what happens to all the chemicals we have consumed? Please, Amazon,copy the ingredients and post it somewhere-- so we know what we are buying. I am usually happy w/ items purchased... not this stuff."
1.0	"while waiting for my order to arrive (now foods - better stevia) i picked up a box of \\""stevia in the raw\\"" from my local supermarket, and boy what a mistake that was! it is without a doubt one the most disgusting sweeteners i have ever tasted and these people claim that it has no after taste...i got one word in response to that, LIARS!<br />avoid it at any price!!!"
1.0	I bought these for my lunch break hoping for something good. Bad idea. I prepared it via microwave (which could have affected the noodle consistency maybe but not the sauce) and the noodles--actually I should say THE noodle since it just came out like one big block of noodle-- tasted gross. The sauce was gross. Who the hell told Annie Chun what teriyaki sauce tastes like? This was an abomination. On top of the tastes, this ramen is like 3x more expensive then the regular kind and is 1/100 of the deliciousness.
1.0	I wanted an orange flavoring to put in my protein shakes after I had bariatric surgery. I couldn't taste the orange, and all I could get was a strong aroma of alcohol. Maybe I don't know the difference between flavorings and extracts, but they should be the same thing! I bought Cherry, Banana, and Orange. All 3 wreaked of strong alcohol. YUCK!!!!!
1.0	"After receiving this item I noticed that the \\""gift box\\"" is ruined due to shipping labels that cannot be removed without damaging the box. Also, the \\""gift box\\"" interior is comprised of,  at least, 75% bubble wrap. I bought this item with the intention of giving it as a gift but considering how awful this item actually is, I'll be searching for a last minute replacement at a store and save myself the embarrassment. You've been warned."
1.0	The package came broke, this is a gift.
1.0	My girls did not like this drink.  We ended up throwing the rest out in the trash. Don't recommend at all.
1.0	I was sent whole bean coffee instead of ground.  Unfortunately, all packing materials were discarded before I realized.  VERY disappointed!  A word to the wise, check your coffee to make sure that you have the right product.  Now I have to buy a coffee grinder, but I won't be buying it from Amazon!
1.0	I thought I would your green tea a try, because, other teas under your name are amazingly good. Sadly not so much! I will return to KIRKLAND'S GREEN TEA. I GET THIS FROM COSTCO!!
1.0	Oh this stuff is BITTER. Even when I just brew it for like a minute it is BITTER.  I've tried three of them and haven't been able to get past the bitter taste. Even using three teaspoons of honey.  I like the tins so will use up the leaves but won't be buying THIS sampler again!! Ever. Never. No way.
1.0	these are supposed to be sold in person, not over the internet. in fact, i think internet *sales* are not just discouraged but not allowed. it gives an unfair advantage to girls locally who are participating and following the rules. It does not promote good sportsmanship among the girls, if they are blatantly not following the sales rules.<br /><br />Most people buying Girl Scout Cookies do not know that selling Girl Scout Cookies online is a violation of Girl Scout policies and can result in serious actions against the seller by the United States Girl Scouts.<br /><br />If you are a parent selling on the internet or selling outside season a bunch of cookies you bought during the season, shame on you, what are you teaching your Girl Scout...you may as well take her out of the organization because you are contradicting what we stand for. Brownie Scouts are responsible for most of the cookie sales in the United States you are robbing 6 - 9 year old little girls.<br /><br />Cookies found for sale online at auction and community list sites should not be purchased under any circumstances, as neither GSUSA, your local Girl Scout council, nor our licensed bakers can guarantee the freshness or *origination* of these cookies. Further, purchasing cookies in this way does not support girls' participating in the cookie program.<br /><br />Respect the fact that The Girl Scout Cookie Program is the premier entrepreneurship opportunity for girls, but it is just one part of the Girl Scout Leadership Experience. Girl Scouts participate in many activities throughout the year and work on many projects. Cookies are just one of those activities. And because only girls may sell Girl Scout Cookies, their market availability is limited to the 6 to 8-week period when they are engaged in the program.
1.0	Complete garbage. All sugar. Nothing healthy about this.
1.0	I searched around for the MadHatter tea blend to buy since I enjoyed it so much as a gift. I was so pleased to find it available. Its been over a month now and it still hasn't arrived. I already know I like the tea, but can't say much about the vendor. I ordered it through Amazon, but it must be an independant vendor. I've since ordered other items from Amazon that arrived promptly.
1.0	"Just bought a box of ASSORTED FINE CHOCOLATES by Russell Stover, made in Kansas City, Missouri, with an expiration date of January 2014.  When I got home, we opened the box for a chocolate treat only to find that all of the chocolates had bloomed (a whitish coating that can appear on the surface of chocolate leaving the taste unpleasant and texture chalky and dry).  I saw that on the bottom of the box they have a \\""Guarantee of Quality and Freshness.\\""  The guarantee states that, \\""If you are not fully satisfied for any reason, we will gladly replace it.\\""  I contacted the company and explained that my box of chocolates had bloomed.  I asked what I had to do to receive a replacement box, offering to mail in the box of chocolates that I wanted replaced (that still contained most all but 2 pieces that my husband and I had tried and didn't even finish eating because of the unpleasant taste and texture).  The candy fillings were also dry and hard.  Unfortunately, Russell Stover's response was to tell me that when chocolate \\""blooms\\"" it does not effect the quality or taste of the chocolate, so they would not replace the box.  I went to culinary school, to train as a pastry chef.  I know about chocolate, and I know that once a chocolate has bloomed, it has basically ruined the quality of the chocolate.  I am so disappointed in Russell Stover's lack of customer service, and their blatant lie of a guarantee.<br /><br />I will never buy another box of Russell Stover's chocolate again knowing that they don't have integrity and that their product may well be ruined regardless of its expiration date.<br /><br />I will tell all of my friends about this and suggest they avoid buying Russell Stover's products."
1.0	Such a disappointment!  If you are trying to watch calories and still want to enjoy a bagel, just get the Lender's refrigerated/frozen bagels (plain is only 210 calories) and don't waste your time on these as it will not satisfy your need for a bagel.
1.0	much less than I thought would come. I should of just bought them at the store where I could have gotten more flavors.
1.0	I sent this a s a Easter gift and the milk chocolate had starte turning white! I was very embarressed!
1.0	FYI Gluten-Intolerant Folks! This product contains Rye and Barley which contain gluten. The package states that the gluten is removed in the processing, but my personal experience drinking this doesn't support that claim. I am gluten-intolerant, and I reacted to Dandy Blend as if I had ingested gluten. Too bad, because it is pleasant-tasting and a nice coffee substitute!
1.0	Hubby didn't like it. Too much of a vinegar taste.
1.0	The picture of the floral arrangement is misleading. I sent this to my Aunt and the FREE vase is a white Mug. ORANGE flowers as indicated were RED. A bit disappointed with this purchase.
1.0	Maybe I put it on the wrong thing but I did not like it at all. It gave my porkchops a strange taste. I used it twice and I am scared to use it again. Don't want to ruin anymore food.
1.0	it was broken when I received it.
1.0	It didn't do what I was told that it would.
1.0	I did not like this coffee at all. It didn't settle well with my stomach. Would not buy again.
1.0	I ordered Chili Pequin seeds.  I was going to use these, along with Garlic to form a perimeter around our farm plots on our organic farm to discourage deer from browsing on our crops.  Imagine my surprise when my plants sprouted and I had a bunch of Green Bell Peppers to harvest.  How has this guy gotten away with this for so long?  Are all the positive reviews from his friends, or ghost accounts.  Beware!  Do not fall for this scam like I did.  Run, don't walk away!<br /><br />I am tardy in updating this post.  Several weeks ago, immediately after I posted this, 'Rob' apologized and sent me another TWO packages of seeds.  I'll plant them this weekend and let y'all know what comes up.  My thanks to 'Rob' for his prompt response.  I really didn't expect it.  I hope all goes well this time!
1.0	Orange Pekoe and Pekoe cut Black, with natural flavor added (but it doesn't say what that natural flavor is).  Hard to tell the flavor as it was so weak.  After getting a weak brew from Lipton I opened an unused kcup and checked content of the cup.  You get half the product than Celestial (which by the way my weight scale says Lipton cup=5gr, Celestial=10gr, and that's being weighed with their cups, so Celestial offers at least twice as much tea per cup than Lipton).  Don't believe me?  Try it yourself!
1.0	Not sure why I ordered this processed junk in the first place, but when we opened it, it was hard as a rock and we couldn't even use it! We had to throw it away. What a waste of money :(
1.0	This stuff is really gross!  I wouldn't buy it again.  I was so dissappointed.
1.0	tasted like crap a big wast of money run away and save yourself  i have to type 3 more words
1.0	"Why is this product listed under the all natural and organic foods?  It not only contains artificial flavors, it's loaded with artificial colors as well!!! Just because they put a little natural flavoring in there does not make it a \\""natural\\"" food product."
1.0	the price alone will scare you away and well it should, over $7.00 for the very small bag, what was I thinking? Taste is ok, but at the price I won't buy this again.
1.0	This was a waste of money. Difficult to use and did not fit the Keurig machine.  I had to pry the top of the cup out of the machine after it became stuck. Very defective product!
1.0	I drink tea every day, and I especially like the vanilla-flavored teas, but this one had a bitter taster, even with sugar and cream added. I would not recommend.
1.0	woody taste not good would never buy them again
1.0	IT DOES NOT WORK IN MY MACHINE
1.0	All cans were flat and tasted like they were from 1999. Contacted Coca-Cola, and was sent a coupon for a free 12 pack of Coke. Rather upsetting considering I bought SURGE for $16.99 not COKE for $4.49.
1.0	"I am a big fan of coconut water. We often buy young coconuts from our local grocery store to enjoy it.<br /><br />Late last year, I was introduced to this product by a friend. I loved the taste. I immediately ordered a 12 pack from Amazon and thoroughly enjoyed every last one of them.<br /><br />In my excitement I signed up for \\""Subscribe & Save\\"" program and got a really good deal. I received two shipments and both were great!<br /><br />However the next shipment had a very bad taste! I am not sure how to describe it. I immediately got in touch with Amazon's Customer service and they sent me a replacement. (Amazon is the best!!!). The replacement had the same bad taste. I ended up throwing all of them in the trash (recycled all the containers).<br /><br />Product showed promise - Unfortunately they did not have good quality control measures in place! I guess its back to the local grocery store for me."
1.0	I wish it had been disclosed that this is not the UK Cadbury product --- I think it would have been fair to have disclosed that this is the US Hershey product......huge disappointment
1.0	The Brooklyn Breakfast variety blends were very weak, no body and tasteless. I tried to make them in all size brew cups to see if it would help. Had to throw them out. I normally like the medium to bold variety. All the morning coffees are awful! I have not tried the flavored ones or the ones they say are darker. So far I am afraid to try the others. These really have no body at all. Water with some coffee flavor.
1.0	The 5-pound bag of dal I received was expired (past the use-by date on the label) and the lentils were covered in green mold/mildew. Please see the picture I posted that clearly shows the use-by date [I received the product in May 2015] and the lentils covered in mold/mildew.
1.0	I was really hoping to like this.  I'm not picky with my food, but this is just way too sweet for me.
1.0	I thank Amazon Vine for letting me try out this popcorn, but calling this a disappointment is a big understatement.  The taste is so yucky that you'll lose concentration on whatever movie you're watching while eating it.
1.0	I bought a bag of the yogurt covered Goji Berries from Whole Foods for almost $12 thinking they must be pretty yummy. The &#34;yogurt&#34; is actually a mix of a bunch of stuff including SOUR CREAM. UGH! It's a very rancid taste and smell. Needless to say, I couldn't finish them or pawn them off any anyone!
1.0	Awful.  Very little ginger taste and all sugar.  I probably just stick to Regatta or Gosling's.
1.0	I think it should be a standard that if you're shipping chocolate that has the ability to melt easily (it wasn't even THAT hot when these were delivered), there should be some kind of packing to ensure they remain cold until it reaches the person who made the purchase. I tried snacking on these for a few days after trying to save them by putting them in the freezer.<br /><br />Pulling off the melted into the chocolate tin wrapper took at least a minute or two per candy and my hands were a complete mess as the chocolate was all over the wrapper from the initial melting. I concluded that the time and mess associated with trying to enjoy these wasn't anywhere close them tasting good enough to keep going. I ended up tossing them and chalking it up as a loss.
1.0	"wish I could put zero stars - take k-cups out of there original packaging and throw them in a box is a recipe for contamination.  these \\""homemade\\"" variety packs should be banned from amazon.  I am surprised the FDA hasn't stopped them yet.  do not buy!"
1.0	Sad to say that more than half the bag of popcorn does not pop. I was hoping this was just one of the boxes but 2 boxes, 6 packs of popcorn, and two microwaves later and the popcorn still does not pop all the way. Sad to say this was a big disappointment.
1.0	Sickly sweet with that artificial sweetener flavor
1.0	either it was old/stale (i.e. expired; you can not check this), or it is not real Kona coffee. Tastes worse than stuff from Costco
1.0	poor quality broken and outdated……………...
1.0	The tea that I received was not the tea in the picture.<br />The tea in the picture is a purple and white box, the tea that I received was in a brown box.<br />I did not want to go through the hassle of sending it back.<br />But I would say it was misrepresented
1.0	Unfortunately, I did not bother to read other peoples review. The seeds arrived RANCID!<br />Do NOT buy!
1.0	My Cadbury Easter Creme Egg arrived yesterday. I couldn't wait. This is one of my all time favorite Easter treats.<br />Every egg in my box is deformed. Most have gooey leakage around the wrapper (and in the box).<br />Obviously this box sat someplace warm and they have the gall to re-sell it at a reduced price.<br />Buyer beware!!! What a rip off. I've been an Amazon Prime member for years and this is the worse product that I have ever purchased. It never should have been sold in this condition at all. This was purchased in the cold snap. We had three inches of snow when this arrived.
1.0	I had to throw away about half of them because my machine wasn't able to use them because they were so damaged.  Looks like they left the warehouse that way because it came in a larger box with other product perfectly in tact...very disappointed they would ship this...
1.0	These are truly subpar boxed chocolates.  Hershey's skimps on caramel and other fillings.  The ones that are advertised as containing nuts have only minuscule shavings.  Do yourself a favor and stick with Whitman's.
1.0	After reading previous reviews, and seeing this product over the years on Amazon, I gave it a try. Bah Humbug...BLAND!!!!<br />This was a waste of money. I finally did get an acceptable bowl of won-ton broth by using 2 packets to 16 oz of water.<br />NOTE This: instructions call for one packet to 3 cups of water...INDEED? BLAND, with none of the deep &#34;umami&#34; flavors of my favorite NYC cantonese chinese restaurants, or of our beloved local Golden China Restaurant here in Atascadero, Ca..<br />BEST buy for true won-ton soup aficionados: here at Amazon...Quoc Viet Foods - Wonton Soup Base, 10 oz jar @ 7.85...and, it DOES result in a very fine chinese restaurant copy cat flavor  [just add a bit of sesame oil...and chopped green onions...YUMMY-YUM!!!!] Oh, 1 tablespoon per 8 oz.water, or, for extra rich flavor, add to 1 cano f Campbell's chicken broth.<br /> [also: you need to add sesame oil to achieve the proper flavor level,]<br />Gung Ho!<br />Robert
1.0	I ordered this in August and noticed the expiration date was Sept. 2014!  I thought the product was tasteless.  Very disappointed.
1.0	The tea bags,when mixed with water,release chemicals that have been known to cause cancer. It's obvious that they don't care that much about their customers with tea bags like that.<br />Oh,and if you don't believe me,google it yourself.
1.0	I was very disappointed when I used this crab last night. Not only did I find what appeared to be hair in TWO different cans (not aware of a hairlike substance associated with crab, but whatever maybe it wasn't human hair) but there were tons of tiny shell bits that were impossible to completely pick out. Completely ruined my dinner. What an expensive waste! Ended up throwing away part of the meal and all the leftovers. Wasn't worth eating.
1.0	The package arrived later than expected and looked like it was used as a football. The entire case the candy was in in was cracked to pieces. I would have returned it it but it was too much a hassle.
1.0	I have a Senseo system that I really enjoy, so I thought this product would be a nice addition to the coffee. When I read the ingredients, I was afraid that it would be too sweet. There is no sweet taste at all..as a matter of fact, there is absolutely no taste at all. All this product does is add calories to my coffee. I would not recommend this product.
1.0	Can't beat eating a &#34;fresh&#34; piece of jerky, then getting about three-four pieces into your snack and discovering a bag full of MOLD!  Makes you want to buy more, not!
1.0	I tried it both hot and cold. It was bitter tasting, as though it had not been washed before processing. I was very disappointed as I love quinoa and was looking for an quick and easy breakfast option.
1.0	Prices like that? I'm disabled, and cannot drive that often. So I rely on amazon for my dry goods. To charge me something like this for one box of cereal is just inexcusable.
1.0	love this flavor of pop tarts so i thought i would buy a bunch from amazon. most of them are old and not able to be eaten. dont waste your money. thanks for nothing amazon.
1.0	This product made my small children violently ill within a few hours after ingesting it.  After reading up on coconut milk from Thailand, it is widely known to cause food poisoning.
1.0	"Says \\""cheese sauce powder.\\""  I was expecting a cheese sauce mix.  Not so.  It is powdered cheese flavor to add to a sauce you make."
5.0	Works great easy to program and looks stylish.
5.0	Works great! Used this product on my bathroom cabinets and  my kitchen cabinets, add new hardware came out very nice.
5.0	This is a good bulb to use as warm light for painters who don't have access to a north light window. It does work well I have 2 of them one on top of palette and another on canvas and it makes color representation accurate. I work mostly at night when the family is out and is giving me a warm light that is acceptable. this was recommended by Qiang Huang a great artist now I used his same light only if I could paint 1/2 as good as him.
5.0	Unless you're trying to shine a Tuba, this tube will last you ten years too.  Just a dab of simichrome on a polish rag, a little working it in (and some steel wool or scotchbrite if the lacquer is still on your buckle) and you'll be shiny in no time.
5.0	Plumbers says they worked great!
5.0	Looks nice.  I accidentally hung it slightly crooked, but it's on a wall that you're never really looking straight at so it's hard to tell.  Matches my other Moen hardware, and the brushed nickel looks great.
5.0	Fit perfect, no issues
5.0	fast service thanks will order again!!
5.0	My kids love this lock vs have to remember a key.
5.0	This light is very elegant and it is well made, especially for the price. We shortened up the chain to about nine inches and hung it in the living room. We love it.
5.0	You are going to need these if your light has been in service for any time. The old ones become brittle from the heat of the lamp. A snap to install on the ballast.
5.0	Quick and exactly what we needed.
5.0	First Alert CO615 Dual Power Carbon Monoxide... arrived earlier than predicted and works like a charm! I needed this to sell my home! in MA
5.0	Works great with an LDF6810ST LG dishwasher. Use a shoe lace when<br />pulling into place, as it takes a lot of force to thread it through the holes.<br />Wear gloves or the sheet metal will cut you!
5.0	Works good in my Man Hut
5.0	I purchased this low flow showerhead due to my wife was in a bad car accident and broke her back. She had limited mobility and the low flow showerhead we had was not a handheld. For the price and only being 1.5 gpm it has nice pressure and a descent flow.<br />I would recommend this product.
5.0	If you are repairing a GE oven than this is the part you need. I looked at other elements (that were less money) but they would have caused me to have to change the wiring connectors in my oven. This part is identical to the element that I pulled out. It is 1/4 the price that GE wanted (they wanted $74.00 + shipping). The shipping on this part was super fast, it arrived on the 4Th day.
5.0	I needed lighting for my big headboard and these are exactly what I needed. I was able to pry the wood open enough to feed the light strip and small remote sensor through the head board so all the wires are in the back. Then simply peak and stick. Beats the cost of bedside table lamps.
5.0	If you are as blind as a bat or even have good vision this thing is great. Look out ants it fits on my key chain. Yeah, I'm in my forties and I still entertain the notion of killing ants, What is up with that?
5.0	This product is everything I wanted and everything the listing said it is. I am very pleased with this and the service I have recieved.
5.0	It works!  - well you have to make sure your old garage door opener has the right amount of dip switches on there (mine had 9).  I made the mistake not checking first and ordered another one that did not work.  My mistake.  This one worked first try. Period. There is no science to it, just a little diligence before you order.
5.0	Awesome awesome lamp.<br />Always wanted one of these since I had seen one at a friend's house.adds just enough ambient light and is always cool to look at.
5.0	Fits perfectly and looks great.  It arrived on time as promised.
5.0	Great quality.  Very pleased.  Would recommend to anyone they will not be disappointed in the workmanship or quality. Highly recommend.
5.0	I moved into an apartment recently and had been used to my water softener at my house, and hated the hard water at my new place.  Someone told me she uses a Sprite shower filter, so I researched them and got this one b/c of the good reviews.  While I still have fairly dry skin from the hard water, it has made my hair much more manageable and less stringy since there's less chlorine getting through.  I love it and will continue to use this shower filter for as long as I don't have a water softener.
5.0	very nice easy to use...
5.0	I installed this myself and it was very easy!
5.0	Exactly what it says it is. An extra freezer bowl for the soft serve maker definitely comes in handy. I might even order a 3rd
5.0	I bought this brush and couple of other sizes to clean water passages in a cast iron boat exhast manifolds and risers. These worked great. There is nothing wimpy about this brush. Heavy duty and tough.
5.0	Does the trick as expected!
5.0	Totally love this looks better in person than did in the picture!!! Can't wait to put it in my daughters room!
5.0	The hose works great in our second bathroom for our son to take showers and for being able to reach for when the dogs need a bath
5.0	These are super handy and I highly recommend having one. I keep it on my desk, great for opening packages, and using here and there. I'll probably pick up a few more and keep them around the house in key places.
5.0	I was looking for low voltage LED spot lights as I had used the higher wattage Halogen lights previously but felt they used up too much of the available transformer wattage. I was surprised just how bright these were, much better than I could have wished for. Install was very simple and I like the install method for attaching to a current landscaping lighting set up.
5.0	This caulking is really easy to work with. Dries quickly, but not too quick to where you can't manipulate it after applying. Used it to caulk around baseboards and windows and notice a difference in energy savings.
5.0	Excellent product that totally met my needs for raising the seating height of a couch and loveseat.  I simply unscrewed the old, shorter legs and screwed in this new one.  The finish on the legs is beautiful.  It looks appropriately substantial in supporting these pieces, rather than tall and spindly.  Would have done this years ago, if I had known how fast and easy it was to do it!  Also, it was prepared for shipping so carefully---each leg was individually wrapped and placed in a bubble wrap bag, and it arrived in just a few days.  Highly recommend this product and company!
5.0	Love them and they look great. Awesome company. Will be ordering more.
5.0	The price was excellent, and it was the same identical battery that was in the use.  Thanks
5.0	Our masterbath needed extra quick heat and this was the perfect solution.  All other options involved major renovation.  The fan is attractive and the heater option fills the bill for us. I know a few have said the heater is noisy and yes it makes a little noise but all extra heaters make a noise.  It is not a problem to us.  We use the fan a great deal also.  I can't believe other fan makers haven't come up with this.  Hunter has always given good service for us.
5.0	Perfect accent light!
5.0	Just the right gauge and price for wiring my rock lights under my tacoma! About to buy another two rolls in a second!
5.0	Replaced an older thermostat with this Honeywell. Price was good and the thermostat is all that it was advertised to be Nice to be able to access it online, check current temperature inside and out and if want to can raise or lower temperature
5.0	Nicely made and includes mounting brackets.  A little snug to hold Costco TP rolls but it still works fine.
5.0	This is the perfect replacement for the 50watt PAR20 bulb.  I have 7 of these in my kitchen.  The 3000k color temp is a perfect match to halogen and the light output is actually a little greater than the 50 watt halogen they replaced.  The beam angle of 40 degrees illuminates my cabinets, floor and counters exactly like the halogens.  I initially tried the LED trim retro-fit kits sold at the major home improvement store but those did not direct the light like PAR bulbs do and they were more expensive.  I enjoyed replacing 350 watts with 63!  Two thumbs up!
5.0	"There are a lot of reviews that question the integrity of this filter.  Many reviews mention how small it is compared to the original filter, and some even wonder how it can be sold as \\""compatible.\\""<br /><br />First of all, it is smaller than the original, and based on the reviews I wasn't expecting it to last a year.  In truth, the filter just stopped working, and it has been 1 year and 4 months since we installed it.  This company is now offering a full sized filter, but I ordered another one of these smaller ones.  I don't see the point in getting a bigger filter that has the same life.<br /><br />Generally the term \\""compatible\\"" is used to indicate that what you are buying is not a direct OEM replacement, but it will fit and work.  This filter, while smaller, fits and works in the Amway housing.  You won't be disappointed with this filter, or its big brother if you are inclined."
5.0	Perfect. 5 min and $23 vs $250+.Thanks Amazon!
5.0	The similar looking Master lock breaks, and sucks, so forget the big  boxes and buy this one<br /><br />Best lock I've owned out of dozens
5.0	works - wish there was more per package
5.0	I didn't purchase the lights for their energy star rating, I bought them because they are a really great product. The night light feature is wonderful, there is always a charged flashlight available when I need one, but the best part is the power outage safety light.  I live in Florida and during a storm when the power goes out it is great to have these lights come on. I don't stumble in the dark to get to the candles or oil lamps, I just grab the flashlight that is already lit because it has detected the power outage and I can take care of my lighting needs.  I don't know yet how long the light's power reserve is as I have yet to have one quit on me after hours of use. We have two at the office, two at my boss's house, two at my house, two at my father-in-law's house and I just order two for my sister-in-law to have and two for her to give away as gifts.  Hope this helps.
5.0	Fit perfectly for half the cost!
5.0	This is an excellent fan if you want white color in a low ceiling room. Very nice looking, top of the quality.  We are happy with this purchase.
5.0	High quality at a great price.
5.0	Wonderful for my Malibu lighting
5.0	Have used this monitor for 6 months now and it's performing exactly as desired. Gives me the ability to monitor my senior citizen friend's  home for their comfort and safety while they are alone.
5.0	My issue was finding a vet fan that I could install without having access to the area above the ceiling.  At first I was intimidated by the product photo that had the electric box and exhaust outlet protruding from the side of the box.  It turns out that the side that you see in silver in the photo is removable.  All I had to do is remove the motor unit (3 very accessible screws), detach the assembly with the electrical housing and vent exhaust duct, attach the electric leads and exhaust hose to the assembly, then slide the rest of the housing up into the ceiling while mating the exhaust assembly to the housing.  Reinstalling the motor was a snap.  I make it sound much more difficult than it was.  The bottom line is that if you have a 10.5&#34; by 10.5&#34; opening and no access to the space above the fan other than through the opening, this unit will work.<br /><br />And, the unit is very quiet!  I highly recommend this.
5.0	This is my go to primer. Works great on everything I've ever used it on.
5.0	Takes about 30-45 minutes in my humid climate to become tacky enough to stick together. But it appears to adhere just as well as the regular stuff; maybe even better in the heat. The fumes are awful so be careful. I think it cleans up better also. A must-have around my joint.
5.0	Nice LED light that is always handy and hanging on the wall.  The hanging hook on the end is magnetic and removable.  It only took me 2 weeks to lose it.
5.0	works well,  1/2 the price of sears , can be used longer than six months in most cases, good luck to you!
5.0	For the price, it is everything you could expect or need.
5.0	I had a pretty specific purpose for this and it works awesome; I trust the brand because I have the ceiling mount one for my closet and think its the best thing since sliced bread. I have to turn the lights out from a switch pretty far away from the door when I leave the house so I wanted something closer to the door that wasn't wired. I now have this standing on a shelf next to the door, and when I am ready to leave, I wave my arm in front of it, then go turn off the lights in the other room and can get back to the door without walking into the dining room chairs or tripping over dog toys. I have it angled towards the wall so its not going off and on all day and it works great. It is VERY bright also, I want to get one for the basement for when I have no hands free and need to walk down the stairs without hitting a switch.
5.0	Just as expected! Lovely.
5.0	"My spouse and I bought a home with chrome and polished brass faucets and accessories in the master bathroom but both sinks (dual ones) had cheap, squeaking faucets...obviously contractor grade fixtures of a low quality brand.  I ordered two of these Moen faucets and have been absolutely delighted over these top-quality faucets.  Let's face it, you really cannot get a better brand than Moen!  In the past, I've had superior service from Moen with faucet replacement parts (lifetime warranties) so I knew to buy Moen this time, too.  The Amazon marketplace seller of the faucets I purchased was great, offering excellent customer service (per a question I asked), quick delivery, and a great price.<br /><br />The installation of each faucet went smoothly and quickly.  The instructions are better than most \\""owner's manual\\"" directions, too!  These faucets are very attractive and definitely please both myself and my spouse.  We highly recommend this Moen faucet for both looks and operation, as well as the ease of installation."
5.0	These things are great!  Yeah they don't come w/ any instructions but they're not hard to figure out.  You use the allan wrench provided to adjust the torque and direction that the hinge closes or opens. The bottom part that has the slot open that has pin holes and when you figure out how tight and which direction it needs to go you insert the pin and that keeps the spring wound.  I bought my first pair of these things on here to hang a mini half door that needed to close and stay closed. I used the lowest toque setting and mounted the door and the owner of the shop was ecstatic at how well the door works and closes gently without slamming hard (did add felt circles to the door to keep it from popping too hard cause when it closes it hits a glass display case).  In fact I was so impressed I ordered a few more pairs and use them around the house and at work.  I have a storage room at my office that no one knows how to keep the door shut so it stays locked up so I installed a pair here.  I also installed a pair on my door to my office because I use a space heater to keep my office warmer than what they keep the building set to and everyone comes in and leaves the door open letting all my heat out.  I simply love these things.  And mad props to amazon.com -- Lowes has the same hinges but they're 2x the price and I have to drive to pick them up.  THANK YOU AMAZON!
5.0	Love the look! Easy to install and after the cord hangs for a week or so to straighten out, looks great.
5.0	Love this!  Saves you from making unnecessary trips to check for the mail.  Our mail runs at different times.
5.0	This tape put down a perfect line between the crown and wall.  I have been painting for years and I can't get a better line without this tape, seriously is worth the money.
5.0	This is the greatest stool.  We have a lot of them around the house.
5.0	Great item! Very pleased with purchase.
5.0	It's a tarp. Does what a tarp is supposed to do.  It isn't terribly thick, but not too thin.
5.0	Nice product for a good price.  Reliable, bright, and lightweight light for hiking, biking, handyman, and emergency uses.
5.0	Fits perfectly into my American Standard toilet tank. Ok, it's plastic, but my previous one was also plastic, and lasted 15 years.
5.0	Purchased and installed two of the faucets.  They look and work amazing.  Everything was packaged exceptional.  Have since purchased an additional three for the remaining sinks in my home.  The color is a dark color that does tend to look purple in certain lighting.  I have this over a clear vessel and a color vessel and both look amazing.
5.0	The valve works as described, perfect for the plumbing in my sump for my reef aquarium, it works great, highly recommend.
5.0	I actually got my original light from Lowes on clearance, it has proven to be the best light I ever had. After plugging it in over night seems like it runs forever.  Stuck it on the outside of a bldg we were working at one night so we could see to use our rigid power machine IT LASTED FOR HOURS. Finally ended up dropping it off a scissor lift to the concrete floor some 20+ feet below. Figured yep that's it it's a gonner now. Went down to get it, turned it back on and it STILL WORKED it was cracked inside  so we couldn't adjust the beam anymore BUT my helper was able to engineer a fix, so we're good. He won't give it back so here I am about to get another one. Not near as cheap as the first one, but I'm willing to pay more now that I know what a great tool this is. Perfect for anyone in service work.
5.0	good cleaner for ice machine
5.0	All i can say is &#34;Wow&#34;<br />Just received this water system today and decided to try it out and see what people where raving about. To my surprise everything they say is true! I set the system up. Let the water run for about 30 min even though the instructions say about 15. Grab a cup and filled it up. Drank it and wow same water or even better than what i usually get from the vending machine outside my neighborhood grocery store. And that water is GOOD.  But its to much hassle getting those 5 gallon filled up and bringing them home. The water coming out from the system taste great! I previously bought a gravity water filter system that didn't do a good job. My water from that still tasted like tap water so i returned it and researched again. Came across this system and im so happy i finally found something that really works!<br />Buy it and you wont regret it!
5.0	Good packaging.  Made in the USA.
5.0	Ugh. My water developed an unpleasant 'taste.' I had let my filter slide past the recommended six months replacement time. Ordered a new Puresource WF3CB filter just in time for warm weather. We use our water dispenser frequently as it saves lots of money on bottled water!
5.0	Seems to work well. The water has no taste. It does have a taste from the tap. Easy to install in my Whirlpool refrigerator. The price has been better than I can find in my city at times.
5.0	this is everything you need in an audio survival kit!  this is a great product for a great price! thanks!
5.0	I love this! It's everything and more! I put it up on the wall of my Shepherd kennel..
5.0	"I purchased a new Metro canister vacuum when I could no longer tolerate my old Eureka canister vacuum -- one of the larger, yellow Boss models.  The Eureka's wheels would barely turn, the tube was so thin and cheap that it collapsed in on itself almost immediately, and plumes of dust would blow out of the exhaust.  I paid over $100 more for the Metro than I paid for the Eureka, but got a lot more for my money.  The Metro Vac is beautifully made -- a real tribute to American craftsmanship -- with heavy duty metal parts that fit tightly together, classy retro graphics, a high quality flexible tube tube buttressed with wire so it won't collapse, and an excellent complement of tools.  The \\""European Style\\"" attachment shown in the photo is particularly effective on my wood floors.  Although the Metro Vac is heavier than my old Eureka, it's much easier to maneuver around thanks to the carrying handle and three casters, which spin and pivot freely.  The six stage Hepa filter really works -- there is no odor or detectable dust in the air after vacuuming, as there was with the Eureka.  Best of all, the Metro Vac has superior suction yet makes much less noise than the Eureka, which made a deafening roar.  On the \\""high\\"" setting, the noise level of the Metro vac is at a comfortable level, and probably half the level of the Eureka.  I used to wear earplugs with the Eureka but have no need for them with the Metro vac.  As for drawbacks, I've encountered none thus far.  I can recommend the Metro Vac OV-4BCSF without reservation."
5.0	I feel like a lot of the negative reviews are human error or defective. Read instructions and know what type of paint/sealer this is meant for and you should be fine. I even used it with water based paint by diluting it with water. Common sense, if you too much water, it will run. If don't put enough water, it'll clog, won't spray, or spurts.That's human error, not product fault.  Bottom line: worth the money, read what it's meant for- and order the right sprayer.
5.0	Works extremely well with Lexan. Other Loctite epoxy's did not work, forcing me to start over.  Used to repair and reinforce the plastic seat pockets in a Volvo 240 wagon.  Sets up within 10 minutes but needs 24 hours for rock hard cure.
5.0	Great product., easy to install and works great.
5.0	Great way to monitor who enters your home. Paired with a compatible lock system, you are able to have a text message or email sent to you anytime someone uses the lock to enter your home. Super easy to install as well! Definite must buy!
5.0	It is the best buy/specifications/performance for the money...and makes more space in our house for storage!  The water heater arrived before the indicated time, so that was a bit of an extra benefit.  All-in-all, I'd heartily recommend it to any prospective buyer.
5.0	Excellent product. Simple installation and works well.
5.0	This was ordered to fix broken parts on a whirlpool washing machine. Everything fitted properly which the install process easy.
5.0	had to do some retro fitting but is very nice
5.0	Moen makes the best faucets and their commercial line is in my opinion far superior to other comparable brands. Moen is quality.
5.0	Great product and excellent support!
5.0	I was a little skeptical about buying a wireless solar powered driveway alarm but so far it has worked perfectly. The directions on pairing the transmitter to the base station are not very good but I finally figured it out. Once it was paired it worked well. At first I had it too close to the road, about 20', and large vehicles would trigger it. I moved it further up where it farther from the road but not in direct line of site to the receiver and it works perfectly, even with our guest house blocking the line of sight. It has been in use for a couple of months and worked well. The transmitter is approximately 70' from the receiver and it works well. I have another receiver that I put in a metal building about 300' away from the transmitter and it will not work.
5.0	My sons, 7 & 6, each got one of these for Christmas. They work well, easy to clamp on to their headboards or to the shelf above each of their beds. Also, easy to clip onto back cover of a hard-cover book, even a paperback. The light is bright, and it is easy to adjust the flexible neck. Love that replacing the batteries is easy---takes AAA's. I've been borrowing theirs and will soon purchase one for myself. Also, when I read in bed, the light doesn't seem to disturb my sleeping husband. Very useful and a great price.
5.0	Does exactly what it's supposed to do.  Just be sure to have a short extension cord.  I have a 3 footer that makes using the monitor a lot easier.
5.0	Received within 4 days of ordering.  Easy installation, works great.  Would order from vendor again.
5.0	Don't know if it really is doing anything, but if nothing, it has definitely given a nice ambiance to our room.
5.0	This was very simple to use.  Applied with sponge brush and it came out beautifully with a smooth finish.  Will use again.
5.0	Keeps my couch from sliding every time I sit on it, despite it being on a hardwood floor.  Easy to cut, very effective.
5.0	Great product at a great price!
5.0	there is light out of darkness,  but there was no bulb in the box  ( just kidding)  standard fixture, good value,  fast service
5.0	Excellent lock and looks just as good as the ones you buy at the big retail shops. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking
5.0	After a trip to Japan and seeing there amazing talking toilets with water cleaning I decided that I want one as soon as I made it back to the US, but given the prices and electricity required for them I decided to try one of this first, and I have never gone back.
5.0	Great faucet. Easy to install, works great. Great value for the money.
5.0	This is one set of neat little lights. I hard wired the transformer so it would be in the cabinet and not showing and ran the wire for the lights so it would not show, and also hid the switch, but it is easy to get to because my wife knows where it is. The lights put out an surprisingly amount of light for there size and my wife is tickled pink.
5.0	Programmable with 4 time intervlas: morning, gone, return, sleep.  Easy to install, even easier to use.  I've had no problems with this since I bought it 3 months ago.
5.0	I can't believe how much more my carpets are being cleaned.  Sheesh, if i had known how bad off my last brush roller was, I would have done his a lot sooner.  Thanks for the prompt delivery
5.0	It did a great job catching dusts!<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Manual cut to fit it for AC and PC air vent<br />- Airflow was good<br /><br />Cons:<br />- None so far...
5.0	Fixed the problem and saved money.
5.0	These started the whole oil rubbed bronze theme in my bath! They are very well made and will last forever.
5.0	This tape not only holds well, the seller also offers it at a good price.
5.0	You can never go wrong with these.
5.0	Perfect fit,  Glad I found a reliable source. Will oder again!!
5.0	I was so impressed with the One Way Wolverine grinding kit that I added the skew attachment to my arsenal.
5.0	Easy to put together. They cast enought light to outline a short path..just what I wanted.
5.0	Great for items you use outside including clothing items.  Keeps cleaner and protects from water, reducing the amount of cleaning/washing needed..
5.0	I put these over our island. Perfect.
5.0	Excellent quality. Looks amazing in person.
5.0	My husband had no trouble installing this lock.  It works well.  I like the light that is part of the locking system.<br />Would recommend this!
5.0	It looks nice and is quite stain (water marks) resisted. The pulldown is very useful when cleaning pans/pots/blenders and especially the sink.
5.0	great stuff. bho extraction, lasts a while if you keep it clean. love this stuff
5.0	I'm very impressed with these lights and I love that you can connect them.i got 2 sets I wish I had ordered more they are so nice
5.0	This item was awesome. It was not available where we live unless you buy the entire opening for tons more than this price. Fit perfect and tough as nails
5.0	Perfect product for my need. Description was adequate to determine if it would work.
5.0	Love these. Ended up buying 3. Much better alternative to nightlights, too, as they help purify the air....
5.0	Good price.  The wire has been installed and works well.  We are in the process of installing the tile at the moment and expect the heating wire to preform just as well as the more expensive brands.
5.0	Nice to be able to drink out of glass & throw it into the dishwasher too. Would buy another when needed.
5.0	This lamp is gorgeous, and was a great price, too!<br /><br />It matches my home decor perfectly.  It was easy to put together.
5.0	No Problems, bought for use on my camping trips and to attach 'stuff' to the outside of my gear pouches and bags.
5.0	This fan is working great, and fit well into a small space in a downstairs apartment.
5.0	Good name brand product performs as it it should.  We used it to replace an earlier version that was 10+ yrs old.
5.0	Bought these to use to hang my Christmas lights around the windows at home, and work perfectly. I haven't had a chance to think of the other 9,999 uses these things have, but they stuck to my wall with no trouble at all.
5.0	Matches the faucets - comes with the piece to be tile mounted but can be removed for wall mounted.
5.0	This is great! High water flow!
5.0	We bought one 20 years ago and replced with the same one this year. This is a great product!!!!! you can adjust it easily and the power spray is wonderful.
5.0	The Whirlpool 4396710P 2-Pack filters arrived as expected and are a perfect fit in my Kenmore side-by-side refrigerator.
5.0	I bought a Bell and Howell floor lamp for my wife about ten years ago.  The bulb burned out, finally, a few weeks ago.  I was all for throwing it away, figuring I'd got my money out of it and thinking it would be a crap shoot whether I could get the right replacement bulb.  Well, I got lucky.
5.0	Mine arrived in perfect condition.  It was delivered by ABS Freight to my house in Wisconsin.  The cabinet was in a clean heavy-duty cardboard box which had internal cardboard bracing providing spacing around the inside of the box.  The  bottom was lined with foam padding.  In addition, the box was mounted on top of a wood pallet with strapping holding the box on it.  The carrier used a pallet jack to move the cabinet into my garage, after lowing it from the truck on a Tommy-Gate lift.<br /><br />No damage found anywhere on the cabinet, when I took it out of the box.  The paint finish on the steel looks/feels solid, smooth, and is deep black in color.  Nothing thin about the coating.  No chipping or hazy paint found anywhere.  I would go so far as to call it a car quality type of finish.  It's that good.<br /><br />I'm hoping everyone else has as good an experience as I did with this cabinet.  With all the complaints about poor quality and shipping damage, hopefully Stack-On has been listening (and improving).  Note that the keys are in a hidden flap inside the main box; so don't throw it away too quickly!
5.0	Easy to install, good product, Thanks
5.0	If you are in the market for a new gas water heater, I have three words for you: BUY THIS ONE. Efficiency that is night-and-day compared to older technology, plus you can use this as part of a hydronic forced air system.
5.0	Great lamps... Stylish and simple.  Great for bedroom.  Simple touch and sweet dreams! We purchased 1 5 years ago, and recently moved and it got broken.  I missed it so much I purchased 2 new ones for bedside tables... Just love them.
5.0	Used these 3pack units for years without any issue.
5.0	This is weird, but I love this toilet seat! I've bought about half a dozen toilet seats in my life and never felt one way or another about any of them. This seat was easy to install. It stays put(so I don't feel like one position shift is gonna dunk me). It's easy to keep clean. It's lighter than the others, so when my kid closes it, it doesn't slam and scare the heck out of everyone in the house. I will seek out this seat from this seller next time I need one.
5.0	Love the night light. Perfect for the bathroom and kitchen.
5.0	Was able to replace the lock myself easily!
5.0	This is extremely useful little tool for home.  When a remote control doesn't work, it is the battery?  Just pull out the battery tester and find out.  When you find a battery in a drawer and need to know if it is still good, just pull out the battery tester and find out.  Perfect for AA and AAA.
5.0	after adding an electrical box under the sink, it was just a matter of plugging it in and connecting the hose.<br /><br />the finish matches my new one hole Alfi faucet perfectly and was a great solution for the extra hole I had in my granite counter instead of a cover plate
5.0	Works very well for the price. Was easy to install. The connector to the wall pipe same as sprayer holder is of lower quality than the shower head. Used the unit every day for the past year without issue. Will eventually buy one for second bathroom.
5.0	I finally replaced the ballast in the laundry room. The light bulbs had needed replacement and I left them flickering for a couple of weeks while they only produced a minimal light. Then after replacing the bulbs the lights were bright, but still flickering. I asked my wife if she wanted a different light in the room and she said she didn't want to spend the money. I ordered this ballast and installed it the other day and the light in that room now practically blinds her. My wife is satisfied!
5.0	I bought this for my son (2yrs old) who is obsessed with both Elmo and guitars.  Needless to say, he was so excited when he walked into his room as saw his two favorite things on his wall.  The decal is big and bright and sticks to the wall perfectly.  It is simple, yet detailed and was very easy to put up.  I recommend this to anyone with kids who can't get enough Elmo!!
5.0	Absolutely awesome. I have medium water pressure at my cabin and this works like a charm. Very easy to install with plumbers tape included. The adjustment lever is nice but the regular spray is perfect so I haven't used the different settings much.
5.0	Love the beautiful glow of the lamp!
5.0	Fixed my toilet keak issue. Easy snap on and no more incessant toilet running noises every few seconds. If your tank leaks into the bowl and you own a Kohler, this is a perfect fit.
5.0	This worked for my old pump.
5.0	This cord is about half the price that most places seem to ask for the same product (if they even carry it). The stranded wire is easy to work with and makes the cord quite flexible.
5.0	Beautiful. I love them. Made my daughters dresser look princess perfect.
5.0	Works exactly as described and expected.
5.0	Works well and is the same type of remote I had for the Air Conditioner. I had to replace it due to batteries damaging it.
5.0	I bought this for my grandaughter who is creating a boho style room and received rave reviews from her on the colors and style. Such a pretty light....... I want one too!
5.0	I needed a control that did not make the fan hum.<br /><br />This capacitor type control did the trick.<br /><br />Triac type controls cause a hum.
5.0	I do a lot of painting and jewelry stuff- this light is great!  Bright almost natural light.  Hopefully the ott- lite bulb that came with it will last a bit. Their bulbs are expensive -- but worth it.
5.0	I recently bought the 6&#34; Cree TW series retrofit kits for the recessed lights in a renovated upstairs bedroom.  Before doing so, I bought one of just about every type of 6&#34; LED retrofit kit available to try them all out.  After being remarkably pleased by an EcoSmart kit (OEMed by Cree), I bought several of their next model up (NOT made by Cree).  Installed them... and they buzzed.  Apparently that's a common problem with the higher model EcoSmart.  Returned them, bought the Cree TW's, and absolutely love them.<br /><br />So, when it came time to retrofit twelve 4&#34; Halo recessed fixtures elsewhere in my house with LEDs, my first purchase was a Cree TW to test.  I installed it this evening and am extremely pleased.  With a 11.5W LED, this thing puts out about as much light as the 6&#34; units, but from a smaller surface.  As a result, it looks much brighter if you look directly at it (don't do that).  The resulting light is very clear and crisp, and the 2700K color temperature is PERFECT if you are looking for a soft, incandescent-like white.  I bought some 3000K kits from other manufacturers and found the light to be quite harsh.  These are bright, but not harsh.  I'll be ordering eleven more to finish my retrofit next week.  Replacing 600W of lighting with 138W that probably won't burn out for as long as I own my house (and probably years thereafter) is a pretty tough deal to beat.  It's worth noting that the Amazon price is about $5 per unit cheaper than Home Depot.
5.0	The sign is much more vibrant than the displayed pictures can show you. I can tell that there is some seriously good craftsmanship. It was everything I wanted it to be, and it fit the particular space even better than I thought it would. 5 stars.
5.0	Works perfectly and looks great! Five stars! I had a really hard time getting the old neck out, like someone had actually over-tightened it, but after install so far so good. If your current shower-head/arm hits you below the shoulders, a must buy!
5.0	absolutly great make light work of moving chest of draws,easy to fit,highly recommend them.you will be glad you have bought them like i am.
5.0	I love this product very much and so far it has not broke on me as I read on peoples review. I do recommend it specially because of its slow close benefit.
5.0	Adorable light! Very bright with a great design.
5.0	This fit perfectly into our sink and works fantastic. The color matched our faucet and other decor so well that you'd never know we bought them separately.
5.0	Great wall decal for any baby room. Mickey is really very big and has good quality of material. It took only 10 minutes to adjust sticker to wall.
5.0	I purchased the older Clearwave model in Dec of 2011.  I paid more for it than this newer model.<br /><br />I recommend the Clearwave to friends and, family.  It does what is claims.<br /><br />It does not provide the same type of softness that comes with a &#34;salt&#34; water softener.  That is ok.  It does significantly reduce hard water stains/build-up.  Too, no salt to buy.  No water softener repair bill or, rent bill depending on if you own or lease your water softener.<br />I am a happy customer and, when this one needs replacing I will be ordering another.
5.0	Thought I ordered it as Prime but the order reads DROK and shipped by Hong Mu Sen according to the mailer. Order placed Jan 14 and arrived Jan 23.<br /><br />I only put it on on a car battery for a second or two to make sure it worked. Lovely bright green display. Reading seemed accurate.
5.0	Really an excellent value. We've had electric bidets for  over a decade in our homes and can't imagine life without them. Kinda like remote entry on a car. Once you have it, you'll never go back. I've even bought them as gifts for friends. They were reluctant at first, but quickly came around to my way of thinking. Why more American's don't have these is a mystery to me.<br /><br />This was purchased to replace a bidet that gave up the ghost. That one cost over $600 fifteen years ago. This one does as good a job at fully 1/3 of the price. The only thing I don't care for, is the attached control panel. Our other bidets all have a remote control.
5.0	We installed this piece in our newly remodeled master bathroom and it looks absolutely stunning! We get so many compliments on it! It's modern and unique design makes it stand out as a great art piece too!
5.0	This opener works really well and has a great range. For my application, three buttons is maybe overkill (may not be the same case for you). In any event, being able to program one of the buttons to turn on/off the light is always helpful.  Make sure you buy the correct model for your garage door. This one works with the Orange/Amber led in the back of your opener.
5.0	Well, they are locks and are easy to use. Use all 4 of them for a rifle case when traveling by airline. Not sure what else to say besides the keys go in easy, they turn easy and I'm pleased with them.
5.0	Great bulb, definitely dimmable. I'm using this on a dimmable outdoor motion fixture. If you're wondering whether to get cool or warm, I bought both. The cool bulb is a bright white, sort of light a fluorescent. It would be suitable for a garage. The warm light throws off plenty of light but is a more pleasant color, better for general indoor and outdoor fixtures. If you're not sure, I'd say choose the warm light color for most situations.
5.0	This Leach & Drain cleaner is working wonders in the Septic tank that was put in 53 years ago this year.
5.0	very sturdy for it's size. It arrived very fast
5.0	We love these unique modern lamps.  They are sleek and take up little table space but provide plenty of light.  They look awesome with our glass and chrome end tables.
5.0	We've only had these a few days but so far are working beautifully and we are planning on purchasing another set for another area of our home.  My husband was very impressed with how well made they are.  Installed easily and were easy to adjust.  The first night we had traffic from our side street setting them off but a small piece of the lens cover provided corrected that problem.  Very happy with our purchase.
5.0	I saw reviews on these master locks but, decided to take my chance on them anyways because one person's experience or misfortune isn't the same for everyone and they were cute. What do you know I was able to start my trip and end my trip and never had to worry about the lock on my suitcase. I even let my sister borrow the extra one because I got the set of two and everything went smooth with our luggage. I would encourage any one to take a chance on them.
5.0	"These stoppers were just what I wanted.  They are a nice white, about 5/8\\"" deep with a larger ring than pictured. Perfect."
5.0	Bought for another brand of sink.  The fit is not perfect, but it works.  The movable protectors allow me to make it fit better.
5.0	Just as listed and work great so far.  If things chamge after more times using them I will report back, otherwise I say get them if you need them.
5.0	Absolutely nothing beats Command strips and system at what they do.
5.0	We bought these for under counter accent lights in our kitchen.  Very easy to install and we love them!
5.0	Just as ordered. Arrived quickly and worked great!!!
5.0	They fit my drawers fine.  It was exactly what I wanted. Thank, you, Bev
5.0	Beautiful door. I installed it myself with a neighbors help in about three hours
5.0	I recently had to replace my iron and did not realize how short the cords are on newer model irons. This extra 6' cable is specifically for heat appliances providing the higher amps necessary. It is extremely well made and adds just enough extra length to my 7' iron cord. Excellent quality.
5.0	LED Light is bright, automatic on and off works flawlessly, so far works as a great light inside my safe. Good styling.
5.0	If you need these, they work great.
5.0	Super vendor.  Super product.  Super easy to install and adjust (I'm a mechanic by trade.)  Works great.  My door only required one of the hinges since it was an easy closer.  Can be adjusted to close and latch without slamming the door.<br />I'd recommend to anyone who is mechanically inclined.  If you're not mechanically inclined, you may have some difficulty.
5.0	These are easy to install.  I did have to change the base on the current ones but this is easy-2 screws.  I used these to replace same detectors that reached end of life.
5.0	Love these things and they seem to be working so far.  We have tried many different items to stop leaves from clogging up the gutters.  Looks like these are going to be a winner.  Very pleased as of this writing.  Leaves just land on top and are blown away.
5.0	We were looking for a moderately priced, but very nice faucet to put in our apartment. It replaced a terrible one that the unit came with. It fits the bill perfectly and makes a huge improvement in our bathroom!!
5.0	ZOMG THE WATER IS SO GOOD YALL
5.0	perfect fit, works great
5.0	I ordered these to replace bulbs that had burned out in an outdoor landscape fixture.  I'm very pleased with them.  I'm a stickler for the color temperature of my bulbs matching, and I'm happy to report that these matched the old 20w halogen bulbs perfectly.  The brightness/intensity was also right on.  Essentially they're indistinguishable from the halogen lights that are still in place, which is exactly what I wanted as I plan to replace them over time, as they burn out.  Yes, they're pricey, but to me it's worth to not have to constantly change bulbs.  They'll also consume a lot less energy over time.
5.0	Even though I didn't need 25 of these, I couldn't pass up the great price.  Used them to replace brass hinges when we did a kitchen remodel.  They look very nice and function well.
5.0	Nice product, it worked very well.
5.0	These filters are a great product and keep our drinking water very clear and pure.  They are very easy to install with great instructions.
5.0	Awesome auger for the limestone I needed to bore through for my gate posts.  I tried the regular rock augers with the pointed carbide teeth for this, but they need more down pressure than I can achieve with my little machine, apparently.  The step pattern of the teeth on this one is a good design that works.  This auger has heavy flighting with a hardened edge.  It turned the limestone into powder in minutes.<br /><br />I wish Drilling World would sell one here in the 4 inch size, because I could really use that one too for some smaller holes that I need to bore. (Hint, hint.)
5.0	This cord worked out perfect for us.
5.0	This is a beautiful product.  The whole assemble is beautifully engineered.  However it works opposite what you would expect for hot to cold  But we are now use to it and love the temperature controls and no we did not reverse the input lines as we called the company to confirm
5.0	Works fine, fits fine, lasts as long, and tastes as good.  Really, it's plastic and charcoal. I'll bet if you cut it open it would be identical to the Samsung. Even the generic is overpriced for what you get.
5.0	We replaced our old one.  Was rated better than the other vent.  It's painted and installed.  Expect a long life.
5.0	It works better than the door knob/lock set that came with our Pella door.  I did have a question and their customer service was great.  What more can you ask for than a great product and great customer service?
5.0	These two filters are half or less of the cost of one of the Kenmore water filters.  I installed it with no problem in my Kenmore refrigerator.  Water tastes great and I saved a lot.  Good product.
5.0	Had an Oder for 3 weeks smelled like rubber
5.0	Very easy install. Had installed in 15 minutes.
5.0	Bought this to hang a bird cage. Perfect color, very sturdy.
5.0	I purchased the XL size and they fit my size 14 wide shoes very nicely. These shoe covers are easy to put on and take off and they have an adequate wear life. I will definitely purchase them again.
5.0	Very quick delivery!  Easy install.  Price was great!  Would order again.
5.0	This was exactly the part that I needed and it was easy to install. Thank you for the quick shipping.
5.0	The Aquasana AQ-4100 Delux Shower Water Filter System does what it's advertised to do. It was easy to install,  and after using, hair and skin feel softer & smoother. It makes sense to have replacement filters sent  to the house automatically (which we have done) to keep the filter working at its best.
5.0	Great light, really bright - lights up both walkways clearly (about 50 ft. each direction!).
5.0	Operates as smoothly as you would expect from the best made product you every used. It came recommended by my cousin the plumber of over 40 years and I see why.
5.0	Prompt delivery, item just as described. Works perfectly for a great price.  Very satisfied.
5.0	My son loved the ben 10 peel and stick decal, it was so easy to put up and looks fab.  All his friends think it is so cool.  What we wish we could buy now is a Ben 10 Car decal to finsh off his room.  Hoping you get thig product.  I have added green pillow case covers to his bed, ben 10 decal on the wall and he feels so cool.  Please get a ben 10 car decal to sell.
5.0	Very nice, easy to install!
5.0	When I tried these little plastic miracle workers!  I wish we had bought them ages ago. A snap yo put together literally. Then on you go to remove scores of hair. Or whatever measurement we give to hair. I HIGHLY recommend the FLEXISNAKE DRAIN WEASEL 3 PACK REFILL as I went through the 2 that were included to make sure my troublesome tub was cleaned of all miles of hair. I wish I took a picture it was that AMAZING!<br /><br />You may choose yo listen to Weird Al's Weasel Stomping Day as you clran as it will certainly brighten your time doing this grossiest of honey do's. Weasel Stomping Day is celebrated world wide on June 31st as I'm sure the makers of this Weasel product mrant to alert you. But no, really it's an awesome product.
5.0	This product covers wood extremely well. Was used to paint an unfinished wood tray after I stained it, excellent for distressing look. But smell is strong so beware. I would buy again.
5.0	Does everything it says. Works very well and installation was easy.
5.0	excellent price and service. Thank you so much. Very much pleased.
5.0	This one is sooooo cute. I love all of these night lights (I have 8), but this one is extra pretty. It is brighter than most of them, with the red back. The quality is excellent. I just love it!Ver
5.0	Everything was easy to set up and install. The three day test period worked great for learning how the alarms worked. I am completely satisfied with<br />the system.
5.0	It goes great with our bamboo-esque themed sun room.  Unlike most lamps that fade into the background of the décor this one actually catches your eye over and over.  I find myself just staring at it at times.<br /><br />Mine was received in perfect condition and considering as of the time of this review only person had a negative experience I think you can chalk it up to the fact that no company is perfect.
5.0	I bought this for my new house and I totally love it. It looks great above my diningroom table. It was almost all assembled when it arrived and I just had to put a few things together on it. I've received a lot of compliments on this.
5.0	This tub-spout is beautifully styled and looks great.<br /><br />Unlike some of the other items in the HG portfolio, this unit is solid metal and heavy.  It does have a rubbery filter on the water outlet (like the faucets and showerheads) which is supposed to make it easy to brush away lime deposits.  I have found that my HG showerhead with similar easy-clean spray heads has held up well after 5 years of continuous use.
5.0	Very well made, good quality, the hose is very flexible and yet &#34;metal&#34; (or at least looks like it) without being heavy.  There are a good variety of water stream settings.  I bought this for the guest bathroom but I like it so much I'm getting one for my bathroom too!  It's also super handy for washing the dogs.
5.0	These came and look to be great products, I'm going to use for my,upcoming vacation. They are smaller than you might think but bright and priced well.
5.0	Well, its a filter, and I think it is filtering the air as I am here now typing this review, I can obviously still breathe and I didn't lose any fingers when installing it.
5.0	This product is thicker and prevents weed or plant growth from coming through.  What I'd heard, and have since tried, is putting the sheeting over plant growth, and letting the lack of light and heat die-back the growth instead of digging out the plant life.  It works!  Personally, I'm very happy with this product...it's easy to cut to size, and there's a goodly length of it for the price.
5.0	I got in the faucet and it was very beautiful and worked well with my vessel sink. Home Plumbing had the best price and was easy to work with.
5.0	I got this product today and install right a way, amazing very easy to install and affordable, i got the best price and this is it, mosquito free , i love this because it is magnetic so easy to come and go for my door.Recommended to all.
5.0	Great post covers. Add a lot of class to a basic post
5.0	We bought these to go in our Shasta Phoenix 2014 5th wheel RV that we live in full time.  These we installed in the ceiling mounted light fixtures where there are two opposing bulbs with a switch in the middle.<br /><br />No issues with these LED's except that the base is fairly short.  Due to the wide nature of the lights, they won't fit in certain candelabra style fixtures because the base gets in the way.<br /><br />The &#34;Warm White&#34; light color is so perfect that we can't tell the difference between these and the incandescent lights.<br />The amount of light is the same as well.  We had to memorize which fixtures we put them in because we couldn't tell after they were installed.<br /><br />Quite honestly, we only remember they are LED when we leave the RV and want to leave some lights on.<br /><br />We've had zero issues with them.<br /><br />*UPDATE* 8/28/15:  No issues with these lights.  Everything works same as it did before.  Awesome product and I'll be buying many more of this in the future!
5.0	Really nice, good quality.  Look impressive on the brick pillars at the driveway entrance.<br />They were easy to assemble.<br /><br />The only complaint is I wish you could use lower v light bulbs it takes a lot light of bulbs, they are very bright which is nice but use a lot of electricity (this is more of an observation and caution to anyone who is concerned about too much power use or high electric bills)
5.0	I purchased 2 of these storage caddies for both of my showers off of Amazon (I searched all my local stores, and they didn't carry these).  I read the reviews before I purchased it and was pleased to see all the positive feedback on this shower caddy.  I think it's the perfect size shower caddy.  Mine also came with an extra hook for holding your washcloth, or body wash poof. Instalation was easy.  You need to let the tape set a day before installing the caddy to it. I've owned this now for about a month and haven't had any problems with it.  I highly recommend this!!!!<br /><br />UPDATE: I have now had these up for 2 YEARS & They are still holding on strong! :) I highly recommend these shower caddies for extra storage room in your shower! GREAT BUY! Don't waste your money on the suction cup versions!
5.0	"This brush I am using to refinish a large Dresser and Mirror set. Is does great at getting inside of the \\""detailed\\"" areas of the piece.  I tried 2 other similar brushes and a \\""foam\\"" brush but this worked better and faster.  Make SURE you wash it with warm soapy water when finished, dry it completely, and it should last a long time.  Also the brush is well made and I have not noticed any of the bristles falling out.  It is a GREAT brush for the price.  I highly recommend it for detailed, intricate work."
5.0	I used this in Warhammer 40k space marines to allow their arms to be swapped out.  They are just the right size for this purpose, and the models look great.  The magnets are just strong enough to hold arms on, but the magnets do not pull out when super-glued into drilled bores in the models.  Shipping was fast and packaging is great.
5.0	Great quality & price.
5.0	quick install , works great.
5.0	Works great!<br />Needed a new light on my bed for night reading.Clips on easily and I can rotate the head to shine where needed.Very pleased.
5.0	The quality and the tough built was beyond my expectation. Well worth for the money, and bought again for different application.
5.0	Arrived on time and worked great
5.0	"I am entirely pleased with this fixture! It's attractive and bright.<br /><br />My new house is a post-war cape and the ceilings are low, constraining the light fixtures I can reasonably consider. I noticed that pure flush-mounts tend to have a limit of 60-watt bulbs, presumably to manage the heat, so I went with a semi-flush because I want to have brighter bulbs in there. (Mine is over the dining room table, and I work there on occasion, so I need good light.)<br /><br />I have regular incandescent bulbs in mine, 75watts, and I have it on an dimmer switch, and yes, often have it dimmed.<br /><br />Assembly was pretty easy. I did hire an electrician to attach it to the ceiling in part because there was not already a fixture there. But I \\""assembled\\"" the lamp (in quotes because that means putting in the glass and using a few thumb screws to attach the base to the larger lamp.<br /><br />I am very happy with this fixture and will likely get more in the line (maybe even some regular flush mounts) for adjoining rooms."
5.0	This is the second time I've ordered these. Our water is not the best and when you fill up a glass (without the filter) it's full of white lime flakes. As soon as the new filter is in place the water is perfectly clear.<br /><br />Pushing it into place is easy too -- just push up into the spot and it's working.
5.0	This stuff is the best.  Thanks for shipping so quickly.
5.0	Item was identical to the ice maker the manufacturer installed in our refrigerator bought in 2006. There were 4 screws to take out and the icemaker just lifted right out. Reinstalled the existing power cord onto the new ice maker, since it fit and bam...put it back into the freezer. Total time to install less than 10 minutes. Be aware that the icemaker needs to cool down before the timer will function properly. Took ours a little over an hour and then it was good to go.
5.0	Great extender, worked perfectly with the Levolor 13288 Heavy Duty Curtain Rod.
5.0	This LED Strip is awesome! Well worth the money. The tape it comes with is not the best so I used some double sided tape to secure the position. Overall my purchase is well worth the money. I am so glad that I got it for the coming Christmas. My front door looks beautiful now.
5.0	Great Product  Thanks
5.0	Great Switch - - Not at all complicated to install or to set the on/off times that I want.  So far, it has held all of my settings better than the more complicated switches that require &#34;programming&#34;
5.0	What can be said that others haven't said about this? This lamp is awesome, easy to set up, gives a warm, glowing light that makes any space more relaxing.<br />But I got to warn others about some potential dangers on this <br />Be sure NOT to set this lamp anywhere near you leave delicate electronic devices, like smartphones or tablets. I had this lamp set over a cabinet on my home's entry hallway. Same place I leave the charger cables to recharge our multiple Apple devices.<br />Well, long story short, the tip of two lightning cables came in contact with the lamp's salt and became corroded, and thus, useless.<br />To make matter worse, I was unaware of this, and connected the cable on my iPhone several times until I noticed the charging became erratic, suddenly stopped charging at all, and ruined my iPhone's lighning port.<br />Needless to say, after ruining 2 $25 cables and paying $100 to have my iPhone fixed, I moved the cables somewhere else. :(
5.0	Nice quality of light, no glare and powerful. Used in range hood.
5.0	Well made and sturdy.
5.0	These are high quality steel blades made by the manufacturer just to fit the Hitachi planer. I have about four sets on hand with my planer. I like to have extra's in case they get dull you can quickly change to a new set. Plus, because they are steel they are easily resharpened at tool sharpening shops or if you have the right tools you can do it yourself!!! GREAT PRODUCT!!
5.0	Exactly like it was advertised.  Works great, will order another one.
5.0	This is the most perfect lamp ever! Thank you. We recieved the lamp three days later after we had placed the order. It goes perfectly with our glass top Dragon end table. A perfect match.We just love the touch to turn it on, thank you again and we will order again someday. Alexis White
5.0	Quick!  Great communication!  Super quick shipping!  Even the screws are made to match the picture!  We have a personalized Pug and Chihuahua switchplate and my kids LOVE them!  It makes their room a little more fun!
5.0	Bought this for my makeup vanity. Perfect brightness. Use it daily with no complaints.
5.0	I purchases these shades for my yoga studio, I was looking for a decorative but inexpensive way of covering the large windows I have in my studio.  Delivery was quick and the shades were very easy to put up.  It's a good product at a reasonable price.
5.0	Saved a ton of money!
5.0	I'm already a customer of the Brondell Swash. Yet I wanted a less expensive product to put in the guest bathroom & the bathroom near the kitchen. The BreezaWarm works perfectly! Our guests love the heated seat. and of course they also love how the scent mechanism just makes all things smell good :)
5.0	The filter is small compared with most other systems; has a sturdy, metal fixture and pull-knob activator; filters quickly with plenty pressure; and of course it has the great Culligan taste!
5.0	Great kit, just what I didn't for a large sliding window. Easy to install.
5.0	I love it! It is exactly what I was looking for, well made  quality mesh its great for my animals going in an out.<br />I will definitely buy another for my downstairs door.
5.0	Ta da. Push the button and the garage door opens. What more can I say
5.0	I found this product six months ago while searching for a safe tank drop-in that would not damage my toilet.  I got much more than I bargained for!  For about $6.00 per toilet per three months, these cartridges keep my toilets sparkling clean.  When they start to wear out I clean the bowl once, replace the cartridge, and voila I'm good for another three months.  Awesome!  Just make sure you get the BLEACH one NOT the blue one.  The blue ones don't work as well.  For a girl who hates cleaning toilets this is the miracle of a lifetime.  Get it!
5.0	Good value, so easy to use, really met my expectations !
5.0	We recently ordered these lights to put around our water feature and was happy how quickly they arrived.  We love how the lights change colors and the build quality was better than expected(pretty bright too).  For the price, you cannot get better quality made product,<br />We contacted the seller about an issue, and Metro Fulfillment House quickly replied back and resolved the issue for us.  It was my best customer service experience to date.  I would gladly recommend these lights for anyone looking for color changing path lights to add to their residence.
5.0	It's a fun novelty item, LED lights work great.  I did notice the high-pitched wine/sound other reviewers have mentioned after about a month of use, but it's actually barely noticeable and only really is heard when the showerhead is on the highest/hardest pressure setting AND having removed the internal ring and screen.  So simply put, unless you have to have maximum water pressure to the point of water pounding your skin from this showerhead the sound thing isn't an issue.  In addition, if you want the LED's to continue functioning and the showerhead to operate good as new in perpetuity all you have to do is some basic maintenance about every three months.  Ie; simply put the showerhead in some CLR for about 30 minutes to clear out hard water/gunk buildup and your fine.
5.0	This was well worth the money.  I bought this to go in my foyer, and I think it looks real good!  It gives off a nice light and fits perfectly in my small foyer.  I'm thinking of buying another for one of my hallways.
5.0	Very quiet and efficient.<br />The unit installed easily and warms up a 12x16 mud room entryway very nicely.  It is a quality piece (again) of German engineering
5.0	I have used cheap bulbs for my metal halide fixture for years with no problems at all but my only complaint is the color is never 20k, more like 12 k with an ugly green tint so they require heavy atinic supplements.....I gave these bulbs a chance saying to myself&#34; these cant be any worse looking then any other of the cheap brands&#34; boy was i wrong, these bulbs are outstanding and provide a true 20k look with a crisp blue look with a hint of white to balance it out....I will not order any other bulbs as long as they keep making these, big props to Odessea for these quality bulbs that will stand up to any of the expensive brands anyday
5.0	Well made, simple, and exactly what I was looking for.  This appears as if it'll last a lifetime.
5.0	Beautiful addition to our room. Fast shipping. Great service. Thank you!
5.0	Moen quality and Amazon.com price.  The old set was severely stained by someone trying to clean the chrome with harsh chemicals. I just had to replace the shower trim as I was extremely bothered by the stains. I had the Moen Chateau set with the teardrop shaped plastic shower handle which looks very 1980s.  This replacement set has a much more appealing and classic polished chrome look.  The only part not included is the chrome handle stop.  I just polished my old one and reinstalled it as the stop did not appear stained.  I am very please with the product and Amazon's Prime shipping.
5.0	Glad that I found this item, I've been looking for it for a while and almost giving up on my steamvac.  After I received the product, it was easy to replace the old one.
5.0	a great value for so many tasks! Easy to use, plenty of air or heat or both and enough light to see fine by alone. I had one ruined by filthy tenants and by buying this unit here it was less than buying just the defective heater- I just popped out the modular components and replaced all  without any ceiling or plaster work as the housing was identical- a nice quality addition. Quiet, good mist clearing, and toasty- what more could you ask? Add free shipping from Amazon and sold American!
5.0	Been using these for over a year and just bought some more for our other outdoor fixtures. Not as bright as a halogen obviously, but uses a lot less energy and holds up to freezing and scorching temps better than any post light I have tried in the last 10 years. The plastic lens/cover diffuses the light nicely. This bulb's color temp is the closest to an incandescent or halogen of any CFL I have owned.
5.0	Easy to install and works great!
5.0	These worked as expected, fit the sockets and produce beautiful &#34;White&#34; light, just as I was wanting to see. I used these to replace a few older LED lamps and they provide even more light than before. Only issue, of no fault of the manufacturer. I was hoping to use these on my range hood, they are about .125&#34; to taller than the halogen bulbs and do not fit in the space allowed. If anyone knows of a slightly shorter bulb than this model, please let me know, thanks!!
5.0	I bought this remote hoping it would out perform the older square style multi-code remote. I get better range now. I don't have to get out of the car to &#34;open&#34; the gate. That almost defeated the purpose of owning one. I'm going to need a few more to upgrade the remaining remotes!
5.0	Nice quality! Great price!
5.0	I bought these to make it safer for my wife using the shower while she is recovering from knee replacement surgery.  In total I purchased four of the grips.<br />These grips have been in the shower now for a little over a month and are still holding strong. When placing them, make sure that you are fully on the tile and not on any grout lines (as the suction won't hold if you are). Fortunately, there is some give in the suction cups themselves and once placed and before you seal the suction by closing the tabs, you can move the rubber suction cup slightly by hand to make sure it's not over a grout line.<br /><br />As I said, they have been holding for over a month and as sturdy as when I first placed them (although I do test them prior to my wife using the shower just to be sure).
5.0	Got the stuff quickly and saved about 40% over local prices  Only issue was the clip to hold it all together...very tight and needed a hammer to eventually get it in place.
5.0	very bright! great color!
5.0	Takes a minute to warm up but very bright!
5.0	Thanks to the other reviewer, I put this in the boiling water for about 5 minutes and lay it flat on the kitchen floor.  I ran two 16 gauge speaker wires and one coax cable through them.  It is tight but lay flat on the floor.  I don't even need to use the double sided tape that came with it.
5.0	Great showerhead. Our guests love it! It also has a long cord so it works great to give the dog a bath. Highly recommend.
5.0	Bought this for my office that sits on the highway.  I am able to access the mail from the back so I don't have to stand in the busy road.<br />Very nice looking and a good quality.  I have received many compliments.
5.0	good looking nice and big, flushes well
5.0	It's the perfect desk lamp!
5.0	It's Gorilla Glue... it works!
5.0	They worked great in installing cement board siding. It took a few pieces of siding to get into the flow, but once your started it became easy.<br />One person can put up the cement board panels. I was using the 7 inch panels.
5.0	This was true to form... super easy to use and dried in a very short time. Excellent for filling nail holes and small problems with drywall.  Outstanding product.
5.0	Not sure how to review a standard water filter. It's a plug and play. Store sent it quick, no issues from the business side of things.
5.0	This is our first replacement filter for our in-sink device and have been very happy with the 9-12 months of use that we got out of it. Water flow is great and the cost as compared to using the filter that is in our fridge will save us hundreds of dollars with switching to this less expensive system.
5.0	We bought this seat for our new Kohler toilet that came with a cheap seat. I love it. My three year old lifts and closes the seat by herself. And I dont need to worry about hands getting slammed. This is a worthwhile purchase.
5.0	I was looking for a 4 inch center set bathroom faucet where the handles and faucet sat right on my countertop. This faucet looks very stylish in my powder room. Nice quality, very pleased with purchase.
5.0	Good Price/ nice looking lights.
5.0	I don't know about racing decal, I used mine for my new Alienware Aurora PC. Super easy to apply and durable. Color and cut is spot on decepticon. Uploaded pic.
5.0	it's chunky, elegant - and exactly what we wanted for our front door.  The Kwikset died that we had.  Lowe's no longer carries them, so we couldn't even do the 'lifetime guarantee' thing.  Love this one.
5.0	I don't know why people are complaining about this bulb!  I got them today - the light is clean light - cheap to run - and of great quality!  I wish [...] had more!  I will be checking Samsclub for more of them - they are awesome!
5.0	Package arrived several days before expected which made me very happy. Easy installation, and works amazingly.
5.0	These look terrific lining my walk and shine much brighter than the previous solar lights I've owned. A good value for the money, thinking about buying more.
5.0	very well made, shiny cover. Looks great in  my bathroom.
5.0	This has been a wonderful investment for me.  I know longer have intestinal issues after drinking water.  I only drink filtered water...what a difference.
5.0	For those with the older Universal SS-2795, this fits without having to replace the wiring or mount.  Fixes the annoying late night beeping issues!  Recommended.
5.0	When the bulbs in my over the range microwave stopped working, I went to Lowes to find replacements. The employee in the appliance department said that they don't carry those bulbs and that I would have to order from the manufacturer. I think not! A quick search on Amazon and I found these. Perfect! They arrived quickly and well packaged. I installed them and there is light!! Great, brilliant, and bright on low and high. Recommended!
5.0	Order filled quickly. Was exactly what I ordered and was installed with ease.
5.0	Arrived on time and packaged well. I recently installed and it operates great!
5.0	I use this for holding stuff on the back of my Surly rack. It keeps things secure and can be adjusted to accommodate awkward loads fairly easily. I haven't seen anything else on the market that serves the same function or is offered at this good of a price.
5.0	wonderful, great, wonderful!!! looks awesome , easy to put on.
5.0	Worked as advertised.  Glad the outside doorbell button is waterproof.  Great product for the price.
5.0	I love they look great on our bar.. Ready to buy a second set.
5.0	Makes transforming plank doors into doors ready to hang super easy, I cant believe I ever did this by hand.
5.0	Excellent quality outstanding service.<br /><br />Thank U
5.0	"First time user of this type of masking material.  I used this with a hand-masker 3000 bought from Lowes (though they don't carry the masking film, thus I had to purchase it online.)      Very easy to use with the hand masker; one must also have an additional role of tape for sealing the sides and bottom of windows/doors.  There is a good tutorial on youtube by \\""Idahopainters\\"" on how to use the hand masker & masking film.  They also have some excellent tutorials on spraying, and other use of painting equipment.    I received this order very quickly, and am very satisfied."
5.0	we bought several of them and I like the style and color. They seem to be well made! My husband put them up in minutes.
5.0	Just what I needed with very low price.<br />I was a little hard to cross reference some part numbers to get the right element but with a little work on my behalf it all worked out.
5.0	fantastic, easy in, easy hook up, great light for 3W
5.0	I live in a very dangerous village in Guatemala so I bought the Rex Plus to deter break-ins.  It's wonderful.  Scares the crap out of the neighborhood cats that come over the fence.  I put it in an inner courtyard where someone could get into and it works wonders.  I also use it when I'm home alone just to warn me if someone happens to come over the fence.  We've named him OSO (which means bear in Spanish).  I highly recommend it.
5.0	There was a very simple digital thermostat with no programming features in my townhome when I purchased it. I wanted something that would turn on the heat in the morning before I woke. After reading the reviews on this and other units here at Amazon, I decided on this thermostat. Installation was fast and simple. Programming was even simpler. There's a built-in Energy Star compliant program but I chose to customize. It was a snap. In just a few minutes it was running. It has a large and attractive touchscreen, a 15-second backlight for use in the dark, and an streamlined case that will fit in nicely in almost any home. The Amazon price is much lower than retail stores. I highly recommend this unit to do-it-yourselfers of any skill level.
5.0	I recently ordered two of these 24-inch grab bars (and one 16-inch). One of the larger ones was for my shower; the other two, for my husband's. He recently had hip replacement surgery and we needed to make the house safe for him. I had resisted the bars before because I didn't want ugly chrome bars in newly remodeled showers with brushed nickel fixtures. These are perfect for our needs and are working well for us.
5.0	I actually stumbled on to the Bidet Toilet Seat Attachments. I didn't know they existed. When I researched the products available I found the Luxe Bidet Neo 180 and read the reviews and decided to order one. It was to be a surprise for my husband who is a personal hygiene fanatic...taking about three showers a day. When the bidet arrived he grudgingly installed it. Within a few days he informed me, &#34;You've bought me lots of things but this is the best thing you've ever given me!&#34;. He is quick to recomment it to friends and family members. In fact, we have a total of three bathrooms and we ordered a Luxe Bidet for each one. I would highly recommend this product!
5.0	These work great and are a much better price than the local big box stores.
5.0	I use this foam tape to seal the window AC unit in my bedroom and it works like a charm. I also use the tape to prop up the AC unit on the sill, as the front has a lip that prevents the unit from laying flat. The tape fixes that problem as well. For the price, you get a great product.
5.0	"this is an amazing product.  it will protect almost any surface, without risk of damaging it. I used it to shine-up a table that I thought I would need to sand and refinish.  However, a few layers of this stuff (and hours of hard rubbing and buffing) eliminated the need to do a full refinish.  I also used it on some antique tools that belonged to my grandfather after I removed the rust.  Its just as effective as a layer of oil, but without the mess (I'm using the old tools for display rather than work).<br /><br />this is the first time i bought it from this site, i usually buy it elsewhere.  i bought it because it was amazingly cheap compared to other sites.  however, I didn't notice that it was such a tiny jar!  the price is actually in line with other sites, in terms of the \\""per ounce\\"" price"
5.0	I love it as a whole, how ever some of the apps are a problem. One of them called hue firework was cool but no way to shut it off that I can find. You can switch too a different app but one second later the fire works starts again. The only way I could get control back, was to shut off and unplug the bridge. I E-mailed Phillips with all my problems looking for help. and got a reply that said call them. Sorry I work during the hours they pickup the phone, So don't expect any help which is hard to believe when you pay so much. The sci-fi app works great with 12 monkeys. Wish something like that would work with blue-ray movies.
5.0	Good job and very affordable.
5.0	As advertised. Delivered quickly. Recommended replacement for this &#34;non US&#34; size light. Fits as specified and does the job.<br /><br />Good deal.
5.0	I purchased both this and the Schlage Link starter package that works with it.  Everything works exactly as expected.  We have a vacation rental property in Mexico.  I can view the temperature online, and I can change the temperature setting online.  Plus I get an email when someone adjusts the temperature, so I can monitor if someone is using way to much AC.  I really feel confident leaving our property for 6 months because I know I won't get any crazy electric bills for air conditiong.
5.0	Seriously, if your stocking looks like a refrigerator with a broken ice maker. I have a Kenmore Elite that quit making ice. YouTube has lots of videos on how to troubleshoot and replace one, and it's relatively simple for any DIY capable person. Only tool needed was a 1/4 inch nut driver, but I also used a swivel with a nut driver handle and 1/4 inch socket so I could reach the screws a bit better. It took about 20 minutes to install, and that's taking my time and reviewing the video again; probably more caution than is needed. Within a hour, we had ice. Factory settings for the volume of water going into the ice tray was good. I knew to check that from the videos, and once it is working, that is probably the only other thing to check.<br /><br />I picked this one because it is the brand name. Other less expensive versions were available, and I debated whether to save a few buck because they should be pretty basic, but I decided not to risk it with an off-brand. I'm satisfied now. The off-brand might work fine, but I feel confident in this purchase and hope to get another 12 years like I did from the original. If I'd put in an off-brand, how many years would be satisfying for saving the $20 or $30?
5.0	I bought these hinges to replace some worn out ones on the cabinets when we bought our house.  The cabinets had a 3/4&#34; overlay which the big box retailers either didn't carry, or only had a single (non-soft close) option.  I thought about getting the non-soft close ones and adding a soft close piston on each door, but the added cost to me wasn't worth it.  These hinges installed easily and worked flawlessly even with our largest cabinet door.  The soft close is a nice feature and the hinges still close fully unlike some other hinges that I tried before these.  These will be what I use to replace all of the hinges in all of our cabinets.
5.0	This lamp is absolutely stunning.  Although somewhat bulkier than its delicate appearance would suggest, the solid brass and crystal make it a heavy piece.  Regardless, the lamp is postively beautiful and elegant.
5.0	Works quite well~even through walls...much smaller than the &#34;old&#34; version, and very easy to &#34;connect&#34; with remote(s). I got TWO remotes and 3 outlets for LESS than I paid 10-12 years ago for ONE remote, and 3 &#34;old&#34; version outlets.
5.0	very good quality.  a bit heavy, but its more a plus.<br />keeps stable , dont move while using. nice product.
5.0	Love these lights. I have changed out all the lights in my living room, kitchen, dining room and bedrooms with these lights. I bought the soft white for all our rooms except the living room. They are very bright and provide so much more light than the old swirly light bulbs. The bright white ones are VERY bright but since our house is a A frame they work perfect in the living room
5.0	These knobs are great for the price and they were great replacement knobs on my white kitchen cabinets. Delivered in reasonable time
5.0	Solve my problem that I have for 5 years
5.0	looks great, action is smooth, smartkey is easy to use
5.0	"I ordered the Tradesman 9930 and found it to be better than expected. It has quality tube framwork with air tires making it very easy to roll. It was easy to set up and fits my 10\\"" Delta <br />sliding compound. It was an awesome deal through Amazon for $69.00. I couldn't make it for that.  <br />"
5.0	I aired red a total of four of these to use in the tracks. For the wheelchair tie dozens in my van.  They are great for an attachment point for Bungie's or tie downs!
5.0	I saw these tarp clips in Cheaper than dirt. They work perfectly for what I use them for.  I use them while camping to make temporary shade, and I use them to hold a tarp down in my back yard covering firewood.<br /><br />I've read reports that these can break under high tension situations, such as being used to tarp down a load on a truck where the tarp will billow.
5.0	I love my Dolphin lamp it is just what I wanted and it got to me fast. It is beautiful add to my dolphin collection.
5.0	Love this fan!  I have one  just like it in my bedroom and added this one to by  bathroom!  I always get comments on it!
5.0	The reviews seemed mixed but I couldn't be happier with this purchase. They work perfectly and it's nice that there's multiple settings.
5.0	After some looking around for replacement bulbs for the kitchen lamp in a new-to-us house, I bought these and have been happy with them. They have been in place for months and I have not had any issues.
5.0	I have 2 of these and they do a great job. What can I say, this shower head does what you need, with plenty of options.
5.0	Fast shipping.  Pressure regulator works as designed and was easy to connect.  Some adapters were included but you may have to purchase additional adapters depending on the type of pipes used.
5.0	This check valve is a replacement the unit that came with my 7 year old house -- my old sump pump failed and I replaced it with the Zoeller M98 pump.  All the reviews recommend that you replace your check valve if you're replacing your pump, so this seemed like a good option for me.<br /><br />I am very please with the design and operation of the valve itself.  The double sided rubber sleeves allow for multiple diameter pipes to be fitted without the need for additional adapters or couplings.  The valve is very quiet when it closes and actually made me get out of bed one night when I couldn't tell if the pump was running or not, since I couldn't hear the tell-tale &#34;thump&#34; from the old valve.<br /><br />I am very pleased and would recommend to anyone.
5.0	it matches the faucet items came as I expected in great shape and top quality... durable, nice finish, easy to install,
5.0	Great unit. Easy to install
5.0	Easy to place on my walls which are painted wood paneling. My son loves it. We also got a pack of smaller character and it was great as well.
5.0	So far, I am MORE than impressed with this system.  It is sensitive, but not too sensitive.  The monitoring folks are all over responding to alarms!!  I kid you not, I bent over Friday night and accidentally hit the &#34;panic&#34; button and in less than 10 seconds, the monitor called and asked if I need them to send help.  I have only had the system for a short time but have already expanded it.  I put sensors on my barn and shop doors more than 100 feet away and the base station has no problem picking them up.  I will prvide updates as things go along.
5.0	really brings old dry wood back to life! used on doors and also on tables and even our antique clocks.
5.0	Much, much better than I had thought.  The strips have a clear cut point (about 19&#34;) to make smaller strands and the solder points were easy to attach to.  Very, very bright and I was definitely satisfied with the purchase.
5.0	It was exactly what we need, however, we were unable to remove the broken screw and had to return these items.
5.0	Brighter than the old bulbs. Look great.
5.0	There was an issue beyond their control and they did more than &#34;just the right thing&#34;, they were fantastic and went above and beyond.  Would definitely do business with them in a heartbeat. :)
5.0	We love the faucet - it looks great with the granite countertops we have. The faucet height and ceramic handles are very classy and give the kitchen a more polished look.<br /><br />The only complaint is the packaging - it was sent in the product box, which was damaged and taped together when delivered. Luckily the faucet was fine. Also, the hot and cold fittings need to be longer to accommodate the depth of the granite.<br /><br />As always, thanks !
5.0	I bought two of these for my two car garage with a 13' ceiling height.  It took about an hour to install both units. Very easy to install. They throw an incredible amount of light.  Very pleased.
5.0	Works great! Had the other model Pur filter previously (filter laying on its side, not vertical) and it used to leak a lot. This filter is on the faucet solid, no leaks!
5.0	I have always wanted frankincense for Christmas. The smell of this is amazing. And the amount in one pound is much more than I expected especially for the price.
5.0	These are just great for what they are. Sturdy, good action, etc., but I didn't realize how tiny they are.  They're really tiny!  Just tiny little guys. I didn't look carefully at what I was buying, so I got something smaller than I wanted.  That's my mistake. Just be aware -- they are smaller than a typical door key.  Really, really small.
5.0	Do you enjoy going high on a ladder, and having your chest, shoulders and nose right up against the wall you are painting? Or the board you are nailing?  Neither do I!  This standoff allows me to be a comfortable distance from the wall.  That's in addition to the other benefits -- letting me reach WAY out to the side; straddling a window.<br />This is the accessory you'll use the most.
5.0	Great unit, I bought this to replace a Badger 5 that developed several holes and was leaking.  I also got the adapter for the 3 bolt mount and the install went very smooth.  This unit is more powerful than my previous disposal and it's a lot quieter.
5.0	Awesome paint .....for the most part odorless....good price is just like it says it is. I will certainly be buying more when i get the chance.
5.0	Excellent quality. Heavy and classy hardware.
5.0	There is nothing critical I can say about it. I used to have a 12 year old Kitchen Aid, which performed very well and when I replaced the sink I've chosen  Waste King because it was batch feed (that is better if you are afraid of accidents especially with young kids around) and it had very good reviews on Amazon and Consumer Reports.
5.0	I used to have a whole house vacumn including one in the garage. When we purchase our new home it did not have an in house vacumn system or one in the garage. Was so happy to find this so that I could use in the garage. I do think the hose is a little long and would probably prefer a 30' hose to the 50' that comes with it. At this length I could not only clean the garage but probably all the way out to the street and even bring into the house. Good price and arrived promptly. Have not put up or used yet, due to the weather but know I will love the convenience of having this vacumn cleaner.
5.0	The attachment method of these is better then the Leviton version.  In my opinion.  Give them a try and see for yourself!
5.0	Excellent fit would recommend to anyone
5.0	My shower is now a religious experience! The flow is powerful but gentle and the head is quite large but very maneuverable.
5.0	"I ordered the filter on Thursday and it arrived on Saturday with free shipping.  What else can I say but \\""Way to go AMAZON!!\\""  The unit plugged into my IKEA Whirlpool fridge without a problem Easy as 1..2..3.."
5.0	I had been looking for a cheaper replacement seat for the old American Standard toilet. The size is perfect fit. Only the color is a bit lighter/whiter than the original linen shade, but it's hardly noticeable when the light is dimmer.
5.0	awesome...this changed my life
5.0	What a trolley,exceeded expectations just what I was looking for. Loved the liner so I can shop with privacy now.
5.0	Looks like a high-end fan. Cools the room nicely. Quiet motor. Bought three for our first condo then more for our 2nd home. Love these fans. Modern and simple.
5.0	I was a bit worried about how hard it would be to apply, with all those letters, just do it slow and steady! I love this quote--and I love this graphic just as much!
5.0	Quick and correct. What I ordered and received on time. Pleased with this service and would order again from this vendor.
5.0	Looking for an easy to use, reliable door entry alarm with no complicated mounting?  Get the GE SmartHome Door Stop Alarm. You won't be disappointed. Afer batteries are activated, you're done. Just put by your door. So sensitive to pressure that I've often scared myself by picking it up the wrong way. (Pick it up by the sides only)  Easy to take with you on trips and a perfect complement to the Door Jammer. Highly recommend.
5.0	Great product - works fabulous in my laundry room clipped to the base of an upper cabinet.  Using for cloth diapers.
5.0	We updated our kitchen and one of the first things I show people is my sink. When I first saw it I wondered why anyone would want a low divide sink.  Now I don't want to have a kitchen without one.  I am able to wash dishes in one side and rinse in the other, PLUS wash large items such as cookie sheets or dehydrator trays.
5.0	Just as expected - sweet!<br /><br />Got a pair for my nieces - 15 and 14.  They loved them and rave about them everytime they see me.<br /><br />Be a hero!  Get one for your teenager!
5.0	Look modern and contemporary. They hold the mirror well. Price is much better than similar ones I saw for $200+.
5.0	Amazing product for build up. I may have used glass cleaner previously and it has taken a while to remove the residue once burned on. This product made a huge dent in the progress. During the cold months I clean the glass daily.
5.0	"For 40 years I lived in Southern California, a warm and exciting experience but \\""earthquake land\\"" also.  Living with the constant threat of a tremblor influences all that you do, and Museum Wax is perfect for protecting and holding your displayed valuables, breakables, and bric-a-brack in place on shelving. A small dab of Museum Wax adheres the base of the object to its position on a shelf, or in a cabinet, so that the object is protected from falling and breaking. I lived through six earthquakes. It's 'good stuff!'"
5.0	Great product.  Adhesive  needs work
5.0	Just what I needed. I only need to buy one because I took the advice from another review. I added a washer to the back of my already broken ones on my stove. And so far, it is working out. I also added a washer to the back of the new one, just in case.
5.0	Good Price! I just had enough, order more than you think you will need.
5.0	This terminal block is a top quality item that I used on my Whirlpool oven. It was easy to install and allowed the wiring to be solidly terminated. I recommend this item and the seller
5.0	Cute design and easy to put on and take off of a wall with out damaging the paint. I was able to use these at 2 different homes and the still look great and for a great price.
5.0	Was what I expected.  Very pleased.
5.0	I can't believe I've let the mail fall on the floor all these years. People were tripping on it. The mail was getting smashed. It is great to get the mail out of the sack instead. I was pleasantly surprised to find that it is beautifully constructed and actually looks better than the photo. The color tan is true to the photo. True, there is a great big sack on your door now, but at least it is an elegant sack.
5.0	I recommend these. Great price too. Although you will need to be creative in trying to keep the batteries in place. I inserted some cardboard pieces and they work perfectly. I will be ordering more.
5.0	Well made holder at great price. The finish almost matches the bronze oil-rubbed Price-Fister faucet but is slightly darker than the finish on my American Standard faucet (Portsmouth Monoblock).
5.0	I installed a Lava HD-2605 UHF/VHF HDTV Antenna with Remote Control for my man cave. I live 40 miles west north west of Pittsburgh. I was really surprised to find I picked up 42 channels, from as far away as Toronto Ohio. Eire pa and as far south as Morgantown WV, and I did not even rotate it to try to pick up more channels. What a deal HD channels for free minus the cost of the Antenna of course.
5.0	Easily fit in my 5 gallon water bottle. My bottle has threads. It fits over the threads and the outer ring screws down to secure it to the bottle. I tasted plastic in the first bottle we used it in. The taste went away half way through the bottle. Using it in a second bottle, and still no plastic taste, thank goodness.    It pumps water really good. Better pumping when the bottle is more full. But as the bottle gets low, I just pump fast, and it keeps the water flowing. We both like this and have no plans to put a heavy bottle on top of the crock ever again. When the bottle gets pretty low, I dump the water into the crock, and put the pump in a new bottle. I'm so glad we got this item! It seems like a quality product. I will take a picture soon and add it here.
5.0	This is just what we needed and could not find it in the hardware store in our small town.
5.0	This set includes all of the necessary tools you would need to complete any kind of project that you can think of. The case is made of wood and has a foam insert on the inside that holds all of the grinding tools in place.
5.0	"At first glance, I had no idea why someone would pay twice as much for a \\""cold-weather\\"" cord.  I thought this was merely a marketing ploy to make people think the electricity wouldn't flow as well in a cold cord.  Some advantages were marked as \\""easily visible lighted plug\\"".  Not a huge benefit.  If you cant find the ends of a cord that's plugged in, you've got bigger problems.  The real advantage is that the cord doesn't get stiff when it's cold.  It remains very flexible in cold weather. Infinitely better than trying to wrestle the bright orange vinyl cords."
5.0	I am neither handy or crafty, and I found this product easy to apply and am extremely pleased with the results.  It dressed up a bare window and provided the privacy I needed.  Loved it!
5.0	Just what I wanted.  Attractive.
5.0	need fuses and these are the size/type I need
5.0	Installed it yesterday and it works fine.
5.0	Just installed the unit, after waiting 10 months. Not as hard as I feared. loving the clean water. I live in the country and our well water is hard. The wife and last kid refused to drink the tap water any more. So I installed the R/O system from Christmas. It took about 3 hours and 2 trips to the hardware store. Drilled 2 holes and connected 4 hoses. Done and no leaks. Good unit.
5.0	perfect color match easy install
5.0	"So after reading the reviews I was skeptical about buying socket bulbs, but after buying two different types, this one is by far the best and even comparable to the other tube black lights I bought. My roommates and I throw black light parties, and these worked great for places like hallways and the bathroom to keep the mood going when not near the big tube ones. They make black light reflective things glow, as well as make the whites glow blue. It lit up my whole kitchen, and not with the annoying blue or purple light, but with true black light, to the extent that even clear plastic cups had a blue glow tinge. Not too bright, but they definitely work in the pinch areas. If you are thinking of using these for black light parties or to just light up your small to medium size room, these are almost as good as getting an 18\\"" fluorescent tube light, and definitely the cheaper alternative."
5.0	Very happy with this light, I bought two of them.
5.0	More light than a 10 watt incandescent bulb for one watt.  Terrific for a small flag or outdoor stairwell light.
5.0	Works great.  Installation wasn't hard - it took about 30 minutes which included making all the wiring hang neat and straight in the corner of the wall and ceiling from the garage door opener to the garage door.<br /><br />The beep is very loud.  Kind of annoying but probably a good feature.  You could tape over the speaker hole if you wanted to.
5.0	I bought this unit to test the amount of silver in colloidal silver that I'm making and it seems to do a great job.  It's simple to use and easily reads the PPM of solids in solution.
5.0	Never used it, Just another gadget for my collection.
5.0	I surprised hubby with a new shower head for his shower.  He immediately installed it, and so far, has enjoyed it very much.  He says that each of the 6 settings is nice, but he likes the powerful jet spray the most.  The water massages his tired back and shoulders and helps him relax.  I especially like how a roll of teflon tape was included with the shower head, but I was somewhat concerned when I saw that the shower head itself was chrome colored, not chrome metal.  However, the shower head seems strong and durable, and was easy to install.  I was happy when given the opportunity to purchase during a promotion, to evaluate and share my opinion through a review.
5.0	This gadget is fabulous!<br /><br />I needed higher bumpers for the toilet seat, and wrote the manufacturer-- They sent me the bumpers for free.<br /><br />I had my plumber install it, but it comes with all the parts, and I could have probably done it myself.  The jets are very strong, which means you get very clean :)!<br /><br />The plumbers were impressed, and compared it favorably to the ~$800/$900 Toto bidet covers.
5.0	What more can you say; It's a floor vent cover. Fits good; looks good! Cheaper than buying at the local hardware store. Not much more to say.
5.0	ITS HARD TO FIND THESE KIND OF LIGHT BULBS PACKED VERY WELL
5.0	The BEST GLUE EVER!!!
5.0	Do you have a strike plate that's been painted over 5 times and can't find a good round replacement strike? This is the product you're looking for. It matched my needs perfectly, and I wasn't left needing to chisel out existing strike plate areas in order to fit a rectangle plate.
5.0	I just moved into a new house, and am a little tight on money right now.  These shades are a great window covering.  And they keep out 98% of the heat/light!
5.0	Our 20 year old Raynor openers are mechanically perfect but the receiver has been getting worse over time.  Poor range and finally it refused to open or close with the transmitter.  Since the openers are working perfectly I decided to just purchase the receiver.  Range has increased significantly and it works perfectly.  Very easy to program and is much easier than the dip switches that my old unit had.  For the 25 dollars it was well worth it.
5.0	Great lights for my swag lamp..not too bright yet not too dim
5.0	Love it! Surprisingly nice quality. It's not an auto sensor so I keep it turned on all the time.
5.0	I have used these bulbs and some other brands, and I like these the best.  The color of light seems natural.  The bulbs last long, and illuminate instantly when you turn the switch on.  They are also relatively small, so they fit into lamps without a problem.
5.0	This is a neat little thingamajig. You can check things like your satellite receiver uses as much current off as it does on. Yikes!  All the hullabaloo about cell phone chargers wasting power when not in use, I checked mine with cell phone disconnected and it read 0.0 watts. Simple and easy to use. Works great, good for troubleshooting and truth checking.
5.0	Bought 2 of them. Went up easily... 3 wires... Light fixture puts out plenty of light. Plenty of air circulation. Make sure the fan is turning correctly if you feel disappointed in circulation.. remember it will suck air up for winter time and push air down in summer... the switch is on the exterior of fan...  Fan has no wobble and is very quite.
5.0	Great item and fast delivery
5.0	Large supply is good for us because night light bulbs seem to burn out awfully fast. The shipping box was adequate to protect the bulbs from damage, and it arrived on time. No complaints.
5.0	I ALREADY REVIEW THIS PRODUCT BUT IF YOU INSIST THE LAMPS ARE BEAUTIFUL VERY NICE MAYBE A LITTLE BIT SMALER THAN I THOUGH BUT IT COMPLETE MY EXPECTATIONS AND GOES PERFECT IN THE NIGHT TABLE. BE SURE OF THE SIZE IF YOU WANT TO BUY BUT THEY ARE REALLY NICE.I wanti to tell you that i am not adela corral. Please take a note.
5.0	Could not ask for a better value ! I would recommend 100 percent . Arrived 2 days. Perfect Condition . Far better than anything I have seen at local stores and much less expensive
5.0	Love this kitchen chair and stool combo! After receiving my chair and using it for a couple of weeks, I ordered another one. My husband put both of them together with little effort. The chair is both sturdy and well made. It's not a struggle to move it around when I need to use the step stool in order to reach for something in the upper cabinets or shelves, it doesn't feel shaky while reaching up and stepping back down. This chair is also comfortable to sit on and the steps pull out so that you can rest your feet. I recommend this product to anyone that needs a kitchen chair and a step stool.
5.0	I have never reviewed anything on here, but this is really the best headlamp I have ever used.  I'm an electrician and mountaineer and use headlamps often.  I have bought 4 over the past few years, and I don't skimp; I have used Petzl and Black Diamond in the past.  I just got this for Christmas, and it is an LED brighter than my halogen.  I currently use a Petzl headlamp that has LED for close up and halogen for distance, but this will replace it.  Just thought you should all know.
5.0	I've put 2 of these in, at 2 different houses, over the last 18 months. Installation takes about an hour or so, very easy. When we moved to our new house, the kids finally had their own toilet upstairs and within 2 months of moving in the thing was already constantly getting clogged. Put this in and haven't had a problem since.
5.0	I bought this as a gift and I love it so much that I'm going to purchase one for myself as well.
5.0	Made in Japan makes a difference in this case.  The quality and attention to detail in design make this knife an excellent value compared to knives that are a little less expensive but mediocre.  It has a very trim, minimalist design that is easy to store in pockets or pencil cases.  The blade does a great job sharpening pencils and smoothly cuts newsprint both with and against the grain.  A model with a larger handle and wider blades would be more suitable for tougher jobs.<br /><br />The stainless steel construction did not bend or even flex when I tested it with more pressure than it would ever get in normal use.  The black thumb slide, the only plastic component, is fairly solid and well protected when the knife is fully assembled.  The pocket clip includes a thin slot that is used to snap off the end of the blade to refresh the tip (there are 12 disposable segments on each blade).  It fits tightly yet slides off easily so the thumb slide can be backed out of the slot in order to replace the blade.<br /><br />Replacement blades are easy to find in art supply stores (and elsewhere) but this sleek, all stainless steel Ofla model is more elusive.  Ordering through the 'Olfa Central' store on Amazon could not have been easier and delivery time was good.
5.0	Works well and easy to install and beats all the other brands we have tried.
5.0	You will not be disappointed with this purchase.  I love this rack's look, size and ease of installation.  It looked so great in the hall way that I purchased a second one for another room.
5.0	I'm very impressed with the GE Link bulbs, and have now used them with both the Wink hub and a Philips Hue bridge. My 2 issues with this particular bulb are (1) its light is definitely directed straight like a spot and not dispersed like a flood, and (2) the diameter of the bulb is nearly 5&#34;, which means it wouldn't fit my existing flood light &#34;cans&#34; that had covers designed for smaller diameter bulbs (the more common 4&#34;).  I wouldn't be complaining if the packaging, website, etc. made these two things clear, but they don't. But as a 5&#34; spot the bulb gets 5 stars.  Just reviewed the GE Link website and the specifications page explicitly lists this bulb as having a 4&#34; diameter, which is incorrect.
5.0	This works quite well for my purpose of making colloidal silver. Thank you for such a good product at a reasonable price!
5.0	It's a battery.  Not much else to say.  It fit my Chamberlain GDO perfectly and has been working ever since.  It also seems like it works better than the original, but I may be dreaming on that! :)
5.0	Love these - they're so realistic looking.  The first time I saw one at my hairdresser's I tried to blow it out! We wanted these for sitting on 2 wall sconces we have. Definitely going to get more of these....
5.0	Well made, excellent.
5.0	Works great!  Fair price.  Good instructions. Delivered in 4 days. Dryers much quieter now. Thank you!
5.0	I have been using these shower filters for about 3 years and find them really good.  They help a lot for dry itchy skin, I have recommended them to friends and family.  The whole unit is so easy to fit too.
5.0	Does the job and performs without a hitch.  Gives me the extra accessible USB ports I need.  I don't see how you can go wrong.  What else can I say?
5.0	I love the Grohe shower head because the water pressure is great and gentle on the face. I've only had mine for a few months and I am getting a second one for the other bathroom. The antilime system is also great because no cleaning is required due to no residue or buildup.
5.0	Filter arrived on time as advertised.  Exact fit at half the price of the last replacement, water quality excellent.  I am now trying to figure out how to set up a periodic order - have done it it the past with other products, but auto-reorder button has disappeared.  Not a seller problem - that's Amazon web site design.  My experience with Refresh has been entirely satisfactory.  JKW
5.0	My 6 year old loves the wall stickers, very nicely made.
5.0	Great bracket for my hanging basket. I like that the bracket is thick and sturdy and that the 9 inch length is the perfect extension from the wall in my kitchen corner…
5.0	Really great service! Prompt delivery and all as promised.  Will buy again in the future as we use these exclusively in our motor home (fulltime RVers).
5.0	My husband was unable to open the door with the key. He stated if he was any more aggressive, he felt like the key would have broken.
5.0	Easy to put up; will buy again next year.
5.0	I'm absolutely loving the unit. I especially like the charts that show the inside and outside temp, inside and outside humidity, Lower and upper temperature ranges along with the actual temperatures. It show the history of when the heat pump is running, the emergency coils, and the fan.
5.0	Easy to work with and looks very nice.
5.0	Known has my 'happy light' at work!  New job, office in a basement.  I was having problems adjusting.  This really helps.  I didn't realize just how bright it was, until I received several comments about the sun shine in the corner.
5.0	Price was cheap. I store it in the box in the closet. I reviewed the family on how it fits in the window. It's a one time use item. It seems very sturdy and easy to use.
5.0	Received product quickly and fixed my problem
5.0	"We got exactly what we ordered from TwitterOutlet (BMB International, LLC)--no switch to a Kenmore filter or one with an \\""LG\\"" label slapped on it, but a genuine LG LT500P filter (like the one that came w/ the refrigerator when we bought it). Easy to install and works great."
5.0	Love them.  Work just  perfectly.  Just like advertised.
5.0	It is what I want and the price was right. It is working very nicely. I will be ordering more in the next year or so.
5.0	Slide as described. They are quality slides and glide easily. I have installed these slides in 8 cabinets over the last 4 months. I also made the drawers for in the base cabinets and pantry.The heavier the load the better they glide.   Will buy more as I will be making more drawer units.
5.0	These are beautiful.  These will be going on cream colored rustic type cabinets, and will look beautiful when installed.  Nice durable weight.
5.0	This lamp is adorable!
5.0	super fun! my son loves it and the stream is perfect...even though it would be nice if it was adjustable. but for 20 bucks it's awesome!
5.0	Perfect! There's nothing like having a desk drawer under the desk!
5.0	Fit right in and is working great after 8 months.
5.0	These are the best water filters I have ever used. Water tastes pure and refreshing every time. These filters actually last longer than 6 months. I wouldn't use anything else.
5.0	this baby arrived and in 30 mins my basement was dry. worked like a champ
5.0	I use this with my baby and it's awesome. A lot of times i hold it under my chin to see him while he's latching and once i accidently dropped it on him so i wish that it had less sharp points!
5.0	Used it to replace a Chicago pneumatic compressor part and it worked great
5.0	A very positive experience.
5.0	Used this light over a pub table. Looks great.
5.0	Works very well. Now my outside receptacle is GFCI protected.
5.0	Works like a charm to install my outdoor icemaker line to a faucet.
5.0	It is ventilated and doesn't mold up<br />It is soft and comfortable to stand on<br />It is a good size, doesn't quite fill the bath tub so it lays flat.
5.0	I purchased this to replace my circa-1960s doorbell chimes. Anyway, the old doorbell had a great chime sound and I was worried that new chimes would sound electronic. Since none of the chime descriptions really describe the sound, and there are no sound clips for them (???) I had to just cross my fingers and pick one. I chose this one because it can be painted. The best part though is that it has actual chimes in it! There are actual hammer-type things that hit some kind of tubes. It makes a nice solid ding-dong sound. Doesn't play a whole tune like my old one, but just the fact that it has real chimes makes me happy. I think the volume is ample -- I can hear it throughout our two-story colonial. The directions claim there is volume control but I haven't investigated that feature at all. I've only had this product for two weeks so can't speak to the quality in terms of longevity. But, I am very happy so far for the price.
5.0	Ordered standard delivery 11/15/14 received 11/19/14!! I purchased the 48 count LED tea lights X 2 all 96 ($51.98) were in perfect condition in little carefully packed 12 packs inside 2 boxes which were inside the shipping box. I turned every single one on all turned on with little effort, light was a nice yellow/Amber glow definitely not bright white which was what I saw others had complained it was? I thought the amber light was pleasing. I did have a few here and there that don't &#34;flicker&#34; but I will have them in votive glasses in decorations for wedding, most do exactly as they should.<br /><br />I notice crazy expectations on here for it only lasted 5 days?! Like I don't know what they are expecting? I will be using them for maybe 8 hours, 9 months from now. I will update battery life and effect later.<br />Overall I am very happy with this product, and prompt delivery!
5.0	This is the third one I've bought. Both my sons have one on their desk lamps and they love them. I put one on my bedside table lamp and it is fantastic for dimming. I got it initially because my hand held massager was too strong and someone on Amazon had suggested purchasing this as a dimmer and it worked great. It comes in white too.
5.0	Arguably the best items I purchased for my home. I purchased two of these and installed them myself. Installation was a breeze. Set up the wireless connection on both thermostats, installed the app on my phone and I could not be more pleased at their operation. My electric bill was reduced by at least 20% and over time these thermostats will pay for themselves. Highly recommend.
5.0	Has a nice variety of switches and a good spray.
5.0	Works as described, even cross-platform. I purchased this as a second unit for my Safety Technologies remote (this one was 1/2 the cost of the ST add-on). They appear to be made by the same company, and so far they work perfectly together.
5.0	Had difficult time locating an universal remote that would work my garage door.  My garage door opener is fairly old.  It does have the safety switch that doesn't allow the door to close if something is obstructing the opening.  My garage door opener is an off brand which made it more difficult to find something that would work. Reading the description on this opener, I interpreted to mean it should work with my setup.  I couldn't figure out how to make work.  By calling technical services I was given step by step instructions on how to make the remote work with what I have.  It works like a charm.
5.0	I don't have much to say except it does work fine at a reasonable price. I will buy more as I need them.
5.0	Great lights.  I have been replacing my Hallogen track lights with these and they work wonderfully.  The lights are exceptionally bight but run on a fraction of the cost.  I have been using this bulb for months with no issues.<br /><br />I hightly reccomend these bulbs.
5.0	Fit my lamp post perfect. I put alittle liquid soap on it and pushed it right through.
5.0	We have had this rain can for several months. I like it because it is gentle like a rain shower, but still strong enough to actually shower and get the soap off. We have 2 shower heads in the shower, this rain can, and a standard shower head. If I were to pick one to shower in, I would probably use the standard shower head, but the rain can is great for relaxing. No complaints!
5.0	Worked great on my old ceiling fan without having to replace the entire body and cut into my ceiling.
5.0	I didn't end up needing these after all, but tried them out for fun:)<br /><br />On the thinner tarps, I had to fold the edge of the tarp over to get a good grip.  On the heavier tarp, the clips gripped well.
5.0	I'm looking for more item like this.
5.0	great lights - great price - they look great mounted on the wall over wife's vanity/make-up area.
5.0	This is a wonderfully soft toilet seat cushion and is the 2nd one we've ordered.  The previous seat lasted for YEARS, which amazed us.  Usually they crack after a year of use, but not this one.  Also very easy to keep clean and looking like new.
5.0	Great for teachers simple to assemble.
5.0	"If I hadn't seen this with my own eyes, I wouldn't have believed it.  My house has cranberry-colored shutters without louvers, and they were 11 years old and badly streaked with oxidation.  Cleaning the shutters took some time until I developed a system.  I'm not sure how effective the cleaner is. It didn't seem to do much until I used the 5 to 1 dilution recommended for stained shutters and combined it with a steel scouring pad from the local dollar store. The recommended soft brush and solution wasn't making much progress. The instructions say to clean the shutters until scraping them with your fingernail produces no result. It took me two or three washes per shutter to achieve that.  At this point, the shutters looked only a little less dreadful than they did when I began cleaning. Once they dry completely, you \\""paint\\"" them with Shutter Renu.  This part is simple and took less than 15 minutes per shutter.  Each shutter uses less than a quarter cup of Shutter Renu.  The trick is to use a larger brush and load it with a tiny bit of the solution to minimize foaming and frothing in the corners.  A little goes a loooooong way.  At first, the shutters looked almost purple.  They dried to touch in 30 minutes, and VOILA!  They looked like they'd just come out of the box, even restored to the original color.  I expected to see more fading, especially since reds tend to fade so much, so I was shocked at the restoration.  Our neighbor wandered over to take a look and was equally impressed.  I can't speak to the longevity of this system yet, but it supposedly lasts up to ten years.  If I get even five years out of this treatment, it's worth it.  For less than the cost of a pair of new shutters, not to mention the annoyance of replacing them and the waste of ditching shutters every ten years, I have beautiful shutters again that give my house a real facelift.  My jaw literally dropped when I stepped back to take a look after application.  This product completely solved the problem at my house!<br />Update: Eight months later, and the shutters still look as beautiful as the day I Renued them.  They were so pretty for the holidays!"
5.0	Amazing quality for a low price. Just be aware that these are very large and very heavy - you might not want to put them into thin sheetrock unless there is a stud directly behind. The blackened finish has a wonderfully expensive look and smooth feel.
5.0	Excellent product, it fitted beautifully. It is  solid and appears to be a good quality product. It was a great purchase.
5.0	(the one i got has soldering pads much bigger than the one shown in the photo, so I don't know if everybody got the same thing as I have.)<br /><br />I measured about 1 amp for the whole 5 meter strip.<br />Bright, sticky, easy to solder, and no bad LEDs. I don't know why people complain about the adhesive. I'm not a fan of adhesives, as I prefer mechanical attachments, but the 3M sticky backings are very good. In fact, I found it not very easy to peel off the adhesive in order to solder them.<br />I'm very happy with it and plan to buy more - next time warm white.
5.0	Super easy to install.<br />Instructions were clear & any questions I had were quickly and completely answered by the folks at SimpliSafe.<br />I added a smoke detector, which lowered my homeowners insurance 10%,<br />so the monthly monitoring, in effect, costs only $5/month.
5.0	Very satisfied with the product and Chans is a very helpful vendor, I needed to communicate with them for a couple reasons and they alwasy got back to me right away. Helped my througout the entire process. Would definitely reccomend them and would use them away when needed.
5.0	works as they say . enough light to see the door, room area , etc. would be better if it had a photocell to shut off during the day.
5.0	This decal was easy to apply and it looks beautiful in my nursery!!
5.0	I recently purchased the Dimmer Switch (Incandescent) and found it worked without any problems, and added subtley and functionality to the lighting system in my home. It is easy to install and adds a creative touch (my children are fascinated by it). The plates (coveringthe switch) can be changed to confirm with the interior of any room and after a while, when you get used to it, turning on a light by actually touching a lighswitch seems awkward. Definitely something to have.
5.0	Fits well behind my shelf and am able to push it to the wall and use the socket behind it.
5.0	They are fairly small, but they get the job done well for the cost.  Not much else to say about this product so just meeting the word count.
5.0	I had a Black & Decker Firestorm that broke.  Since I had just purchased new batteries I was looking to replace it.  that s when I found out the Dewalt fits the Black & Decker batteries and is a heavier duty version drill than the Black & Decker.
5.0	Absolutely fantastic device. I set it to turn on at sunset and off at sunrise for my soffit lights. So nice having this.  Money well spent.
5.0	Fits my Lennox PureAir system and does what it is supposed to do.
5.0	Bought these for my sons room.. and he totally loves them. They were definitely easy to put up and I removed several to reposition and it didn't tear off the paint
5.0	The system was very easy to install/configure and is working perfectly. Definitely recommended!
5.0	excellent product and price
5.0	The lamp arrived today and it is absolutely beautiful.  I read other reviews that mentioned bubbles in the glass and this one has them too but you cannot tell it unless you get up really close to it.  I think the bubbles just make it look that much older.<br />I did not like the really shiny brass ones.  This one looks like antique gold and it is just what I wanted.  The lamp is very heavy and sturdy and puts off a nice glow around the computer monitor instead of that bright light that was in the other desk lamp that I just put in the garbage.  The price is better  than others I have found too.  Glad I bought this one.
5.0	Easy to install and great system to know when the door is opened or closed. I don't need to worry about my kids loosing the keys. I certainly recommend it.
5.0	these lined shades are a great base for any custom decorating you and your glue gun can imagine. Mine were glamorized for Christmas.
5.0	If you have an old house with no real insulation, this stuff is awesome for repairing cracks and holes in plaster. We bought an old 1924 home with mostly cosmetic repairs required, and even though this is designed for exterior repairs, it seems to expand and contract with this old house. When I tried it on my dining room about three years ago, it was like working magic. Our sagging back porch had been raised more than a foot (with the roof of the house) after I repaired that room, and the stress fractures in the plaster that I had seen before the raising did not return. All the other rooms where no repairs were done were looking worse for the wear.<br /><br />Since then I have sworn by this stuff in every room in my plaster-walled home. Every place I've patched with this paste is still looking great. Any place where I have had to resort to another type of plaster or spackle has ended up in a mess with cracks that needed more repairs after the fact. It even works well on the old sheet rock.  I highly recommend this!
5.0	Took about 10minutes to hang the shell pieces, which are prestrung on individual strands. It is absolutely gorgeous and looks fabulous with a single frosted light bulb for a softer lighting effect. I'd been looking for a shell pendant chandelier for about a year, but they were all so spendy. This one is a great price and much more &#34;full&#34; than those that cost more.<br /><br />Before we hung the shells, we spray painted the fixture white because I didn't like the silver finish. So the effect is that you just see the shells and not the fixture.
5.0	I used this for the first time while camping in the mountain this past weekend and it surpassed my expectations. This is a great emergency back up unit along with outings.
5.0	I now have loads of batteries for all my cats laser lights
5.0	Wish it was wider but it is the same width as an other ladder.
5.0	I replaced the spots above my bathtub with these.  They are as bright as the 60 watt bulbs they replaced.  The color of the light was great for the application.
5.0	The original ice holder in my fridge started having piece break off just when it was out of warranty. I luckily found this which is the identical part. All the parts and pieces have worked well. We haven't had any problems with it at all.
5.0	Awesome light outout.
5.0	Had a problem with flickering with a halogen bulb in a dimmable fixture.<br />This Xenon bulb solved that problem. Also puts off less heat.
5.0	Works perfectly. Very handy for travel.
5.0	I GOT IT FOR MY SON WHOM I RECENTLY FOUND KNOCKED OUT AND TIED TO A CHAIR. THEY FOUN ALL HIS SAVED MONEY IN HIS CLOSET. THIS SAFE IT GREAT, AND THE WAY HE INSTALLED IT, NO ONE WILL FIND IT!
5.0	I expected this product to be cheeply made, and only be usable inside my darkroom, but it turned out to be the duct I was looking for, for all of my needs. Don't be fooled by other products of the same type, if it dosen't have the UL stamp, it isen't what you want.
5.0	Worked great.  Had to replace both lights on the hood and both worked fine.  Now I even have a spare.
5.0	No problem with this product.
5.0	Very nice looking and works great. Come with everything you need for the install.
5.0	The switches work very well and don't require a neutral wire (white wire) with all types of lighting, including LED and CFL with dimming.
5.0	My wife has always blamed are well water for her hair problems.  No more!  These filters remove all the crap so. Her hair looks and feels great
5.0	"First, this particular device might more accurately be described as a \\""shower for your bottom/privates\\"" than an actual bidet.  In Europe/Canada, a bidet is a completely separate fixture from the flush toilet/water closet.  Some types just fill up with water, like a lavatory/sink basin, and after using the flush toilet you sit on the bidet to soak/clean your bottom.  In the USA, this device saves the installation of a separate fixture and accomplishes most of the same ends (pun intended).  This kit has impressive metal fittings (stainless and chrome) and is easily installed.  It comes with only the cold water connector/tubing, so you'll want to purchase the \\""Danco 2003HIK GoBidet hot water installation kit\\"" as well (the exact fittings for the hot water side are hard to find otherwise).  To keep the chrome shiny, clean the water sprayer end with baby oil periodically (otherwise the water sprayer/tube turns green color).<br />PS: there's good descriptions of a \\""classic bidet\\"" on the following websites and how to use one properly:<br />plumbum.com/misunderstood.html<br />wikihow.com/Use-a-Bidet"
5.0	No complaints. The instructions were easy to follow and they do what they're intended to, hang small things.
5.0	Perfect for my new door, modern and pretty. A nice change from the old timey wooden slide handle.
5.0	Easy to install once you figure out where to drill the holes.  Use a piece of cardboard and quickly make your own template.  Sturdy and should be easy to clean the chrome finish.
5.0	This is an excellent water saving shower head with a built in cut-off. It is sturdy, simple and very effective. I was replacing an old one (over 20 years old) that I was too lazy/unable to figure out how to replace an o-ring on the cut-off valve/button. The overall unit was still solid and working great. It simply was leaking too much water off to the side when engaged. My style of showering is to soap up/shampoo up, etc. with the water off and then switch it back on to rinse off. Great for water savings in the shower but, for me, it is a personal style preference that is more than adequately filled.
5.0	I've been having issues with replacement Genie garage door openers since our original 2 went bad.  Every one has been worse than the ones they replaced.  I used to work for Linear, and well, my opinion of Linear as an employer is almost as low as it can go, but heck, it's been 25 years, so why not get over the grudge, yea?  Thankfully I did.  1 issue I read was the big button was easily pressed unintentionally when in pockets, so I used the top tiny button programmed into our opener.  It works great.  The range is pretty good- not as far as some of the Genie remotes, but this really is nitpicking- it really is more than sufficient.  Great item.
5.0	I got these to hang my scarves on a hanger.  They work great because they have no sharp edges that will snag the scarves.
5.0	My 2yr. Grandson loved these !!!  They were easy to apply on the walls, and he could help too.  The adhesive holds well, they remove easily, & re-apply numerous times without leaving residue or damage to the walls.  The adhesive holds up to numerous applications without curling, and the clours stay bright and don't fade with the sunlight.
5.0	Delivery on time. Perfect for the price.
5.0	On time and as described.  Very easy installation
5.0	We needed a light for our girls' bathroom and this was just perfect.  We mounted it so the lights point downwards and it looks awesome.  So happy with this purchase.
5.0	Amazing device for its size!<br />I ended up buying 7 of these and putting them in every room!
5.0	Fast delivery and as described, thanks.
5.0	Quality Solid Brass 2-3/4&#34; Trigger Snap Hook 5/8&#34; Swivel Eye from Pro Tool is a nice way to secure a locked box, when you don't need the security of a padlock.  It keeps my outdoor storage container where we keep our potting soil and pots, as we don't need to lock it up, but it does have a lift up lid that could catch a stiff breeze and blow open.  Much easier than the last snap hook I used that was awkward to put on and take off the ring, which is made for a lock.  I really like it and have ordered another for the boat, in stainless.
5.0	fast and easy!  Planning my next purchase already!
5.0	Fast delivery. Great price.
5.0	I've had these bulbs in my kitchen pendant light for the past year and I could not be happier with them.  Yes, they are expensive, but the look and style they add to my clear pendants is worth it.  Everyone who comes into my house comments on them. I'm including a photo but it can't really show them to their best advantage.  The shape of the bulb casts images on the surface of the pendants that change depending on the position of the viewer. The photo comes out looking like a circle of light but they really look nothing like that.  They are really delightful.
5.0	Works well~ shipped fast~!
5.0	I have a house that has 3 restrooms. Tried other brand bidet. Was  cheap material and leaked . But luxe bidet was really great. Valuable worked day one till now no problem , never leaked, very great material, I really would recommend it to any one as I think It was built to last
5.0	We have two of these, one in the basement and one in the bonus room.  The one in the basement has been in place approximately 2 years.  The one in the bonus room was purchased to replace a CO detector from another company which stopped working after approximately 18 months.  A good value.
5.0	since moving to the country, I've found myself avoiding the 30 mile trips to the nearest substantial town. It's an overpriced wall plate but it saved me a trip to the store
5.0	We had a real problem finding a replacement the side tank lever , but thanks to Amazon we found one and also purchased an extra just in case
5.0	"We replaced an older gate opener with this model after years of replacing blown fuses and circuit boards. We live in the Pacific NW and the slugs were constantly getting into the circuitry and shorting out the boards. I tried everything humanly possible to try and block their entry points but had no luck. Service on the unit was horrendous and over the last 10 years we poured hundreds of dollars into the that unit to keep it operating. The last time it shorted out I had had enough. That Miracle 1 unit is a piece of crap and it took a security company certified electrician to work on it and believe me, they weren't cheap! We researched many options and settled on the Sentry 300 unit. I installed it a couple of weeks ago and it is preforming perfectly. It took me less than two hours to install the entire system. Mind you, I already had mounting brackets that I could easily modify to accept the connections to the post and gate plus 110 power for the battery charging was already there.<br /><br />The unit came with a good dvd that summarized the installation process. Good thing, the manual that came with it was missing many pages and had duplicates of the others! A manual is available on their website but with the information provided on the dvd I didn't need to access that.<br /><br />In choosing this unit I saw several good reviews and also was glad to see that the circuit board on this model is completely sealed to keep out the \\""bugs\\"". What a concept! That in itself was enough to convince me that these guys new what they were doing when they designed this thing.<br /><br />The opener works great! My only issue is that I drive a 12 year old Suburban and the onboard programmable opener button will not accept this new 9 pin remote signal into it's memory. I am using one of the remotes provided until I get to a Chevy dealer and see if they can help me out. Perhaps it's just my older vehicle technology because my wife's new Subaru easily accepted the code and she doesn't need to carry the remote.<br /><br />Lastly, I am NOT a mechanical genius or electrician......just a normal knucklehead woodworker and installing the unit was quite simple. I would recommend this unit to you.......especially if you are suffering the indignity of possessing a Miracle 1 (what an oxymoron....it's a Miracle they are still in business!).need to carry the remote.<br /><br />Lastly, I am NOT a mechanical genius or electrician......just a normal knucklehead woodworker and installing the unit was quite simple.

5.0	My shower doors never moved smoother.  I bought these to replace a rusted roller on a shower door that became impossible to open and close.  I was so pleased with these I decided to replace them on my other shower door also.  And I'll be purchasing some more to keep as spares.  I couldn't be happier with this product.
5.0	Meets all expectations, very impressed. Does its job well, and very attractive design. Light does its job well, and get a lot of compliments.
5.0	I've been using this on the wood shaft of my pool cue and so far I really like it. A very small amount is all it takes. Every few days I wipe the accumulated chalk and skin oils off the shaft and with a microfiber cloth then buff it and the light wax coating becomes super slick again. I reapply every few weeks or so if my shaft and ferrule requires a deeper cleaning.<br /><br />Haven't tried it on other objects yet. For my use, the small jar looks like it will last decades.
5.0	Position are well set, left-mid-right. Smooth. Quality of made seems decent. leads are solid not cheapy.<br />You can beat the price.
5.0	To be honest, I question the intelligence of the average reviewer. This lamp was as easy to assemble as any other basic piece of furniture. Sure, the three icicles intersect at nonregular angles, but with I successfully assembled two of these floor lamps in under ten minutes. The lamp itself looks gorgeous and the dimmer controls work well. My lamps arrived intact, undamaged, and ready for assembly. My only complaint is the excessive packaging, but this is a cost I was very willing to pay to protect my beautiful light fixture.
5.0	Just what you'd expect. I bought this for my kitchen since I only have one outlet. And the cords seem to snap in the strip so they won't be coming out easily. Definitely the best strip I have!
5.0	I have been looking for one for years. It's so handy when away from home and need to get up in the night in a strange place.
5.0	Working great. Love it.
5.0	Works great and has a great range for typical use.  My mailbox is about 40 yards away from the front door and the receiver is in my foyer on a small foyer table.  it is line of sight and there are side windows on both sides of the door to give you perspective.  It works every time the mailbox opens.  Even more so when the mail lady does not close it good enough and it falls opens...beeps every time the wind blows and will drive you insane.  But does what it is supposed to, let's you know your mailbox is open.
5.0	I USE IT FOR...<br />My bathroom (8ft x 5ft). 3 bulbs flood the room with a nice, warm glow. Very cool.<br /><br />PROS:<br />The design is quite impressive; manufacturing looks top notch; bulb delivers a very warm incandescent-like glow that is light-years away from the previous CFL bulbs I add (fluorescent, yuk). I am impressed.<br /><br />CONS:<br />Recycling facilities do not know what to with these once they go out.<br /><br />TAKE HOME<br />At that price point and with that performance, picking these over any other bulb is a no-brainer. Highly recommended.
5.0	Just what I imagined from the photo and description.  Very well made.
5.0	We love the extra depth of this sink. The stainless steel is high quality, no discoloration or rust after 6 months of use. The sink comes with a wire rack for the bottom of the bowl which keeps your dishes clear of the drain. This has proven to be so handy and eliminates standing water in our sink when we leave dishes inside.<br />For the money this is a very well made sink that should stand up to many years of use.
5.0	I used this product while refinishing some antique dining chairs.  Needless to say with all of the spindles and rounded edges I did not want to brush on poly.  The spray of this product is fine enough to discourage runs, but thick enough for great coverage.  I'll probably never brush on poly ever again.
5.0	Arrived sooner than expected. Love this piece, it's exactly what we were looking for.
5.0	I have been to every hardware store within a twenty mile radius of my home and found nothing along this line. All motion sensor lights I could find were electric. I wanted something powerful, easy to install, and would operate anywhere but especially in a power outage. The price is right and I have purchased 6 of these wonderful units and given some to my children....I highly recommend them...Author Joyce Bishop Morris
5.0	perfect replacement for my aquarium actinic lights.
5.0	Instead of using two to four regular 60 watt bulds at 120 to 240 watts or two to four 11 watt flourecent bulds at 22 to 44 watts.  I use four of these at 6 watts  on my vanity light in my bathroom.  Eletric bill have gone done alot!!!!!!!  It's just enough lighting for me and at a good price.  Remember that they are not as bright as regular light bulds but they will save you a lot of money in the log term.
5.0	This stuff really works.  We have tried many hand creams over the years and by far this one seemed to work the fastest.  It helps if you put on before bed that way you know your hands are clean and O'Keeffe's Working Hands Cream can do it's job.
5.0	A good selection of sizes. I always use these for hanging pictures or plates. These items can be found in stores but not in the different sizes that Amazon offers.
5.0	I lose these levers. I replaced every handle throughout my entire house with them i liked them so much! They look very updated and they look much more expensive then they actually were! Easy to install as well.
5.0	We wanted a tall, shiny faucet, but didn't want to pay a fortune for it. Amazon knows me so well that they actually sent me an email featuring this one. I ordered it, it got here fast and I put it in the next day. It only took me, a 50+ year old woman, about ten minutes to install it, with no leaks!<br /><br />Other reviewers are correct when they say that getting the old one out is the hardest part. It took me about an hour of contorting and cussing, but Peerless included a helpful little booklet to help with that part of the process.Ten minutes later I had a brand new shiny faucet that is high enough to fill even my largest pot. I'm very pleased with it and recommend Peerless - this is a nice item.
5.0	Perfect fit, washer fixed.
5.0	I learned about this filter some years ago after reading Natural Cures they don't want You to know about by Kevin Trudeau.<br />This filter lasts for two years instead of the 8-12 months like many others on the market.<br />The company went out of business and I have spent the last three years trying to locate this filter.<br />I was skeptical when I saw it on Amazon...advertised...opened and barely used and for an unbelievable price under $80.00 when the original was $200.00 +.<br />This filter saved my hair, skin and health. Already I can tell the difference.<br />Thank You for fulfilling one of my deepest wishes.<br />Best filter ever!!!
5.0	This light is pretty sweet!  Mounts smooth and near flush to the ceiling and works great!  We needed something for a low clearance ceiling, and I am not disappointed.  No skull cracker here, just a smooth bump in the ceiling to spare my follicly challenged dome.
5.0	My husband bought this for our son's room to keep the cats out of the crib & off the changing table. It works perfect. It's easy to walk through, closes fast & all the way down, & the cats are afraid to walk through it. Easy, fast installation. I woild recommend this product!
5.0	I'm pretty happy with this nightlight outlet.  I got it because I have small children who like to pull out and otherwise mess with night lights.  That's dangerous and also always results in my nightlights getting lost.<br /><br />I previously purchased the levitron one of these...looks the same but it's $5 cheaper and it is noticeably dimmer.  The levitron would be good for a smaller room but I wanted something with more light, for a big room.  I moved the levitron around the corner and am now happy to see this flooding the room with light.<br /><br />It's adjustable, which is nice.  You should be able to make it work in whatever configuration you want.  The light is on the yellow side of white while the levitron is on the blue side.  Both are LED.<br /><br />The initial setup of this guy was a bit of a hassle.  Hold the button down for 15 seconds (or more) and it flashes, which changes it from always on or always off mode to the mode where it sense darkness.  Hold it down while the light is on to adjust the brightness.  Sounds simple but it's confusing because it's not responsive.  Pressing the button turns it on and off.  It communicates back by blinking.  Overall, I would have preferred some mechanical switches on the back to set the mode.<br /><br />Anyway, once you have it set up, it works well.  It doesn't turn on and off instantly like the levitron.  There's a delay.  Also this unit requires a much darker room before it turns on.  All the lights have to really be off and it has to really be dark outside.  Anyway it works well for my use and I recommend it.<br /><br />I'll probably keep this one in the great room and get a couple more levitrons for places I want to light up but that don't require as many lumens.  This is adjustable, but why pay more for a product that puts out more light if you don't need the extra light?
5.0	Fan arrived as scheduled and in good shape.  Installed easily, runs quietly and effectively.
5.0	Fit in my candle warm perfectly.  Was back up and running quickly.  I would recommend this product for a replacement  bulb.
5.0	Easy to follow and accurate instructions.  Mark your wires and read instructions - easy does it.  Nice price for a 7 day programable thermostat.  You can spend more but why?
5.0	Our previous Kohler spout finally stopped working, mostly due to our hard water where I live, the stem started to be difficult to move up and down.  The construction of this spout is much nicer than what you can get at the local hardware store.  Simple slip on style.
5.0	Love the light. The color is a little off of what I thought it would be but it is very functional and great options.
5.0	Love these bulbs.  Find it much clearer and brighter than other types of bulbs.  Not happy with the newer type bulbs.  Feel the light is too dim for my eyes.  Would order more if available
5.0	I have several Hansgrohe products.  I love this sturdy design.
5.0	As advertisedAs advertised, this product was the best price I found and really works as it is intended to. I am satisfied.
5.0	Description was excellent! Item as described.
5.0	Exactly as described and pictured.  Have had it for 4 years now and still looks new. Held up thru all the Florida heat, humidity and stormy weather. Looks great and I get lots of complements.
5.0	Worked perfectly well. I was able to fix the old unit and saved a lot of money by not having to buy a new microwave. Thanks
5.0	Works well to stabilize the wood in my turning projects.
5.0	Worked right out of the box, outstanding, would recommend, least cost no code changes needed, very happy with the purchase
5.0	Worked well, installed easily. Like the broader range compared to my original controller.
5.0	Just what I was expecting.  This was an exact match to my 10 year old pallet.  Saved me a bunch instead of Purchasing a new tool case.
5.0	I really like this lamp. It's not bright enough to be a reading lamp,but its a nice accent lamp. The speaker is very clear. Today my niece saw this in my room and needless to say I no longer have a lamp,it's found a new home .
5.0	I uses this for my autistic daughter and she love it. When she is upset I put in the lamp and she enjoyed dancing around the lights.
5.0	Very easy to install.  Works great!
5.0	Access Lighting 20660-BS Zenon 1-light wall sconce, brushed steel w/opal glass is as pretty up as you see in the picture. My husband said it was very easy to install, and it has a lower profile than the last sconce we had, so maybe he won't break it. The quality is nice for the price!!
5.0	fast delivery and they really work
5.0	I've had my RO unit installed now for a couple months and enjoy it very much!  The water taste is excellent!<br /><br />When I was installing the system, I was really impressed how much I received for the money paid.  And most of it is already assembled.  I only needed to connect the tubing to the cold water supply and to the faucet, which is very nice.<br /><br />All the little tubes from filter to filter are pre-assembled from the factory.<br /><br />The only problem I had was the UV light.  It worked fine, but actually made the water taste very bad.  I have no idea if that is true for everyone's water.  My water is deep well water in the South Florida area that is high in sulfur.<br /><br />iSpring was excellent with their customer service and offered me a two year supply of filters if I would return the light to them.  That was a fair trade.<br /><br />In spite of my troubles I gave the purchase and product 5 stars because I believe my well water simply reacted badly to the UV light.
5.0	Fit right in and at a good price too.
5.0	"I bought a cheap 6 piece set from Harbor Freight that still burned oak a little when drilling holes.  I bought this set because I needed the larger sizes.  They are flutted different to raise and remove the wood chips - thus no burning of wood.  They cut through oak like a hot knife through butter.  I was drilling holes 2\\"" to 2-1/2\\"" deep on an oak block made up of four 3/4\\"" thick oak boards.  The bits arrived in mint condition and I used 9 of the 16 bits and they were all sharp and cut nice clean holes.  I was making a tool caddy for all my fly tying tools and cement bottles, the larger holes of 1\\"", 1-1/4\\"", 1-1/2\\"" and 2\\"" came out so smooth I did not even have to sand down inside the holes.  For the money you can't beat this set.  I went to the local hardware store and they wanted $18 for a 1\\"" bit and $23-$27 each for the 1-1/4\\"", 1-1/2\\"" and 2\\"" bit sizes.  I paid 1/3 the cost with shipping and got 16 bits with a cool storage/display case.  For the casual wood worker this would be a great set.  The hex shanks are nice and so far all the bits I used ran true and square in a drill press."
5.0	They work great, the strobes are a little faster than the last ones I bought but I think it might be the batteries. Either way I love them!
5.0	I hesitated to buy this due to the comments about it being slow.  It is a little bit slower than my 1/2 HP Liftmaster on the door next to it, about 4 seconds on an 8 foot door, not enough to bother me.  The installation was easy, I watched two videos on Youtube before I got it and I hardly had to open the directions.  I highly recommend watching them.  Very quiet operation, the kids don't have openers for the Sommer, so they have to use the noisy Liftmaster (no sneaking in late).
5.0	I Really Like ( thumbs up) this lamp. It is easy to assemble for technically challenged such as myself and the light is so nice. I use for reading and knitting. I am pleased.
5.0	These helped fix my garaged door. It would be nice to see some better designed cogs though.They seem to go out for a lot of people in general.
5.0	This was a replacement for my security system and after charging it cleared my default codes. It worked as advertised.
5.0	Easy to use and works well.
5.0	My daughter wanted a touch of Tennessee in her house in Chicago.  She loved them. They were the quality she expected.
5.0	Lots of bungees in different sizes. They seemed well made. They have and will continue to be very useful. Thanks
5.0	We have a long front yard and no nearby outlets. These were perfect for our fence for Christmas. They worked immediately and all season. I loved that there were different modes, so it was never boring. We will most likely buy more for next year for different areas.
5.0	I used it upside down for a trash can modal like the cabinetmakers do with suspended trash can.  Very Strong
5.0	I know alot of people said that they had a heck of a time getting the blister packs & wrappings off.  I didn't think it was bad at all.  I seen alot worst.  Just had a screwdriver & pliers for the staples holding the plastic end caps for the packing. Even the film that is on the rod itself came off fairly easy.  I am very pleased with this rod set.  The Antique Brass color is beautiful.  The matching brackets are heavy & plenty strong enough to hold up any curtains that you may buy.  Mine are 80&#34;W x 84&#34;L for a patio door.  Only needed 2 rods. (comes with 3).  A regular diameter one & the smaller diameter one.  The rod is plenty strong too.  My curtains slide effortlessly back & forth. I think the price is very reasonable for such a well made product.  And if they is a wall on one of the sides that make you wonder if you can make it fit, these end caps are pretty flat.  You only need about 1'' of space for the cap.  Putting it up was really easy too.  About 20 mins.  I would highly recommend this product.
5.0	This looks beautiful and sticks very well
5.0	Good value and quality.
5.0	These are really nice. The lights are very bright. They look really nice at the edge of my landscaping.
5.0	Same thing about the matching set without locks on it. Difficult to tell which way is up, but it's a beautiful set. Seems durable enough and it's easy to swap out with other doorknobs. Having these makes it easy for my toddler to open and close doors, which can be a good thing compared with the round handles.
5.0	My light bulbs arrived quickly after ordering. They work fine. There just light bulbs, what else can I say?
5.0	Fit perfectly.  Exact replacement.
5.0	second set of stickers we bought for my son's newly decorated spongebob room, these are much better quality but still transparent - so be careful if applying to dark walls because colors will bleed through from the wall.  THey stick much better than the other brand I bought. On wood, these almost don't want to budge, it's the highly shiny acrylic I painted on my son's room that cause some of the ends to lift, it's not the product, the ones I put on his dresser and bed are perfect, so if you have flat walls or plan on putting this on wood, it's a must, really great designs. Fast shipping too, thank you.
5.0	I really like the light this sharp-looking lamp emits - it's not yellow light, which I hate, but a bright light similar to daytime light.  The easy-touch switch is readily accessible, located on the base of the lamp. One can move the hand along the base from left to right in order to arrive at the brightness  one desires.  After several years of being mildly annoyed at the inconvenience of the on switch on my last desk lamp, this switch location is a relief.<br /><br />I also like the looks of the lamp.  It's really ultramodern and it still fits in with the traditional (and rather messy) decor of my desk.  The fact that I'm saving energy while enjoying the benefits of the lamp make it a real hit in my book.<br /><br />Strongly recommended!
5.0	It does every thing I thought it would do. Very happy with it
5.0	AWESOME & very fitting glasses! GREAT colors and great style! GREAT for anyone who needs glasses for wrok! A+++ glasses! One of the best I have worn!
5.0	I think the decal says all that needs to be said!
5.0	The pans were identical to the original ones in fit and quality.  The price was the reason I gave these a try.
5.0	Have only been using this for a few days. Hooked it up yesterday to new bulb. No problems using different settings. Bulb  doesn't flicker at all even at the dimmest. No hum. The tiny light on it is nice in the dark.  Stays on all the time funny it goes dimmer the brighter the light is on. No problems like I read about with other ones. Price is good. Will see how it holds up and post if problem in future.
5.0	Just what I needed to make my magnetic spice rack!
5.0	Smells great!! Bought all kinds and last long. The smell is strong too which I like because it fills up the whole house.
5.0	Bought this to replace a 600 watt dimmer that was getting too hot for the customer.
5.0	This matches our existing light covers well. After our old one broke in a storm we were glad to find it. Does the trick and looks good!
5.0	Pros: very bright, my plants (cacti) are looking great, does not get too hot<br />Cons: hums a bit<br /><br />I will definitely buy this again.
5.0	I bought this to backup files in case I needed to reformat or if I needed to transfer a mass of files somewhere and didn't want to use the smaller flash sticks. This one was pretty cheap and offered all the memory I figured I'd need. It hasn't failed me so far, and I did end up having to reformat windows so it was a big help to know that all my ebooks and documents were backed up and I wouldn't have to add insult to injury.
5.0	The lanterns were exactly what I expected.  They are made with sturdy materials so they can be used again. The size is good also.  I would order them again and recommend them for your event.
5.0	Nice idea to have another security system. With the increased home intruder reports. it makes a person feel a little more safer.
5.0	Completely satisfied - worked just as described.
5.0	This is an Impressive gadget. When pulling the trigger, give a nice tug so the full pressure would go through the piping.
5.0	great filter for my Samsung
5.0	The whole bar is well made and the included screws were perfect.  Long and strong.  Took just a few minutes to install and it's very solid.
5.0	"I bought this wine caddy basket to hold 2 lamps made from recycled wine bottles. I wanted something that would make it look like 1 lamp and keep the bottles from being easily knocked over. This works perfectly!    It's about 14.25\\"" H including handle, 7.75\\"" W, 4.25\\"" D. Holds 2 standard sized wine bottles. The frame, handle, and feet are a very sturdy metal, the trellis design part is flexible metal. Lightweight. Antique bronze-like finish.    This is more of a craft store type item and is unlikely to fool anyone into thinking it's high-end, but it's perfect for my use and a great value for the reasonable price.    A note of caution, I would only use this as a decorative item. I would not try to use this to transport bottles of wine unless using padding of some kind to keep them in place. Otherwise, they wobble around too much when the basket is moved. The basket would easily fall over if transported in a vehicle without something to hold it in place.    Pics shared above."
5.0	Looking for a mechanical timer for low-voltage trigger for electronic fireplace. This works fine. Increments (up to six hours)  are great for a fireplace timer - as others (1 hour or 24 hours) are either too limited or too long.  Typically set for 2 hours and forget it!<br /><br />Easy to install. Choice in colors is good - have one in white and one in bone.
5.0	I live in Los Angeles and it's well documented and widely known that we are in a severe drought. Originally, LA had five different water sources ranging from upstate to the Owens River. So the water changes periodically and it can be quite hard in quality. That really took a toll on my hair. I have brown hair and have never colored my hair once in my entire life. My hair started to turn a brassy, orange color and got very dried out and nothing seemed to help. So I got this filter and cut my hair and started fresh. I haven't had any problems. This shower head also protects from bacterial growth or bacteria in general. It's a great filter. I change it as recommended. It's very easy to use. All you do is pop it into the corresponding shower head, making sure not to let the rubber washers move off (there's no reason they should but they ensure that the filter stays in place so that it is effective). I will say that buying and using this filter is one of the smartest moves I've ever made. Using this shower filter is a lot cheaper than dying and treating my hair, and in general I have a better shower experience. No matter where I live I can still use this filter. I think this is a smart buy and if you are on the fence about what shower head and filter to get I'd say this is a safe purchase. It's effective and the price point is very reasonable. You'll be happy you got this and when you need to replace it you won't be set back as much as with other filters. Good luck!
5.0	I've used this switch since 2007. It looks similar to the regular hardwired switches which blends in more with my other switches.  This also works nicely as a 3-way switch.  I bought 2 switches with the same channel.  So both switches can control one receiver.  This way I can have one switch on the two different entrances to control the living room light.<br /><br />If you need to operate different lights throughout the house make sure you get different channels otherwise the matching switches will control both matching receivers.<br /><br />I live in a condo.  One year later one of my neighbors bought a switch that uses the same channel because my lights would go on and off without me doing the switching.  I didn't know which neighbor it was, so I would flip the switch on and off to hopefully let them know someone else has a similar device with the same channel.  After two days, they got the hint and I have not had the problem since.<br /><br />I want to add another pair as a 3-way switch for my dining room.  I bought my original pair from Home Depot, but they no longer carry it locally.  The trouble with ordering on-line is you don't know what channel's they will be sending you.  In my case I needed a pair of matching channels.<br /><br />Another pro or con, depending how you look at it is the 9V battery. This is more common and easier to find than the 12V battery some of the other wireless switches are using.<br /><br />I really love the switch. However, I wish we could order it on-line and specify the channel. I thought about giving this a 4 star, but the switch works fine.  Just the on-line ordering mechanism is not refined enough to specify what I want.
5.0	This a quality cord, well made in the USA, at a great price.<br /><br />Shipping was FAST Will buy another one whenever i need one.
5.0	Easy to install and works well
5.0	I used this for the fiberglasss floor in my boat and it worked really good. it has not peeled with lots of use in the last few months and its really easy to clean
5.0	We noticed that our water and ice was starting to have a sulfur smell, and sure enough the Change Filter light lit up on our Frigidaire Gallery 26 Cu. Ft. Side-by-Side refrigerator. Ordered these replacement filters and they arrived quickly, brand new and in manufacturers original packaging.<br /><br />For those that can't find their manual anymore, these are not that hard to change:<br /><br />First, though it looks like you should be able to just pull your old filter straight of its holder inside the 'fridge... don't! What you have to do is push IN on your old filter to unlock it's spring-lock mechanism, and then it will pop partially out. Once that happens than you can easily remove the filter from its dock. If you have to strain pulling it out, something is wrong and you could damage the unit.<br /><br />Next, take the protective plastic covers off the new filter's nipples and insert the filter into the dock by matching the flange on the filter to the groove in the dock... push the filter into the dock until it resets the spring-lock (you should hear the click). Let go and it should settle into locked position.<br /><br />Lastly, get a pitcher and run water for about 5 minutes (three of our big pitchers full) to get all the loose particles out of the filter and your refrigerator water system.<br /><br />UPDATE: December 25, 2014: Purchased more of these and they work perfectly. No issues at all, and will be back when the ones we have now expire. We have been getting about 6 months use from each.<br /><br />Recommended<br /><br />That's it!<br /><br />Once again our water and ice have no smell at all and the ice is crystal clear. We have had this refrigerator for about 18 months now and have gone through three filters (about one every 6 months), never having a leak or other malfunction.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
5.0	I'm the type to worry about the few negative reviews even if there are thousands of good ones.  After using for about a month I have found nothing to worry about and everything is better than expected.
5.0	The lampshades I bought from Lamps Plus are absolutely beautiful.  I can't believe I'm saying that about lamp shades.  They appear to be very well made and look gorgeous in my bedroom.  I would definitely recommend this store to anyone out there looking for well made shades.
5.0	Loved the lamps, great quality! Trans Globe is really a good company we have purchased other items from them.
5.0	the desk lamp Tron would own! digital and stuff.
5.0	Good quality item. Was exactly what I was looking for. More than enough rope to get the job done right.
5.0	I bought this to replace an older craftsman table saw that had a bent arbor. First off, this is a heavy saw. After it's all assembled and after you add the cast iron wings, it's almost 400lbs. So make sure you get the move-able base to go with it.    The saw itself works great! I have never been able to cut stock so precise. The insert is deep enough so you can make your own zero clearance inserts. The riving knife is extremely easy to take in and out, because they're are no tools required. The fence allows you to reset the ruler starting up against the blade. So if you add a sacrificial fence, you won't have to second guess your measurements. When decided between the Aluminum and Professional T-Bar fence, make sure to get the professional one. It's very heavy duty and much beefier than a beisemeyer table fence. I haven't noticed any deflection what so ever.    Overall, this table saw is incredible, and I'm very happy with my purchase. I also have the peace of mind that my kids won't have a accident when they use it later down the road.    One last thing - Make sure to put a good layer of paste wax on it to prevent the cast iron from rusting. because my old table saw was already pretty rusty, I forgot this step, and end up regretting it. Some steel wool and a couple coats of Johnson's Paste Wax have taken care of it.
5.0	I used this for my outdoor Christmas lights and decorations and it worked perfectly. The best feature has to be the timer. You just set it, which is so easy just turn the dial, and forget it. Each night the lights came on at the same time and went off at the same time and I did not have to do a thing. Very happy with this purchase!
5.0	Factory sealed.  Arrived like new, as it should. Good product for the price. Like the three adjustable settings on the shower head.
5.0	Worked great for the price. Can't beat it.
5.0	works pretty well, i have a few of them, i am quite happy with the way they work
5.0	Was beautiful. .took two hours to put up but wellwworth it
5.0	Easy to install.  Using it on a pellet store and could be for any situation where thermostat control was required that uses a 2 line  unit  Highly recommend it.
5.0	The Chamberlain 940D Wireless Keyless Entry System is simple to install and easy to use. I put it up in less than five minutes and had it running right away. The instructions are right on the flip up panel so you can set temporary passwords when needed that can be set for the number of hours you want it to work or with the number of attempts to open the door. I will never lock myself out of my house again! ;)
5.0	Very easy to use, dries super clear and very sturdy.  I love that it's capped so I can reuse it.
5.0	just what the doctor ordered.
5.0	I have had this Planer for well over a year now and frankly I don't see what more you could look for in a planer.  The unit produces a perfect finish.  I especially like the cast iron table.  My previous unit, a Powermatic, had rollers and they are dangerous as your fingers could get caught in the rollers as the wood exits.    I think it is a little on the noise side, but they all are and you need good ear protection.  One definite requirement is a good dust collection system.  Overall, i would highly recommend it.   I did not buy my unit through Amazon.  I purchased it through Brians Tool in Enfield, CT.  Note:  One important thing i did want to mention.  If you have any questions call shop fox.  They have one of best customer service departments I have ever spoken with.  They will spend the necessary time to answer any questions you have.
5.0	One month and still hanging strong
5.0	There is nothing wrong with these locks. They come with two keys which both open both locks. All the mechanisms were smooth as better. A good buy.
5.0	I got the item as ordered. And it is working fine ever since it was installed. I am happy I ordered this item.
5.0	This pumpt came up to all me expectations amd fit in the area where the old pump was located.  The abaillity to do its job is excellent.
5.0	One of my file cabinets is in an unlit area.  By placing the Super Bright, Battery Desk Lamp above the cabinet, I can easily locate the files I need to update.
5.0	These door knobs look beautiful on my bi fold closet doors.  They give an elegant appearance and I like them very much.
5.0	We bought these as a temporary window covering option right after we purchased our house.  The worked great.  Easy to install, use and remove.  Simply measure your window opening cut the shade and stick into the opening using the self adhesive tape and you are ready to go.  The supplied clips are a great way to hold the shade open and to close remove the clip.  These are truly blackout shades because little to no light gets around the edges if you measured and cut correctly (great if you work night).  The shades also look good from the both the inside and outside and don't feel like a temporary window treatment.  We had a two year old at the time we bought the house and the shades held up to his punishment (pulling, pushing, driving cars on the window sill).  I would recommend these shades for anyone looking for a quick and easy window treatment.  Great product.
5.0	Buying a photo-sensitive light control with good reviews probably means buying one without any reviews.  There seems to be a wide range of success with these units, and most of them rate badly.  I have this one on a high porch light with a CFL and it works great on dusk/dawn setting.  The timer function works great, but there is a serious flaw.  Since there is no manual switch on the unit for the timer, you set it by the number of times you press a button on the unit.  It remembers that setting... until you turn the light switch off.  It then defaults to dusk/dawn setting.  I used the timer for a month or two until the light switch got turned off by accident.  I decided against getting the ladder back out to re-set the timer, but the dusk/dawn sensor has been working flawlessly.
5.0	PURCHASED OVER AND OVER
5.0	I have put these in both of our downstairs bathrooms.  Kids love to slam toilet lids - this lid will save you from cracked porcelain.  The only issue is I now assume every toilet has a slow closing lid...
5.0	Bought this for the corner of my living room. It fit perfect was easy for me to put together and they lighting is a nice smooth light across the room. :) very happy with my purchase
5.0	Not cheap, but an awesome shower head.  Would buy it again
5.0	I was glad to find these through Amazon and for a good price too. The delivery was fast and now I save energy cost with these on my roof vents
5.0	It was exactly what I needed
5.0	Item arrived just as described and was easy to install. I would highly recommend this product to anyone needing to replace their icemaker.
5.0	"We had this HOMAK \\""Security Cabinet\\"" for about three months before loosing the keys and needed access to the contents. Fortunately I had somehow only locked the top lock, but it still took my son and I roughly 45 minutes with a large crowbar, big hammer, and a few of chisels to get the door open. Keep in mind that we did this in our own house, were not overly concerned with making noise, and we used the \\""play\\"" at the bottom of the door (since it wasn't locked) to get the chisels and eventually the crowbar into working position, which not have been possible if the bottom had in fact been locked. Could we still have gotten it open? Yes, quite sure we could have, but it would certainly have taken a lot longer.<br /><br />This really is not a safe (but not priced like one either), but rather a well secured cabinet that does hold eight rifles and has a small shelf for accessories or ammo. Some minor assembly is required, but nothing too involved and taking only a few minutes.<br /><br />I am quite pleased with the difficulty it took to open this without the keys (even with only one of the locks locked) and will be replacing it with the same model.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />CFH"
5.0	"My wife's interest in a retrofit type of bidet piqued my interest and I ended up deciding on a Luxe, primarily because of the reviews here. We had initially looked at some that were integrated with a seat system, but those were, frankly, out of our price range at this time. The Luxe seems to be a great value.    Installation was easy--about 45 minutes for someone who has light experience with residential type plumbing. These do not require a real plumber to install, but if you have no experience with hooking up a sink or a toilet connection, I would suggest getting someone who does to do it for you. Not that you couldn't figure it out, but there is a certain amount of \\""feel\\"" involved in working with those connections and it is possible to under-tighten or over-tighten the connections which could cause you regrettable problems down the road. You don't want to come home one day to a flooded bathroom.    OK--in our case it came down to two issues. 1) Get the one with the hot water connection? 2) Get the double nozzle version?    If you live in a northern climate and, during he winter months, ever turn on your cold water and say, \\""WOO HOO, that is some COLD water!\\"", you're gonna want the warm water connection. That is, unless you have a walalala with no nerve endings. (You can pretty much figure out what I mean by that.) The warm water connection actually ties into the hot water stop valve under your vanity, so it's not like any significant plumbing modifications are required--assuming that your vanity is pretty close to the toilet. If not, it can still be done, you just might need to buy some longer tubing. The product comes with the necessary T's to tie in. They even give you a pair of nice new, metal reinforced connection hoses.    Regarding whether or not to get the double nozzle version--oh, you know this is such a delicate area. OK--we found that with our toilet seat (which happens to be one of those vinyl covered, cushioned types), the \\""sighting\\"" was dead on. Thewife feels that choosing the double nozzle version was a good decision and adds that the sighting is dead on for both barrels.    Insertion of the bidet assembly does raise the back of the toilet seat about 1/2\\"". It's no biggie to get used to. As a matter of fact, I like it because I wear bifocals and it makes it easier to read.    So. There you have it. Hopefully some information to help you make an informed decision...and without video! You're Welcome!!!!!!!!"
5.0	Solid construction and reliable!<br /><br />Much better than the quality you will get with the big national brands at Home Depot or Lowe's and a better price.<br /><br />Highly recommended if you are looking for a great quality kitchen faucet at a fair price.<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!
5.0	This was a gift to my dentist.  He LOVED it!
5.0	I bought this for a 10&#34; Moen rain showerhead that sat too close to the wall when attached directly to the protruding shower arm.  With the Adjustable extension, I can extend the wide shower head up and out from the wall.  The 10&#34; fixture can now be pointed straight down or at slight angle, like a rain showerhead should.  It also allows room for a hanging shower caddy which won't be dripped on by the shower head either.<br /><br />I didn't have any problems one might be concerned about with a budget fixture.  The 10&#34; showerhead is not tremendously heavy but it's certainly not light either, especially with the torque on the adjustable arm being extended outward.  The two screws tighten very well and I have not had to reposition a drooping showerhead since I put it up.  I would not, however, suggest this as a fixture for constant adjustment.  The screws tighten down well but require significant pressure to free up again.  I wouldn't want to do that daily, pushing the fixture up after a shorter housemate positioned it down.<br /><br />I have no problems with leaks and the included plumbers tape is a nice touch so you don't have to buy a whole roll for the job.  There was no noticeable decrease in water pressure either although the tubing on the fixture is narrower than a standard shower arm.  Rainshowers aren't the most demanding test here though.  But as other reviewers noticed, the 12&#34; is the total length but not a statement of any effective reach. The straight pipe is only 8&#34; between the pivot joints.
5.0	Great , it works just like the old one. Perfect, good deal!
5.0	Good service--good item
5.0	Thanks: My old planes are users and being able to replace the broken handle has extended its life by many years.
5.0	So far these light have not burned out. I know I wrote a review on these lights and I might has said they burned out after 30 days but once I replaced them after 60 days in use their stilling lighting up my front yard at night. I do recommend you clean lights with some light alcohol on a cloth to remove finger prints from the light and to install use the same alcohol cloth finger prints.
5.0	I think this is one of the best LED bulbs on the market at this price quality and performance.  800 lumen for 10.5 w is about 86 lumen per watt which is one of the top efficiency levels.<br /><br />Check out the Astersheen blog
5.0	Great filter and very easy to replace! When I first turn on the water I have to wait a few seconds as it bubbles initially, but after that it is fine.
5.0	What a beautiful sink! We are remodeling our kitchen and purchased this sink. I like the racks that come with it and the modernized look. Kraus is a good name and the price on Amazon was fabulous!
5.0	I finally got around to using this.  You can see the difference as it goes about making dirt easier to separate from the coil.  Make sure you take all the precautions in the instructions.  You should not take cleaning chemicals for granted.  I used a chemical grade sprayer with the mixture as recommended in the instructions.  It has no real smell to it.  I will make this an annual use item.
5.0	Great fan timer, good price.  Our four mechanical (spring wound) bathroom exhaust fan timers have started to fail.  We tried a Woods timer in our &#34;power room&#34; but guests didn't use it because the one button operation wasn't clear to the unfamiliar.  We replaced it with the Leviton LTB30-1LZ which is self explanatory in operation.
5.0	I got a little concerned after reading some reviews wherein they encountered problems installing the Bidet. Fortunately, mine went smoothly. Everything you need is in the package. Follow the instructions, refer to the step-by-step assembly picture and you're set. Oh, you just need to have a Phillips screw, a drill and a 5-150mm adjustable wrench. Overall, I'm satisfied with this product & highly recommend it.
5.0	The freezer came fast. I installed it and it work great. Thanks loads.
5.0	This isn't too hard like I thought it would be and it isn't as cold as I thought either My bathroom is a little chilly and it don't seem to bother this seat at all it is comfortable too.
5.0	best bulb I ever evaluated, in terms of max brightness (Lux), lowest heat, lowest power consumption, and not too expensive.
5.0	This Krazy Glue with the All Purpose Brush works great. I use it for various household tasks, some that require quite a lot of glue. The brush in this bottle works well and helps coat entire surfaces for adhesion. One of the better examples I have is using this to keep wheel caps on my car and it is still holding, even through rain, heat, and wind. The only disadvantage I could see would be the relatively small size of this bottle, and might not serve the needs of someone who might use this on a daily basis. But for basic household use it works just fine and will last.
5.0	We use our water tester all the time.  We have not had any issues with it.  It always reads accurately for us.
5.0	I tried this on the screens in my camper and it worked wonderfully. I can see through my screens again.
5.0	Great night light and conversation piece.
5.0	Bought these to replace a couple that I lost. Very easy to clone, just be careful you don't do it backwards and clone the blank one to the good one...wiping it out. I caused myself a pain having to generate new codes when I did this by not paying attention.
5.0	Works well nice DC motor
5.0	I want these in every single room in my house.  The soft, twinkly effect of these lights makes everything better!
5.0	fit perfectly, went together fine and does not leak.
5.0	I cannot believe how awesome these look!!  LOVE them.  I put two of these on my transom windows in our old Victorian home and I am SUPER pleased.
5.0	love them so did my friends great  stickers
5.0	I really like to fact that I can easily rekey these locks in minutes without needing a locksmith. They really hold their setting, too.<br />I wish I could buy these lock cylinders for surface mount deadbolt locks.
5.0	Met all expectation.  Very timely delivery..
5.0	very user friendly great product
5.0	I was VERY leery of these shades because I have never purchased a &#34;Paper Shade&#34; in my life, and wasn't sure that paper would be strong enough. After reading reviews I decided to give them a try.<br /><br />I ordered 3M Scotch Heavy Duty Mounting Tape, 1-Inch by 50-Inch with the shades because I wanted to be sure they stuck.<br /><br />I was able to cut them down to the ODD sizes I needed. My dining room has 4 windows - 2 in the center are considerably larger then the ones on each side of the 2 bigger ones. I was able to cut one shade in half and use those 2 pieces in each side window, and I was able to cut off about 4 inches of 2 more to fit the center windows.<br /><br />These were simple to install. Measure your window, cut with either sharp scissors or an Exacto knife.Pull off the strip covering the sticky strip &#60;I did that and then added the 3M Double Sided Tape&#62;, then simply put them up. These curtains, all 6 of them, come with clips that you put on the bottom of the shade to pull up and down the shade, without touching the paper. It took me an hour to put all 4 shades up, and I'm 100% Disabled so I don't usually do this stuff. But I was excited to see them up and didn't want to wait for my husband to come home from work to do it.<br /><br />I am actually pretty impressed with these shades. They look Amazing! You'd never know they are paper unless you get right up to them and feel them. They are definitely a high quality paper. I had these ugly, ugly plastic mini blinds that I paid a fortune for since they were such odd sizes, and these Paper Shades look like I spent even more!<br /><br />They aren't light &#34;Blocking&#34;, but they do filter it. I have more light now then I did with the plastic mini blinds. It's a really nice &#34;glow&#34; light. I like that there's no string/handles, they're cordless. They provide complete privacy &#60;nobody can see in or out&#62; while not blocking out the light.<br /><br />What I like best though is No. 1 - the price is perfect! Where can you get 6 shades for under $40??? And No.2 - I can do this myself! And quickly! AND with no help from anyone. And for someone like myself who has to count on someone to help with almost everything - that's pretty awesome to me!<br /><br />Definitely give these a try!1 - the price is perfect!

5.0	Flushes like a champion, no matter what comes out of you.  Either end, if you know what I mean.  Word.
5.0	I have a pinball machine and putting these under the legs makes it so easy to move the machine over the carpet in my basement. Very useful on both tiles and carpet.  Moving a 300 pound pinball by myself has been a life saver :)
5.0	I ordered this from home depot 3 times and each time they sent me the wrong product. I searched 5 different stores (including the store where I purchased the ceiling fan) to find the Lithonia bulb but nobody sold them in stores until finally I purchased this one and it was perfect. I am so happy.
5.0	Looks as good as original, maybe better...
5.0	This part is actually NOT the correct part for the faucet that we needed fixed, but it worked anyway. It looks good and I'm very pleased with it. I do praise Delta for being consistent enough in its fixtures that this could work!
5.0	worked great!! Quick shipping!!
5.0	Very bright and cheap way of creating up lighting for a party. Was surprised at how bright this ended up being.
5.0	I have used this on my rental for over two years.  Works great and easy to use.<br /><br />I have a different brand on my other rental and it has not held up as well as this one.
5.0	End grain sealer is a must if you want to slow down the wood from cracking. This product has a mid-range cost and it works as good as any. It is thin enough to sink into the wood, and it dries hard enough that it does not get all over everything around it. I would buy this again.
5.0	Awesome is the only way to describe product also really affordable and cheaper than a local dealer. Loved it.. Loved it.
5.0	This remote does exactly what I expected it to do.  It is a good price for this remote compared to local hardware stores.
5.0	These are the best locks.  Schlage is the best!!!!  You can call costumer service and they will walk you through ANY difficulties you may be having.  We set it to automatic lock, so it locks after 30 sec.  No more forgetting to lock the doors.  EASY to program and change.  I would NOT buy from another company, ever.  I am so impressed with them.  I had a much older version for 13 years that quit working and they just sent me a new one (much newer model) no questions asked (a $106 lock).  WOW, they have my business.  I have one of their locks on every entry door in my house and cabin.  Work GREAT.  Trust me, you will not be disappointed.
5.0	Nothing get's your attention like a flashing light, these things are cool in the since they can flash, or just stay on. My son loves them, and I'm glad since he sticks them on his bike and it lights up flashing down the street  they are magnetic) . He uses them as a night light, and used one at a friends house to mark the bathroom at night, so he could find it in the dark. He tried it in the pool, it is waterproof, but I was soon fishing it out of the filter since it got sucked into the creaper cleaner. We Also use it to put notes on the fridge when we miss each other, you see the flashing note on the fridge, read it and turn it off, my son loves it, he will put a test paper on the fridge flashing to make sure we see it. (only the ones he passes that is) It also tells the note maker that you got the note since they will see it is no longer flashing. I like this since I hate using the phone every 3 min. for trivial things. I see it as a post it note alert button, my kid sees it as a fun toy, with haloween coming up I see them in his costume someplace to mark him better.
5.0	We bought this one plus 4 more to decorate our sons room!  He absoultey loves them.  They were super easy to put on. Will be buying more of these in the future!
5.0	I bought this from Amazon. Came very quickly, a day before I expected it. This fan does a super job. It was very easy to install, probably less than one hour. It comes with rubber mounts to help keep it running quietly. I've had no problems with it at all, works as  expected, and looks wonderful! I highly recommend it.
5.0	received fan blade and motor ahead time and happy about it.  packing was ok.  if needed , will order again.  thanks.  5stars.
5.0	This is a very nice desk lamp-puts light where you need it.  Since my desk is in my bedroom, I use the dimmer feature of the lamp to lower the brightness and leave it on as a night light.
5.0	Easy to program, worked great, took maybe 10 minutes. I can now open my wife's door, turn my light on and off and open and close my door.  I love it.
5.0	Works as advertised. Folds up compactly and unfolds very easily. Works great for hauling items back and forth that otherwise would have to be carried in several trips. Really helped in my recent move.
5.0	I placed this light so when I open the pantry door, it comes right on and only when you need it to.  It's great, I love it!
5.0	I want to put one of these on everything. Works flawlessly. Using it outside for the bug zapper and so far doing wonderful.
5.0	I cut the item a little closer for a better fit and it looked great.  It got noticed at the local bike night several times!!
5.0	Not worth trying to clean. Easier to just order another one..<br />Love my humidifier.. Use it all winter long.
5.0	works perfect for repairing stone bench top.
5.0	I have a lot of Amish made furniture, this works very well
5.0	"This lock was the perfect solution to secure two Kayaks. The cable end fit through the drain ports with room to spare. I bought the lock after reading lock suggestion reviews on a kayak owner website....one reviewer simply stated \\""Python baby!!!!\\"" and I figured it out from there and bought this lock."
5.0	It's a good-short extension cord. The flat plug was nice so it ran close to the wall behind other things in front of it.
5.0	Same as in the stores but a lot cheaper.  Worth it if you plan ahead and are willing to wait,  but shipping was fast.
5.0	Easy installation, works as expected. Found it cheaper at home depot...
5.0	Much wiser in your fuse box than putting in a penny. You will have light without risking a fire.
5.0	We are extremely pleased with this product. It is actually better than we expected.  Good design and good quality.
5.0	Very pleased.. Price and Quality will purchase another Will see how it holds up for the long term. A ok
5.0	Cute lamp!  Works well!
5.0	This is the perfect size to stick in a suitcase so you can have a helpful handle while traveling.
5.0	This thing is great, i have had it insalled for 5 months and the construction is holding up really well. No more cracked knobs
5.0	This bulb puts off a surprising amount of light compared to a regular night light bulb.  I like the fact that it won't burn out for a long, long time.  Some may not like the switch from a yellowish incandescent glow to the clear white light at night, but it helps us find our way better when the lights are out.  Recommended!
5.0	Great little alarm. Nice that the battery was included. Really appreciated that. Works well, right out of the box. Great price/value.as a two/one unit.
5.0	Works perfectly. We only had a light at the top of our stairs so we set two of them up along the stairs and they work great. Light up the entire stairway.
5.0	Bright for a carport. Love that is does not turn on during daylight. Cover between base and sensor is loose but does not affect performance.
5.0	It's an icemaker hose.  It is a decent length and seems high quality.  We use our water and ice daily and have not noticed any weird tastes. Please with the purchase and the price was good.
5.0	Used this on a dock that has been a challenge keeping painted.  This appears to have finally given us a layer that paint will adhere to.
5.0	Love this ladder.<br />Very sturdy and easy to store.
5.0	We love it!  It arrived quickly and was easy to apply.  My daughter spread the different labels out throughout her room (door, bed, etc) and now it's all decked out!  I am really pleased.
5.0	the brightnes was excellent for the use i had it for
5.0	Perfect! Light is consistent, and just the right color.
5.0	does the job, easy to program
5.0	Finally replaced the original shower head installed by the builder. And honestly this one was probably cheaper and definitely worked much better! The water pressure is strong and it's actually cutting down my water bill! If you're looking for a replacement, look no further!
5.0	Holds a charge longer than any  other solar light I own. Brighter than most other lights.  Looks great both day and night.
5.0	"Bought another \\""adjustable\\"" multi-cable stripper similar to this one. The only adjustment it turned out was for the jacket cutter.  It did not work at all on my RG-6Q cable, even though the package indicated it would. I went to the home improvement brick store and found this little gem.  The top has a plastic sliding plate for the 2 types of cable, \\""59\\"" and \\""6\\"". Mine was preset to the 59 position. Didn't notice that until after a few cuts.  The instructions indicate to first select the size cable one larger than your using, make your cuts, then select the size for your cable and cut again.  After trying it out once, I really didn't know what they were talking about because after selecting my cable on the second cut, it did nothing at all.  Did not see the point in attempting to decipher vague instructions.  Threw the instructions away.  What I did is just slide the plastic plate to the size cable I was using..\\""6\\"", and made a cut.  After looking at it I needed to adjust one of the blades a little using the provided wrench.  After a few small tweaks of adjusting the blade, I got the cut right where it should be, and every one after that has been identical, fast, and painless.  The stripper itself is made quite well. It has a clothespin style design, thick plastic, with a rather strong spring holding the cable in place.  Wish I would have found this first and saved the money spent on my first one."
5.0	We ordered five of these lights, some for closets, some for our garage.  They are far more stylish (in my opinion) than the fluorescent tube lights.  The metal is strong and durable and is much heavier than the picture reveals.  The plastic cover is also strong, which is very nice.  We like that the light shines outward in all directions from the top in addition to the light shining downward from the dome.  Very pleased.
5.0	Check valve is plastic but very nice quality. Probably the best I have seen. Nice flapper with sprig steel. Flat side up for horizontal application. Adjustable rubber boots nice clamps included. I used check valve to provide disconnect for easy pump removal. Wish they made a screw in check valve to install right in the pump. Quiet.
5.0	good quality easy to instal
5.0	Does what it's supposed to do and was easy to put in.
5.0	This is really nice just what we expected. Makes a little buzzing sound but that's ok....... The color changing feature is pretty awesome. We love it.
5.0	Outstanding for unclogging hair from sink and tub drains
5.0	"Love my small Ott lamp.  It's perfect for my painting needs.<br />I also have an Ott floor lamp with magnifying glass and large clip.<br />Now I have all I need for \\""surround light\\"".  Ott makes dependable products.<br />No complaints.  A 5 star company."
5.0	Great. Item<br />Saves my garage wall !!!
5.0	i was very happy with the product
5.0	Awesome.  Light, perfectly made, easy to use.  Buy one.
5.0	While my purpose for this purchase may be a bit different than some, it still deserves a great review.  We have been refurbishing and refurbishing a 1968 Airstream trailer.  Everything looked shiny and fabulous.... except the logo sign.  Along comes Rust-Oleum paint to the rescue.  After doing some research, we realized this particular color fits the bill.  I was a bit worried as I know some spray paint cans deliver uneven coverage, clogs, drips, etc.  But this stuff went on perfectly, evenly, and with the perfect amount of coverage on each layer.  Definitely recommend!
5.0	Quick and easy care excellent negotiation, client fully recommend this product was what I expected. thank you very much. I hope to continue doing very well as far as luck made ​​an
5.0	Actually cost more to install than what we paid for it.  We are extremely happy with this hood it looks fantastic and works beautifully.  Still haven't had it up long enough to need cleaning.  Might be a little bit more difficult but that is the sacrifice for the style.
5.0	they were great screws I don't exactly what I expected him to do
5.0	This was exactly what I needed, came quickly & was in brand new box.  The price was good too, on the Nutone website it was twice  the cost.
5.0	These handles are great. they have a nice weight to them and look much more expensive than they are. I put them on a dresser that I repainted. These handles complete the look! I also got the Amerock BP53029-G10 Mulholland Knob to go with them, and they match perfectly. Fast shipping, too!
5.0	We have had a lot of compliments on this fan! Really looks beautiful! It is not the quietest fan around, but they indicate that in the description. While it is on the pricier side, I am still very happy with the purchase.
5.0	I love the Prestige Collection.  I have several pieces of the collection, and soon, almost all my lighting in my house will be from the Prestige Collection. I love the swirls on the glass!
5.0	This was the best price online I could find and I was not disappointed!! The gator head is huge which was exactly what I was looking for...
5.0	I ordered these at my mother's request for her windows because she was remodeling her living room space. She loves the look and effect they have on the atmosphere of the room; they add a warmth to the ambiance of the room. It's nice to allow light to come in without feeling exposed. Plus it makes the windows look classy/fancy. Easy application and removal.
5.0	Price is right too! Worked for my old ankle braces that had worn out Velcro. Have held up several months of repeated use.
5.0	The bulbs were great and best price via Internet. Customer service was great. Got a phone call when I had a problem and it was resolved quickly.
5.0	I am not the type of person to write reviews, but I cannot say enough good about this device.     Its LED provides just the right amount of light -- not too dim like many other energy saving LED devices, and night too bright to impact your night vision.    It's perfect for entryways, hallways, etc.  Especially if you have younger children where you or they are up at night.      It costs considerably more than a plug-in nightlight but it is worth it.
5.0	Perfect fit replacement.  Quick shipping.
5.0	I was so happy to realize that a mass produced, standardized, dead simple conduit T-Body was able to perform it's intended function. It really brightened my day.
5.0	This is used to replace the year old filter and all seems great so far
5.0	Love it, still on my wall after years of being there and everyone comments on it; thinking I painted it (ha ha).  Easy to do to.
5.0	I bought this cable for our new dryer.  It was the perfect length and excellent quality.  Not too much to be said about this cable other than it is a great price.  I would not hesitate to buy this again.
5.0	works great and looking forward to the savings
5.0	Well-built, light weight, easy to collapse and to open up.  The handle adjusts to be taller, too.  Great for hauling the plastic tubs around, as pictured.  I use it for art fair set up and break down.  It rolls reasonably well over grassy terrain.  It also does well with heavier items, such as generators, etc.  I love it!
5.0	I have an old Blue Max garage door opener (20+ years old). The Genie dip switch remote was easily configured and now I am living the Queenly life with a garage door at my command again. Couldn't be happier.
5.0	Works great, easy to install, and is keeping is cool.
5.0	This bulb is much brighter than the original bulb that came in my light fixture, even though they are supposed to be identical. So far it's reliable.
5.0	Will work out well in our theme
5.0	Very easy to apply<br />Very cute
5.0	Worked as advertised.  I saw that they didn't work for some people but it appears it either works well or not at all.
5.0	I really like the Energy-Efficient Halogen 90-Watt bulb because I like using Energy-Efficient Products. It is really clear and shines so nicely! I'm glad I got them! Thanks
5.0	Fast shipping was Exactly what I needed for a DIY project
5.0	Our son broke  the original. Replaced here at a great price. Thanks Amazon! No more getting out of bed to turn off the lights after reading.
5.0	Item is as posted, shipping fast and communications great A++++
5.0	you don't have to fold your papers as they lay nicely in this box.  Ships nicely.  Easy to store and then can even put things on top due to its nice size.
5.0	This cheap little device works better then my expensive other WiFi devices.  I only wish that  I could connect more than just five devices on it. But so far I happy with it.
5.0	Great product to control the water flow, works and looks great.  Very good quality heavy and well made.  Will buy again for other showers in my home.  A must have.
5.0	great product and easy to assemble.  Great illumination for our basement.  It is a bit bright when all three lights are on, but that's fine.  We can just turn one of the lamps off.
5.0	Really, really nice. I expected them to be much smaller than they look on Amazon, as well as very light and hollow, but that is far from the truth they are just as big as the pictures and they are really made from a solid metal. I am very pleased with this purchase
5.0	Great price, fit perfect!
5.0	Great for minor repairs
5.0	The best thing about this product is that the floor is clear with no strip cluttering the area.  Having 4 plug ins works out fine.
5.0	Well worth the money and I used the extra contacts to turn on an alarm if it stops working
5.0	I have purchased the LG Lt500P for my refrigerator and they are the best, I have purchased the aftermarket filters but was unsure weather I was getting the quality as purchasing the Factory Original Filter. It is very important I'm choosing the best product for my Family. The price was compatible to the aftermarket products but ZI would pay a little more for the right thing.
5.0	I read the other reviews and bought this product for a Harbor Frieght solar system... Works perfectly as promised and I will update my review if I have any issues down the line. Great price for those of you getting into a startup solar project.
5.0	We have owned RVs for several years and enjoy dry-camping from time to time, relying only on our water pump for pressure.  I always dreaded having to wash/rinse my hair, knowing it would use up a lot of water and take time. Used the Oxygenics showerhead for the first time and it lived up to its billing, woohoo!  I did choose to buy a separate turn off valve, as the one on the showerhead leaves too much water dribbling out to save much water.  But the pressure it gives makes up for that failing, in my book, so I'm leaving it at 5 stars.  Installation was simple, requiring no tools, though I ended up buying Oxygenics own wall holder (another review, works fine), as the original in the RV was a little too small to reliably hold this larger showerhead while driving.
5.0	Excellent product. Easy to install. Never seems to ice up. Great on leaves.  (nothing works on pine needles)
5.0	Great product, was able to setup real quick. The photo cell works great and the best feature is probably the timer that you can. Definitely a must buy if you are setting up landscape lights.
5.0	Very-Very pretty lamp
5.0	We have a Maytag Centennial washer with auto water level sensing and experienced the problems others have described -- the machine started agitating immediately upon starting a cycle, rinse cycles were off, etc. I used the &#34;blow through the clear tube&#34; trick several times to prolong the original sensor switch's usefulness...and eventually the problem got worse. I happened to be standing near the washer when it was filling...and filling...and filling. It started to overflow and if I hadn't switched the machine over to the spin cycle I'd have had a huge mess on my hands.<br /><br />Anyway, this is a long way of saying that the new switch has resolved these problems. The washer functions as it should. The part swap is easy, though it's also easy to lose the springy clips that hold the control panel.<br /><br />For now. I'd love to give this product -100 stars because I shouldn't need it, but that's not the part's fault. I'll certainly try any other manufacturer besides Maytag/Whirlpool when I replace this washer. It's ridiculous that the problem appeared so early in the machine's life (just after 1 year).
5.0	It's been a month and still works, considering the price compared to Sears, high rating.
5.0	Installation couldn't have been easier.  The snap off feature is pretty clever but not sure how the plastic connecting components will hold up over time.  The soft close feature works flawlessly.  It works on both the seat and the lid, which wasn't clear in the item description.  The universal elongated model fit my American Standard toilet easily.  I will purchase this for the rest of the toilets in my house.
5.0	Great so far! Easy to set up, wiring was a cinch once I decided to RTFM (look that acronym up if you don't know what that means). The included sensor allows me to know what the temp is upstairs while the thermostat is downstairs and adjust accordingly. Amazing product! Thanks a bunch Ecobee! Also, there's a good Windows Phone app you can use with it too.<br /><br />Hint: If you use the PEK and your old thermostat used to have a jumper wire from Rc to Rh, DON'T use the Rh side and get rid of the jumper! Only use Rc.
5.0	The clear coat produced the required finish over the Java stain.  Just follow directions as given. These products will be used on future projects.
5.0	"I've used the 3-step version of this skinny stool for years and was looking for a shorter version to fit in my coat closet. This little stool is perfect. I really love skinny stools because they are much easier to stow away.<br /><br />PROS:<br />*Solid, durable construction. I believe most if not all of the components are steel.<br />*The skinniest stool I have ever found at 2\\"". This allows it to fit into tight crevices like the side of a fridge, dresser, or workbench. It also barely protrudes from the wall if you hang it up.<br />*Very light. I considered some aluminum stools which were even lighter but none of them folded as skinny. For a 2 step stool, aluminum doesn't make a worthwhile difference in weight.<br />*Easy folding mechanism.<br /><br />CONS:<br />*Minor issue - Since the lower step is much smaller than the upper step, you may accidentally slip off off the lower step. Just be careful.<br /><br />DIMENSIONS:<br />-Top stop is 18\\"" high<br />-Folded height is 32\\""<br />-Folded depth is 2\\"""
5.0	Works Great and a good price. Cleans out the room of all doggie smells, food smells and have to dust less.
5.0	Great investment for children that are learning how to use the potty. Much better than having an extra seat to put toilet and MUCH better than a small toilet that I have to clean out. We purchased one for each bathroom.
5.0	Was exactly what I wanted and was here in three days!
5.0	Great for soft luggage
5.0	This light/fan combo is relatively quiet and the design is not distracting.  Because it is larger than the fan we were replacing we were afraid it would look out of place in our relatively small bathroom, but the design and color fit right in to the point where it is hardly noticed. I did remove the  Hunter logo from the glass cover with nail polish remover,
5.0	I needed a few short cords for some LED stage lighting.  Black was a requirement, as was multiple outlets.  These are perfect for my application
5.0	So far so good my granddaughter stopped itiching the very first time!
5.0	The First Alert Interconnected Battery Operated Combination Smoke and Carbon Monoxide<br />Alarm with Voice Location was exactly as anticipated. It was installed with no problems.<br />Every residence should be protected by these types of detectors.<br />The life you save could be your own. ~ The Boss
5.0	Arrived on date promised well packaged in US mail.  This was purchased for a Magic Chef CYE4000AYW dryer as it seemed like the heating element was fried.  This is the best price I could find and it INCLUDES a new thermostat (there is a comparable item for sale on amazon for about $26).  Removed old part and installed these in less than 10 minutes.  Works like a charm.  Would not hesitate to recommend product or vendor to anyone and would order again if need be.  Thank you for selling a reasonably priced product including S&H.... Awesome.
5.0	This is a good bulb, good build, nice light, energy efficient, runs cool.  I will be purchasing more style LED bulbs from this manufacturer for most all my home lighting.
5.0	Good thickness, size and length for its needed application (basement dehumidifier extension cord). Was desiring a flush female plug (plugs parallel with wires) and this was one of the few I could find in this length. Meanwhile, the perpendicular male plug (pins 90 deg from wires) makes for a nice-looking scene on the wall. Recommended.
5.0	I love this little heater. It quickly wams my daughter's bedroom and I like the temperature control. I replaced it after nearly three years of daily use with the same model.
5.0	I originally bought this item for my wife; but little did I know, I would enjoy it as well!  I have noticed since using the Luxe Bidet, my wife and I feel cleaner...even more-so than wet wipes.  We have pretty much eliminated the need for wet wipes, and we are using FAR less toilet paper than in the past.  So not only does it make me feel clean, I save money in the long-run!<br /><br />I've already suggested this product to everyone I know... so far, a few have already made purchases and love theirs as well!
5.0	great product fast shipping.
5.0	Love them..Bright, Just what I was looking for. I put them on the back of my HD TV..Perfect...They are pricey but you get what you pay for.
5.0	Fast delivery! Candles worked great!
5.0	I use these for my car alarm remote. They work good and last a good amount of time. If you need some back up batteries these are good.
5.0	Perfect. You need to have this.
5.0	perfect item at very reasonable price.
5.0	Great Price and fast shipping.  Thanks
5.0	I can't believe how much I like a doorknob, but this is awesome.<br /><br />Besides the convenience factor, this is also a wonderful way to help out people who may not have quite the grip or strength to open a typical doorknob. (Examples: elderly people, young children, people with muscular and skeletal disabilities) If anyone in your house has experienced that sort of trouble, this product is an absolute godsend.<br /><br />Installation was a total snap. In fact, after replacing a broken knob with a &#34;cheapest you have&#34; model from the local hardware store, this was substantially easier to install. Unless your door isn't drilled for a knob, this is a quick three-minute job with a screwdriver.<br /><br />The quality and feel are really impressive. Outside of the cheap knob I mentioned above, the rest of the knobs in my house are similarly priced upper / middle range brushed metal Kwikset knobs. The difference in quality is like night and day.<br /><br />I'm really considering buying enough of these to replace every doorknob in the house.
5.0	The Towel bar is a heavy duty piece of hardware that has a beautiful finish, is easy to install and matches our Moen faucets perfectly.
5.0	Was really nice product.
5.0	Love these alphabet stickers.  We put them up in my daughter's room.  They are the perfect size, visually colorful and nice with the animals on each letter, easy to remove for moving around for placement, and fun.  Great product!
5.0	Rally cute and seem sturdy so far. I no longer have to tell people which one goes to the light and which one goes to the fan.
5.0	We use these scrapers in our restaurant to scrape the flat grill. We've found nothing better. The only drawback is the plastic doesn't hold up to the heat forever.
5.0	I ordered these pads to move furniture on my newly refinished floors.  They worked very well.  The foam side kept the pad under the legs of the furniture and the felt side made sliding the furniture a breeze.  I highly recommend this product.
5.0	Just received this remote about an hour ago! It was a breeze to program and I am not having the same issues that some other people are having with the distance. I can operate the garage door from the attic of my home without an issue! I think it's about 75 feet from the garage to the bedroom of my attic.
5.0	I bought this lamp for a place without electricity.  I can't believe how bright it is!  It is lightweight and turns on and off with a push button which is very easy to do in the dark.  It is adjustable, so you can direct the light the way you want.  Very inexpensive and so far no problems.  I haven't had it very long, but so far very happy.
5.0	I haven't used it yet, It has no smell, so it will be great!
5.0	This is by far my most important purchase in years. It is simple by design yet the most effective. I am going to buy one for everyone of my children to use as well.
5.0	Good fit, easy to replace
5.0	This kit works well to replace your worn dryer door latch. It's an easy fix, so don't hesitate to do it yourself rather than calling a repairman.
5.0	I recently switched from using a flat rubber sink mat to one of the raised rubber/wire ones because too much stuff got trapped under the old one. Only then did I realize that one advantage of flat one was that utensils etc couldn't fall underneath and head for the disposal opening. I started getting paranoid about things getting into it (memories of my mother sticking her hand in hers and the family yelling no!). I didn't even know this type of gadget existed; I was actually just searching here on my favorite shopping site for one those generic wire baskets when I came upon this.<br /><br />So far, so good. I didn't know if it would fit and was afraid with my luck it would fall in and have to be rescued, but it fits perfectly. It's easy to put in and out and stays in place. As noted in another review, the holes are a little small, so water drains more slowly - not a complaint, just a surprise. It would be nice if it could drain more quickly, but I'm sure there is a trade off in that if the openings were much bigger, more things could accidentally fall through.<br /><br />I'd definitely buy another if this got lost.
5.0	This little gizmo works as advertised. I am going to purchase another unit!
5.0	This light is pretty incredible, especially for the money. It delivers the kind of light effects that you expect to see in a club, concert, or ice rink. It is very easy to use out of the box with amazing results, but it also has some impressive features for someone willing to program it.  It lights up a large room with high ceiling, no problem. Love it!
5.0	Our Delta Lewiston Single Handle Kitchen Faucet with Soap Dispenser arrived and was perfect for the job. It looks great and works great. The ease of shopping for this item through Amazon and the speed of the delivery was better than driving all over and shopping store to store.
5.0	Love this!  Very bright, clean white light.  No heat.  This is an ideal garage workbench light.  Very happy with it.
5.0	Great price; Great delivery; great filters.
5.0	Works as stated.  The trick is chosing the right epoxy. One that doesn't dry too fast but doesn't take too long either.  You don't want the epoxy dripping down but you also want enough time to work with the clips under the sink.  Also, take care to not over tighten the clamps on the studs.
5.0	this stuff worked great-had a leak around some ductwork I couldn't pinpoint-taped the seams and hasn't leaked since
5.0	WAS JUST WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR!<br /><br />  THANKS
5.0	Best system ever - now have 2 - feel sfae a confident we are covered
5.0	I've bought others that didn't last but a few months. This is great length(you wouldn't want anything shorter).  A perfect hose!!
5.0	just what i wanted and at a very good price. shipping was fast.
5.0	"I was a little concerned when I ordered this push button, as I am whenever I read \\""Works for all models.....\\"". My old push button stopped working and as I didn't want to buy the whole door chime set-up I bought this.<br /><br />It worked, it amazes me how they can make something work with all models, they should try getting somebody to work with Naomi Campbell."
5.0	This light is beautiful.  The shadows on the ceiling from the wrought iron are really cool.  The white globe gives bright light, but it is not harsh. We are very pleased with this light fixture.
5.0	Good Grip. Great price. Worth more than you pay. Earlier received than expected. Made in U.S.A. Good job! That's all I can say.
5.0	Works great-The dusty smell in our den seams to have disappeared.<br />The trick to these lights are to leave them on 24/7. (no water drips)<br />The wife has ordered 2 more salt lamps-They also make for a good atmosphere.
5.0	Just what I wanted, it gives out a wonderful light in my curio cabinet.
5.0	Received products very quickly and they were all very easy to install.  The old connectors fitted and each unit took less than 5 mintues to install.  They all work great!
5.0	I've had this faucet three years and I love it.  It's a great bargain.<br /><br />It's plastic, but you wouldn't know it without looking closely (if you care about that kind of thing).  The hoses that come out of the bottom seem to be well made.<br /><br />It was a snap to install.  Originally I had a problem with the faucet head not seating properly, but I adjusted the weight down and that pulled it more snugly.
5.0	Completely satisfied with this hand held shower head. I have this same one in my other bathroom that I bought from a big box store a few months ago but paid almost double for it. I wanted to replace the one in my other shower with this same one, I only wish that I had looked here on Amazon first. The quality of this is as good if not better then any other brand of shadower heads that I've seen. I would recommend this to any family or friend.
5.0	"The cable arrive within 3 days after ordering.   The cable is extremely \\""Heavy Duty\\"", it is constructed well and durable."
5.0	arrived in perfect shape. looks very much like a real candle
5.0	Bought this to check plumbing lines ability to hold pressure before turning on the water or making offers on foreclosed homes.  Bought a brass adapter to go to the assembly and hooked up a washing machine hose to it (those hoses are M2M).  That way I can screw it onto the outside hose bibs or the washing machine.  Sure beats the old way<br /><br />Your mileage may vary but rhis setup works well for me and I highly recommend this test gauge assembly.
5.0	This product works exactly how you'd expect it should.<br /><br />The remote comes with a battery, the buttons are reliable (meaning, they work the first time) and the range on the thing is good.<br /><br />I'm using this to turn on and off lamps throughout my home without having to walk to each one and turn the switch.
5.0	Being a plumber for 43 years and now retired I find the sink to be a great valve and was installed with ease. My daughter loves it.
5.0	This light provides the perfect task-lighting that my husband requires.  It is so portable and easy to use on his various projects to illuminate the task at hand.
5.0	Worked great for what I used it for
5.0	Have bought two of these now. Received in couple days after purchase. Dont hesitate to buy.  Best price on a good quality mount plate on Amazon. Just a matter of which thickness plate you need.
5.0	Best toilet paper holder ever.  Easy on east off
5.0	This thing is better than expected!  Saw it talked about on Tekzilla and thought about it for a bit and when my next purchase of canned air came up I decide to give it a try.  Wow it blows!  In a good way!  Took my tower computer outside and the cord reached farther than it looks like it will so I left it plugged without an extension and pulled the trigger-the dust flew out of my case.  Better than any canned air ever had and with it plugged in I really gave the case a good cleaning instead of worrying about running out of pressure in the bottle.
5.0	Excellent Seller and Product!!!
5.0	Love it!  but you can also buy theses at a Dollar Tree for only 1 Dollar!!
5.0	Delivered on time, good quality, nice storage box.
5.0	I was looking for a ladder to use from my daughter's condo on the 2nd floor. This ladder is packed in a box for storage but also very easy to use directly from the box. It's made out of metal rungs and web strapping on the sides. It looks to be strong enough for my daughter's family and the price was reasonable. Highly recommend this product.
5.0	I ordered two of these to control multiple high bay fans. The original controller I bought had only 3 speed settings, and did not allow enough flexibility in speed control.<br /><br />The fully variable fan control from Cooper works great, and because it is rated at 5A, you are able to wire several fans to one controller. I wouldn't hesitate to buy these again if the need arises.
5.0	quality material. Good stuff
5.0	"I honestly can't say enough good things about Surebonder and the Roller Wizard!  Surebonder, for its part, provided me with excellent customer service when I had an issue (entirely my own fault).<br /><br />I've tried the Roller Wizard under some pretty extreme situations...  The first time was when I used it to clean a roller that had been sitting for three days (I'd wrapped it in a plastic bag and tossed it out).  I was impressed that it came clean but not absolutely amazed...  \\""Absolutely amazed\\"" came a bit later when I was priming new drywall (if you know anything about New Drywall Primer you know that it ranks up there with oil-based paints in terms of cleaning!).  Well (sparing you the story) let's just say that I had the chance to clean a roller that had been sitting in primer for OVER A WEEK...  I never thought that it would come clean...  I only tried it to entertain myself with the limitations of the Roller Wizard and, as it turns out; there aren't any.  GOOD AS NEW!<br /><br />NOTE:  If you watch the attached video you'll see what happens if you don't crank the fitting down as far as it can possibly go.  Note that there are a few threads showing at the end of the fitting:  ***If you have the fitting fully seated you should only see ONE THREAD***"
5.0	Just as described, its a medium cup hook. I used them on my kitchen wall just under the cabinet to hang my measuring spoons and cups on for easy access. This was one of those pinterest hack ideas and it worked wonderfully.
5.0	I bought these to upgrade our stock brass knobs.  Installation was easy and the typical knob installation.  No surprises.  They work very well and look great.  They feel much lighter BUT NOT cheap.  They feel solid.  So far, they have held up to our kids using them and not being gentle with door knobs.  The antimicrobial part...I can't tell if it is working.  How do you test anyway?  I recommend them.
5.0	works as expected. best price that i could find on the internet. best price that i could find on the internet
5.0	Solved problem with door!
5.0	Price is good. not sure why the 3 pack costs more than 3 individuals but I can order every 6 months  or add to my Christmas list.
5.0	This is the best product to keep a spare house key safely.  I installed mine on the door frame between the front door and the screen door and it fit perfectly.  Wish I had bought one a long time ago, it is so easy to install and is very practical.
5.0	Great product.  Have 2 now
5.0	Worked perfectly. I inherited the ice machine and it was probably never properly cleaned. Nu-Calgon made the ice taste like new!
5.0	I use this to turn my tree on and off and well it does that and it is green wich is a plus.
5.0	It was very helpfull and it was great, thanks for my article. here is your reviw for the purchases. .
5.0	I live in a loft with 14' ceilings. The building had a rickety wooden ladder that was 12' tall; when I managed to live through my first recessed lightbulb change I immediately got on amazon and ordered this ladder so I wouldn't have to go through that nightmare again. Yes, the ladder is a bit heavier than I would prefer, and putting it up to its full extension (in both A-frame and straight mode) can be a bit frustrating if done solo. But it is amazingly stable and secure, and I have no worries when working on the ceiling lights. It folds up compactly enough to store in my coat closet, and it has been the emergency ladder for several of my neighbors when their contractors brought the wrong size ladder. The ability to extend the sides to different lengths meant that it was perfect for repairing a light halfway up a stair case. The only thing I haven't done yet is use it in scaffolding mode.
5.0	It is sleek & elegant - we got the Tall one as we have a vessel sink. Looks fantastic.<br />The water pressure is very strong - so be careful when you first start using it. Best to mount it in the middle.<br />Extremely happy with the purchase & we ordered 2 more for our Master bathroom.<br /><br />Follow up email from the Company to check if we were happy with the product - good Customer relations.
5.0	Easy to install<br />Super elegant solution<br />Works as advertised<br />Knocked $100 off my electric bill in the first month.<br />Love the phone app.<br />Will be adding more units for my second zone as well as my second home.
5.0	You should have one in every bathroom. We will never again be without one/several. This is up there with the internet and cell phones, why they're not yet as popular is beyond me.
5.0	These are cute and I liked how they are not too baby. I didn't line them up very well the first few times and was able to reposition them with no problems losing their stick. Some of them are not as obvious as they could be.
5.0	This is my 2nd one.  We like the 1st one so much we decided to get one for the side of our home also.  The batteries in the 1st one are right at a year old and it still works as good as new, even after the cold winter months.
5.0	My wife and I have gone through quite a few folding step stools over the years. We tried to save a few bucks each time and wound up paying for it in the long run. This item is perfection. It is strong but lightweight. It folds and unfolds so easily. i'm a 200 pounder, while my wife is half my size. We have found that it will support me with ease and it's a breeze for her to use. We really like this and would recommend it many times over.
5.0	VERY NICE....FINISH IS BEAUTIFUL!<br />;
5.0	Sent promptly; item is as advertised.
5.0	Difficult to praise thermostats other than to say they work well. They are easy to install and shiny so who could ask for  more.
5.0	Best tie downs I ever bought,
5.0	Love it we can plug In Multiple decorations at once! This just makes sense with a lot decorations. Great value too.
5.0	Very useful putty-type product
5.0	We love Moen products in our house, and this bathroom faucet is as nice as the other Moen items we've bought.  It is very sleek and modern looking, but I feel it'd look nice in just about any d&eacute;cor.  Changing the faucet in a bathroom gives the room a whole new, fresh look and it really looks so nice.  The quality is excellent, very attractive, solid and performance is wonderful, too.  The instructions for installation are very easy and straightforward, it took less than 1/2 to get the whole thing done.  I'd highly recommend this particular faucet and any product made by Moen.  Exceptional quality at a reasonable price.
5.0	Cheaper than I can find locally at the Orange or blue box.  It arrived quickly and well packed.  No complaints
5.0	Excellent for my purpose and very reasonable in cost.
5.0	Have't use it yet, but I did use the 30/50 ones. They worked as expected. No issues. All items are new in their boxes so I don't expect any issues with this 40/60 one.
5.0	I have been looking for this type of faucet at the local hardware stores.  Some were available but not to my liking, and at a higher price.  I purchased this one at a fair price and it got here in three days.<br />Thank you<br />Manuel Avila
5.0	Great replacement for LG microwave.
5.0	I needed a short but very sturdy ladder instead of an old rickety one we have been using. I don't mind getting on the top rung with this one to reach up for all types of jobs to do around the house.
5.0	Exactly what I wanted!
5.0	looks better than the picture the bowl is held on by the center nut. the arms are decorative and modern in appearance. A great finish and total appearance. I put in 100w equiv led bulbs and it's brighter than 9 can lights. I think 60w led bulbs would have been more than adequate, we had to install a dimmer to be able to tone down the brightness in our entry. We suspended this 9 feet off the floor, our entry is 18 feet tall. Looks very modern and stylish.
5.0	Exactly what I was looking for.
5.0	I almost don't want to write a review b/c I want to keep these awesome gadgets a secret.  I was living in an apartment without ceiling lights and this let me mimic the ease of &#34;flicking a switch&#34; by vel-cro-ing the remote to the wall and hooking it up to my floor lamsp all around my room.  No need to go to each one to turn them all on, or to bend down to find the button on each lamp. I LOVE these.
5.0	The filter was much easier to install than I anticipated and is working well with no adjustments.  I was pleasantly surprised.
5.0	Meant to hold a larger and heavier plate this hanger is working great for the purpose I planned. It comes with a hook to attach the hanger to and it is a nice touch to provide this little hook.
5.0	vERY NICE. iT WAS A GIFT
5.0	The washer would stop mid-cycle because it thought the lid was up.  I took the old switch apart, but it was too far gone. This fixed it nice.<br />FYI: a flat blade screwdriver will prize the 2 snaps up on the front of the washer.  Then its simply 2 screws and 2 wires to get it out.
5.0	Delivered was on time. Good product
5.0	Ordered this on a Monday from Ontario and received it same week on Wednesday morning as per schedule.  Item is exactly as pictured, was well packaged.  Works perfectly, easy to use remote and I find quite powerful as being on the low setting 2 of 6 it really moves the air around.  Runs very quiet and no wobbles, looks great,  love it.
5.0	I have a collection of decorative glass paper weights. I had purchased many expensise individual (electric) under lights to illuminate some of them for display.  But... with the inexpensive DOT-it light I just set the crystal paper weight on top of the light and it shows through the crystal paper weight illuminating it beautifully. Plus, they are portable so I am not limited to an electrical outlet.
5.0	These are replacement shades for an old pair of wide chrome lamps that required a wide and tall shade.  The shades are just what I was looking for and fit perfectly. They are made of good quality linen, very sturdy and well constructed. A white lining reflects light to provide a soft glow and sufficient filtered lighting in the room. I also needed to order harps the same height as the shades, to balance the look/height of my lamps. Very pleased with service from this seller, would order from them again.
5.0	I bought this gear to fix my Chamberlain garage door opener.  Went on Youtube to look at an install video.  $4 dollar fix.....NICE!!!!
5.0	I just couldn't justify spending more for a base than the cost of my umbrella!!!  This unit is a good value.  The bronze color is a nice brown, the pictures are accurate.  It took me a long time to get my wet sand into the thing (like about an hour), but that made it end up quite heavy which should be a benefit.  I would recommend filling with dry sand if you have it (much better flow) and then also adding water to increase the weight before closing the cap.  I was able to remove the cap after putting it on, but it is profiled to lock in place.  The unit is simple and goes together fine.  There are I think 3 different adapters for umbrella pole size and one fit my umbrella perfectly.  The stand is long enough to help secure things.
5.0	I was able to find the exact item I wanted at a good price and reasonable shipping AND I received the items in a very timely manner. <br />I am very pleased with my experience.
5.0	I was not impressed by the online photo, but it is actually a very nice product! The hose is very flexible, unlike most hoses that are included with showerheads, and it looks nicer (no plastic, no black lines, just stainless steel). Also, it's the perfect height for attaching my showerhead from the tub faucet to the wall, which avoided a plumbing headache and expense without compromising elegance.
5.0	Good product. Strong adhesive. Excellent seal. Make sure you place it carefully - just snug enough to form the seal but not too low to make the door drag.
5.0	"I'm adding the reviews to the other components too, as based on my original writeup on the heart of the system, the WSS10 receiver.  [[ASIN:B002NU6MHK Leviton WSS10-GDW Wireless Momentary Switch Relay, No Neutral, 120/277v, 1-Pole, White]]    The WSS0S series is the remote switch to the WSS10 series receivers.  The one big aspect that sets this remote apart from many other remote-based switches is that no batteries or wiring is required; it is a spring-loaded self-powered switch.  The switch may be surface mounted or recessed in a box with at least 5/8\\"" clearance.    Versatility is a huge plus on this setup.  The receiver can be set for up to 6 devices (switches or occupancy sensors), so one can readily make this a 4-way setup and beyond.  The transmission signal is digital and each device has its own 32-bit address, so interference is extremely unlikely even with multiple receivers in the same vicinity.    Yes, this setup does cost more than other wireless 3-way switches, but the others are not commercial-grade, nor versatile to be used as 4-way switches and/or with occupancy sensors.  Installation is quick, as the only wiring involved is in replacing the wall switch with the receiver; there's no need for wiring through walls or ceilings, no patching, and no bill for the hours of labor by an electrician.  And it's that last part makes going with this setup a much cheaper option."
5.0	A great, tight, middle weight knife,  that is a great buy for the money.....
5.0	Bought the light as it was about the brightest I have seen in the size unit, but was even more impressed when listening to the quality of the sound when playing my IPod Nano on it.  For the size of it, this is an impressive little gem!
5.0	Used these for my under-cabinet LED lighting project. Works as advertised.
5.0	It was great to be able to but several at a time! thank you:-)<br /> very nice look to each bulb. PRIMITIVE!
5.0	Well to start off, this product is exactly what we were looking for!<br />It's extremely easy to use, which is why we bought it. You just plug it in, and it automatically turns on and starts flashing colors on the wall! There are no buttons or anything on it, so like I said it is EXTREMELY easy to use, plug it in and watch it go!<br />It changes patterns of the flashing colorful lights, which is pretty cool :)<br />It is extremely lightweight and portable, anywhere the is a power outlet is a place you can turn into a party with this little device!<br />It came in a plain brown box, so I wasn't positive what it was when I got it, then I unboxed it, and saw what it was, plugged it in, and it worked right away!<br />It may not be very big, but the spectacular light show it produces would indicate otherwise.<br />Overall we are really glad we decided to buy this product, and we are probably going to buy a few more just to add to the spectacle!
5.0	Great product. I prefer Cool white(4,100K bulbs,led,CFL) over any other color. However, I did not realize that its a GU24 base and had to get a new bulb socket.
5.0	Very easy to install. Easy to trim to fit precise.
5.0	"I bought this because somehow or another my cash always comes up missing when i have company over. I got this and was suprised at the fact it looked faded like a electric outlet that had been there for a long time, so it wouldnt stick out as the only perfectly white outlet in the house. It installed easly, and the \\""key\\"" it comes with can go on your key ring and no one will ever know what it is for. I will buy another and maybe a couple as christmas presents."
5.0	Bought two of these fans and installed them in the living room of a rental property we are remodeling.  They look amazing, and I was so happy to find something other than the traditional looking fan.  They look very clean and modern.  As other reviewers have stated, the bulbs that come with the fans are far from bright, so I will seek an alternative.  With that being said, I would still buy these again.  I'm actually thinking of buying another one to put in our bedroom to replace one of those fake wood/brass monstrosities with the four lights hanging down.
5.0	Beautiful. Shoots rainbows all around the room.
5.0	It helped a lot for what I wanted - my refrigerator is now safe and stable. Beatigfull piece with brake
5.0	Been happy with it so far.  It was fairly easy to install; my thermostat wiring had a fifth wire that I was able to attach to the C terminal on my furnace control board, so I didn't have to use the Power Extender Kit; I can't comment on how well that piece works, but it's a pretty simple idea (similar to a Phantom power injector for microphones).  The Nest's &#34;power thieving&#34; strategy from the signal lines didn't seem like such a great idea to me (I'm an electrical engineer), but the Power Extender Kit approach seems pretty reasonable.<br /><br />I considered the Nest because it's very popular, but a lot of the reviews (particularly from HVAC professionals) steered me towards this one instead.  The real clincher was the remote sensors (disclaimer: my master's thesis was on wireless sensor networks, so I'm a bit of a distributed sensor nerd); our daughter's room gets fairly cold in the winter, and while we supplement with a small, efficient space heater, it's helped to even things out a bit.  The thermostat and the sensors have motion sensors to determine room occupancy, and only occupied rooms contribute to the average home temperature (which seems on its face to be a crude way of managing it, but it's probably about the best you can do with a single-zone HVAC system without vent dampers).  The sensors use a bog-standard CR2032 battery (the same kind used for the CMOS battery on PCs), so replacements are easy to find and cheap.<br /><br />One nice feature, in my view, is that the thermostat appears to use mechanical relays instead of solid-state ones.  I like the audible click when the mode switches, though I recognize not everyone does, but the real advantage is in durability, particularly compared to the Nest.  Most of the negative reviews of the Nest I read from HVAC professionals complained about the unreliability of the FET relays when used with (not always well-regulated) HVAC voltages.<br /><br />Installation was pretty easy, assuming you're comfortable with medium-voltage wiring.  Turn off your furnace control board before you wire this up, because you don't want to be shorting anything out, but you're not likely to shock yourself, and HVAC lines are generally well color-coded (R=red, G=green, etc.).<br /><br />The web interface is nice, if sometimes a little clunky.  One of my favorite features is the history data; you can see the total time spent heating/cooling per day plotted against outside temperature, which is quite nice if you want to tune your energy usage.  You can also download all your data (and I mean ALL your data; temperature, humidity, heating time, cooling time, occupancy, and readings from all the sensors) as a giant CSV file if you want to perform your own analysis.  Perfect for data nerds.<br /><br />I've been pretty happy with this so far.  I'm sure there are a few setups where it wouldn't work well; I don't think I'd particularly want this installed by a professional and put in the mode where it reports things to the installer, either.  But so far, I'm quite satisfied with my choice.
5.0	Tektrum blue LED lights.<br />They are brighter and better than I expected. They arrived sooner than promised.<br />I will definately order them again.
5.0	I do not know how you rate a toilet seat. It does what it should do. Non slaming lid is great and has a different cleaner look. You don't see the seat when the lid is down. Any other toilet seat I have to replace will be with this model.
5.0	I is long tuff and it meet todays standards it also comes with different nipples so it will fit most dryers......
5.0	I recently purchased and installed this so that I could hide all the cords behind my wall mounted plasma television.<br /><br />Just so everyone knows, this is a gang box only. You will still need to purchase the electrical outlet, HDMI outlet, etc of your choice to install.<br /><br />When the box first arrived it looked like it might be too large to install in a standard wall depth (2X4 studs are generally 3 & 3/4 inches deep). I put a measuring tape on it before cutting into my wall and it fit.<br /><br />The gang box can be used in new construction or old construction applications. My application was an old construction situation where I cut out the drywall and set the box in the new hole.<br /><br />Overall, the installation went well and I am satisfied with the outcome. One thing I must point out is that the gang box relies on a cover piece to pull tension against the sheet rock to stay in place. It is the second piece from the right in the exploded product photo. This piece is not perfectly flush with the wall. It will stick out about 3 or 4 mm (about the thickness of a wall socket cover). This typically is not a big deal, but if you require an absolutely flush application, this might not be the solution for you.<br /><br />The best benefit of this item was that I ended up with an HDMI outlet and a [[ASIN:B000KKLNV0 Leviton 47605-ACS J-Box Surge Protective Kit - Single AC Power Module]] that were both mounted in a recessed manner into the wall. This meant that when I plugged in the television and HDMI cable the plugs did not bump into the television. The television is completely wire free to the eye and does not look as imposing now.<br /><br />Hope this helps. Feel free to comment if you have any questions.
5.0	I use it always it is an excellent product I come in time they are a few persons very responsibly I recommend 100 %..
5.0	This item was delivered promptly and as described. I know there were some disagreements amongst other reviewers regarding how many keys came with the lock pack, however my pack came with two keys. Perfect for use at the gym!
5.0	Bought these to replace my halogen bulbs in my small photography lamps and these are so much better because they don't get really hot like my halogen light bulbs and they are much brighter.
5.0	Prior to receiving this hinge, my refrigerator door remained unhinged, unopenable.<br /><br />Receiving this hinge changed my life.  My refrigerator door now glides open and closed with perfect ease, like magic!<br /><br />Thank you!
5.0	I got one set free in exchange for an unbiased review. In LOVE with these lights. Super excited about them. I have been wanting WHITE Fairy lights forever and finally I have some and now that I have tested them out I am going to buy A LOT more as soon as I can afford to! We hung these in our window, but want to hang some from our trees and I have a fairy house out back - like a woman cave I am going to put some in too!<br /><br />First, I can tangle anything yet I was able to get these unraveled with ease, I mean I could not tangle them if I tried! They are shipped in a way that they are all neatly and perfectly bundled up by each individual strange. They are SUPER long and they are a perfect curtain!<br /><br />These are the way to go for a party, a fairy hut, garden decor, lawn decor, etc.<br /><br />In love with the Tesoar Wedding Party Lights! Even my husband was totally impressed.<br /><br />There are different settings from just on, to an on to fade then back on, blinking, every other strand blinking changing back and forty, etc.<br /><br />Festive and magical!
5.0	bought oil rubbed bronze, matched colors well, feel good and strong, Beautiful detail and unique! Great quality, would buy again and recommend!
5.0	Using in my audio booth and it's exactly what was needed and feels solidly built. Even the switch feels good. Recommend.
5.0	Easy install as it replaced an existing switch.
5.0	I put this sink in a house I'm remodeling/flipping.  It looks fine.  Cheapest stainless steel corner sink I could find.  Just realize you need a shorter stemmed faucet so that the water stays in the sink when you're pivoting the faucet from one side to the other with the water on.  Also realize with the 4 hole corner sinks you are limiting yourself with faucet options...Not all soap dispensers or spray wands will fit under the faucet in that fourth hole.
5.0	After several months using my Victorinox Swiss Army Midnite Minichamp with the LED flashlight, the battery finally went dead. I found these as an Add-On item and purchased two of them.<br /><br />The battery fit within my knife perfectly and restored my LED flashlight to proper working order. I'll keep these in my wish list and will certainly purchase more when replacements are needed.
5.0	Great price and a perfect fit. The water tastes great again. This was extremely easy to install.
5.0	good buy would buy again
5.0	Very nice sand blaster for the price.  Don't waste your money on the cheap metal cabinet ones, I had one before this.  Defiantly a big upgrade, and it comes already 95% assembled.  A very professional looking addition for my home shop.  Only drawback is it does not include a interior light, it was very easy to add one however.  I highly recommend this to anyone  looking for a decent inexpensive sand blaster, that really works, and doesn't leak at all the seams like my old metal one did.
5.0	Next to the Best incense
5.0	I was very pleased when o got my center plate Rod
5.0	This toner cartridge works great. It replaced one that was ancient on my grandmother's old Canon Copier PC920. Inkers was a great supplier, getting it here VERY quickly and in good shape. They were very helpful. My only complaint is that in the description, it sounds like it's a Canon product, and it's really a Canon compatible product. But it's working well and it's also much much less expensive than the Canon product!
5.0	Easy to install and works great!
5.0	easy to install and functions perfectly.
5.0	big gulps on each pull.
5.0	Good assortment, strong nails, haven't had any break yet.
5.0	These bulbs shine a full 360 degrees and are plenty bright without the heat.  I use these with dusk to dawn sensors that keep them on all night on the outside of the house.  The design allows them to look great installed on the front of the house.  These are a lucky find.
5.0	I ordered two rolls of this for our 37 foot rv. We had enough to do all the windows. We cut them so they sit behind the strings that work the shades. They sit in place really well like that yet are easy to remove when you need to. Not only are our windows protected from the sun coming in and heating up the place, it also gives a lot of privacy at those rv parks where the spots are so tight you are nearly toughing your neighbor. Also wonderful in bedroom for blacking out the room. Nighttime shades are nice if you have them, but these really blackout the room! Really great purchase for our rv!
5.0	This coping sled is well done and made of sturdy materials which should make it last a lifetime.  It is relatively heavy and hold the piece to be copped firmly which overall dampen vibrations and help providing a very smooth cut.    The sled is easy to use. It can be mounted on the mitre slot. It can also be riding along the fence in which case you will have to cut into the sled.    The sled can be use with large or small pieces without any problem. You might have ot reposition the clamps if you go from one extream to another.    One small negative is the initial assembly. There are a lot of different parts to assemble and the instructions are not always very clear.  It is a little expensive but I believe worth the investment.
5.0	I purchased these along with the matching switch plates and rocker plates.  The finish is lovely and the plates do not look flimsy or cheap.
5.0	imagine having a garage door opener that does not even make a sound, better yet, imagine a garage door opener that cant even be seen. yes, of course its invisible, so invisible that i havent seen it yet, although i paid $300.00 for it, it was never shipped or delivered to me so all i can do is imagine having one, so if you decide to purchase one why dont you just imagine having one...
5.0	We bought this to regulate a ceramic heater for the baby room. Before this, we used a timer that worked okay except the temperature fluctuated depending on ambient. This unit is easy to set, has weekday/weekend modes and keeps the room at the most comfortable temperature for our baby. It is also easy to move around with the heater in case the baby needs to sleep in our room for any reason.<br /><br />The rest of the house can be 68F during the night but the baby room is always 72F.
5.0	Heavy duty and obvious quality. These work great at dimming LED bulbs.
5.0	I recieved exaclty what I expected from the product description.  the product works well, and was easy to install. blah
5.0	Works great,perfect replacement
5.0	I got this pull to go with my great grandsons baseball fan. The fan has thi same colored baseball for the light.
5.0	These are the best available. Cost a little bit more, but they have a larger photo cell and are much more efficient.
5.0	Very easy installation. They come on at dusk, and go off at dawn. Adds just the glow that I wanted in the yard.
5.0	Used it to replace an old cover that I broke when I took it out. It went in easier then when I put the first one in, but that spring system they used is quiet tricky. Hint, Place one side of each spring in the slot, (same side of each spring) then use a needle nose pliers to insert the other side of the spring. Don't push the cover up into place until you have both springs in the slots or you won't have enough room to place the second spring.
5.0	This is the lowest flow shower head I could find so I expected it to not rinse quite as well as my old shower head. That comes with the territory. No surprises there. The flow pattern is about as wide as you would expect considering the necessary constraints of the water saving design. The engineers did well considering the specs they had to work with and the goals they were given.<br />The flow is somewhat gentle. I leave it on it's widest setting because if I put it on the massage setting not enough water comes out to really take a shower.<br />I love this shower head. For a couple years I've been telling my teenage son to stop taking those long (very long), hot showers in the morning and leave other people in the house some hot water for their showers. You know teenagers, in one ear and out the other. This shower head forces him to use less hot water. Now both showers in the house can be used at the same time without either one running out of hot water - even with a teenager in one of the showers!<br />Not only are we saving water, we are also saving on the natural gas used to heat the water. This shower head gets the job done but I wouldn't want any slower flow. This one is just about the right compromise between saving money and keeping clean.<br />I also got the HydroRight Dual Flush Conversion Kit offered by Amazon. It will be interesting to see what this one-two punch will do to our water/natural gas bills. If you get the conversion kit, do NOT take advantage of the offer underneath the product description &#34;People who bought this also bought....&#34; They will offer you the conversion kit along with a different handle and fill valve for a slightly cheaper price than the three bought separately.  The handle is nice but the fill valve and flush tube is already included in the conversion kit. No need to buy it twice!
5.0	Good Quality. Fast shipping. Had several devices delivered. Building a solar off-grid battery bank. Four GC2 golf cart batteries in 24v configuration. All 2/0 cables to inverter.<br />Cotek S1500-124 pure sine wave inverter. Bank charged by Samlex SEC-2425UL in UPS mode. Sharp 240W panels, Outback FM80 charge controller and Midnite Solar MNPV6, MNSPD-300, EBBB, MNEPV breakers DC, and MNDC-GFP63 from Channel Island Electric as are the PV-MC4 double insulated cables.<br />Will be adding a new bank of 208AH for a total of 416AH. If project grows an Outback Mate3 and FN-DC will be ordered.<br />Cheers, John
5.0	Purchased to replace Sinkerator 1/3 HP Badger disposal (as so many here have)... Ordered on amazon and arrived within 3 business days via amazon prime. Noticed that my old disposal was NOT connected to dishwasher and after thinking about it, wanted to attach this new one to my dishwasher. The idea of hot soapy water going through it almost daily sounded good as far as keeping it clean and fresh smelling. So, off to the big HD box store... talked to a licensed plumber there who advised against connecting to dishwasher. Why? I asked.... he told me that here in CO, the new plumbing code as of 7 years back makes it fail the code if attached to dishwasher. I said I still wanted to do it, and he helped me gather necessary parts (dishwasher attachment piece and additional piping). As I walked to the register I told him my reasons for wanting to attach it to the dishwasher, knowing I would be going against plumbing code. Well, he told me that it would wear out a lot faster if I did have it connected to the dishwasher due to the abrasive/caustic dishwasher soaps that are currently used. Wow.. didn't take that into consideration. Plus, if I moved, I'd have to disconnect the dishwasher for it to pass the current plumbing code (if discovered). So... I returned the extra parts and chose to install as the previous disposal had been installed.<br /><br />I watched the you tube video of the Waste King disposal installation. It was long, slow but very informative. If you see it and have a porcelain sink, you MUST use plumber's putty. If you have a stainless sink (like the one pictured on you tube), then you can use the rubber gasket included. I thought this disposal was longer than the Insinkerator version I was replacing so had purchased extra plumbing pipes which I did NOT need and will be returning. I had plumber's putty already since I replaced the kitchen faucet a few months ago.<br /><br />I used the EZ Mount system which was very easy. When adding the metal ring and rubber gasket under the sink, you must keep in mind that the metal silver ring must be able to move up and down or  you have pushed the gasket too high. The gasket has a lip around the edge, that fits inside the rim of the drain coming through the sink. If you practice a couple times taking it apart and putting it together prior to installation, that will help a lot. It's hard to explain but easy if you do it a couple of times. No leaks, and it works GREAT!<br /><br />The disposal does make a clicking noise as it turns on, but runs much quieter than my Insinkerator which was replaced after 8 years because it leaked intermittently from the reset button plus seams at the bottom.<br /><br />You can't beat Amazon's price, plus free shipping.<br /><br />P.S. I am female, and the installation was easy. The most difficult part was removing the old disposal and the 3 screw mount under the sink. What are you waiting for? If I can do it with a puppy annoying me during the process, you certainly can. The mount system is a  breeze. Watch the video online and read the directions carefully before starting. I kept pausing the video until I'd completed the steps shown, then started it again to preview the next steps.sket under the sink, you must keep in mind that the metal silver ring must be able to move up and down or  you have pushed the gasket too high.

5.0	I am VERY pleased with this item.  Easy to set up and looks super!  The arched window above the main window in my dining room faces South and we were getting way too much sun in there.  This shades but lets some light through.  The best thing is it looks very good.
5.0	Great seller, great product. Arrived fast and fit perfect. Will buy again.
5.0	After doing quite a bit of research to find just the right accent lighting to install on the crown molding in my theater, I found this fantastic product.  I have never been exposed to LED rope lighting and have only ever used the standard ropes which tend to generate quite a bit of heat.  I was concerned that the heat may pose a dangerous issue, but these lights do not seem to generate any heat; after four hours of being plugged in, the temperature of the light felt exactly the same as when I'd initially plugged it in.  My intention was to connect the lights to an outlet connected through a dimmer switch.  The lights dim as claimed; however, the lights seemed to have subtle surges of power which affected the light levels.  I plugged the lights into a non-switched outlet, and the light level was constant.  Perhaps a different dimmer would work better, but my plan is to replace the dimmer with an on/off toggle and enjoy the constant light level, which seems to be just the right level for my theater room.  I am very happy with these rope lights, and, barring any catastrophic failure in the future, I would highly recommend this product.
5.0	This was exactly what I was looking for and I got it quickly.
5.0	The lamps arrived quickly and they were packed so that there wasn't even a crack.  They have helped my allergies/sinuses a lot in the two days that I have owned them.  I hope it only gets better the longer I use them.  :)  They were bigger than I thought they were going to be though.  I priced them around town and discovered that this was the best price.<br /><br />If you are tired of putting eye drops in your eyes every hour and having constant sinus headaches and migraines, I recommend you try them.  I have used them for a couple of weeks, and I have seen a tremendous improvement.  I only have to use eye drops once a day (instead of the aforementioned every hour).  I do have to take my sinus/allergy medicine, but now it is just for when I leave the house.  I do not have a headache all day or wake up with migraines.  I am hoping that over time, I can stop using the eye drops (at least at home) and the sinus/allergy medication.  I do have a little trouble sleeping with the lamp on, mainly because I like my room dark and the glow from the lamp, while soft, is still there.  I don't do night lights.  I now have a sleeping mask to help with the light issue because I like not waking up with a headache or migraine.  I feel it is a fair trade :)<br /><br />For those of you with animals who don't get along, this also helps with that - or at least it has with my 2 cats.  They don't normally get along, but when I have the salt lamps on, they do.  They are much more relaxed and one cat even licked the other cats paw and there was no bloodshed or fighting.  It was amazing, usually if one of them brushes the other's tail or anything, it is cause for a huge, fur flying fight.<br /><br />I'm very pleased with how these are working out.  :)
5.0	These are great for the yard.  The opening is large enough to hold your beverage in a koozie, or in a Tervis Tumbler.
5.0	Heavy Duty, pulled off a stubborn compression nut with no problem.
5.0	I use this every freaking day! Works great for my hobby (minis) and with my eyesight I need every bit of light.  it's better than the old larger ones i have and well simply cheaper!
5.0	This is seriously a MUST have for any Eeyore fan. This is one of my prized Eeyore collections. The lamp itself doesn't light a room. But it is very soft lighting that is very pretty to have for a collector type piece on my desk. It is very well made and great quality. It is very unique and I love it.
5.0	This product is exactly the diverted I needed for my kitchen faucet. The picture is deceiving because there is no spring that come with it, which is okay because a spring is not needed for the repair
5.0	These are an absolute must if you have a front loading washer. They are easy to use and your washer smells fresh afterwards. I always leave my door and soap container open after using it, but you still need this product to keep your washer clean. I definitely recommend it.
5.0	It's a receptacle cover so what can you really say? It was exactly the same as I would get from Home Depot to Lowe's (if they have it in stock) at half the price.
5.0	It's funny,  I got the MB240 because we lost power over the summer and my son didn't want to sleep without a light.  But the day the package arrived we got hit with Irene.  Needless to say I got some use out of the kit rite away.  Let me say the system work flawlessly!!  I was able to see the generator hook-up, my son slept through the night and no one fell down the steps.  I would recommend this kit to anyone.
5.0	Quick delivery, great price
5.0	Item arrived promptly and it's of good quality.
5.0	Perfect for home/office networking. Easy installation.
5.0	This is a wonderful unit.  It works great and doesn't consume a lot of batteries doing its work.  Highly recommended for those that need a portable motion alarm.
5.0	Easy to set up. Simple instructions. Perfect for every need.
5.0	It doesn't get any simpler or easier to install.<br />Does well, waters great.
5.0	The kit worked as expected.  The nail gun is back to 100% after replacing all the o-rings in the main cylinder.  They don't give you much lubricant though, so be careful not to use too much on any one o-ring.  Shipping was quick and product arrived undamaged.
5.0	I now have three of these they operate independently based on easy to follow directions I would highly recommend this product
5.0	This shower head is so awesome that I am tempted to measure the gpm flow just to make sure they sent the right product!
5.0	GREAT TO HAVE WHEN NEEDED , A BIT PRICEY BUT WORTH IT WHEN STAINLESS IS REQUIRED . I HAVE A NICE SELECTION OF SIZES FOR ALL POSIBLE APPLICATIONS .
5.0	Just what I wanted.  Better than the magnetic ones which do not really seal well.
5.0	At about a buck a piece, these satin nickel pulls are perfect for my kitchen remodel project. Similar ones at Menards and Home Depot sell for about $3-4 each. I'm happy with the quality. Love the price. And would definitely recommend.
5.0	These adaptors work great. Save me some money on the hard to find bulbs that came with the bathroom lights. They are of high quality. I bought the screw in type if bulbs in teh miniture version. They do not protrude out too far. Plenty of light in the bathroom. If these were not sold I was ready to replace the bathroom lights.
5.0	So nice? Good quality.
5.0	Pump works awesome!  Was able to drain my spa in a fraction of the time.  Love it!
5.0	"I spent 2 months trying to get a replacement garage door remote from Sears.com for garage door opener model 139.53990.  Long story short-I couldn't seem to get the correct replacement remote from Sears.com for a Sears garage door opener. Go figure????  I googled the model of the remote I needed and this item popped up on Amazon.com  I ordered it, and when it did not show up in a couple of weeks contacted the company.  They reshipped it and I got it quickly and it works like a charm with my \\""amber\\"" learning light garage door opener! Plus the best part is it is less than half the cost of what Sears. com is charging from their website.  This is a no brainer-buy here on Amazon...."
5.0	My mantel was late being delivered and I noted this on my review.  I immediately was contacted by a representative and from then on the problem was being worked on.  Not only was I kept informed of the progress, I felt that every effort was being made to satisfy me.  After making arrangements for a new delivery date, I was credited for the total amount I paid for the item.  My mantel was delivered as promised and I will certainly use Amazon.com in the future, knowing that they really care about their customers.
5.0	Good bulb for what it is, but does not produce as much white light as I would like. I find that I would prefer 2 of them for my intended use.<br />I bought 1 bulb as a test and will end up buying several more after I am done renovating.
5.0	Works great. packaged well with no breakage!
5.0	Lovely products and what a wonderful company!  I purchased this street lamp for myself and went into Amazon.com to purchase another as a Christmas present for a friend.  Although Icy Craft no longer had this product available (yes, they sold out that fast!), the gentleman (Colt) was very courteous through email and over the telephone and helped me find the perfect replacement.  I highly recommend Icy Craft products!
5.0	This little rock light works great.  It looks just like a rock and is plenty bright at 20 watts.  The only issue is that you are going to be limited to the bright 20w illumination.  That was a bit much for my application, but I was not able to find a 10w replacement bulb.  Other than that, it works great.  I did cut off the connector and hard wired it into the landscape wire.
5.0	These are perfect butterfly decals! I let my 4 year old niece hang them on her wall in her room at my house. They were easily removed from the paper and also from the wall. She had a couple of times that they stuck to other butterflies, but I was able to peel them apart without any damage. We both love them!
5.0	This has a very narrow beam, and I got it just for that reason. I put it above my shower and works great. When Philips says 2700K they mean that. Very natural lighting!
5.0	Lovely lamp! It was a terrific Christmas present
5.0	Love the glow effects we can create!
5.0	Despite all the bad reviews I ordered 11 of these for my new home.. They arrived in great working condition! just what I thought they would be as far a quality very happy with my order
5.0	very nice  came in a timely fashion  thanks
5.0	Works flawlessly! Easy to setup and although it has 2 dummy switches it looks good too.<br />We have the three outlet remote switch too in addition to this unit. All good...<br />Very handy!
5.0	Fast shipping. Worked great with my Electrolux Icon side by side refrigerator/freezer.
5.0	Fit perfectly into my magic chef oven.
5.0	I wish I had bought on sooner. It is great to read by.
5.0	Was hard to find and my old camera is still highly functional.  I like having negatives to drop back on.  Can't express the frustration of a digital image backup going bad when I need it the most.
5.0	Worked exactly as described.  Recommend it!
5.0	Best solar light.  Easy to install batteries.  Light comes on at night and goes off during the day.  I highly recommend this solar light.
5.0	We bought a few of these for the showroom at work. Liked them enough we bought a couple of hundred direct from the company. We used to burn out 10-15 light bulbs a month. In the 3 months we have had these in we haven't changed a single bulb. We are using less than 1/2 the electricity we were before too! Our local energy company had a rebate/grant that we applied for that covered the ENTIRE cost of the retrofit. The bulbs are quite literally making me money now.
5.0	"Painted it with glow in the dark paint. Then used red paint to put bloody handprints all over it. Wore it with a gas mask. \\""Zombie haz mat cleanup team\\"" is what my son called it. Held up VERY well for Halloween!!"
5.0	I don't know what happened with some of the reviewers, but the shrink-wrapped filters I received were from Watts, fit my RO system perfectly and appear to be working fine.  I'm glad I decided to chance buying despite those ominous reviews.
5.0	Stylish, functional and very good quality. I think this lamp looks great in my office!
5.0	Hue is one of the most awesome home automation product I have.  When you first load it's mobile app, you feel it's confusing and limited function.  But when you link it with other home automation device and software such as wemo, Ifttt, smartthings, then it will release it's full power.  I have the lights turn on by sunset, change color for my kid's room at story time(her favorite thing), dim down when we go to bed, and also motion sensored at midnight if anyone gets up to the kitchen.  The problem? You just want to keep adding more bulb.  It's a much better build than the cheaper GE link products.
5.0	This was exactly what I needed! It's sturdy, and extremely easy to install if you are even slightly hands on. Plus the white porcelain matches the light fixture and accessories in my bathroom. Works so much better than the plastic that's supposed to look like metal handle that came with the toilet.
5.0	This product did what was intended for--survived on air conditioner covers and tarps over one winter. For those complaining about it taking off paint when removing in the summer--this isn't painters tape! Painters tape uses extremely low-tack adhesive to avoid that situation (and even painters tape can't be left on for more than a couple months.) Use the appropriate product for the job.
5.0	Very nice light.  It puts off light going down.  We have it in our stairway going into the loft.  I really like it alot
5.0	This light has a blue tint to the room , which is very unique. I love the look and I am planning on purchasing more. Love it.
5.0	Make sure to check the dimensions of this, as it was a little smaller than I anticipated. But overall, this is a beautiful pendant. I don't know why, but we had a hard time finding a brushed-nickel pendant fixture like this (reminiscent of the older looking fixture we replaced). This is a nice mix of old-school and contemporary. The bubbled glass would match many different decors, and blends in nicely with our updated kitchen with brushed nickel faucets, etc., but the older paneling. It's a nice thick glass and very pretty to look at. As other reviewers noted, though, it did come quite unusually packaged - packed in a ton of newspaper rather than in a packing box. Nothing was broken though, so I'm not complaining about that. My next door electrician neighbor installed it quickly and easily with no problems, and we have enjoyed it every since.
5.0	I installed this on an outside gate in September 2013 in Minnesota.  Since that time I have not once removed it or unlocked it.  I've attached pictures of what the lock looks like after having been exposed to Minnesota weather for 15 months.
5.0	I recommend this product to anybody who has a store and office and not a dedicated person for the store.<br />It works even from great distance and never miss a customer in the store anymore.
5.0	I love it! So far so good. I installed it in my new remodeled bathroom. I purchased the Venetian Bronze model.
5.0	The Best Christmas gift EVER! I sent this to my husband (of 31 years), and it came in the mail…he thought it was another bunch of baskets for me. Then I asked him to open it for me. He was SO surprised, and we had such a laugh. I was a big hero that day. He won the &#34;Major Award&#34; He recited all the lines…we are so corny!
5.0	Helps to save energy. Help the planet and save your monie at the same time. Very Good and easy to install.
5.0	My only complaint, which is really only my fault for not reading the product description more clearly, was being very surprised at how tiny these little guys were. The pictures don't give any sense of scale. However even with their tiny size, they sure are strong, exceeded my expectations, and met my needs
5.0	the lamp is more beautiful in person than the picture on line and was so glad to find the matching floor lamp. just love these lights.
5.0	I don't know about you folks, but I don't like those pull-down cords hanging down from ceiling fans. And while hand-held remotes are convenient; I have a habit of misplacing them! This works perfectly if you have a separate wall switch for your fan light and fan. That allows you to replace the fan wall switch with this control. All you have to do is set your fan speed to high before you remove the pull cords and install the speed control. The control fits perfectly in the opening where your Decora (or similar)  wall switch was located. Just remember to turn your breaker off when installing it to avoid a shocking experience. Then put the cords and remotes in a safe place and enjoy the convenience that this device provides.
5.0	Good quality, attractive lights. Copper wire blends in with our woodwork. Lights nearest the plug are brighter than those further along.
5.0	The filter was just the right one sent and received at lightning speed!
5.0	These are so adorable.  Very easy to apply and reposition.  Have only had them for a for a few days but the quality seems very durable.  The colors are muted giving it a vintage feel.<br />Highly recommend, especially for the price!
5.0	What you see is what you get.  The perfect size for my foyer table and when the lit up so beautiful. A good buy and choice.
5.0	Great Faucet! After searching at our local home improvement stores we were discouraged at all the &#34;plastic&#34; cheap products. We looked on Amazon and read the reviews for this product and were impressed. So we bought it! It is all metal except for the faucet head. It is a large/tall faucet larger than what we expected.  It is well made, sturdy and looks good. We have been using it for 6 months and still love it!
5.0	This standard size bathroom sink faucet looks and works just fine.  It is easy to install. The brushed nickle surface looks new after a year of use. Others have shown corrosion in this time interval so I don't consider this a minor plus.    The faucet fits right in with our floor to ceiling bathroom remodel which we completed last summer (2010). Our previously crummy bathroom is now a work of art and the faucet is a nice part of the package.    I have not detected any leaks. My wife has not complained even though I bought it without consulting her. In this regard I consider myself lucky and I would not recommend you pressing your luck - ask her first.
5.0	this  is  beautifull  and  precious.... this  lamp  is  fantastic
5.0	Did exactly as described. It took me 10 seconds to syn with my garage door opener. Great product.
5.0	No problems with new furface burner. Works very well and it does the job it was intended to do.  Thanks,
5.0	MY HUSBAND CLEANS FANS & LIGHT FIXTURES AND PEOPLE ASK HIM TO CHANGE BULBS &#34;WHILE HE'S AT IT&#34; SO THIS DEVICE FILLS THE BILL.  JUST PUT IT ON A POLE ( OR ANY HANDLE THAT HAS A THREADED END) & WET THE SUCTION CUP SLIGHTLY..........BUT MAKE SURE THE BULB IS COOLED DOWN FIRST.  IF YOU HAVE DIFFERENT SIZE BULBS AT YOUR HOUSE, GET THE 3 PIECE KIT.  DEFINITELY WORTH THE PRICE.
5.0	I was shocked at the price of these bulbs at our local stores (Lowes & Home Depot). They were roughly $7.50-$8.30 PER BULB. So, I turned to Amazon and purchased these. So far so good. I can't tell the difference except in my pocket book.
5.0	I have used the small packs you can buy anywhere (Lowes, Walmart, etc) and yes the are a little clearer.  But you give up on toughness.  When I use and still do use the small packs for all my standard size windows I have to be very careful not to shrink it too tight or it will split open right at the spot I am hitting it with heat.  I also have 5 widows measuring just over 5' X 6'.  No little box kit had a chance.  Even some of the bulk rolls I was looking at fell short on the size I need.  Not to mention a higher price.<br />I am already stocking up for next years cold now.  Can't beat the price. A+++++ product<br />By the way.  I have yet to have a visitor over that noticed they were even there until I pointed it out to them.
5.0	a needed product, keeps my water fresh!!!  easy to install
5.0	I've been looking to outfit my entire house in LED bulbs and this one had fantastic reviews so I ordered one off of Amazon to try it out.      It got here yesterday and I tried it out in a lamp and felt like the light was quite a bit brighter than the 60 watt incandescent next to it.  The light wasn't quite as warm as the incandescent but definitely wasn't bad.  Next I took it into my parent's bathroom and tried it out in their light fixtures and you probably wouldn't have been able to tell the difference in the 3 lights in the fixture. My parent were so impressed that they wanted me to order 6 of them for them for their bathroom (they don't like how hot the incandescent bulbs make their bathroom).    I did notice the heat sink getting a bit hot so I left it turned on in a lamp at my parent's house overnight to see how hot it would be in the morning and it hadn't changed at all during the night.  The bulb was just a bit warm to the touch, and the heat sink was just a bit too hot to be comfortable to touch for more than a couple seconds.      Overall I'm very impressed with this light so I ordered exactly 41 more bulbs from their site.  Hopefully they all work great!  If anything changes with my shopping experience through them I'll update my review later.      41 bulbs x 7 watts, or 41 bulbs x 60 watts.  I expect this to make a pretty good size dent in my power bill =)
5.0	Very good quality and heavy.
5.0	Love these REALLY BIG calendar pages that stick and re-stick on a wall or filing cabinet, or lay flat on a conference table, and wipe clean with water. Smart phones, laptops and tablets are fine for managing schedules for a single day, week or month, but fall short when you really need to see all the details for three or four months at once.
5.0	I know this is their extra sticky stuff, but boy, does it stick! Worth the extra money. Extra strong fabric, but you can still tear it off the roll. This stuck to a surface I had tried to seal repeatedly with regular Duck brand duct tape. This is great stuff. Just buy it and save yourself the frustration.
5.0	Perfect for all of our important documents. I like that it also has straps in the lid for smaller items like our vehicle titles and marriage license.
5.0	arrived on time and performed as advertised.
5.0	Just what I need for storing gallon of milk and sunnyd
5.0	This lantern is brighter than my other solar lights and casts a beautiful shadow at night. I will be ordering another
5.0	[[ASIN:B0012Q5AJC GROHE 32999SD0 Alira Low Profile Centerset Pullout Kitchen Faucet, Stainless Steel]]  Superb construction and the installation was simple (I did the installation myself).  I did RTFM (read The Fine Manual) before installation and fit the parts together before going under the sink.  I replaced an earlier Grohe faucet which was a bear to install and remove.  The water pullout tube is metal, not plastic, and the return spring is strong but permits easy pullout.  There is an indent making it easy to return the pullout to its fixed position.
5.0	If you hate to iron like I do, you'll keep a good supply of this amazing wrinkle release product on hand. It's especially great to smooth wrinkles in scarves, shawls, and sweaters. It's a good idea to spray items the evening before so you have plenty of time to follow the recommended wrinkle remover process.
5.0	Very nice.  We live in Florida but wanted a fireplace in our living area for the atmosphere.  It is great.  We built it into a stone hearth and mantle.  I would recommend this to anyone wanting an electric fireplace.
5.0	Easy to install. High quality. No problems.
5.0	I was tired of cleaning around the cords under my work desk so I found these on amazon and just organized the whole mess with 2 captive cables and a few small pieces of velcro organizers. It looks so much better and the cat is a little safer now too, she was always trying to chew some cords.
5.0	Fit perfectly and arrived promply. Love it!
5.0	I ordered these for my mother's home and she really likes them and they look really nice in her bathrooms.
5.0	works great, had it a few years now.
5.0	Beautiful shower door.  Seems to be high quality, time will tell.  Two thumbs up.
5.0	Great Item.  Fast Shipping.
5.0	Replaced the sensors on my old craftsman garage door opener. Very easy to install and align. Work perfect
5.0	Excellent valve and this allows for replacement of valves on older toilets with very long tailpieces.
5.0	"I ordered these desiccant packs for use in plastic shoe boxes stored in my \\""very cold closet\\"" and have found them to do exactly what I had hoped.  All shoes are warm and dry."
5.0	Need I say more than what has already been said.  This is quite simply stunning elegance for your dining room.
5.0	This really is a nice lamp.  Quite elegant in its way and very flexible and functional with a wide variety of brightness settings.  It turns on and off with a touch in the circle on the base and the brightness is adjusted the same way.  No heat given off either (it has a nice spread of light from multiple leds).  Easily the best desk lamp I have ever owned, or used for that matter.
5.0	I purchased Smelly washer cleaner, April 16th. I did not use this till June 1st, but what a difference it made. The smell is gone!!! It's been over 2 weeks and no smell. This was only one application and no smell. WOW, this stuff is good. I say buy it and use it, see how it works for you.
5.0	I've only had it a few weeks but it seems like it is working fine. I recommend this product. It will save money over time.
5.0	These worked really well for my event... and then I took them home and am using them around the house. I'm really pleased with these candles and will likely buy more. They have the perfect warm glow and the flickering is very realtic. They are better quality than those cheesy electric tea lights you usually see people use.
5.0	This stuff works great to anchor down breakables in a household of numerous cats.  I highly recommend it.
5.0	Other than the slight damage that occured in shipping, this dor bar works great. It fit into my fridge with ease and keep my yogurt in the door, saving space on the shelves!
5.0	Awesome, awesome.  I'm a dustophobe, I even used it to dust me entire apartment, behind furniture, etc.  It's scary what you see floating in the air, I opened the window with an exhaust fan and just watched dust bunnies being sucked out of my place.
5.0	Aimed upwards toward the underside of the umbrella, this warm white light gives the perfect ambiance for dining, drinking, or just hangin' out. Being rechargeable is a very cool feature, too. Much better than hanging stringed lights. Two big thumbs up for this product.
5.0	Love this! Does a wonderful job filtering hard water. I researched the brand before buying. It really does make a difference with my hair and skin.
5.0	Worked perfect. great fit was real easy to install
5.0	This is the greatest stuff for privacy! I got it and it was easy to cut, put on the window and remove. And don't worry if you put it on a window in a bathroom the steam does not remove this from the window. It is amazing! It looks really nice on the window and you still get light, it is completely private.
5.0	I'm really happy with this product. I have a few 6-outlet adapters that have two rows of three outlets that I used to use. The problem with those is I cannot plug in anything that has a large adapter at the plug end without covering up one (or two!) of the other outlets. This product allows me to use all six outlets with anything I've tried to plug into it so far.
5.0	A very nice faucet. We love it. Works well and we can use it to move the water stream around the sink with ease. Looks very sharp too.
5.0	I've been using these timers for about 10 years now and have never replaced them. I am looking to purchase additional timers for more holiday lighting, however, I was disappointed to learn both Home Depots in my town had discontinued these and replaced them with a not-so-user-friendly brand. I was so pleased to see Amazon selling them. The other brand works, but they cannot compare to Intermatic. The Intermatic are easy to use, precise and reliable. I have never had a problem with them, in fact, I have been using them to turn on and off a variety of July 4th, Halloween and Christmas decorations throughout the year inside and outside my home including multiple light strands wrapped inside and outside my barn, around trees, around lamp posts, wreaths, garland, reindeer and other ornamental lighting. They're so easy to set. You can set up to three occurences by just moving around the little clips at the appropriate start and stop times. The little notch on the wheel grabs the clip and turns it on, then spins around and turns it off at the next clip. If you want to bypass the timer settings, there is a little knob to turn it on manually. I've always used the timers with name brand heavy duty extension cords from the home improvement stores. Never a blown circuit or plug or timer! And these timers are turning on and off a good amount of electricity. I can't say enough good things about this timer. Thanks for offering these Amazon.
5.0	Bought a 22&#34; and a 14&#34; for a kitchen upgrade. Used included AC plug to verify operation prior to installing since I would be cutting wires.  Used the hardwire connection method. Controlled by a duplex switch/plug that replaced a duplex plug.  Units sit underneath cabinet and are hidden by bottom lip of cabinet. Installation fairly straight forward if you are electrically inclined.  Placed unit with lighted part towards front edge of cabinet. All hardware was supplied, but my cabinet bottoms were too thin to use the mounting screws supplied. That was the only thing I had to buy extra. Lights up the countertop beautifully. Nice white light. Can finally see what I am cutting!  Well worth the time and effort to install.
5.0	I bought 3 of these sinks for the bathrooms im my house and we are very happy with them. They look just like the more expensive ones. I would buy these sinks or other products from this manufacturer if i ever need to buy sinks again.
5.0	We love these. Used to use the felt and for your larger pieces they work great on hardwood floors. Do expext a little difficulty in putting soft fuzzy pieces on the disks.
5.0	GREAT STUFF better than LOWES and HOME DEPOT Products GREAT ON FLOORS TREATING WOOD drys hard and better than latex and acrylic
5.0	The re-installation of another H-300 cartridge went smoothly.  All one has to do is follow the instructions that come with the cartridge.  Lasts about one year.  Have had the Everpure filter system about 5 years and have never had any problems.
5.0	Fast and easy. Quality part. Very satisfied
5.0	This is a perfect desk lamp.  It provides bright white light which I prefer for reading.  I am planning to buy a floor model to place by my couch.  Typical lamps do not provide enough light for me.  This definitely does the job without being blinding.
5.0	I've been using this on a consistent basis.  No problems.  The insulation stays flexible in cold below freezing weather.  The light up end is handy to determine if you have power.
5.0	This was a Christmas gift for my parents.  They haven't stopped talking about it since they started watching it! I love Amazon and their offers.
5.0	One of the best, great for lights or small appliances, I have this on my bathroom that will use a led bulb along with a small heat device, pair with nexia and a door sensor will turn on light and heat when you close the door, will shut-off when you exit or open the door, this device dont use a schedule due bathroom will always needs lights ( no outside window ) but if your bathroom has a window then a schedule from sunset to sunrise will do the trick, a little immagination will take you long way with this gizmo.
5.0	I would love it if it were actually what I needed on the construction site. Confession: I thought L5-20 and L5-30 connectors were compatible but I was wrong; they don't fit.  I can't find a lighted L5-20 male to (2) L5-20 female lighted splitter. Coleman, please make one and I'll buy it in a heartbeat.
5.0	My wife has eyesight that is falling and this light offers her a better field for quilting. It is a great help.
5.0	Fast shipping!  Product arrived fast and on time.  Great addition to my bx25d.  I have used a few times already to move my chicken coop and move different things around the yard.  Easy to put on and take off only takes a minute.
5.0	Needed a replacement in a rental property that had rotted out. Fits our stove perfectly after 3 unsuccessful purchases at home improvement stores.
5.0	Love this mop. The best on my wood and laminate floors.
5.0	makes me smoke clouds! best kanthal wire for my vape!
5.0	Smells good, goes on easy, seems to be very durable!
5.0	This is a pretty basic product, or it seems that way. I am rating 5 stars for a reasonable price from a good brand. I have not USED the pole yet though! ... so I will update if anything goes awry.
5.0	Does exactly as advertised.  It's really helped figure out where I'm using electricity when I didn't know I was.
5.0	Looked at local stores and the entire faucet ends were made of plastic as well as the soap dispenser.  Found this item searching the internet and purchased both the Kraus stainless steel sink and this faucet and soap dispenser.  Quality made product and would highly recommend (as I already have to a friend who also going to purchase a Kraus).
5.0	love ths lamp.  Excellent quality for the $$ paid.
5.0	Very nice finish and easy to install. A solid, nice looking house number. Very modern, but looked great on my 1920s house.
5.0	No damaged ones received and the price was great and they still work days later. The extension pipe is a great added touch.
5.0	They work well on the stoveand refrigerator.
5.0	This is the best door lock set ever.  It is so convenient not having to carry a key or not having to leave my house unlocked for my handyman to come over. It looks beautiful and it is very heavy duty
5.0	I bought this item because it it much cheaper then the name brand model.  My water tastes the same if not better! Highly recommend.
5.0	Great for front porch security. Very bright white light and works great with my 10-year old motion sensor.
5.0	Great lights ,they work great
5.0	You have to get the app! Everyone I show it to is completely amazed by its functions. Turn my house on from a different country and if using geothermal heating it is a must. This thermostat even has a setting for geothermal radiant heat! So user friendly too
5.0	Love this chandelier, it is bright and the brushed steel is perfect for any decor.  It was easy to install, would recommend to anyone who likes simple but elegant.
5.0	everything is great thanks
5.0	Fast shipping.  Item great for outdoor lighting.  Bulb is totally shielded from weather so less burn out or risk of electrical issues.  And they are good looking.
5.0	Switch works the way it is suppose to. Unlike others I did not find it difficult to wire. A large gang box is needed. I used a 4 gang for two rocker switches and the four function switch, leaving plenty of room for the wiring.
5.0	I needed this expansion kit to add to my light kit over my kitchen cupboards. It added the perfect amount of lights for my cupboards.
5.0	Excellent, very good, I recommend it.
5.0	Worked great, and I have not had any problems with leaks any more. I will most definitely buy again the next time I have to replace a toilet.
5.0	Best thing we could have bought - alot of spliters that come with head and handle kits are trash.  I can't believe I waited this long to purchase this and would buy again if it breaks down.
5.0	I added this to the adapter I installed on my kitchen sink so that I could screw on a hose to water my plants on my patio. The nice thing about this fitting is it gives you several different ways to get it to fit correctly depending on the threads on your faucet. It screws on easily making it easy to remove when I need to hook up the hose. Works exactly as I had hoped so now I don't have water splashing all over the counter or me.
5.0	Aqua Plumb 1800090 AB1953 REQES 8-Inch Two-Handle Polished Chrome Combo... got this to go over my old concrete laundry tub, works great and suits it to a T!
5.0	I have to hand it to the engineers who built this excellent LED bulb. Absolutely no flicker when using dimmers, (and my dimmers are 25 years old). The bulb has the ability to dim to extremely low levels and alternately, to very bright, far surpassing the upper and lower limits of the old 75 watt bulbs I was using in my bar. The light is warmer than florescent bulbs, no blue, and the bulbs fit into small desk lamps.
5.0	Spent a lot of time looking at sinks for my new kitchen remodel, this is what I choose. I like the set of the sink, faucet, and soap dispenser. Worth every dime in quality. You can't by this kind of quality at the local home improvement store.
5.0	This isn't the most common part, and my local Lowes and Home Depot didn't have it. I ordered this part from Amazon and it installed perfectly.
5.0	What can I say, it is a toilet seat.  Easy to install.  I ordered two and they have been working well for several weeks.  I would order these again if I needed another seat.
5.0	Worked great. Plus enough word so I got the minimum of 18.  Let's see.  Six more words.  That does it.
5.0	I spent waaaay too much time looking for curtain rings to match a lovely oil-rubbed bronze-style curtain rod, and after doing far too much research, I decided to buy these.  The price was great, the reviews were good, and aesthetically they were exactly what I was wanting. They arrived very quickly, and I am as thrilled with them as anyone can be about curtain rings.  Trust me, if you're looking for dark metal curtain rings, you'll love these!
5.0	works great. purchased two more for the back yard.
5.0	Nice unit.  Be careful hooking it up after use so you don't drop it. Otherwise, works as intended. Can use in duplex mode or solo.
5.0	For the price, this is a great product. I am very Impressed with how well it works.
5.0	Works great on both of my toilets (main bathroom & half bath). It's nice and secure and won't break like the cheap plastic ones.
5.0	The dual heads on this are great. The hose is long enough to spray the opposite wall. The control for turning the faucet on and off has a helpful feature - you can set a water temperature that you like, and leave the smaller handle set to that, but use the larger handle to turn the water on and off. The temperature goes back to &#34;just the way you like it&#34; each time. I did used to have a hanger on the shower for shampoos, soaps, etc. and there is no room for that to hang from it anymore. My plumber recommended Delta fixtures for remodeling my house. He especially suggested the In2ition for the showers. Great advice.
5.0	One of the most widely used accessories in my boat! Conveniently stores, light weight, and supports my 331 lbs.
5.0	I bought this to replace the same faucet that is installed under cover outdoors. After many years my original AS Cadet Bar Faucet is pitting and weathered but still works very well. I'm waiting to install the new faucet in the spring. I'm hoping to get another 10 years out of the new faucet. My review is really on the old faucet along with the price and shipping of the new faucet. I thought the price was really good and shipping was very fast.
5.0	just what we were looking for no plug in to electric necessary nice clear sound I would recommend to every one
5.0	Best water filtration system.
5.0	Great quality part.  I usually do not like to order parts thru mnail order, but having tru-to-life pics helps make shopping a breeze,  Thanks you...
5.0	Excellent and reliable photocell at 12V...it works great
5.0	These eyes more than met my expectations.  This is the second time I have ordered them.
5.0	Love the warm glo but not real bright like a modern bulb.
5.0	As an electrician(20 years) I can say this is the nicest wireless switch system I have seen.  I only installed it yesterday but it has been flawless so far. I took the remote switch 2 floors away and it still worked. The base (wired) switch is kind of odd looking with little clips on the side that make it look like something is missing, but from the pic's it is right. My customers are very happy. I will use this again in hard to wire area's. Update! I have just seen that a handheld remote can be snapped on to the front of the base switch. This explains the clips on the base switch.
5.0	good price and quality!
5.0	I love this bulb. It works as advertised, works well in the hallway and equipment room. I would like to see the same bulb with longer range detection so when I walk down the stairs it would detect me from the distance.
5.0	WORKS WELL. MADE MY JOB OF MARKING OUT WHERE MY FENCE WAS TO BE INSTALLED
5.0	I had a drip.  I did a little research and put these in.  I no longer have a drip!  It was much easier than I suspected, I wish I had done my research a bit sooner... although my local water department is probably glad I didn't!!  If you buy, I hope they work out as well for you!
5.0	Great  nice faucet. Thank yo
5.0	Love them.  Easy to install and work perfectly. I would buy more if needed.
5.0	I am very pleased with my Whirlpool filters.  The price was amazing.  I could purchase 2 for the price I used to have to pay for 1 before...GREAT DEAL!!
5.0	perfect, exactly what I expected. Installed it on our master bedroom bathroom fan. Ususlly go with the Amazon reviews and again they were correct.
5.0	The scroll detail was exactly what I was looking for!  Very simple to apply! Make sure to measure as this product is meant to add a simple addition to your wall so don't assume it is large enough to use alone...unless it is being used in a small space!
5.0	Great contact paper, have had numerous compliments on the wall behind my desk.
5.0	Arrived fast and very well packed. Exact same size as the Halogen 12v 35W bulb. It fits into the fixture very nicely and it is very bright. I think this 1.8W replacement lights brighter than the 35W halogen. Will definitely buy more.
5.0	Good price, exactly as advertised, one of the few remaining PAR38 spots.
5.0	Good breaker.  Ge panel, used for a 50a ac/dc arc welder..  Works great and has a hard throw so seems like a good breaker..
5.0	This was easy to install, and I am not usually the handy type.  It is strong and thats good because we get some bad wind where I live in Ohio on the lake.
5.0	I Received lots of compliments on the finial. It has a beautiful finish. It is great for the horse lover.
5.0	This motor controller is being used to open/close a roll off roof observatory with the use of a Bison 3 phase gearmotor. It has all the options needed to customize the motor's operations. Inparticular I like the ramp up/down and braking functions. It does everything I need it to at a very reasonable price.
5.0	The description said universal remote but that's not true only works with other linear products I gave five  stars because it probably works good I have a craftsman garage so it doesn't work on mine
5.0	I got this ladder for my husband to use in his retirement as we travel around the country in our 5th wheel.  It's very easy to use and doesn't take up much room.  I can carry it easily, which is a first.
5.0	Works great, had to remove the water restricter for the best pressure. My wife loves it when she cleans the shower.
5.0	After you install this filter you need to let a lot of water flow to get the water come out without any &#34;filter&#34; taste. After a couple of days the taste goes away.
5.0	Good product. I would buy again. Go with brand names and have no regrets. I wish I could remember that!
5.0	The filter came in on time, easy to replace. The directions were thorough and easy to follow. It was a direct replacement with simple installation. We will use these again.
5.0	fixed broke drawer guides perfectly
5.0	Worked beautifully on my outdoor table. Need plenty of ventilation while using!
5.0	It's a really nice tarp & much better quality than comparable price ones at the store! Would definitely buy again!
5.0	Looks amazing! Worked really well my son loves it. Makes his room very ninja turtle theme with the added bricks
5.0	finally something stopped our shower leakage! has stayed on and no leakage after trying multiple other barriers. highly recommend it!
5.0	These are excellent bulbs and the ability to use them with or without the ballast bypass is very nice.
5.0	What a fantasic way to dress up a picture!  Super easy to install, works reliably and illumiates our fairly large picture beautifully.  I am very happy with this purchase!
5.0	"I bought this magnet pack exclusively to use as a \\""stud finder\\"". I keep at least one magnet on my tool belt at all times (on my hammer head or nippers). Super easy to locate studs via drywall screw heads for knowing where you can anchor cabinets, moldings, etc. They are brittle so don't drop them or let them go more than one inch or so from something metal. I had one slip out of my hand. It landed on my hammer a few feet down and split into two pieces, which stuck to each other."
5.0	I bought this Joy Bidet several months ago and it has been working excellent. I believe having a Joy Bidet in your bathroom is just a brilliant idea and I think HC-2 is just the right choice. I recommend it for all.
5.0	I was hesitant at first because they are just circles but these work amazing!!! One flick of a black lights and they will glow for the rest of the evening! They look so real and so beautiful! Will purchase again.  You can see them in the day light but it's not super noticeable.
5.0	Easy installation. Sturdy. Not made for big items, but important paperwork and jewelry will fit easily. Installed in a closet. Easily hidden by clothes.
5.0	It is very good quality<br />looks very beautiful<br />doing a great job<br />and the price is very good<br />Would recommend it to my friends
5.0	Keeps my 1911 outta my 3 and 7 yr olds hands if I run back in house or gettin gas . Makes it legal to carry in truck in Cali w/out mag . $20 why not
5.0	great product but unfortunately you can not put more than 10 100 bills in it, I use it for keep my money safe in travel
5.0	So far so good.  We added a beam under our kitchen floor to get the deflection under control, and then used the ditra underlayment for a relatively large size but soft stone tile.  It's been a year and we have zero cracks.  Great product.
5.0	"I have installed many ceiling fans in my lifetime. This fan installs fast and easy.  The blades \\""click' in - no dealing with those pesky fan screws. It is darn quiet/silent. The only issue is with the remote and the instructions.  There is no info on how to change the fan direction. The answer is when the fan IS spinning in one direction HOLD down the reverse button until you see the fan slow down.  The fan will eventually slow, stop, and change direction. Great fan. Great price."
5.0	Thank you I received the two Filters and tested them. works great!  Just what I needed. Fast shipping and at wonderful price. Thank You.
5.0	Great product - will likely order again.
5.0	Does what it should and great price especially when compared to buying from Home Depot etc.  Took all of 5 minutes to install. Note: if you are installing this to convert a three prong to a four prong for modern houses, the green wire is your grounding wire and should be screwed onto the grounding plate or body of the dryer inside your access panel.
5.0	This product was recommended by a friend.  He warned of the clean up ahead of the purchase.  That didn't deter me.  I purchased two at the onset.  I also purchased the tune up kit (haven't needed it yet).  I am not a professional painter but I got better than professional results with this item.  No splatter, drips, and it comes with excellent instruction manual.  I liked the product so much I'm going to get two more.  They'll be held in reserve for future repair/replacements parts.  Drip pan flimsy and fell off during painting; but I found it wasn't really needed.  Disappointed the roller covers aren't readily available at my local hardware store.  I have a friend who is a professional painting contractor that wouldn't touch an item like this because of the clean up time.  I understand that for a person who paints for a living.  I don't think this was designed for a pro but it was designed for professional results.  I also noticed that even though it took a lot of paint to prime the roller I had more paint left in the can after each job.  If you hate painting (and I do)and the mess it creates this is the product for you! Clean up was fine.  I took everything apart the would unscrew, popout, etc and rinsed really good.  Put vaseline back on the plunger(inner tube), allowed it to dry and it was ready for the next room.  The price was great too because it was on sale!  Buy it, try it, you might love it too!
5.0	Easy to hang and unique. Love it.
5.0	I'm not sure why you cannot purchase hinges for Bi-fold cabinet doors in the store, but we searched high and low for these and found them at the Blum website.  They were the perfect replacement hinge for our cabinet and work perfectly.  Thanks Blum!
5.0	This is a replacement piece, the old one lasted about eight years of constant use. Hopefully this one will too.
5.0	very nice item. firstly its well built and the size is just perfect, looks beautiful at night with her subtle flower lights. quite happy with the purchase.
5.0	Fantastic invention.  Works GREAT.
5.0	It could be a little brighter, but all and all we are very happy with this light. WE bought 2 of them
5.0	This fixture was a great but for our spare bath. It looks way more expensive  than in the pics!! Very happy with it and it matches my rubbed oil bronze fixtures perfectly.
5.0	The stickers are now all over my son's bedroom. He reads the names of the train every night before he goes to sleep. Good quality too!
5.0	Well-described; delivery was prompt, so excellent.
5.0	cute lamp. perfect for any place you would like to put it;,,I love wolves ;; A PERFECT GIFT FOR ANY WOLF LOVER
5.0	This little night light is so cute! I bought it for my grandson to put in his little tent! It has a warm little glow.
5.0	This is a pretty light.  The dark glass absorbs more of the light than I expected but it looks great.  Arrived very securely shipped.  The light fixture doesnt hum when poweed on like some other internet light fixtures I have purchased.
5.0	Purchased this for my son's room - i'm happy with the quality of the image, it seems durable and very easy to put up (helps to have another person in the room, so they can tell you if it's crooked); I've tried to re-position a few times, and it held up well.  Just like it says in the description, this image is about 5 feet tall, so plan accordingly.  I'm happy with the price as well, because there's another company out there that makes these, at 3x the cost.  Follow up - the only gripe i have so far is that the top parts of the decal peel off the wall on hot days and you have to stick it back.. not a major issue, but thought I'd menion it
5.0	When I moved into a new house, I wanted a curved shower rod.  The look of the bathroom dictated getting a bronzed color.  After almost three years of use, this has help up great.  Installation was easy, it looks great, and it still looks like new despite having metal hooks being used multiple times a day on it.
5.0	Thank you!  Bought 2 to replace old remotes circa 2002. Service was prompt and product arrived in perfect boxed condition. Just ordered the keyless entry 976LM to replace our old one.
5.0	If your wife's cooking stinks, this filter helps eliminate the smell. My over the stove microwave did not come with<br />the filter, but did come with a spot for it. This is an exact fit for my model. P.S. The food may stink, but it always<br />tastes great!
5.0	I was looking to replace my 8 year old smoke alarms that started to randomly beep at night. The bottom plastic mounting ring that is against the ceiling must also be changed buy this was easily done. It took about 1 hour to replace 6 older smoke alarms
5.0	I have this safe under my seat in my silverado and it works great. I also bought one for my wifes g6 so she would have a place to lock up her weapon in her car. This is way better than the biometric model. Just buy this one don't waste you time with the other.
5.0	After sitting on my expensive eyeglass frames and breaking the stems I was sad. However I repaired the frames AND made a fashion statement at the same time by making the stems BLUE. Over the last year I had blue and grren eyeglasses. It is a cheap and cool way to fix and update my boring broken brown frames. Yeah!
5.0	exactly as advertised - beautiful results
5.0	Great burner worked well
5.0	I love this purchase! It matches perfectly with other nickel metal items in my powder room and it looks like it cost much more than I paid.
5.0	I BOUGHT THESE BULBS TO REPLACE 20 WATT HALOGEN AND I AM EXTREMELY SATISFIED WITH THEM.<br />I HAVE TWO ON EACH OF MY 35 FT. TALL PALM TREES. AND THEY LOOK GREAT. I COULD NOT BELEIVE HOW FAST MY ORDER WAS PROCESSED. THANKS AGAIN TORCHSTAR.
5.0	They got here at a reasonable time. The price was good. They work and fit really good
5.0	This does a great job with incandescent bulbs.  They have a different model if you want to use flourescent bulbs.
5.0	We gifted this to our youngest son who recently purchased a loft downtown. He loves it, entertains a lot and gets a ton of complements on it.
5.0	We bought a house and only got 1 door opener.  I ordered a second for my husband that so kindly let me have the 1 opener.  It came in today, faster then expects and took 3 minutes to get it working.  It was a fraction of the cost direct from the company or Home Depot!  Thinking of getting a third as a back up!
5.0	It's worth starting out the review stating that these lights take a couple minutes to fully warm up. They shouldn't be used in a bathroom or any other room that you need quick access to lighting. You should know that going in. I would add that I've used them in my living room and office and it hasn't bothered me at all. Usually once the lights go on in those rooms they stay on for awhile.<br /><br />As for performance, I was surprised at just how close these mimic traditional floodlights. I'd be surprised if you could tell a difference once they've warmed up. The rest of the benefits you probably already know about. It will lower your electric bill and it does help keep rooms cooler as the bulb doesn't emit as much heat. This is particularly nice in the Summer if you want to save a little extra on the AC bill.<br /><br />Overall, I'd highly recommend these to anyone who has a room that the lights are typically not going on or off a lot. A living room or home office works for me, and I'll probably get around to swapping out the lights in my kitchen at some point too. I'd stay away from using these in the bathroom or hallways, but otherwise they are  a great and cost effective addition to the home.
5.0	Great product. Super strong, just what I needed
5.0	I'm using these in the kitchen where I don't light to be too, too warm in color, but I don't want it to be daylight either. This one works pretty much perfectly.
5.0	OEM replacement ; is not a knock off
5.0	I tried many options, but stuck with these because they light up the room nicely with a bright pure light that comes on instantly and glows evenly. These bulbs fit perfectly and were a great replacement for my older standard bulbs.
5.0	The shower head was very easy to install . Looks great in the shower , and the different settings are great for washing my hair and just feeling like you are in a spa . I will buy this for my other two showers . Very sturdy and the dual shower heads work well together . The knobs turn easily to adjust and also to change the sprayer and shower heads .
5.0	Great Showerhead.  Both settings work well--rain and stronger shower.  Easy to install, good looking.  Everything is good.
5.0	One day I was considering how to solve a lighting problem, when it occurred to me that someone must make a light socket extender. I search that term here on Amazon and found this. It turned out to be exactly what I needed. It seems well made, and it allowed me to convert a recessed ceiling fixture into a directional light that I can aim at the wall.
5.0	The product arrived on time and as advertised.  It FIT my faucet perfectly (tight with no leeks).  The quality is good and comes on and off easily.
5.0	These knobs are part of a matching line that also includes cup pulls. I installed both of these  items on my cherry shaker cabinets and they are a great update. They have a wonderful finish and go great with stainless appliances. They come with the screws needed for installation.
5.0	just what we needed to provide a neat installation in our cement board siding
5.0	"The lightnight comes with 2 types of light settings:  a soft blue \\""night light\\"" (depending on the color you bought) and the white LED light for diaper changing, going to the bathroom, getting a late night snack, etc.  The soft blue light is on while you charge it.  The lightnight reminds me of those old school candle lamps as far as how the light is distributed/shines.  It's solidly built and provides enough light to do what we need to do at night while not waking up our 2 week-old."
5.0	Great bang for your buck
5.0	We just love this desk light, it's hard to find one that's not huge and how nice that the controls allow different level lighting.
5.0	Very easy to install and configure.  High quality product.  I love that it will notify me on my phone if there is a problem at my house.
5.0	Quality shower door. Install directions are easy to follow. I installed it on a fiberglass shower that had curved surfaces around the opening so it took some filing to get the bottom and top plates to match the curves. Door arrived by truck and, to my surprise, the glass wasn't broken and no missing parts. Wife loves it.
5.0	Long wait to get them, but worth it!
5.0	This is a perfect replaement for hot tub plugs, it gives you all the protection with a compact size. Plug works great and doesn't seem to get warm to the touch like the other one we had. Easy to replace/clearly marked for wire hook up.
5.0	I bought a similar travel adapter/converter from Target (also here online under a different name, made in China) for $29.99 in a rush. It lasted a week before it burned out in the middle of printing some important papers for work! I replaced it with this one from Skross which I bought while I was in Europe for 22 Euros. What a difference in quality! The way the prongs slide out feel like a machine instead of a cheap piece of plastic. And so far, I've used it often with no problems and now I don't have to worry about losing power while doing important work.<br /><br />Bottom line, you do get what you pay for. For the extra $10, this was definitely worth it.
5.0	I purchased this tape to repair a rain fly for a tent. The waterproof seam liner on the rain fly was peeling off. So, I removed the old liner and replaced with this Gorilla Clear Repair. Like clear industrial duct tape. I think the rain fly is better than before. I ran out before I could finish so I need more :)
5.0	Good quality. Easy to install.
5.0	does keep it dark..for the price you get what you pay for...but works for what I need because I have it behind my solar shades in our  5th wheel
5.0	I love the soft close toilet seats.  This fits our Toto Drake model perfectly and it is also well made.
5.0	Great price and now I know my reverse osmosis system is working very well
5.0	Rediscovered this in a serch.  It works well to hold my area rugs in place.  Replace regularly, and use rubbing alcohol to remove old adhesive.
5.0	I have had these a few days and am going to order more very soon.  They are sturdy, not flimsy like my old ones.  The thing I think I love most about them is that they curve very far over my vent, covering all but about the front inch.  This captures more air to blow directly forward and is making a difference in how effective my heating is in the room where I'm using them.  I give these a hearty recommendation.
5.0	I have a large garden, with a large, high deer fence around it. Not the prettiest but it keeps the deer out.<br /><br />I have used solar lights before and really like them. Supplied by the company in exchange for review. These lights are just beautiful. You have twenty feet of LED bulbs, strung evenly thorough out double strand copper wire. What I love about the copper is that you can give your lights some shape just by bending the wire however you wish.  I set the lights up around 1pm on a cloudy day, so I wasn't even sure if they'd work that night as they only had about four hours of light - but they did!  Once it was dark I had a beautiful light display on my garden fence.<br /><br />They come with everything you need including the small solar panel.  You can either stake the panel into the dirt - that's what I like to do  - or it also comes with screws and a piece you could screw onto a wall or the fence post. They are very easy to set up. The price is very good and the only upkeep will be replacing with the rechargeable batteries around once a year.  Beautiful lights and highly recommended!
5.0	Used it to replace the plastic ballast from a lamp bought at Home Depot for which I paid over $70, said plastic ballast died after only a year of use. It uses 2 T9 circular lamps (22w & 32w) , the GE ballast barely fit (had to drill 2 new holes to secure it with screws) inside the smallest diameter lamp. Make sure it would fit where you plan to use.  Bottomline, I got me a new lamp for around $20, instead of spending over $70 again on a new lamp.
5.0	Brighter than I thought it would be, but very pretty.<br />I may get a more yellowish/gold tint due to the brightness.<br />Effective though!! Pretty
5.0	It is bigger than we expected. But so far it is perfect. We really love our new kitchen faucet. It makes a statement and matches perfectly with our new JA appliances.
5.0	Got this to paint over some rat-urine stinky studs inside of a wall.  After a few weeks....so far so good.  But I'm pretty sure my battle with rat urine ain't over yet.
5.0	I'd recommend this product. It works great and is easy to install. Now my boyfriend will be warm doing my oil change/ working on others cars.
5.0	Very quiet and easy to install. It arrived on time and construction was impressive. Attachment really does require the flanges, ordered separately, since they have the screw threads and pump does not.
5.0	This just worked like a dream. I don not have to worry  about a broken line .
5.0	I replaced a First Alert single action smoke detector with this dual action. I felt lucky that this one fit the same holes in ceiling.I tested it outside before installing and was very pleased.
5.0	Standard size light switch plate.  Comes with matching screws for seamless design.
5.0	I adore my salt lamp, it sits on my desk at work and I don't know if it is purifying the air or not but I do know it makes me happy with its pretty glow. And when my fingers are cold from all the computer work I place them on it and warm them up. It's a two-fer!
5.0	I bought three of these units to replace another brand of LED units I'd bought previously. Some of the other units developed a fault where they would start to flash when they got hot.<br /><br />These seem to be well made and are warmer in color than my old bulbs. A little warmer than I'd have liked, but certainly acceptable. So far I'm happy with my choice.
5.0	Ok.. I have about 11 of these adapters in my house, and in my opinion they are great. I'm glad that I read review that you can leave your outlet plate in place - it will hold adapter to the wall even better.  What I like about these adapters more than about old ones that I had (I actually had different ones when I bought my house - from Power Sentry to Belkin) - on old ones, all outlets were located on the same side - 3 in row and 2 rows.. I like that there is space between outlets - if you got pretty huge adapter, you will be able to connect at least 3 of them, when with previous outlets it would block 4 of 6 ports easily.
5.0	This cord is perfect for use outdoors in the Wyoming winter as an extension for my truck's engine coolant heater cord at -31 degrees.  It handles the 400+ watts and 15 AMP current needed for extended periods.  Tip: When not in use, hang indoors on a single hook to keep it as straight as possible.  Also, with a clean cloth, put a THIN film of WD40 on all three prongs for easier plugging and unplugging in colder weather.
5.0	I originally bought these from Home Depot back in 2007 and they no longer carry them and I did not want to have to  replace them with another brand and not have them all matching .So thank you and keep on stocking them..
5.0	They're beautiful and more sturdy than I expected.  I am very happy with this purchase and would recommend these lamps to others.
5.0	This item is a very good buy and reliable. The Blue waterproof poly tarp for camping hiking is large enough for you to enjoy the outdoors all while being protected. It is also very durable.
5.0	Came with the wire harness as pictured. I only had to cut & splice 3 wires to attach the harness from the old motor to the new one and it works perfectly. It looked confusing at first with all the wires coming from the new motor but after realizing I only needed to cut 3, it was a breeze!
5.0	Excellent, excellent service from seller!  A++++++
5.0	Works Fantastic. Very easy to install in your bathroom making it a great purchase. I recommend this product to anyone
5.0	came in quickly, very happy!
5.0	Fits into tight places,very easy to put in.
5.0	Very nice addition to my master bath. Only problem is I waste water now, feels sooooooooo good.....
5.0	These metal clips will really hold wire shelving in place. If you can find studs to attach them to they will really supplement the plastic drywall clips. It only takes a few of these to get a solid shelf.
5.0	Very nice quality.  Solidly built.  I was struck initially by the size of this fixture.  It's large, but it grows on you quickly.  I've had it installed about 2 weeks and I love it.  I didn't see the point in spending $200-300 or more on another fixture when this one looked fine to me.  I purchased it without the advantage of any reviews, and I stumbled upon a gem.<br />If only we made these in the U.S., like we used to.
5.0	These are awesome bigger than i thought
5.0	"i ordered the \\""be your own kind of Beautiful decal for my half bathroom. this decal fits perfectly in the bathroom it was easy to apply to the wall and was shipped in a very timely manner, and over all the seller was on top of getting it out. the decal was packaged well, instructions for putting it on the wall were easy and clear!!!! would recommend this to everybody!"
5.0	We had cracked our diffuser and needed a replacement one.  This one looked exactly like the original.  The reviewer that said the dimensions were slightly smaller than 1X4ft was correct but that was the size that I needed.
5.0	My city's water supply is sandy and s***ty. So I've bought a few of these since they (by design) clog easily. Once one figures how to install (about 1/2 hour start to finish once you've disconnected water lines to pull dishwasher out to access this piece) it goes in as expected. Fits like the original. All good.
5.0	They arrived in good condition & work great.
5.0	unit arrived on time .  I used it to clean small engine carbs it did a good job.  I AM  VERRY WELL PLEASED.
5.0	Definitely a fun purchase.  Easy to recharge and plenty of light.  Save different color wine bottles for that special ambiance.  Suggest a gang usb charger for multiple bottle lights.
5.0	Works exactly as it should and looks clean and tidy in my washroom.  I usually prefer wicker baskets for t-paper, but in this particular room, I love this.
5.0	We ordered this fixture to convert our old track lighting spots to a more clean and simple simple look.<br /><br />I can say that it met our expectations and more. We have already ordered two more to complete our conversion to this wonderful pendant light.<br /><br />It is easy to assemble, easy to hang, and looks fabulous! At a great price as well!
5.0	Supplier provided later version of requested part and informed me accordingly. Part arrived during projected time frame. Worked as advertised once installed.
5.0	Just what I was looking for to put outside on my deck to be able to have it shine on our pool at night!!
5.0	This was a perfect fit for my microwave and no disassemble was required.  I was relieved that I did not have to remove any parts for this to work.
5.0	These bags fit the applications perfectly, are strong and good quality, and the box size is convenient to store while still giving a break in the price.  Wise choice.
5.0	This made installing our powered thermostat (honeywell Z-wave compatible) so much easier.  The builders used two of the lines from the theromostat bundle for the door bell thransformer so I needed a solution.  This worked really really well.  Follow the instructions online and on YouTube and you'll have no issue.
5.0	I have used this stuff for years....and not being a real handyman..it is perfect. No gun required...perfect accuracy and easy to use! SADLY, I have always purchased this at my local Menards..and they don't carry it anymore. And I won't pay the obscene price here on Amazon.,.the most I have ever paid is 4.59.
5.0	This thing is great! for the price it really cannot be beat. So far I have painted almost 20 doors and an entire house with a coat of primer, and two coats of paint. I really can't say enough good things about this! I have also purchased the Wagner Detail Front End so i can do some fine work with finishes on woodworking projects. This kit would still work great for that but now that i have used it for paint i wanted something just for fine woodworking projects. If this ever dies i will be buying again.
5.0	excelletn<br /><br />Leviton 80414-W Decora plastic adapter plate, Blank - No hole, with...<br /><br />Leviton 80414-W Decora plastic adapter plate, Blank - No hole, with...
5.0	Man, these are so bright with white light I cannot look directly at the bulb! Makes great use of them for reading (especially for fine small print). And a great price, too.
5.0	Just had this sink installed about 2 weeks ago, and love it!  Got the anthracite (black) and it looks clean all the time, whether I decide to wipe it down or not.... Some people have complained about similar silgranit sinks that they cracked, or the lighter colors show stains, but the silgranit website claims beet juice left overnight on a white sink wipes away, and you cant leave hot pans on them without burns.... Anyone having those issues should certainly complain up a storm to blanco because their website makes strong claims of the sink's durability, so....the squeaky wheel gets the grease, as they say.  All in all, I love this sink.  My only issue is that I wanted to place a suction cup sponge holder in the sink so I wouldn't have to have something on the counter, but SUCTION CUPS DO NOT STICK TO SILGRANIT. just so you know.  If anyone has one of these sinks and has a solution, I'd like to hear it.
5.0	The gun vault is perfect to store a gun and lock it up for safety.  Perfect size. Arrived on time and well packed.
5.0	You have to know if you really need this item or not but I did so After I received it, It was a straight forward application.  No problem installing it.
5.0	it was a great light and a great price and i would buy more of these lights for my gameroom.
5.0	This is a great spray. I make coasters and when I don't have time to do epoxy and only intend for the coasters to be used for wine and other cold drinks, I resort to Krylon. As others have mentioned, the fumes are especially strong, so always apply a coat outside. I'd give it about three days to fully cure if you're making something in contact with wet things, like a coaster. I've never had a problem with ink or paint running, and my pieces stay shiny each time I use this spray.
5.0	I bought two of these last year and they are both working fine.  Very easy to program and the internal battery does a good job of retaining the settings during even protracted power failures.  Very satisfied with these units compared to some other digital timers I have tried (and which failed after a short time).    Jan 1, 2010 Update:  Both of these little timers are still chugging along in daily service.  I have each one on a separate table lamp for security lighting.  Flawless so far.  I did pull one from the AC outlet just to see how long the internal battery would run.  It was still going after 2 weeks, so I just plugged it back in.  Still the best electronic timers I've ever had.
5.0	This is working very well for me in my workshop.  I am using it to control an outlet which I have a space heater and fan plugged in to.  I've set the temp very low only to keep the workshop from reaching freezing temps.  I have some things stored there that you can not let freeze such as glues and paints.  This thermostat was easy to set up this way and it is working fine.
5.0	Good product and an excellent price.
5.0	So my husband and I wanted to replace the wall vents in our house but could only find generic plain looking ones, unless we wanted to spend lots of dough, then I found these and the possibilities opened up. I could buy a floor register and make it work for the wall, yeah! So I started looking around and found some that I loved ordered them and these from Amazon. I did find these clips through other websites for a cheaper price but would have to pay shipping. If one was to get say 4 packages then yes, it would be cheaper this way as the shipping did not increase but with me only needing 2 packages, the price was the same so I ordered them from Vents Covers Unlimited through Amazon and received them much sooner than they anticipated which was great. I had to go to a store and buy a drill bit to make holes in the particular registers I ordered which was fine as being new home owners I'm sure we'll use the drill bit again. I did ask for help in selection of said drill bits but wish I would have gotten a smaller one than suggested. Even though the screws I used didn't make all of these tight, thanks to the drill bit and my holes, they were stable enough not to fall off the vent, they just twirled a little bit, but still fit nice and snug in the 'vent' hole, so it didn't matter. Over all extremely happy I found these and not sure why they aren't at any local stores as they are wonderful! Would buy from this seller again and this product again if I ever needed to.
5.0	I was a bit skeptical before purchasing this stain remover, but now I'm a believer! I had paint and ink stains on my carpet and  this stuff removed them with little effort. Btw the stains were about at least 3 years old! I highly recommend this product!!!!!!!
5.0	This is far better than what you would find at the big box stores. Heavier metal and a better paint job.
5.0	Great replacement filters. And a great price for a three pack.
5.0	I couldn't have been more pleased! It looks wonderful in my bathroom. The top half of my wall is white, bottom half is medium blue with the dragging affect and the border in the middle. I love it!! Easy to put up too.
5.0	Holds my stair treads very well
5.0	finished the house project to change all outlets
5.0	Very cute and sticks well to the wall, and just the right size for the common U.S. light switch. Thank you.
5.0	It fits my refrigerator and it is very convenient to have it shipped on subscription.
5.0	For the price, it is great. I don't test batteries often, but when I do, I want a simple tool to use. This is it! The delivery time was faster than projected (it comes from China).<br /><br />Simple, inexpensive tool.
5.0	I received this garage door opener quickly and it was SO EASY to program.<br />If I ever need anything like this again I will definitely use this seller again as well as recommend them to my friends and family.
5.0	Huge San Francisco Giants Fans!  This is perfect.
5.0	This speaks for itself it's nothin like family you one get one so I just loved this quote.  Awesome in family room
5.0	Using for new Xovers...  seems fine gauge for replacement... 18 gauge
5.0	Excellent product in all aspects from price to ease of installation.  It is a functional fit and form replacement for the ice water line filter on my LG refrigerator.  I am pleased in that you merely push up on the bottom of the existing filter and twist it out for extraction.  Then push in this replacement and make the same twist in the opposite direction.  Then use the water operation on your ice maker to clean out the activated charcoal residue inside the filter until the water is clear.  Expect these, like the one originally provided with your new LG refrigerator to last about six months.  For that reason the two (2) pack units are an excellent value and time saver.
5.0	Just received our package last week and installed all the sensors...very easy to do.  Tested everything and all works fine.  We did not sign up for the monitoring, just wanted audible alarms to scare anyone away.  I would highly recommend this system!
5.0	I bought Simran SMF100 for my haircut machine which works with 220V. The voltage converter works nice, no complains at all. Also it has switch button 110/220V and adapter so I would be able to use it in Europe with products from US. Overall I recommend it!
5.0	We hung this fixture in our foyer and are very pleased with how it looks. It is difficult to find a fixture this size without it hanging too low. The quality is great for the price.
5.0	The unit is pretty big, but i was able to push the bed right up against this device and plug in<br /><br />Better buy than the swivel socket
5.0	This product works fine for protection of the switch.  However I purchased it to keep my grandson from turning on the light in his room at night.  It is not a child proof switch cover. My mistake.  I gave it 5 stars because it simply works for what it was intended to do.  It is very white and will show if your plates are off white.
5.0	Did exactly as advertised for my rheem water heater. Worked great, would definitely recommend to anyone installing a tankless water heater system.
5.0	This lamp shade is exactly what I thought it would be. my husband made a lamp from copper and the shade was the exact size we needed. it's beautiful
5.0	High quality, very bright! A little pricey but so far worth it.
5.0	I am going to try and figure out a way to point the beams a little higher but that should be no problem and I will be able to cross stitch in the car in the dark on the way home from our travels with ease.....as well as at home in the evenings!
5.0	I bought this Doorbell for a friend and she love it.
5.0	gave as a gift to a fan of christmas story movie.enjoyed response everyone thought it was great. only thing missing was the wood shavings as packing
5.0	Have owned this for about a year and use it every day.  It's far better than paying a monthly subscription fee.  As long as the company keeps adding new features and coming out with new products (when is the DoorFront coming out??), I'll keep reccommending it.
5.0	This shelf is exactly what we were looking for since it was easy to install, matches our dark brown (espresso) decor, and has an 8 inch depth providing plenty of display space (compared to the crown molding shelves that only offer 3 in to 5 in max). Definitely a classic look that provided the shelving we needed with a decorative touch.
5.0	"This item: 3M Stickit Sanding Block 2 1/2\\"" 3M  3M(TM) Stikit(TM) Paper Refill Roll 415U, 2 1/2 in x 95 in 220 A weight [PRICE is per ROLL] by 3M  3M(TM) Stikit(TM) Paper Refill Roll 415U, 2 1/2 in x 70 in 120 A weight [PRICE is per ROLL] by 3M    I used this product during a bookbinding course in France (Vesinet).  It appears to be impossible to order this item at Amazon.com for reasons I don't understand.  I am a regular customer who orders mostly books and CD's. Never a problem at all, credit card OK etc.  The only review about this product is from an Englishman who apparently bought this product while travelling in the USA.  I would like to understand why it is impossible to order this product on your website.    E.G.Faber, ernst.faber@planet.nl  Netherlands"
5.0	This was to replace a Grohe shower head we've had for 8 years, I love the quality of their product . Was very happy to find it on Amazon for so much cheaper than my local store!!
5.0	WOW! This is one beautiful lamp.A great accent to any room, also therapeutic. I leave the light on a low setting at night, and wake without my usual sinus stuffiness.I liked it so much I bought a second one for a gift.I 'll likely get more for gifts.Reasonable priced unique item.
5.0	"I love these but find them difficult to locate here in the great north woods...a little \\""pricey\\"" perhaps. Very easy to use by virtue of both the star drive and the aggressive thread. Makes me wonder why anyone would use a phillips drive galvanized screw for any type of wood project when you can get these."
5.0	This item does everything I hoped it would. It holds a regular shower head and it also mounts a portable shower head on a 5 foot hose. The portable head hangs on its rack on one side of the diverter and the valve to switch between shower heads is right next to it.
5.0	I love it but the only problem with it is the knob which turns the water on and off is cracked.<br />Other than that it is awesome.
5.0	These Legend handles were a great buy! They are attractive, sturdy and inexpensive when compared to their competition from the home improvement stores.  This variation is the one you would use for a door you wish to have the option to lock, like a bathroom or bedroom door.  There is a turn knob on one side of the levers.  Included with each box is a two sided lever, a striker and a tumbler mechanism along with the required screws.  We replaced ALL (21) of the doors knobs in our house with these types, some locking, some key-locked and some standard levers; they all look, feel and operate great. Installation was simple, too.  The price of these levers was about two thirds that (64% to be exact) of the home improvement store.  I handled (pun intended) the brand at the home improvement store and it felt to be of similar quality to these Legend levers.  Overall, these were a great buy and they add a subtle elegance to our home versus our old builder-installed brass knobs.<br /><br />UPDATE 7/2017:  These levers continue to look and function great!  After almost three years installed, I have no real complaints.  If I had to point to a few very minor nitpicks it would be that the outside levers (exposed to the elements) have had a bit of their finish wear off; I kind of give that a pass though.  Also, some of the springs in the frequently used levers have weakened a bit and the lever hangs slightly below a perfect 90 degree angle...however for non OCDers that shouldn't be an issue.  I still definitely recommend them.
5.0	Great warm glow, come on every evening as expected.  I put them in a metal lantern instead of a candle because they are weathe resistant and I don't have to worry about ruining a nice &#34;fake&#34; candle, or lighting a real one!  They do have a yellowish hue, rather than a soft white, but I like them just as well.  Can't beat for the price, either.
5.0	Just right and convenient
5.0	Used this item to replace a worn out drive gear in a 1/2 HP Craftsman garage door opener.  It is a exact replacement.  You might have other problem in the gear shaft that caused the gear to wear out but I decided to only replace the gear.  As it states it is the gear only and you will have to re-use the pin that holds the gear in place. FYI, removing and replacing the pin requires a high amount of force.  Also you will have to provide you own grease.  I used multi purpose white grease that I had on hand.
5.0	My water recently changed from really tasty to really bad and I purchased the instapure. The initial few seconds creates a black liquid that clears out the carbon, but shortly after the water tastes very clean. The water flow is also very good. The best part is that the filter refills are inexpensive and last a long time.
5.0	This sink grid fits my Blanco sink perfectly.  8 rubber bumpers and 4 rubber coated steel legs keep it snugly in place and prevents scratching.  Easy to clean and easy removal of the food drain makes this perfect.  No more discolored plastic grids.<br />Measure your sink at the bottom of the bowl.  I was concerned it may be too small, but the measurements were just right, and probably standard for the large deep Blanco sink.
5.0	Just what we wanted and works great. Good buy.
5.0	great product, bought for my pregnant wife to get in and out of the shower, and for standing support
5.0	Very quiet, no mechanical issues.<br /><br />Have all Pana fans in bathrooms and all of them are at least 3X recommended airflow.  Don't skimp on ventilation in your remod.  You can run the shower full blast in all my bathrooms and there will not be even a hint of fog on a mirror, the fan will make it hard to close the door, it pulls that strong.  Your buddy from college could try to destroy the place after a binge of white bread, bad clams and cabbage and will fail with this fan in a 10x7 bathroom.  You get the idea.<br /><br />Cleaning the squirrel cage can be a bit of a chore but you probably only need to do that every couple of years.  Reliability of all my Pana fans, including this one, has been a non-issue.  But, hey, it's an AC electric motor, not the space shuttle so that's not a surprise.
5.0	Great little lamp! Nice looking and I love the dimmer feature.
5.0	I love it, set up was a breeze...the water tastes great. Very pleased.  It does make a few drops of water after you use it like it said in some of the other reviews, but it's set up so the spout is over my sink not a problem for me
5.0	I had had the same washers hoses for 14 years, and my son thought I should get new ones after a friend had a flood in the house after one of their fairly new hoses broke.  These were a great replacement--good length, well made, and easy to put on.
5.0	i have a long driveway and can't see the end from my house, sometimes it lets me know of deer in yard.
5.0	These look great in our new shower! Work well and easy to operate. They came with ripped packaging so I was concerned about scratches, etc but they were all fine (we purchased 6 of them).
5.0	perfect match installed easily
5.0	I love this standing lamp. It came quickly and was easy to put together. You need to follow the directions. It is thick paper and make sure you put the sunny side out. The light turns on by stepping on the switch, which I really like. It's very cute.
5.0	I have one of the original Ridge table saws. It is a great table saw, but the cheep iron is notorious for rusting. I have tried every product on the market, only to have rust return after a few days. This stuff really works. After two coats, it took a month before any rust returned and that wiped off easily. I would not pay over eight dollars shipping for a nine dollar item, so I will buy it elsewhere, but it is a good product.
5.0	It's a knob. It fits properly. I can now do laundry. My clothes are clean.
5.0	I had the S300. I feel the S350E is downgraded. these are commanding a high price and there is a good reason. This thing is simply awesome. It is not just being lazy. It is hygienic and just very convenient. If you are not aware all this does then read up on it. If you need to ask why you need it well you do! This is just simply fantastic. Get one while you can. when they are gone it is apparently forever now. I hope they bring back the features on newer ones. The top nearest has all the features but you must get the toilet with the Washlet then.
5.0	I love this heat gun, my work had a really crappy one and this one makes so much of an improvement when dealing with small electronic glass heating application.
5.0	looks great,bright & shipping was fast
5.0	My grandchildren were always tripping on the cords that ran across the hardwood floors, knocking the lamp off the table ect. This holds 3 cords and looks more neat and tidy.... and no more tripping hazard!
5.0	10% of the population complains about everything! This is one of the best toilets out there.
5.0	Selected this door lock to highlight my wine room; what a great choice.  This door lock is magnificent.  The pewter old rustic finish is awesome. It was very easy to install, just make sure you don't lose any of the parts and pieces.
5.0	I purchased this to replace my existing kitchen faucet.  This was an easy spruce up for my kitchen.  Looks nice and works well.  I had a professional install this but it looks like it would have been easy to install.
5.0	This looks so beautiful. The bird is crafted very elegantly. It gives off enough light for my hallwaystairs. I'm very happy with the purchase
5.0	Strong and attractive lamp. Lamp sends most light upward and yet the individual shell colors are nicely bright.
5.0	Etekcity Programmable Wireless Remote Control...
5.0	The unit is just as described, and works right out of the box.  Although it works on some GFI receptacles, it hides the GFI buttons even when it fits the receptacle.  It is more appropriate for old-fashioned receptacles.
5.0	"Dollar for dollar this is the fastest and cheapest means for unclogging those pesky slow drains. Do not be fooled by the \\""disposable\\"" label. If you are patient and do not mind grappling with the hairy gray sludge these will pull from your drain, you can clean them off and keep using them. I bought a pack of 12 of these a couple of years ago, and many clogged drains later I have only had to throw one of them away. This was entirely my fault, as I pulled the snake from the drain too quickly and with too much force and ended up stripping off many of the little plastic teeth. Lesson learned. If you work the snake into the drain slowly and work it out easily, even when it seems stuck, one of these will last for years. Super cheap, easy to use and very effective."
5.0	Before ordering, I hadn't paid attention to the description as a Cool White, Daylight White light bulb.  When it put it in the end of the hall, it was a surprisingly different color than the rest of the hall lights.  It was blue/white compared to the yellow/white in my other soft white bulbs.  The difference was too noticeable to be ignored.  Instead of using it where intended, I put the bulb in the laundry room, where it is not seen in conjunction with other bulbs.  The bright, cool white color works so much better in the laundry room than the soft white bulb I had in there previously.  I can now see the food stains on my husband's clothes so I can pretreat them!  Bottom line - great bulb.  Just make sure you get the color you want for the space you want!
5.0	right parts, good price, shipped quickly.
5.0	I did not receive these. I can tell from the pic that these would have been great for my son, to have a night light without always being plugged into the wall. These would've been great for him to carry into any room and watch them change colors. I am giving them 5 stars cause when I contacted them to tell them I did not receive them they gave me my money back.
5.0	Beautiful, musical chime. Can hear it all over the house but without jarring our nerves.
5.0	Little pricey but if you have trouble with arthritis this is the tool for you in my opinion.
5.0	Is just what I needed.  I only have 2 outlets in a large room so this makes it possible to get the use out my outlet I need.  Would recommend it.
5.0	Easy and smooth transaction with good quality
5.0	Spent the extra couple of dollars to get this version rather than the extendable version. Definitely glad i did. Other reviews have said that its too much work to make sure the size is right, or that the material quality is lesser than the other version. This was perfect. Looks great, took a few minutes to set up. I did have to trim a few inches off to fit it into my tub, but really it was very easy to handle with a small coping saw. Anyone should be able to trim it if needed.<br /><br />Only complaint is the plastic end caps. They look great now, but I'm worried that down the road the plating will come off. Its not really anything to warrant less stars because it hasn't happened yet, its just something that I've noticed has happened with similarly plated plastic parts.
5.0	as good as advertised
5.0	I use this  flashlight every night because it doesn't light up so brightly that it wakes me up. Outstanding product.
5.0	Just what i needed! Amazing product!
5.0	I purchased my unit from Costco in 2011 and haven't had any issues in the past 4 years.<br />I replace the filter cartridges once every year or so with no issues.  No leaks, no funny taste.<br />For me, the unit works as designed and I like it because the cartridges are easy to replace.
5.0	We were looking for a replacement fixture for over our kitchen sink and this work just fine. The light is a little eerie - a sort of ghostly blue white light or that's the way it looks to this guy - but the cost is low and if you use yours as much as we use ours you will save a bit on your electric bill.
5.0	installed easy,  works perfectly
5.0	My husband was tired of constantly needing to replace the cheap plastic storm door latch and we could not find any metal ones locally. Amazon came to the rescue.  This product is metal, at least the parts that will absorb wear and tear are metal and will definitely outlast the plastic garbage that are typically sold in local hardware stores.  Thank you Amazon!
5.0	They are of high quality and will not rust.
5.0	Replaced all my Halogen bulbs with this LED Dimmable Bulbs
5.0	Its great to find out how hard my tap water is.  These strips provide me with a quick way to see how many grains of hardness are in my tap water.  Good find.
5.0	Very easy to use and install. It took about 5 min to install the thermostat and another 5 to program a week's worth of temperatures into it.  We don't use our a/c very often so we mainly just use the hold feature in the summer.  In the winter though it will be nice to regulate the heat and save some money.
5.0	Bought this to go with a 2 gang box that I was installing a Wemo Switch on one of the fixtures. Fits the Wemo perfectly and was easy to install.
5.0	Look nice and easy installation. I was afraid that it won't fit the old conduit box but the base has many possible ways to fit in place. Perfect replacement.
5.0	Very attractive and sturdy (which is necessary in this household!) But the best part was the customer service.  I mistakenly threw out the mounting bracket with the box (oops!)  But I contacted their customer service dept. via e-mail and they had a new one to me in a week.  I really appreciated that.
5.0	I put these in our courtyard lights, wow! what a difference it looked like the courtyard was lit up, it was so much brighter than it had been before using 40 watt bulbs.  I would highly recommend these LED light bulbs, I am going to order more!
5.0	This looks great in our kitchen and compliments our decor beautifully.
5.0	KEEPING IT SIMPLE, THIS PRODUCT WORKS! YOU CAN ALWAYS FIND AN OUTLET THAT HAS BEEN CRYING OUT FOR THIS ADAPTOR.
5.0	We started to replace our doorknobs with the larger version of these dummy knobs, and when we decided to continue the style to the closet doors, we found this vendor, who fortunately had enough for us to complete the job.
5.0	Nice drawer pulls... they look larger than the normal 3-inch centers.
5.0	Works exactly as stated - love it.
5.0	Excellent for the price. Good Quality !!!
5.0	I'm a Zumba instructor and this light adds a lot of character to my classes...makes us feel like we're in a club!
5.0	This faucet is very nice quality - I will admit, when it arrived I installed it on the new sink...  the faucet leaked from the head immediately and I wasn't going to take everything apart.  A quick call to Delta, they sent out a new head, only to then find that the original problem was just a rubber oring at the connection from the hose to head - couldn't see how to take it apart until the new head arrived.  I replaced oring with a quick trip to the hardware store.  Very nice unit.  Delta's help was immediate and free.  Very good customer service.
5.0	it works how it is supposed to, so no complaints!
5.0	These are the filters that I have always bought at local stores.  No one's price can compare to Amazon's though.  A great deal
5.0	Received in less than one week.  Installed and working fine.  Really great price and reliable name- brand.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone
5.0	worked well and seems to be holding to the wall very well
5.0	The system fit perfectly and was easy to install. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to improve their car.
5.0	I like the way the sink was designed, and easy to clean.  Looks really well with my granite countertops and black appliances.
5.0	I see the review below where $$ were saved to make your own.  That's great if you have the time and the resources.  I didn't so I simply opened the box 2 days later when it arrived, hubby installed the timers and then screwed this to the wall and we were done.  I actually like the fact that it's metal so over-torquing the screws won't crack the plastic since it has weak points where the larger holes are cut (Decora?).  Highly recommended - the color even matches the plastic options which I also have on the same wall.
5.0	These are really great lights. I'm redoing my garage and decided on using 5 of these units great lights extremely thin low heat and of course low power draw. I'm doing it abut different on the insulation I'm removing the small ower units at. Each light running low voltage wiring and powering all of them with a single external 24 volt ower suply.
5.0	This is a very detailed wall plate.  I painted it with light aqua craft paint and now it looks like a work of art for just a couple of dollars.  Lots of fun!
5.0	This product is the official filter for my Whirlpool refrigerator.<br /><br />It arrived earlier than expected.<br /><br />Installed easily and all is great again!
5.0	I remodeled my bathroom and purchased this drain combo for my old tub. It is well made (heavy material) and it was much cheaper then other places. It came well packed and got shipped almost instantly. It looks and works great.
5.0	Great product,it has all the information necessary for the professional installer.<br />The thermostat has multiple use for different HVAC units domestic or commercial.<br />It's pricey,too, but worth the investment.
5.0	Very pretty for an antique bedroom set.  When the sun hits the crystal, rainbows shine!<br />I was worried that they were going to be small, but work very well.<br />The shipping takes some time, but well worth the wait for the price!  10 for under $10.00
5.0	Solid construction. This is Great, 0 cons. its just a winner in my book.
5.0	This light performed so well that I ordered a second one for backup.  The wavelength replicates the sun and by setting the digital camera to the daylight setting, I can take indoor photos under this light repeatedly with the same results.  Also excellent for crafts and reading.  Amazon's price at $11+ including shipping is a best buy!
5.0	Works well. I have the receiver placed at the end of corridor, totally surrounded by walls and I can hear it loud and clear. The outdoor part is exposed to rain with no issues so far.
5.0	Bought this for my entry way.  The quality isn't bad for being such an inexpensive chandelier.  I'm happy with my purchase.
5.0	After trying at least four other types of solar lights this is the very best.  The light is bright enough to light our path when taking the dog out at night.  It lasts long into the night and the solar charged batteries appear to be lasting longer than any others we have tried.  After having one such light for a year we purchased another two and they are all working just fine winter and summer. These three provide more light than a set of eight others did.  Would definitely recommend them above all others.
5.0	When I decided I needed an SAE  set of stubby Open end-Ratchet end wrenches, I found the quality and valve that this GearWrench set offers a no brainer! A life-time-warranty product, these small gems are fine wrenches that hold up well, have an easy to maintain finish and are built tough! Their smooth and fine ratcheting features combined with their stubby length allow for easy adjustments and movement.<br /><br />Even in tight situations, these short grip wrenches still offer enough torque and strength to get the job done well. Their ratcheting box ends work flawlessly and the mirror finish is easy to keep clean. Working on auto engines, small tractor-pressure washer engines or appliance and purchase assembly activities, these little workhorses were just what the doctor ordered...Love em!
5.0	great for the pool filter
5.0	It works. Our tap water really is awful (350ppm). Bottled water isn't much better (280ppm). it makes me appreciate my table top water distiller (0 ppm)
5.0	Standard cover however it does enhance the décor.
5.0	Works great - it is engineered so that it will fit (horizontally or vertically) exactly on a wall surface paved with 4-inch shower tiles - suction cups rest on tiles only - no overlap onto grout lines.
5.0	Very good fan, Setup in detached utility garage in Stockton, CA (very hot summers) and the built in thermostat worked perfectly.  Fan is relatively quite (not silent but not super noisey).  Note does NOT include a grill and the size may require cutting studs to fit. I would have preferred a mesh grille on inside and out (to prevent fingers and other objects accident getting stuck in blades).
5.0	this item was great! the item received was very sticky so it went on my daughters bedroom wall pretty nicely. it did come with a marker with eraser as well which was a nice bonus. as soon as my daughter seen this item on her wall , she went nuts. she's almost 5 so you could imagine how happy she was. she started drawing on it right away. thank you, seller for this wonderful opportunity - i am glad that i came across it. it will help my child prepare for kindergarten next month.  thank you, thank you , thank you. five stars.
5.0	Ordered two for my master bath and absolutely beautiful.  Saw these for way more than what i paid for them.  They fit the decor perfectly
5.0	Pretty much stopped the dryer from making so much noise, but I didn do the repair....let's hope it lasts
5.0	this item was just perfect and was just as described.  It fit like the original item to which it replaced thank you
5.0	I have had this light about 2 years and is the best flashlight I have ever owned. I love it and everone is amazed at its bightness and they want one until I tell them price..But it is worth ever penny to me. Very tough and rugged as well as the 300 lemuns it puts out.Would recommend very highly
5.0	It had been 1 year and out of the 6 lights 3 had burnt out bulbs. Could not find a suction cup in the stores, found this online and it worked great. Now I don't have to go buy a new light.
5.0	I stumbled along for years fixing my electric (wired) door bell and look at this. 30 minutes after I rec'd it we had a door bell again that we can trust.
5.0	We were looking for a good smoke alarm after out old ones died out, we really liked these they came at a good price and work excellent.
5.0	goes on even nice satin finish just a hint of luster, perfect Drys super fast re-apply coats every 30 min.
5.0	Loved the pulls but had to but different screws because they were too short.
5.0	The safe is great it fits just one pistol the med pistol the full size would be harder to get out in  a hurry ,it works great i leave my open at night close it in the morning
5.0	arrived on estimated day. Installation was easy and took a half hour to remove my POS insinkerator and install this unit. It's quiet and shreds everything with ease. And with a 10 year in home warranty and all stainless steel parts you can't go wrong!
5.0	I read a lot of reviews on this Lock which were all good so I decided to get one after installing the lock and using it now for a few weeks...... I like it very much, Easy to install and works great no problems.
5.0	This is a great commercial quality occupancy sensor. I usually install Leviton and Lutron brands but have used Intermatic in the past. This new offering is robust and well made. The build quality is great. The 14 gauge pigtail wires are easy to wire in. The manual push button and overall feel of the switch has a robust and sturdy quality. The coverage works as specified and is adjustable which comes in handy in most situations. The time delay settings are also a must and being able to go from 15 sec to 30 mins allows you to dial in that ON time which works best for the situation. Overall I have found this to be a solid offering to the competition. Commercial grade. Will work great in residential too.
5.0	First I thought the LED's were an unnecessary feature. Now I'll never buy a soldering iron without lights!!! Its a great tool.
5.0	Very nice. Went very well with the other dolphin décor. Delivered a day a head of schedule.
5.0	I needed new filters for my refrigerator and of course went on Amazon.  These make the water taste well and were easy to install.  I also felt the price was good compared to other places I checked.
5.0	Great product for the price.
5.0	I love this book light, it covers the whole page in light. I have had similar book lights but their lights only shined in a small area. I recommend this book light to all book lovers.
5.0	Ever have that one piece of electronics where you find it needs a male to male connection?  Well, this will get you up and running again.
5.0	"I own the 1 1/4\\"" Laguna Resaw King Bandsaw Blade in 171\\"" length for my MiniMax MM20 Bandsaw. I bought it along with a new Driftmaster Fence upgrade and Ceramic Guide Upgrade. I am really impressed with how smooth and easily this blade cuts through my stock. I have used it to resaw 8/4 Maple and Oak and to make veneer. It slices through wood like butter. My friends were surprised at how easily we were resawing ash for guitar backs. Amazing cut quality. It also did not require NEAR as much tension pressure as my Lenox blades require. I also noticed less drift in this blade than other blades I have for this saw. Also the kerf is significantly thinner (less waste) than some of my other blades. It is a great solution for your bandsaw. Try one out the next time you have some stock to resaw!!"
5.0	Holiday lights, eazy to use, cost effective use little power give off a very nice bright light. Order early don't think you will find these mid December. They are also called fairy lights and not widly found in stores where we live, that is why we come to Amazon first when wife finds something in a magazine like these she wants to use.
5.0	I was totally amazed at the speed this product removed all traces of mold and mildew. It's a fantastic product and works when others did not. Be sure and wear gloves when applying and a face mask is a good idea as well. Leave the room following application and ventilate it well!
5.0	I use one of these to filter my tap water and one to infuse powdered brewery wash into the water flow for flush cleaning brewing plumbing.  Made from quality materials with good craftsmanship.
5.0	These arrived in very good condition, and in due time.  These are so beautiful, they are really going to look pretty this Christmas season.  For the value, these are just unbelievable......they are a good weight, and are very pleasant to the eyes.  I feel that I really got a good bargain for the $$$$$.  I have ordered other colors, and they are all just as wonderfully beautiful.  I certainly would recommend these to friend and stranger alike, as they are a good purchase.
5.0	I just received my knife in the mail today. It's great so far, it springs out fast and with ease, and its a good size and weight, and the metal material seems really good. I got it for protection for public transportation since I'm a female and alot of strange folks on metro lol.
5.0	This item is as lovely as it looks in the photos. I am very pleased with it and the matching towel bar.   A great item for a classic or period bathroom.
5.0	I was able to install this in about 10 minutes. The water pressure is great and I love how I can have both the stationary head and the removable head on at the same time. My husband loves it too!
5.0	Super bright and work perfectly. I ordered 3 different time because I love them so much. I have them all over the house, so at night i never have to turn on a light. The whole house is always lit. Not too bright where your blinded, but just enough for you to see where your going.<br />I love that when we get home late at night we never have to turn on lights, and from outside it always looks like someone is home because I plug them in near windows.
5.0	I love these water bottles.  I got the 18oz ones, and they are the perfect size.  The glass is not perfect, there are air bubbles and some parts do not look even, but it works great, makes the water taste better, no plastic taste to it.  And it looks pretty nice.  I like the plastic caps, I don't have to worry about it leaking.  Overall I am really happy with my purchase, and I would buy it again.
5.0	Wored like a champ with the other parts that I ordered and installed .Was so easy to fix after I got this.
5.0	Quiet as a church mouse.  Great exhaust fan.
5.0	Exceeded my expectations!
5.0	love the look and glad this specialty plate was available on amazon.
5.0	Magical for replacing old caulk.  Cleans neatly and easily, and the smoother lays down a nice bead as long as you get the right size starting out.  The edge on the back of the remover doesn't fit into all corners and angles because of the length of the pointed removal side, but it worked for most areas and made the job very quick and easy.
5.0	Much less costly than mosr pleated filters but much greater filtering than those woven fiberglass filters.
5.0	My husband puts all his ball caps on these marvelous holders. Then he puts them in the dish washer providing his caps with a stable form to keep their shape
5.0	This switch plate met all of my expectations.  It's beautifully made, and is beautiful as well.  I highly recommend ordering from this company.
5.0	FANTASTIC!<br />I have mobility problems, getting up to turn lights on & off is difficult & time consuming. When I am working I like several lights on in my room but before going bed for the night I would have to get up to turn off all the lights.<br /><br />I had tried using what is commonly called a &#34;Christmas tree light control&#34;. With this you plug your light into an extension cord like device then push a button to turn lights on & off. It worked ok but after a while I found these cordss wear out. I also had wires running everywher.<br /><br />Tthis is a wireless alternative.<br /><br />TIP: This system allows you to control 5 lights. On the back where the plug is there is a number coinciding with the number on the remote but controlling 5 lights (if your mind works like mine) it was confusing remembering which number went with which light. I  used Computer Shipping Labels & typed a small list, ie: #1 near closet, #2 near bed & so on, I then stuck the labels near where I keep the remotes, it is a quick reminder of which button I need to push for which light.<br /><br />I definitely recommend this system especially for the elderly or people with mobility difficulties.
5.0	Decided to get these as an add on product since you can't order these all on their own. Would rather get them delivered to my door than stop on my way home from work.
5.0	Good Quality replacement glass lampshade.  It is 10 inches in diameter.  I needed 15&#34; and couldn't get a response from anyone as to the size.  The smaller hole at the base is 1 1/4&#34;, which is also  what I needed.  The 10 inched diameter will do until I can find a bigger replacement.
5.0	If you love Michigan State this is a product for you. It arrived in good condition. The product works just like described. My son had a blast decorating his bedroom.
5.0	This flower are pretty that what I was expecting. This flowers are gonna make my bedroom look soo nice. Hope my fiance likes them too. Thanks :)
5.0	I used it to fix and install new bricks and so far I love the product. People came out to help and borroed some to fix there tile and ect.
5.0	The timer on our dryer went out and we got an estimate that it would cost about $250 to fix it. I just got on Amazon and found the part and put it on myself. Saved over $200! Works great and very easy to install. (I'm a women in my 50's and was able to do it myself) Thanks Amazon!
5.0	works great, great price
5.0	You will not be disappointed with these baffles.  Much better than the original.  I concur with the other reviewers, these are the ones you want.
5.0	I was afraid the faucet was too high but it is perfect.  We did have it installed by a professional and he had no problems.  Love the cross handles.  Very happy with the speed of delivery and the product.
5.0	Exactly as described, works perfectly.
5.0	The water from this unit is pretty much tasteless to me, which is ideal since tap water tastes awful. I grew up with Culligan, which has a certain taste to me, versus this which is just pure. Haven't tested it but plan to. We also added a line to the fridge ice maker so our ice is purified. It was easy to install in our home, and we've used it three months with no issues. The cables are long. today when our sink clogged and we had to drain it, got a mess over all the filters, and they water tubes were all long enough to put the whole unit (still assembled and attached), into the sink to rinse it off. I'm glad it's made in the USA so I know all the parts have stringent manufacturing guidelines. The only thing I would change, is ordering directly from apec instead of Amazon, only because apec sells brushed nickel and other specialty spouts for a fraction of the regular cost, if you buy them with the unit.
5.0	My wife wanted to add some bling to her walk in.  We have bronze throughout our home, so I found this after a chandelier she found at Ikea proved too long.  I like this because it was easy to shorten enough to fit in an 8' tall closet without me hitting my 6' tall head on it.  It looks very nice and wasn't difficult to install.  We paired this with a Sylvania 78911 14-Watt A19 Ultra LED Bulb and it provides great light at a low cost.
5.0	I didnt have a problem installing this into plaster walls.  Only used the hardware it came with. It looks great and is exactly as I expected.
5.0	"Note that this wire gauge (aka gage) is commonly called a \\""gauge wheel\\"" in the body jewelry industry. <br /> <br />This has become a standard tool for body jewelry manufacturers and piercing shops.  The gauge wheel is used to accurately measure sizes of body piercing jewelry.  This sturdy tool is built to last-we have one over 10 years old that is in fine condition.   <br /> <br />The metal may scratch surfaces, especially that of organic body jewelry, so care should be taken when using it to measure.  Also note that, because of the thickness of the gauge wheel, measurements of the very bottom of deeply sloped saddle (flare) shaped plugs will not be precise.  However, since typical wearing surfaces of earplugs are much greater than the thickness of this tool, measurements can be used as read."
5.0	These are nice quality and the supplier was FAST in the shipping. I needed to get longer screws to fit my cabinets, but otherwise, these are exactly what I was expecting.
5.0	This is exactly what I was looking for. Even better was this it was very easy for me to set up. I highly recommend it!
5.0	This stuff has been around my entire life and I can not imagine a Minnesota winter without it. Easy to apply, no fumes, and easy to remove. What more could you want?
5.0	Handy little devils, how bout that price? Man the time I wasted skinning wire looking for old alligator clips, what a waste!
5.0	I bought these in 2013 for the sole purpose of sliding my reclining couch around the living room 'often'.  We had a need to put a seating arrangement closer to the TV occasionally, but didn't want it there all the time.  I bought these, put them under the corners, and BLAM,  I can pull the loveseat from the wall and into place easily.  Sliding it back to the 'stored' position is even easier.  If you think they will drag on carpet,  you are wrong.  Great Sliders!  Perfect for our use. Would by again.  AAA++++ Seller  ( kidding,  but awesome product!)
5.0	Classic looking fan, nice and quiet just the way I like it.
5.0	Good one..8 bulbs for 8$..that too GE 13W..its good deal..I replaced all the filament bulbs with this 13W ones..i had 60W/40W everywhere in my apartment..need to check next months electricity bill...to figure out how much i saved..anyway the light intensity is pretty good..less shadow..overall its worth buying..
5.0	Purchased replacement pump for hydronic heating system that has two pumps. One still going after 6 years, the other starting to seize.
5.0	Wife had to have lights in the gazebo.  She's happy, so, I am TOO!
5.0	Bought this unit to replace an old Monroe-Matic(yellow unit) sensor. Hooked it up<br />as instructed and cut yellow wire and it worked first time. Took about 30Mins to install..<br />No problem after a month, still working.  This cost $20 and my alternative was a<br />$150 new motor...
5.0	My truck camper thermostat is located in direct line with the heater.  This caused the heater to cycle too often and made sleep difficult.  By re-locating the heat stat location away from the direct heat from the blower I expect less cycling.  It is very easy to hook this unit up in parallel and not affect the original thermostat.  You can control the heat with either thermostat (just make sure both are off if you do not need heat).  The only problem in rv's is trying to hide the thermostat wire run, I wish I could have located it up in the sleeping section over the cab.
5.0	Exactly what I needed for a fixed shower (primitive camp)… the 0.5 gpm is too low for rinse, but perfect for soaping up while conserving water… 1.0 gpm is fine for rinsing…. in this application, the 1.5 gpm won’t get used (much)
5.0	Our intercom system died and we did not want to spend $500 to replace it. We live in an old (160 yr old) city brownstone and live on the 3rd floor. The unit works with no problem at all!!
5.0	They look fantastic and are really quiet. The lights are really dim, so I wouldn't recommend using them as the primary lights.
5.0	The Grill did work well, I was not able to use the collar. I used a 4½ &#34; hole saw but was unable to fit the collar, also I live in a loghome and the collar was to short if used.
5.0	Great choice and quality.
5.0	I bought two of these for either side of my bed and am very happy with them. Well worth it for the price, if you like the design.
5.0	Haven't used it yet, but seems it will be thick and heavy and useful for its purpose.
5.0	Beautiful. The fit perfectly in my guest house.
5.0	Great little item.  Works exactly like instructions say it will. We have two of them.  That says it all!  Great for people that get up during the night.
5.0	It fit perfectly thank you
5.0	If you do not look directly into the top of the candles you will not know they are not regular candles.  My wife loves them.
5.0	Just use it for storing extra ammo.  Wouldn't keep valuables in it but does the job of keeping people from looking in it
5.0	I installed this to filter my hot water dispenser and cold water spout on my kitchen sink. I was already using 1/4 inch tubing with my water line so it took about 2 mins to install this. Once installed, I flushed out the filter for 10 minutes and all was well. There was a little loss of pressure at the dispenser spouts, but nothing major. The water tastes so much better going through this filter instead of drinking it from tap.
5.0	All 6 worked well and your getting 6 for the price of one at radio shack.
5.0	Wonderful!  The towel works great on glass, windows and mirrors. Very happy with product!!
5.0	With some practice becomes much easier. Be sure to use helper.
5.0	Husband bought this to reline an old chaise lounge. The webbing has been outside in the sun for many months now and is holding up quite well.
5.0	Wanted some mood lighting in a corner. I used a 15 watt candelabra bulb. It's just enough to read by, and adds some dramatic effect.<br />Certainly worth the great price.
5.0	Beautiful chandelier and looks just like some I see in local lighting stores choosing thousands of dollars. Instructions aren't great so it probably took 5 hours to assemble but worth it.
5.0	Without much time shop around, we purchased this based on our plumber's recommendation.  Checked the reviews and had it shipped for next day delivery and installed by a handyman in about 30 minutes.  Looks sleek, the large button on the nozzle to switch to the sprayer function is convenient and the hose pulls out and retracts smoothly.  The small handle makes it easy even for our young children to adjust the temperature.  We expected it would meet our needs, but it far exceeded our expectations.  Now, everyone in the family wants to wash the dishes.
5.0	Great quality commercial door handle.
5.0	no problems works great
5.0	Items arrived on time and in good condition.  I have used them in the past with good results and these new ones functioned just as well.
5.0	Have an ugly ceiling you wanna disquise? These are perfect! We had bad leak and ceiling never did look 100% even after fixing it. We purchased these tiles and we get compliments all the time!  They are  easy to install and even though they are lightweight they look awesome on ceiling!  Give ceiling a great new look!
5.0	This is a great wall decal.  My 2 1/2 year old son just loves Mickey Mouse and was so happy to see him life size on the wall.  It brightened the room immediately and just makes  you smile.
5.0	Holds like a bolt as long as you use it appropriately and get it set up well. Plus no danger of sticking your hands together or mixing up a solution.
5.0	Working as intended in my game room ceiling fan.  Trivial no hassle installation.
5.0	Hard to find. Just what we needed!
5.0	Looks great and easy to use. Customer service was quick. The only way I would leave a key to my home outside.
5.0	Exactly what I wanted!
5.0	I use this bulb to back-light a tree in the backyard, I was using fluorescent spots, (which was much better than traditional bulbs) but even they are not as reliable as this!<br /><br />Also, these LED bulbs are instantly on to full brightness without warming up like fluorescent Bulbs.<br />The color is also nice and white, not blueish at all!<br /><br />****<br />Jim
5.0	I had trouble unplugging the old unit and had to use heat gun to unfreeze.  Directions did not look like my unit.  I did not change any included water parts.  The instructions said I must do that but since the old and new units had exactly the same water caoacity I didn't do it.<br /><br />Installation required I remove old unit, one screw and one plug.  Remove two plastic parts from old unit and snap onto new unit.  Slip in, install screw and plug.  Turn on.<br /><br />If I did it again I could easily complete job in two minutes.<br /><br />Working great!
5.0	So happy with this little shade. I had ordered a totem lamp from Shearwater Pottery in Ocean Springs, MS. It came without a shade. I measured and them went to Amazon to search for what I had in my head. I knew I didn't want a round shade, the lamp is small. I wanted one that was somewhat flat and very narrow. This is just what I was looking for. Thanks.
5.0	The shipment arrived in good condition, with no damage to the box. The product was complete with all parts, hardware, instructions etc. The only problem I found with the ladder was a design problem. The lower corners of the frame on the hinge end were slightly opened up due to the continual stress of the gas shocks. I did not want to install  it with the corners gaping open about a quarter inch, so I clamped the corners back closed, replaced the two quarter inch screws with five sixteenth inch carriage bolts and installed a long wood screw from the end member into the side member to hold the corner closed. Then I wrapped it with a piece of sheet metal and put wood screws in the end and side boards to hold it solid. When I removed the clamp, the corners stayed closed. In my opinion, the factory should wrap this corner with sheet metal to hold the corners closed since the gas shocks do exert quite a bit of pressure on the joints. Hardwood, instead of pine might also work. Overall, I am very well pleased with the ladder and it is very solid and sturdy. I would highly recommend this product to anyone. Although I managed to install in by myself, it really is a two man job to do it safely.
5.0	Just applied this to the front door in advance of today's winter storm, and before -7°F temperatures here in New Hampshire last night. I had a larger gap than I realized between the edge of my metal front door + the door frame. I applied on layer of this product, then added a 2nd layer, adhered to the first layer. Is working great. I'm going to buy another package of this product for other applications.<br /><br />I don't understand why some folks complained about the adhesive: follow the instructions and all should be well. You must clean the surface before applying. And don't try to stick it on top of old, dirty weatherstripping.
5.0	Love love love this. Perfect for that lamp that you just can't reach.
5.0	Now this is fun!  It had to have some work done on it before putting it together.  Some nuts were not workable.  But my husband perservered and it is a fantastic addition to a wild bathroom.
5.0	These decals are durable and stick very well even when you change your mind and move them from place to place.
5.0	I used the bulbs in a small room during a science themed kid's camp and they performed flawlessly for my application.
5.0	It very modern.its what I expected.
5.0	My &#34;no-name&#34; fridge Ice Cube Make Filter is truly a bargain.  If you read the specs on the filter, and calculate the &#34;water flow&#34; in to the ice maker and assume the number of cubes made a day (after day)... the cartridge would actually last about 10 years (for my Sears Ice Maker.)<br />These statistics are only base on the cartridge specs and my fridges capacity to produce ice.<br />The reality, I change the filter about every two years.  I have no problem with odor, or particles in the ice. The filter change takes a couple of minutes, empty the first couple of &#34;ice trays&#34; and wait another two years.  There has never been a leaking problem.
5.0	This is great.  It stretches to hold lots of stuff in the back of my Jeep.  I'd order another if needed.
5.0	Used it at Christmas time.It work real well.The rain and snow did not interfere with it  at all.The light is very bright I will be buying more in the up coming months.
5.0	This thing boils a pot of water!  BOILS!  Do you know how hot that is?!?!  (It's 100*C or 212*F, in case you were wondering.)
5.0	I tried an aftermarket substitute for the Maytag filter in the past, but it just wasn't as good as the real deal.  The off-brand didn't last as long as the Maytag, so there is something to be said for factory recommended parts after all!
5.0	Perfect fit for front porch. No problems installing, does exactly as instructions. love it's not bulky doesn't sense till dark.
5.0	I use these bulbs for in a whole house UV  germicidal system in my air handler. i ordered 2 bulbs one arrived defective, but was quickly replaced by Anyray. excellent folks to do business with!!
5.0	I would consider myself a high-end shopper and don't mind spending extra money for a quality product .  Quite often, you get what you pay for.  I also always read the reviews,  which is usually a good indicator of a great product.  If a product has great reviews, it gets my attention. This shower head was reasonably priced with great reviews so I thought I would give it a try.  The water pressure in my house is OK, but I thought I could use a little boost.  I can't say enough great things about this shower head!  To say that it gives the water pressure a boost is a gross understatement.  I was extremely surprised how much it increased the water pressure!  I'm very, very happy with it.  I find myself looking forward to my showers now more than ever.  I was hesitant because it is not a hand held shower but I purchased a converter and attached a handheld shower head so now I have both.  I love it!  I highly recommend this product for sure!  You will not be disappointed.
5.0	these are great, especially for your significant other , crafter or to take yard-saling.
5.0	This pull has exactly the look I was hoping to achieve: very clean lines, high sheen, no visible &#34;folds&#34; in the corners, and a solid feel - a little work of art.  I have used other Top Knob pulls for different rooms and they are always top quality.  I highly recommend this item.
5.0	Worked great! Easy to replace
5.0	Old style ,simple ,drips are easy to fix.I had a Peerless guaranteed not to drip ,but it did.My plumber told me to buy this one .
5.0	I needed loupes that could help me while checking small objects and these are perfect!  Thank-you very much and will order more for gifts soon!
5.0	This is a beautiful lamp.  Very prompt delivery.
5.0	Great filter.  Fits nicely inline with the water line.  Easy to install.
5.0	Best price. Quality handles. I put them on 24 of my kitchen cabinets and made my rustic kitchen some character!
5.0	Love these lights ! You can display in different ways and they looks so beautifully.<br />Very pleased:)
5.0	looks great in my bathroom
5.0	use these instead on the big box store landscape bubs (2/pkg for about $6!)..they seem to last longer and just be carful about handling them prior to installation.
5.0	Love these little lights!  I will be ordering more for the holidays next year.  I used these on small trees and they worked great.  The wire makes it easy to bend and place just in the right places and the glow is nice and bright.
5.0	This is the best shower head ever.  I ordered two and they were so great that my neighbors asked me to buy them one.  I JUST RECEIVED MY FIVE MORE.  Thsnkd for a great producyt.<br />Joanne Coleman
5.0	Worked perfect and good range. I like having it on my keychain. Programming was a bit weird but figured it out in about 10 minutes
5.0	Haven't used them enough to know.
5.0	Very good filtration without blocking the air flow;<br />The price though is not a deal ($70 for 6 when writing this review); they are $60 at Lowe's and you can always get 10-20% off coupons at Lowes.<br />I use http://renovopower.com/ for Lowe's coupons; no trying, no sign-in just plain coupon codes.
5.0	nice cheap easy to install
5.0	Installed this at the beginning of summer and it has been running its little heart out ever since.
5.0	They fit perfectly and look great! Also much cheaper than the ones at the big stores.
5.0	I was worried this wasn't the right match for my fridge, I was supposed to get the -00003A replacement, but this worked like a charm.  Simple to install, works great.
5.0	Super simple, stick the wire in and tighten it with a screwdriver, no wrapping wire around a screw.
5.0	I can't install enough of these!  A friend recommended me to get one for my porch and after installing that got some for all my bathrooms and kitchen.  I couldn't believe I lived for 2 years in my new house without them!<br /><br />EASY install.  You really need zero electrical background to figure out how to install these.  Just be sure to shut off the power and the rest is easy.<br /><br />The price I paid on Amazon was a few pennies more than the sale price at a local big box store for the same product.  Definitely worth buying on here, in my opinion.
5.0	I'm a big Tazmanian Devil fan and wanted to decorate my office. This will work great on my big wall above my computer.
5.0	I researched this part all over the net.Amazon had the cheapest price.Seneca River Trading was the company where the part came from.It was shipped super fast.part works great at a fraction of the cost that the local parts store wanted.On a scale of 1 to 10 its a 10!!!! Thanks Amazon!!!!
5.0	worth its weight in gold if you have to do caulking
5.0	Bought these timidly... because I was fearful of ruining one by making mistakes in changing over the old fixtures. Not only am I not an electrician, but I don't even play one on the Internet.<br /><br />But by reading the reviews here on Amazon and watching You Tube videos of the installation, I began to understand the concept and after doing one fixture changeover, it becomes old hat.<br /><br />Don't want to overstate my abilities, but I wouldn't shy away from reading for the role of an electrician for a small part like this. '-)
5.0	Excellent design and construction; great value too.
5.0	These cleaning cloths are great. The quality is great and I am very happy with the purchase. The seller has gone above and beyond and really made sure I have received everything and am happy with everything. I have been impressed with the seller as much as the product.
5.0	Could not find these o-rings anywhere else.  They all wanted to sell me the entire basket.  I  already had two of those.  The o-rings fit perfectly and solved my probably.  Thanks
5.0	First time I ever had a built in filter system in refridge...love it.
5.0	Great area coverage!  Love the maintenance/cost free idea!  Look forward to watching for more products!  Glad to be your customer!
5.0	Use it for filtering water for home brewing.  Plastic 1/4&#34; tubing fit perfectly & needs no adaptors to work.  Love that design!
5.0	The transformer replaced the original that lasted about 6 years and was used every day. I look forward to the same service from this one as it is identical. It took forever to get here but the bargin price made it worth the wait. Amazon.com are good folks to do business with.
5.0	We painted the walls shades of grey, so the color and design of these look very elegant on them. We're very pleased.
5.0	It looks amazing and so sparkly. Love it, We are using this for our Powder room. Perfect size and shape.
5.0	"Update 6/2/14 still no issues.++++++++++++++++++++Update 12/3/12.  Still no issues.++++++++++++++++++Update 9/10/12.  No issues with the faucet to date.*************Original review: I'll update the review after we have this a while.  No issues after it was installed and works as advertised.  It has only been in one week.  I had a plumber install it becauset the plumber was coming out anyway for the original issue with the old faucet.  It took the plumber about an hour to install.  This looks good.  I have stainless steel appliances and it really pulls the look together because the faucet is \\""tall\\"" and prominent.  The plumber did mention that he has a couple customers with the faucet and they both have had issues with either solenoids or short life batteries.  We went for it anyway."
5.0	My lamp is perfect for my office-library and I didn't have to<br />run around shopping to find it! Good price too.
5.0	It did the trick and all pieces were included.  Can't believe I have lived with my top dishwasher rack falling for the past two years.  This is metal, so they have changed the design from when our KitchenAid was manufactured 4 years ago.
5.0	I got this cord for my refrigerator after I moved it.<br />Does a good job with no overheating.
5.0	Works well to moisturize and protect wood.  My wood furniture looks so nice when I use it.  I would buy again
5.0	I will order another one!  beautiful lamp, elegant yet simple. it was easy to assemble and very affordable, great product
5.0	This is real Leviton for sure. Excellent quality, as you would expect.
5.0	It was just as described and works perfect and is of very good construction. I actually purchased it to cover a Light control system in my restaurant. People would bump agains it and turn off the whole restaurant. This works great!
5.0	I was tired of risking my life with all the old unstable ladders in the garage that we have acquired from generations past.  I thought this three step ladder would be a great fit, and i was right!!  Light weight, a place for your tools, screws, etc., and is the PERFECT size.  I couldn't be happier!
5.0	Straight up fit perfect
5.0	I installed this shower head in my daughter's condo.  The chlorine level was high as well as other aspects of the water not being very healthy.  Within 2 weeks she noticed an improvement in the way her hair and skin felt.  I don't know if it's helping with anything other than the chlorine but if that's all it does, it's well worth the investment.  Installation was as simple as with any other shower head.
5.0	After my husband had a conventional aluminum ladder tip and cause him to fall while working on gutters, we decided to buy a premium-quality ladder.  The footprint of the Little Giant ladder is wide, so it is very stable.  We have used it in both extension-ladder and step-ladder mode.  It feels solid when standing on it, and does not rock or pitch. It is extremely sturdy, and nicely finished.<br /><br />Two problems that we have encountered:  (1) It is heavy, and that may be problematic for some users, (2) BE CAREFUL when sliding it into the shortest configuration - you can get your fingers caught!  We are giving it 5 stars, because the finger-pinching problem is mostly a matter of being careful and paying attention to what you are doing, and is not a result of a defect of the product.<br /><br />The ladder is expensive, but good quality items are priced accordingly.
5.0	direct replacement for the old worn out one. 10 minute install. What more can I say other than it was about 50% cheaper here than at the big box stores
5.0	Good item, great service.
5.0	Its a broom works great it brooms things and does it well really well a broom is just a broom
5.0	The vendor surprised me with the speed of service on this order. It only took 4 days from order to receipt of product. Great transaction. Highly reccomend this vendor.
5.0	I bought this because my local big box store doesn't carry posters (or materials) anymore. The package itself is small, but a 48-pack is bound to have me set for a few years. These strips are much better than the typical square adhesives, and removal is very easy. I would completely recommend this product.
5.0	Great lamp would recommended it.
5.0	Bought this just a few weeks ago and hooked it up myself, nothing to it. The product works great and I was able to program in the settings that met my needs. I would recommend this product. Great product and you cant beat the price at $17,23
5.0	These, along with some 9&#34; wristlets, make a safety strap for my small items including flashlight and cell phone, so if they fall out of my pocket, they don't meet the ground.  These are very small, about 1-1/2&#34; long, which is exactly what I wanted.  Durable and very well made.
5.0	I ordered these for the holiday lighting in my yard. I ordered a bunch of red and blue bulbs...maybe 12 total. I have had 2 go bad. One cracked on the front lens and the other just stopped working. The rest have performed flawlessly. Great value and very bright lights. Some white light leakage to the rear of the bulbs but nothing crazy. Huge electrical savings over standard bulbs. Takes a few minutes to achieve full brightness in cold weather (less than 50 degrees). Very Good Product!
5.0	Upgraded both garage doors in less than 10 mins and now able to control from my phone (requires gateway).
5.0	"I feel silly being so excited about a potty-related item, but I LOVE this potty seat!  I wish I knew about it when my daughter first started potty training.  No more \\""setting up\\"" the removable potty seat on our elongated bowl each time, and then having it lay around on our bathroom floor after.  Super easy to clean (especially around the bolts because the whole unit can come off!) and looks nicer than the brands with the silver hardware, in my opinion.  My 2 1/2 year-old is so proud that she can go all by herself now, and loves her \\""real big girl seat.\\"""
5.0	This lever was such a great deal that I took back a purchase from Lowes and ordered this one.  A friend synced it up with my front door key and they both use the same key which makes it so easy.  Works great and is so easy to use.
5.0	Just installed this on the front door of my new condo. SO easy to setup.  Works perfectly.  Looks fantastic.  I set up a few codes already for my dog walker, friend, etc.  The ability to easily add and remove codes is great.  Instructions were clear.  I'm very happy with this purchase.
5.0	Worked great until a tree totally destroyed the pumphouse, it hit the tank and bent the bottom ring, after I hooked it back up when everything was cleaned up it works the same, so its tuff too!
5.0	Barely made a dent in the bag when adding &#34;embers&#34; to my gas fireplace!!  Enough for several fireplaces....added more glow to my original embers.
5.0	To keep from scratching hard wood floor.  Now just need to find some that will fit rectangular shaped legs of my kitchen chairs.
5.0	Best damn thing, since sliced bread!
5.0	a most excellent value, long lasting for dusty desert air they are great.  They are not so tightly woven as to make it hard for heat pump to draw air, and have a nice snug fit.  I will always buy these at this price, no need to switch.
5.0	Took the old one off and popped this one in place.  Excellent. Not super quiet, but it does the job and I have 5 zones.
5.0	Gave me all the measurements necessary to fit my door.
5.0	Omg the best thing ever. Great quality made to last .. And I get a lot of WOW how cool is that
5.0	The faucet sprayer that does it all!  I don't know why  these are so hard to find, so we ordered several.  Very  happy to have them.
5.0	They worked perfectly. good quality product
5.0	You can't get any more manly than this. It is a REAL craftsman screwdrive handle, even smells just like the ones I grew up using that were my Dad's!
5.0	Excellent check valve.  All it is advertised to be.  I'll buy another when the time comes.  Wife now complains she can't hear the sump pump, and is always asking me to go check if it's working!
5.0	Installed this for someone that wanted same that was in attic before fit was correct works nice and quite fan fit like it belonged on it.
5.0	This set is a must have for any home repair DIY-er.  Ive used it to pry everything that needs to be pryed.  The smaller sized one is especially handy for more delicate items just remember to place a thin board underneath before prying against drywall or woodwork.<br />The metal is strong and the handles are a welcome comfort.  Use these tools without gloves as the grips are comfortable and very grippy.
5.0	This was an awesome addition to my son's room.  Couldn't be happier with the image or quality.  All around great purchase.
5.0	Fast service, exact parts needed!
5.0	Works great. The redlink teamed with our Honeywell Prestige IAQ allows you to set schedules and control your home hvac remotely. Turn up the heat or air before you get home. We love it!!!
5.0	It works well. I tried the undercoat and though they are similar, the leak ender goes on evenly and I used it on a wet surface. The undercoat bubbles/bunches up, for lack of better term. It is a temporary fix but I used it 3 months on my roof and so far so good.  Please shake well.
5.0	Exactly what we needed to complete our vessel sink installation!
5.0	I used this on a 5 day, 1500 mile motorcycle ride from Big Bend Texas and back.  It held my tent, mat, and sleeping bag securly to my bike.  I don't understand negative reviews on this.  It is cheap and does a great job.  If you don't like it buy something gold plated.
5.0	Very easy to install and functions great!  I would recommend to anyone.
5.0	Good product. Looks good too.<br />No problems and I recommend it. (need a few more words for the review)<br />:)
5.0	Easy install , recommend to preread instructions and add other devices in<br />This group from Honeywell for complete home system.
5.0	I bought this for floundering in the Gulf of Mexico, and it is plenty bright enough to shine through the murky water. Amazing for hiking, cycling, camping. The rechargeable batteries last a long time and I've recharged and reused them about 20 times now. comfortable on the head, brighter than most peoples maglites. Get it.
5.0	my daughter loves this, it really helps with her &#34;winter blues&#34;
5.0	This item is very useful for eliminating energy vampire devices.  Use this to replace items that take a lot of energy or find out how much your devices uses when just sitting there.  Get a surge protector that kills standby power to go with it!
5.0	I found the original to have mixed reviews so I bought the extreme, which is fatter. It fits perfect, and took about 90 seconds to assemble. It does work very well. we have carpet, and the outside is an enclosed porch so we don't have to worry about it getting wet. on the outside of our door is a metal base, I was worried it would jam but it glided right up and over it. also, when you fold and velcro the end you inserted the tubes, fold it like the end of a present, like a triangle, and tightly velcro shut. Because the end of the fabric was stuffing the door a little. It even went right over our old draft guard. I give it a solid 5 stars.
5.0	This pulley worked great on my 12v electric motor. I painted it black so I could reduce the reflection of the shiny metal because i needed to clock the rpm of it. It's a good quality pulley and has thousands of potential uses. I would definitely recommend this product to anybody who needs a 2.5in pulley.
5.0	I love the product. The LED's are just as bright as they are in the pictures. They came 3 days before the earliest estimated delivery date and they came through in perfect condition. nothing was bent everything came in a plastic bag with stickers on each individual baggy to specify the color you had. There were plenty of resistors and a spec sheet that included operating voltage/current for each color.. I would recommend this product to everyone despite other peoples reviews. It is kind of over-kill IMO to put these in a box. Just depends on who handles your mail and if they have respect for your property or not. The bubble wrap envelope perfectly secured my product. THANKS!
5.0	Works great. Will have your feet very smooth.
5.0	Works great for holiday lights.
5.0	Works well and easy to install. Well, I'll admit, I've installed a number of garage door openers in the past. They're all different but the concepts are the same. In this case, this design is well thought out and the instructions are easy to follow. One task per page and explained in text and pictures. I've also purchased other Whisper Drive units in the past, but this one was by far the quietest unit ever. It's so quite that my wife can't hear it open the garage door, which is good when I come home late at night. ;). Others we've had in the past could wake her. Trust me, not good. Still though, it operates smoothly and really, the only noise we hear come from the door itself. A feature I had not expected was the end of travel, both up and down, that slows the door down just at the end of it's run, similar to self closing kitchen drawers. It's a nice touch and though it does not add to the functionality, it adds to my peace of mind. Well done.
5.0	Good travel locks, durable and inexpensive
5.0	I noticed that this is identical as the one that I pulled out to replace...  Which has been under my sink for at least 15-years (and was working fine).  I even used the old power cord and save some money...  So, this Badger must be a cash cow for InSinkErator (I assume no R&D in years!)<br /><br />Easy to install (about an hour for me to install - and I'm no plumber).  Also, obviously reliable.  And I was told by several folks that unless you are interested in &#34;low noise&#34; garbage disposal, stay with this 1/2 hp workhorse.  Glad I did.
5.0	This works great in my kitchen.  I dont have to have a exhaust for dryer  its only for a electric dryer.
5.0	Sparkles in the lights !
5.0	Nice....great big size, perfect for taking photos with your party guests.
5.0	I have bought the various scents that this company offers and they are great!  Use a grill lighter wand to get them going otherwise it takes a while.
5.0	Great price on a set of 6 bungee cords.  I used them to strap 2 kid's bikes to the top of my SUV and they worked great.
5.0	There are lots of window fans available in the market. I chose this model because of its remote control and reversal functions. It has a cheaper twin model without the remote control. It runs smoothly and quietly. I bought one first and bought another one after a test run. It sucks in cool air during the evening hours and it blows out hot air as well. I highly recommend this product to whoever living in area whever there are cool evenings but warm or hot during the day time.
5.0	i love these, they are cute. It is a great value for what you get and they look wonderful around the room. not too small. good quality, easy to put up.
5.0	Great bulbs! Awesome service!
5.0	It works great! Highly recommended&#62;
5.0	A special thank you to the guys and girls at Statue Collectors Facebook Group for helping me out and thanks to Chris for suggesting the Etekcity Remote Outlet Switch 2 Pack from Amazon.com.  It works great!<br /><br />I have 4 sets of these working together and its super simple to sync.
5.0	Excellent product, easy to use and held up well.
5.0	Great item. I already have one and wanted to get a couple more for my children's family. Thanks
5.0	Did the job I bought it for.
5.0	Purchased for my toddler busy board and she loves the chain and can unlatch and latch the lock.  Looks nice and perfect for my use.
5.0	Worth the money so far..no leaks ...see what happens in couple years
5.0	We have a very dark stairwell and I placed this on the step just to see how it worked.  Lights up<br />the whole stairwell so I am not going to require two.  Fantastic item.
5.0	We purchased this sink as an upgrade for our kitchen and we love it. It fit the cut out for the old sink without a problem. We also like the fact that it can be under mounted. When we upgrade the counter tops we will have the option of installing it that way. The only problem we had was the first sink arrived cracked. Amazon shipped a new one immediately and there was really no delay for our contractor.
5.0	Master Lock Outboard Motor Lock: Just what I was looking for, at a great price. The Lock works great and gives me peace of mind.
5.0	This is my new favorite &#34;security&#34; product - the light turn on when they need to be, and off when they don't. Been using them for 5+ months now and still going strong - unsure if they will last as many years as advertised, but the convenience of them makes it worth the price.
5.0	In today's world of cheap plastics and overall poor quality, this door chime button is actually made of thick metal (other than the push button itself, of course, which must be translucent for the light).  The unit surface mounts and provides a clean, but functional look.
5.0	An absolutely GORGEOUS sink, big and handsome. Looks like it's made of dark chocolate fudge! And I can wash my largest pans, pots, trays and baking gear in the sink. No more standing things up to try to clean them. What a wonderful change for the better.
5.0	Work great on full size double closet doors. Securely holds doors in place and are very easy snd simple to install
5.0	Better than expected.  I haven't installed it yet, but seemingly a great deal at first glance out of the box.
5.0	Bought this for 3 home showers.  Great product.
5.0	Arrived and worked as expected.
5.0	work great,perfect for the home
5.0	At first I thought that it wasn't going to work, but when I installed and the night arrive, everything was bright and clear. It is exelent product. I have two in the parking lot of my church.
5.0	After many years and installing many different brands of motion detector this unit, so far, is the only one I have found that works reliably.<br />It is more costly to purchase but call-backs are much too costly for me.
5.0	I have had these lights in our backyard for three years now, and they are still as bright as they were when we purchased them.  They are absolutely the best!
5.0	The cute purple butterfly and quality are excellent. It matches my baby girl's crib bedding set. It looks nice on the wall. The only setback is that I have to rearrange the fishing string to make it more invisable behind the flower so I can hang it on the wall. Other than that, it's nice item to use in the nursery room which can be useful in years to come.
5.0	This was just whate we wanted. It replaced a leaky Moen, and it was easy to install. It is attractive and easy to keep clean. I like the rocker switch on the bottom of the pull out spout - it is easy to switch to spray or regular.  The bronze finish matches our kitchen and arrived as expected. So far it is working perfectly.
5.0	Sturdy and very easy to install!  Great quality!
5.0	These things come in handy for projects. Ordered them and they were received as described. No problems found with any of them
5.0	Two grounded outlets on one timer... Didn't think I could get one for under $15! Only off by a few minutes in the two months I've had it.
5.0	I purchased this for an outdoor shower project at our weekend retreat.  It's taking water from a spring (65F) and heating<br />it to a very comfortable temp even with the heat turned almost all the way down.  We have 40-45 psi of<br />water pressure so I'm sure that would change with more pressure.  There is a short few second delay (5-6) from the time you change the temp to the time the water temp actually changes, but it's probably due more to my 8-10' of plumbing from the heater to my shower head more so then a delay in it's heating the water.  If I was building another shower tomorrow,  I would use the same<br />thing.
5.0	Great product, fast shipping Thanks!
5.0	Once I figured out why my oven wasn't lighting this was an easy fix.  Replacing the ignitor was easy with only a screwdriver.
5.0	This product far exceeds SoftScrub...does not leave a residue and cleans very well.  I use it on light beige Silgranite.  Will buy again.
5.0	I bought this water heater over two years ago and it is still working just fine. In the summer we keep it on low and during the colder days we turn it a bit higher, also we have not had Anny issues with the water pressure.
5.0	Shipped very fast and it works great in my dryer.
5.0	Worked perfectly for our cabinet doors. The directions were pretty much nonexistent since it was all in chinese on each bag but the cupe requires a 1 3/8 in forstner bit and 1/2 in deep. The adjustable function in two places was super helpful in aligning the doors just right!flaw
5.0	Our last alarms by First Alert lasted five and a half years before it was malfunctioning and required replacements.  We ordered these as replacements, thinking the price was right for a five year product.  This version does not require batteries and simply operates on your wall plug-in which I LOVE because the old ones required batteries.  This way, I never get woken up at 3am to replace batteries in my CO detectors. It seems that's when batteries always run out so we are satisfied with this product!!
5.0	THIS WAS MY FIRST TIME BUYING A PRODUCT FROM THIS SELLER.  I WAS VERY PLEASED WITH THEIR PRODUCT  AND CUSTOMER ASSISTANCE.  I WILL DEFINITELY BUY FROM THEM AGAIN.  I ORDERED  THE SUNDERLAND LAMP AND THEIR PRICE WAS THE BEST OFFERED IN COMPARISON TO OTHER SITES.
5.0	It matched up perfectly with the Croydex L-Shaped Telescopic Rod, 78-3/4-Inch
5.0	I purchased 4 sets of these for the front and back of my house. I've put 6 lights on 1 converter with no issues and these are very easy to setup.  I've had these for 3 months and so far, no complaints.
5.0	The filter was easy to install and worked immediately. It was worth the money spent.  I would by it again especially since GE parts are so expensive.
5.0	Last fall I purchased the other well known brand that looks like a bluish colored flood lights that states on the package, Grow Light. Besides burning out quickly they are nothing more than a light to make your plants looks greener. This year I tripled my winter greenhouse size (16x16) and bought 6 of these hydroponic bulbs. I live in the Midwest and normally mums, Lantana and outside ferns are goners. Under these lights they are thriving and blooming. The house plants are growing beautifully. I have been running these lights on a timer and they are on 16 hours a day for a month now. (Knock on wood!!!!!) no problems. A little expensive when you first purchase but after last year rebuying and rebuying the other ones throughout the winter, with POOR results, I could have saved a lot of money in the long run buying these hydroponics from the get go. I rooted 6 Butterfly Bushes two weeks ago and under these lights they are also doing well.
5.0	Because of its flat profile and neutral color, it blends with the wall. The light is perfect for night time. Just enough light to navigate around furniture and find the doors. I highly recommend it.
5.0	The magnet is much weaker then the old days but the product works great.  Thanks for the ver fast service
5.0	I was able to get exactly what I wanted by shopping at Amazon.  The sink is perfect and arrived so fast - faster than going to yet another local vendor.  I am all about supporting local vendors but got tired of them never having what I wanted and prices higher than I expected I would pay.<br />This suited our needs perfectly.
5.0	The product is just what I expected. A little too much glare, though.
5.0	Have done a bathroom remodel. This cabinet is sleek and looks great in the new bath. We inset the cabinet but it can be wall mounted just as well. Well made. All the hardware is included to install. Great product hope to get many years of use from it.
5.0	As advertised and received fast
5.0	As expected and they are great lights<br />for the price.
5.0	I haven't hung this pendant yet but I love the color and style and I chose it because I only need a 6 inch extension which this offered. It appears to be of good quality and it was difficult to find on other websites...all sold out. Can't wait<br />To see it hanging above my bar!
5.0	Extra nice for the price and the UPS man didn't beat it up - Nice for a change.
5.0	I have searched years for a hand creme that would give my hands relief from the cracking and itching because I need to constantly wash my hands. I have researched and tried so many different products that I gave up hope I would be able to find a hand creme that didn't leave my hands feeling completely sticky/tacky and still dry because the lotion would not absorb. I am sensitive to odors and the lotions on the market are often heavily perfumed.  I thought I was forever going to have to resort to Vaseline which can be a real pain since your hands end up greasy if you use too much.<br /><br />I was very skeptical that O'Keeffe's Working Hands would work, but I am believer now and just ordered another jar.  This is going to help me so much going into the winter. You just need to use a very small amount.<br /><br />PROS:<br />1)  there is absolutely no odor and is not greasy or tacky feeling<br />2)  your hands feel like you have a protective glove over them that make them feel so soft -- think what your hands might feel like after parafan wax treatment<br />3)  completely relieved all the itchiness from the dryness<br />4)  my hand were soft and dry cracks disappeared immediately upon the first use<br /><br />CONS:<br />None!!<br /><br />Using Minute Manicure once a week in conjunction with this creme is amazing!
5.0	GREAT, holding up to very heavy use. Love that its easy to install and its long enough to stretch on my apartment porch. Saves money drying clothing all the time!
5.0	Great for short extension and to gauge if power is working
5.0	Has excellent color and finish.  Was very easy to install.  Only question is, 'what are the little sticky squares for?'
5.0	Easy to put up and looks a little different from the average towel bar  A modern look I would call it.
5.0	The vendor stated that this had &#34;crisp white light&#34;. The light is dim yellow and not bright enough for my studying. Had to pull the old light out of the closet. I will be returning this &#34;light&#34; light.  OK, to be fair, I got accustomed to the light and really love it now. I bought a second one. It throws off a different light than my bright as day halogen light and took getting used too. I was concerned with eye strain but this adjusts well and use it dozens of hours a week. Stays cool. I use it when I travel to keep a light on at home. My apologies to the vender.
5.0	These are quality toliet seats and very pretty for a toliet seat. Goes well with the decor and brightens up the bathroom.
5.0	I bought this for my girlfriend who bought a house that had a garage door opener but no remote.  We looked forever and couldnt find a remote for her off brand of garage door opener (Cavalier).  Wasnt sure if it would work or not as her brand was not listed in the description.  It worked great and took me about 10 minutes to get programmed (had to match the dip switches to the garage door opener).  Worked great!  I couldnt have asked for a better result!
5.0	Love these addres numbers they are beautiful!!!  High quality :)
5.0	Works great.  Matches shape/quality of the factory burner.  I tried generic burners and drip trays in the past and had trouble with them not fitting together perfectly.  This results in the burner being unlevel.  I also saw some people having quality problems with 3rd party burners.  For something like this, it's best to buy OEM parts.
5.0	Product as advertised. Will buy from company again.
5.0	My mom had been searching for a cute glass lamp for her dresser for some time.  I found this on Amazon and bought it for her for Christmas.  She was suprised and just loves it!
5.0	I live in the country and need a dusk to dawn light.  I have had 3 of these lights now.  can't do without this light.<br />recommended to a friend, and he has one now, and likes it much better than his other yard light, that cost him monthly
5.0	I love the variety of sizes and they look lovely on my daughter's wall. We have ALMOST a popcorn effect paint job, but with the right amount of pressure, these are sticking just fine so far. Very cute.
5.0	"For those of you wondering, this is a real Whirlpool factory certified part.  It arrived in a Whirlpool box, and taking the gear cover off reveals the FSP (Factory Specification Part) molded into the plastic.  It isn't a Chinese knockoff, which I was worried about, since I also ordered the ice level fill circuit board at the same time and it WASN'T Whirlpool or FSP.  Check my other review for that fiasco.  In doing more research on these parts, the original Whirlpool or factory replacement icemaker will have a dark gray or greenish ice mold (where the water fills and ice forms).  This does have that.  The knockoffs will have a white mold instead.<br /><br />At any rate, I haven't installed this yet, I want to wait to also install the correct ice level circuit board at the same time.  Will update my review upon install and confirming this works.  But for now, just being a real Whirlpool part earns it five stars.<br /><br />Update 4/22/13: Installed this today, and within a minute it cycled correctly, making ice cubes later.  I now have the \\""Acceler-ice\\"" function activated to make a full bin of ice as quickly as possible."
5.0	Perfect for replacements for my outside lights.  And what a great price!  It's so much better, cheaper, and easier than buying a full strand of lights just for a few colors.
5.0	Solid and well built.  We are using it as a cash drop box for server cash outs in our restaurant.  This unit mounted easily to the office door and provides a very secure way to temporarily store cash and credit card receipts prior to the daily reconciliation.
5.0	These beautiful pillows brighten up my living room.  They are the perfect color and the quality is really worth much more than I paid
5.0	Now this produces light!
5.0	Love it! Great price for this brand.
5.0	Easy installation and very quiet when in use. This thing will grind anything.
5.0	This towel holder is all that I expected, good height and stable, looks sharp.
5.0	I painted this medallion oil rubbed bronze on the perimeter and the inside ring dark hammered bronze and it is awesome! Perfect solution for Lineage line of chandeliers with square escutcheons.
5.0	Works well for our needs.  Easy to cut with a hack saw.
5.0	exactly what i was wanting... excellent tranaction......
5.0	Great product!  It is just what I had asked for to complete the project
5.0	If you are looking for a beautiful, user -friendly, headache free and no nonsense indoor or outdoor or specifically a garden light or decoration light then you are in the right place. Extremely good product, very rightly placed price wise too! The length is good and suffices all your needs easily.
5.0	It can when it was expected, it was easy to install and works great!!!
5.0	This is a powerful spotlight and very sensitive to movement. Installation was simply to screw it to a post and I needed something wireless. This did the trick.
5.0	Quality product and shipped very fast
5.0	I have bought LED floodlights in the past but they were so narrow angle that they were terrible. You got a bright narrow spot of light and then darkness all around. These have the same wide angle of the CFLs and incandescent bulbs - great.<br />The bulbs have a slight delay when starting, but not like the weird effect of CFLs with a delay and then they are dim for a minute. These delay for about a second or less and then are full brightness.<br />These are very very bright. Much brighter than the 65W incandescent bulbs or the CFLs.<br />We use them on a normal slide dimmer (Leviton) and they work just fine. They do not dim as low as incandescent, more like CFL dim. But, no flickering for us.<br />The regular edison bulb shape ones also work well - very good distribution of light and good light, although they are whiter than the PAR30s for some reason.<br />I will buy more as I am very impressed.
5.0	This night light is pretty close to perfect. It's safe- doesn't get hot like a lot of other night lights and isn't flimsy, which means no tiny broken pieces! I can't even count the number of night lights we have had over the years that are cheaply made. One wrong pull, the plastic snaps and it's useless. These have never broken on us. It's also super cute and acts as two night lights- one on the wall, one on the ceiling. My twins were always contact in their room at night and I think it was partially because of this light. When they wake up they see the familiar light in the ceiling and are able to comfortably get back to sleep. We actually bought this night light on vacation with us several times to help transition the girls.<br /><br />The image on the ceiling does fade but it doesn't seem to be a big issue. We have a few in different images because they are such a big hit with all of our kids!
5.0	We are very pleased with our purchase and we thought they were excellent value.
5.0	This product is exactly what I needed.  Very easy installation with terrific color.
5.0	Great lights- I bought a second set for the side of my house I liked them so well.<br />Then sensor is sensitive but not overly- a person walks past and it comes on- but its not coming on for a cat strutting past.
5.0	This product is amazing! My parents purchased this for their house in Dover, DE. The house is on the east side of the city near the air force base where there is plenty of marsh and wetlands (i.e. mosquito-ville). In the summer, mosquitoes are everywhere! As soon as you get out of the car or head to the car, they are waiting to swarm and bite. They follow you into the house or into the car. Well you all get the picture. Since they purchased the Stinger 1.5 acre (model bk300) bug zapper this is about 90-95% reduced. We can go outside to water the garden, go to and from the mailbox, and go to and from the car in peace. Not only does it kill mosquitoes, it kills the nasty biting flies too. Moths, potato bugs and other pests are also immediately eradicated when they touch the bulb of the lamp. It is MUSIC TO MY EARS and I love it!<br /><br />I love how this lamp shuts it self off during the day as the sunrises and comes back on at dusk when the sun sets. It also can be left on all day and night if needed for a cookout or other outdoor event! If you need a yard free of mosquitoes, this is the device to get!<br /><br />I will be heading to Bangkok, Thailand on a missionary trip for a few years and I plan to purchase one of these lamps. From the blogs and articles that I am reading online, I know it will be well worth it. I only hope the electric conversion gadgets will work!<br /><br />Bottom line, I give his device a 5 star rating!
5.0	I purchased the sparkle magic, it stopped working after just a few minutes, though I didn't have the satisfaction  of getting to use it, I'm satisfied that they will refund me for the laser and shipping, so that is why I'm giving them 5 stars  is good customer service, and from what others are saying about the laser maybe I just got one of the few faulty units.
5.0	Really nice light. Very white which is what I wanted.
5.0	It's a really nice and well constructed box. Holds the cord in tact. The rubber seal on the end seals the cord fairly tight. You have to push in it to form a tight seal. One of the reviewer says the hold is too small. I think it's design this way to have tight seal. Easy to open and close with the lid snaps right in. I got two of them.
5.0	This fixture was easy to install and it is very beautiful. I love my purchase, I received it fast and boxed appropriately.
5.0	Exactly what I expected
5.0	Not oly beautiful but came in the configuration that I needed which was difficult to find.  It matches the other switch plates in my newly remodeled bathroom.
5.0	Quick shipping.  Fit perfectly in Kodak 750h Carousel Projector
5.0	I bought this fan as a gift for my nephews.  It arrived very quickly and in perfect condition.  THEY LOVE IT. &#34;IT'S AWESOME&#34;, they said.<br />We literally installed it in their room in about 15 minutes.  All the parts were there and the instructions were easy to follow.  When we turned it on the light was great and I was surprised at how much air the fan moved, even on the low setting.  VERY QUIET - NO WOBBLING.  The construction of this fan is totally solid.  The colors are nice and bright and the graphics are baked right on the fan blades.  They are not cheap stickers like I have seen on other Disney fans at the store - and they were about $100 more than this one cost.<br />This is a very high quality ceiling fan with a great finish and a very good price.<br />FANTASTIC PURCHASE - THANKS!!!
5.0	Purchased this to controlling an old Craftsman garage door from a Vera 3 unit along with the Ecolink sensor.  Was easy to pair. Fortrezz provided excellent instructions on devices settings.  I have had the device  for about a week now and has performed flawlessly.  Just purchased a second unit for the other door.
5.0	"Very well built grab bar (24\\"") that can substitute as a towel bar. Came with necessary hardware for stud mount. Finish resembles brushed nickel. Gatco has a complete line of Latitude 2 products for that matching hardware look. The only con i can see is the finish may scratch if grabbed by user wearing a ring. Mine came scratched but automotive clear coat polished renewed the finish like new."
5.0	I saw a similar night light at a friend's house, and then sought this out on Amazon.  I love it, and only regret that I didn't order another one at the time.  When I went back to order a second one, they were out of stock.  The light arrived before the expected arrival date, and I enjoyed using it during the holidays.
5.0	Not cheap, looks great
5.0	Brought it for a friend for their daughters room and they loved so so very much, matched the decor perfectly i am so very happy about my purchase Thank you
5.0	This was the answer to my need.
5.0	Just what I ordered and on-time delivery.  Nice weight.  I'm sure they will fit the bill.
5.0	Fast delivery. Easy to install. Fun tunes to choose from. My son is excited everytime someone is at the door.
5.0	What can I say...it does the job.  It came very timely, charged up and has been in use ever since.  The product was quality met expectations.
5.0	Very good filter, good seller.
5.0	It was easy to install. Part fits perfect, works nice. Be sure that you have right tension of chain after all parts were installed
5.0	Indistinguishable from an incandescent bulb with a fraction of the power.<br /><br />You need to have a 3-way lamp to make use of the 3-way function.
5.0	Looks great and works great.  A little pricey but worth it.
5.0	The filters work just fine but I have since pruchased a new refrigerator that takes another kind.
5.0	Surprisingly good quality, some would say motel quality. Heavy weight, mirror finish, includes mounting hardware
5.0	How did I live without this creme, or never hear of it, for the past ten years?  The skin on my hands started cracking and bleeding and aging me badly about 10 years ago when I entered the food service industry (wash wash wash those hands!).  Every winter was a painful horror.  I've used olive oil.  shea butters.  almond oil/butter.  medicated creams.  nada.  First wash and poof!  all benefit gone.  This stuff, i did it once before bed and once in the morning.  Washed my hands maybe 50 times (i'm a professional cook), and end-of-day still had smoother, softer, 'stretchier' skin.  I could make a fist without wincing or feeling my skin tighten.  i LOVE THIS STUFF!
5.0	I Have been using this RF deadbolt for about 2 months now and it works great.  It was a snap to install and works as advertised.  Remote range is pretty good, about 25ft or so.  The construction is sturdy, and brass has a nice finish.  The instructions were pretty decent and only tricky part is lining up the dead bolt hole to the dead bolt.  If you don't get that accurately it may  not lock, and give you the annoying error beep.  It took me a few tries to get it right.  Make sure you check the little switch in the back and its in the position for left or right hand door otherwise the remote buttons will work in opposite.  I called Morning industries to verify this and their customer service was AWESOME.  Very helpful and knowledgeable.  I ended up ordering two more remotes from them too.  Best part of the system is you can add and remove remotes as you wish.  If you loose one just erase it from the system and add a new one.
5.0	I like it, and feel that it is necessary for the all metal Berkey water filtering systems so you can see if the water level is full or near empty.
5.0	Right length helped me trim a bush that was driving me crazy.
5.0	Best tie downs out there. These were recommend to me by another rider. The soft loops are perfect and the hooks close like carabiniers.
5.0	I am Very happy with purchase.  The driveway patrol sensor and receiver kit is a great way to monitor your property.
5.0	What can I say its a tool.  it works.  fast delivery.
5.0	Perfect for both kids and kids at heart. Nice quality plastic, not the flimsy stuff. Two thumbs up! : )
5.0	Awesome Product, The speaker is no joke, its as loud as whatever device you are BT'd to so it can get pretty loud.
5.0	Mother of God this thing works. Ever have that girlfriend that has a stopped up shower drain? Run this thing down the drain and back up and she'll think you're the master handy man. What a great tool to stock pile.
5.0	"This item works just as it should, was easy to install (slip on and tighten a screw), and is by far a better bet than those so-call \\""universal\\"" spouts you see at Lowes/Home Depot/etc.  which do NOT work well at all."
5.0	installed and works great
5.0	Excellent.  Works perfectly while setting the fuel pressure on my fuel oil torpedo heater.  Super fast shipping.
5.0	We have used the Mighty Mule wireless driveway alarm for about four months now, and are very pleased with it. We have a rural nature preserve that is open to the public. We use the device to monitor our driveway and to let us know when visitors arrive. It has worked flawlessly through several thousand alarm cycles, never missing a vehicle. The device is placed approximately 150 feet from our house and about 5 feet from the driveway. In four months the device has had approximately four false alarms (no vehicle; maybe an errant radio signal). Deer pass the device daily without setting it off. We had a more expensive driveway alarm several years ago, but it was so unreliable as to be worthless. We highly recommend this product to anyone; but do read the applications and distance limitations before buying. We are well satisfied with the Mighty Mule for our specific purposes.
5.0	We bought two. One for each side of the front door. They went up easily and we even bought the wider and longer length for a side door in the dining room. They match and look great. Now, no one can stand at the windows or doors and stare directly into our house. It's nice to be able to let some light in, but not the peeping toms.
5.0	The press top is made of metal and feels heavy, the nozzle has anti-drip design. Overall the build quality is very good. Highly recommended. Coming from cheap stainless steel alternative, this plastic bottle wont rust in the long run.
5.0	The entire transaction went well; the product(s) were exactly what we wanted and fit the description perfectly. The delivery was timely, as well. Would not hesitate to do business with this company again.
5.0	I've really enjoyed this lava lamp. Black lava and clear liquid is a nice combination that doesn't seem to have the funky groovy retro feel of the more colorful versions ... it's more classy looking, Batman graphics notwithstanding.<br /><br />One thing I've noticed is that the level of ambient light makes a big difference in how it looks. I also have the white wax/black liquid Batman lamp and they react pretty differently to light level. With lots of light in the room, like during a sunny day, the light coming from the bulb is less noticeable and the wax takes on a nice inky black color. But at night, even in a well-lit room, the wax looks purplish and there's lots of light reflection, and it doesn't look very cool. I think even the black wax has some transparency so it appears purple when the light traveling through it is visible. Meanwhile, the one with white wax looks better in a darker room because the wax glows more.<br /><br />The point being, this is a great color choice if you're going to be using it during the day, like at the office. If it's going to be on at night I'd suggest a lighter wax color.<br /><br />There's one other thing I noticed: this lamp has more interesting lava flow than my white wax lamp. I get lots of snakey long blobs and nice medium-sized round balloony ones going up and down. The white lamp just has a thin strip of wax that rises every few seconds from a mass at the bottom. I have a feeling it's because the black wax absorbs more heat and so the whole system runs hotter. Or it could just be due to variation across different lamps.<br /><br />I haven't had any cloudiness issues with mine, but you definitely want to check return policies before you buy these over the Internet. And for the love of Mike, don't have one of these shipped across the country during hot weather.
5.0	Just what I was looking for. You can never find what you need in the store any more. Thank you.
5.0	Its the perfect fit for my log rack. Went right over the top and it wasn't too snug. It has a flap to open and close so you can get logs out. it been through snow storm and rain storm and still looks good! I am very pleased.
5.0	You can't best this for the price.  Will take a temp.  From just about as far as you can shot the laser.  Does both Fahrenheit and Celsius.  Has nice back-lit led screen for night time.  Feels well made. Don't have that cheap feel of some plastics.  Can't go wrong with this
5.0	They sent a ligt burn!! And they sent me an email!! And them they sent one replace !!! So thx for help me !!!
5.0	Works as should and is actually medium brown.  Not purplish as the &#34;brown&#34; selling at Fred Myers.
5.0	These little pipettes work great for and with my essentials oils when mixing.
5.0	Love this...easy to put on wall
5.0	Great little desktop light for computer table.
5.0	This is so much better than the toddler trainer that we bought originally. The magnetic child sit is great as guest even sees it there.
5.0	The hardest part is cutting the it to fit your panes--you really have to measure twice, and a paper cutter helps. Getting it on is fairly simple, though I recommend a real squeegee, not the piece of plastic they provide. As far as appearance, it looks just like rice paper and provides both privacy and light. I've used it in my dining room (to block the view of my air conditioner's compressor) and in my kitchen, to keep people from seeing in.
5.0	These are very pretty and are easy to put on and remove.  There is a guide so you can put them on like they appear in the picture or you can put them in any order you like.
5.0	"My 91 year old father, who is oblivious to style, commented on how beautiful this lampshade appears. It has a French cottage type appearance on our white thin wrought iron based lamp. Just be sure to double check the measurements; this is a small shade: the top is 6\\"", the bottom is 11\\"" and the length is 8\\""."
5.0	so far so good. dont know how long it will last
5.0	My 18 month old daughter loves these!  We put them in her room and in her bathroom.  Every time she seems them she gets excited!  Great buy!
5.0	Stupid Proof Product.  Just got done installing the product and it was &#34;stupid proof&#34;.  Done in 30 minutes only because I had to go up and down two flights of stairs to turn off and on the power. If you follow instructions well you cannot screw it up.  And I'm not a handy guy when it comes to electricity.  My home was built in 2000, so all the wires were color coded to my thermostat.  Gas heat (have not tried heat pump).  But I followed instructions, hit the power, and it fired right up.<br /><br />Connected to the internet, set up my account, downloaded IOS app to the iPhone and I'm playing like a kid in the candy store.  I have a downstairs unit as well, so I'll be ordering another one.  Can definitely see the savings this unit will provide by remote access to adjust temps.
5.0	Great! Just as advertised
5.0	I love that in a smaller space the 3 fan blades don't seem so busy. The blades are nicely finished and the painted antique look on the motor cover is well done too. I would recommend this fan for a stylish finish in any room.
5.0	I had no idea that the wise overlords of Amerika banned incandescent light bulbs until two weeks ago.<br /><br />My bright idea was to use LEDs  to save us money on the electric bill; and it did not hurt that area stores had instant $10 off coupons.  But after buying $180 worth of various LEDs, and trying them out, I chucked them because they hurt my eyes to look at.  I have young kids in the house and don't want them going blind because they look at LED bulbs.  Also, I could not stand to read my Bible or a novel under the LEDs.  We are extensive readers--reading for hours each day--and I just did not like the way the light reflected back from the pages of books to my eyes.  This caused me to Google LED effects on eyesight, and I found that some in Europe have already raised concerns about the effects of LED lights on eyesight.  Further research revealed to me that lighting only comprises 3-4% of an average electric bill.  3-4%!!  So I spent all this money on LED lights to save a buck or two a month?  Good riddance--I threw them out.  (As an aside, I never have and never will try CFLs because they pose risks to human health and the environment.)<br /><br />After chucking my LEDs, which I bought to replace my incandescents, I went back to the big box store to replace all my incandescents because I chucked them out to get LEDs.  That is when I discovered that the Republicrats and Demicans in DC banned them.  I panicked!  Thankfully, local stores still carry 40w and 60w, and good ole Amazon carries 75w and 100w.  Because I found out before the black market went into full force, I was able to stock up to ensure that I'll always have lighting that works, is pleasant, contains no toxins and, unlike LEDs, does not ravage the earth because its components are a dozen rare-earth materials.<br /><br />Lastly, where I live there are only two months of the entire year where it is considered a negative that light bulbs put off heat.  The other ten months of the year I welcome allthe &#34;wasted heat&#34; put off by incandescent light bulbs.
5.0	Tarp works great and is better quality and half the price they want at Walmart. If you need a large tarp, but this one.
5.0	These candles are wonderful.  They are not cheap in appearance and actually have the feel of a candle.
5.0	Super Bright! Maybe even too bright. We have 6 of these on a light fixture above the restroom sink. They are certainly bright enough for the grooming that takes place there and will even leave you a little dazed when you walk out to a normally lit area. They stay pretty cool and everyone I purchased work well.
5.0	I am glad there is a pack of adequate rollers available at a decent price for those of use with just a couple rooms to paint.
5.0	great price for such a nice light.
5.0	They work great the remote is nice and works well, the sticky back stuck to the cabinets well.  all is good. Oh ya I got them in 2 days
5.0	They are warm white and not the bright white of other LED lights.  Blend pretty well with other lights but still a little whiter. Overall happy.
5.0	Easy to install, quite long, seems durable and looks nice.
5.0	No ordinary thief will cut through this!<br />Its bigger, badder and heavier than I imagined. Weighs about 18 lbs.<br />This is a great chain so make sure your lock is just as good.
5.0	Exactly what I was looking for. I searched several stores around my city looking for these and no one is carrying them anymore. I was very happy to find them here.
5.0	Arrived as promised in its original packaging.
5.0	I bought this item to add ambient lighting under my entertainment/computer desk. The lights came with tons of screws and clips to attach the lights to anything. They were very simple to install and they look great. I have enough clips and screws left to install somewhere else in my house if I would like to move the lights around between the two.    They worked so great, I just bought the 6' ones to wrap around behind my wall mounted TV. These lights are perfect to make your entertainment room stand out, and the lights are simple to install.
5.0	Works great with Verde Z-Wave
5.0	Perfect fit. Great product!
5.0	I absolutely love thjs
5.0	It is amazing. Noise is so low I almost have a hard time hearing it when it is working. Really great product.
5.0	Worked great and immediately!!
5.0	Filters are great. I ordered the wrong size. After I made it the right size, (very carefully and precisely), it fits and works very well. Having the right size is way better & I recommend doing your homework before ordering.
5.0	Got exactly what I expected and they work great!!!  Great for strapping beach chairs and cooler to our beach cart.
5.0	excellent transaction great product
5.0	I bought these based off of someone else's review for being bright. I've purchased so many night lights over the years and they are all so dim. This one is pretty bright! I am impressed with how bright this light is and it has helped me as a path light for my hall stairs.
5.0	I used this glue to glue back the feet of a small decoration piece that my wife liked.  It worked just as advertised.  The bottle is very good, self sealing and opening.  Dispenses just the right amount of glue.  Easy tose and the glue holds tight!
5.0	nice light. works well.  I would buy additional lights as needed.
5.0	I purchased this outdated unit because of the low price. Instructions to install were easy to follow and it went well. I used a current sensor switch which was also easy to set up and the unit is doing very well. We were dealing with humidity levels as low as 21A% during winter months. We have set the humidistat at approximately 42-43 and it keeps humidity levels ranging from 38-41%. We are very happy with this system.
5.0	"I bought this bulb with the intention of using it in my basement which receives no natural light and is painted a dark color. Problem is, I spend a lot of time there working and the dark wall color turned out to be a very bad choice.  I was beginning to have a rack of lighting fixtures scattered all about the room in order to get the right color, lumens, etc. so that I could look at a computer screen for extended periods.  I was beginning to have problems with looking at the screen, but ONLY in that location.  I was fine in other locations, workplaces, offices, etc.  Anyways, with so many bulbs it wasnt safe, not to mention wasteful.  When I replaced like 4 or 5 \\""normal\\"" 60 or 120 watt bulbs with one of these ginormous ALZO bulbs it was nice--things got a little better.  This bulb puts out LOTS of light!  Its great :)  Everything about this bulb-YES!.  I'll be buying many more of these in the future."
5.0	So far so good. I have been using his for about a year now. To be fair, I wouldn't expect any problems in this short of a time.
5.0	Very beautiful......stuck well to wall.
5.0	Worked perfectly. Easy to install, but you need to refer to the youtube instructions, or you will miss the importance of first removing the grounding screw on the bottom. Great price on Amazon.
5.0	Good Product, Not much of it tho.
5.0	Needed this after I bought a brand new faucet for my bathroom. Old faucet was a 3/8&#34; inlet. The new one was a 5/8&#34; inlet, thus this adapter. So far no leaks and everything is well.<br /><br />Would buy again.
5.0	Very good, and very economical.....good buy
5.0	Installation was a breeze and fan works again. No need to replace the whole ceiling fan assembly unit on older Nutone model with integrated light fixture.<br />Power unit just pops right into the existing fixture. I would recommend to anyone, whose fan stopped working due to wear and tear.
5.0	Glad I ordered this with the sink.  Keeps things from scratching and allows me to drain clean dishes on one side of the sink.
5.0	Although this fixture is larger than I imagined it does measure in width as most chandeliers.  The colors are remarkable and more brilliant than shown in the pictures.  Pictures cannot do it justice.  Workmanship is outstanding.  A truly one of a kind piece of art.
5.0	EXCELLENT PRODUCT, GOOD PRICE, SUPER FAST SHIPPING THANKS AGAIN
5.0	It was great.  I'm glad to have a Dual smoke alarm.  This smoke detector is so easy to install, it took less than 5 minutes.  I recommend it for all your rooms.  It is well worth the price (it's should be more).  Thank you to the seller and I recommend this dual smoke detector for your family.      -EM, Family of six
5.0	This is the first time I have used sanding screens.  I am not just using them for drywall, but also some painted surfaces.  I didn't know if they would work well or not, but they are doing a good job.  They do get a little clogged with the paint, but keep the cleanup to a minimum.  I haven't used these as much, as the medium grit has worked really well and not left marks that would need fine sanding to remove.
5.0	A must have accessory for your safe.
5.0	"As John Belushi said in Blues Brothers \\""I see the light\\""! And what a bright, glare free light it is.  Perfectly illuminates my laptop and external keyboard. The design makes it an ease to raise or lower the light to the preferred level.  The sturdy aluminum construction arm is designed to pivot in, out, up and down with ease to get to just the right angle.  This lamp is ALL METAL, it is devoid of plastic which would be much more prone to  fatigue from bending back and forth.  I personally prefer the \\""daylight\\"" (5000 Kelvin) LEDs (\\""cool\\"") to the lower 2700 Kelvin (\\""warm\\"") lights. There are three brightness level adjustments, but I find the brightest to be the best. I don't need to dim the light and be romantic while I'm on the computer! This appears to be the brightest LED lamp on the market. Check Amazon and you will not find another one at 12 watts. If you can find this lamp, I would HIGHLY recommend it. However, I noticed that right after I purchased it, it became \\""unavailable\\"". Newegg also had it and similarly sold out. Can't vouch for other Oxyled products as a substitute because I don't own them. Good luck in your quest for the perfect desk lamp, I was lucky to find mine!  NOTE: I have been using this lamp for around one month.  As always, if something changes, I report back.<br /><br />April 20, 2014:  The light still works great, but I notice the specifications were changed to 4000K vs. the 5000K when I purchased it. The light will be a bit different than mine, but as long as the  design and construction build remained the same, it will still be an excellent product in my opinion.  However, once again , the availability of this item remains elusive.<br /><br />August 31, 2014: The light is still functioning great!  However, I noticed the price changed (increased) as did the description.  Perhaps it is \\""new and improved\\"", but more importantly, they eliminated the base.  This is regrettable if you want to place the lamp on the desk rather than clamp it.  The disclosure on not including the base is the very last line, so some people may miss it: \\""Note: this is a upgraded version without Base, and the former version has a base\\"". FYI.including the base is the very last line, so some people may miss it: \\""Note: this is a upgraded version without Base, and the former version has a base\\"". FYI."
5.0	I've had my command shower caddy for years- I love it, and it comes with me every time I move. The water resistant strips are great for hanging not only the Command caddies and hooks, but for almost any other flat-surfaced item! I've had several shower-corner shelves held up with these, even though the shelves weren't Command brand.    I've had my caddy up for 2 years on one set of these strips- loaded with full bottles of bath products, and never had the thing fall or even slip a little!!
5.0	We have an area of the house that is jungle-African themed (tigers, lions, etc). This switch plate matches the area perfectly.
5.0	I will use this remote to get my car out of the garage so I can go to events which protest the cruel and atrocious conduct I holding cetaceans in CAPTIVITY!
5.0	These have a very bright white color (which I expected) and come on instantly with no delay whatsoever. It was very easy to modify my existing fixtures and within 30 minutes I had all 4 bulbs installed. I removed the old ballasts and old unused wiring just to keep things tidy and probably would have saved 10 minutes if I'd left it in. They appear to be very well made and came packed very securely. I'd like to change out another 6-8 fixtures but will probably wait to see if the price comes down a bit though these do seem fairly priced compared to others on the market.    Update: 2/21/15: I just got done installing another 4 of these bulbs in a detached garage/workshop. They were just as easy to install and turned on instantly even though it was only 45 degrees in the shop. They replaced 32W, 5000K T8 bulbs and are noticeably brighter than those were. I'll be purchasing more.
5.0	I installed this in a slate countertop.  It looks fantastic.  It is slightly recessed into the countertop, so you need to cut a large oval hole that can be awkward.  However the skirt covers quite a bit so it does not have to be very accurate.  It is good that it doesn't sit too high above the counter.
5.0	This Lenox branded filter is in my furnace.<br />The media is fiberglass, not paper or plastic.<br />Filter does not rely on static electricity to<br />help clean the air, so it works, even on humid days.<br />I now have no indoor air alergies.<br /><br />I like my Bryant furnace.  I love my Honeywell thermostat.<br />And as for the Lenox brand filter, I have to say: Atta boy Dave!!
5.0	Excellent!  As advertised.  Delivered on time.
5.0	Absolutely love this item.  Glad we got the touchless.  It was worth the difference in cost.
5.0	When our original icemaker stopped working I did extensive trouble shooting to diagnose the problem. I ruled out that neither space aliens or zombies where the culprits in the failure. I started calling around to repair services and discovered where the space aliens and zombies where. So I decided to do the infamous, &#34;It's so easy you can't mess this up&#34; do it yourself repair. The price on this icemaker was half the going price from local shops. It arrived quickly and I was quickly able to install it and it performed as hoped for from the start. Of all the ice cubes we have ever had made in home icemakers, these are some of them.
5.0	I will try to make this short and sweet. While I think the Nest is an Engineering marvel of design, however it fails at the basics for what it is intended to do. A thermostat needs to deliver information to the user. The simplistic design of the Nest is beautiful to look at when its off but difficult to get useful information from. It is plagued with issues from waking up and variances in temperatures up to 6 degrees.<br /><br />This Honeywell on the other hand has a display that is constantly on (although dimmed when not using) that displays expected information for this type of device. It is one of the easiest installations I have done taking less than 10 minutes to install. I have no need for the schedules and was easily able to disable all these features allowing me total control of the device.<br /><br />The WiFi, website, and IOS apps were all easy to install and work flawlessly. The device is small, the build quality is excellent. The display is bright and clear and a pleasure to look at. As others have mentioned this device needs to be powered from the system so make sure you have the necessary control wire as you will require it for this device to function. If you are in the market for a remote controlled thermostat look no further, you will not be disappointed with this device.
5.0	Purchased these to light up a custom built desk with the lights beneath a a shelf overhead.  I used 3 strips of lights, each about 26&#34;.  They were powered with an existing 12v power supply (wall wart) that supplied enough current for the 3 strips.  I also added a switch and a cheap dimmer in case the lights need to be dimmed.  I soldered 18 gauge wire to each strip and ran them behind the desk, back behind the desk, they were joined to 14 gauge wire and run through the switch, dimmer and then to the power supply.  Very easy to install.
5.0	These are perfect velcro tie wraps. I've used a lot of different ones, and these are really ideal. They are just the right thickness, they are just the right length (I got 8&#34;) and they are a great price.
5.0	super nice sounding doorbell with nice sounds
5.0	Put it on the hall lamp, works great. Lamp stays lit only about 5 minutes; longer than you need, but saves tons of energy.
5.0	My daughter loves it. Great quality
5.0	The timer is a little hard to set, but the directions are adequate to get the job done. The nicest part is the tethered remote. It allows me to turn on/off the light without getting a flashlight to read the settings to make sure I put it back on 'auto' or some such process that my old timer required. Very happy with this purchase.
5.0	Great product. Nice high end quality and shipped quickly too.
5.0	This is the best wire ever. Speaker or power and ground. I will never buy another brand as long as knukonceptz is around.
5.0	The Nutone chime push works great. I am very happy with my purchase.
5.0	Now on my new white door, outstanding.
5.0	Excellent. I love it.<br /><br />High quality and with a great seal to conceal.<br /><br />Enough room for a few small items.<br /><br />The space is about the size of a regular Walgreen's pill bottle, give or take a few millimeters.
5.0	This is a good product that works like it's supposed to.
5.0	Product are exceptional, would recommend someone to buy.
5.0	This was the second unit from Schlage with a key pad. I love this product so much words cannot describe. My friend also purchased one too because it was just to convenient for her to pass up. Having to not ever worry about having a key brings joy to my life. I hated juggling keys in my hands when bringing in stuff from the car. It was such a drag. Now I don't ever have to bother with my keys I just punch in a code and I'm in. This is perfect for going out of town and having hassle free way of entry for dog sitters and friends who need to check up on your house. I installed this one on my back door and it is perfection. I am so pleased with this product and I believe that every home should come standard with one.
5.0	Compact, all-in-one unit covers essentially any country the vast majority of us will ever travel to.  And a USB plug too! Very fair price.
5.0	They looked a little different than the original I needed but the size was exactly right, they are a little brighter also. I highly recommend speaking with the company if you are in doubt, he was very helpful!
5.0	Fast shipping and exactly what I wanted.
5.0	While my home was being built, I decided to run wires for a security system (DIY). I started with some wire from Home Depot ... it did the job, but was really difficult to work with. It came rolled on a plastic spool, and was so rigid that it held the shape of the spool it came on causing it to tangle easily, making for difficult (and time-consuming) wire-pulling. When I underestimated the amount of cable I needed (and exhausted the inventory of every Home Depot in 15 sq. miles) I looked to Amazon ... I'm glad I did! Not only was this cable cheaper (by a long-shot), but it was MUCH easier to work with. The cable comes packaged in clear plastic sacks that facilitate pulling (just punch a hole in the center and pull your cable through) ... and the cable is much less prone to tangling. Saved me a ton of time and effort ... and a lot of money. This can not be over-stated: If you are in need of security cable, look no further ... this is the stuff you want!
5.0	Bright, beautiful pattern iis emitted by this light. I have only had it a week, but am happy thus far.
5.0	Bought a second one for my son's room
5.0	Love that I don't have to stretch to turn off light at night, couldn't find anything around home thatnwas a simple aand reasonably priced
5.0	Great lock!  Easy for my kids to use.  They loved that they could make up a word for the code, instead of remembering numbers.
5.0	Experienced one of these in a resort, and then when we got on the Norwegian Epic, there was one in the shower there. I decided to buy one and I LOVE IT!!  This is the best shower I have ever had.
5.0	Beautiful. These were perfect to light up our bar. Didn't heat up, remote worked well, dimmer was perfect.
5.0	I got the item fast. It was perfect. It is the second  time I have ordered this, I broke one before, I am very happy with the result!
5.0	No complaints- works great and was inexpensive, much less than buying on the Liftmaster website and it came in a weeks time
5.0	Met all expectations, was easy to apply and looks great
5.0	Very nice.  Arrived quickly.
5.0	It installed easily, didn't leak and flushes as designed.  I like the adjust-ability of the product to make it work in the old taller tanks.
5.0	The quality of this basket is way much better than the original which came with our sink. Also love the stainless steel look. Great product indeed.
5.0	I have been eyeing these lamps for a long time and finally bought one.  This is a steal for what they are going for in restoration hardware!  It was a fairly heavy box but not too bad to put together with the help of another person.  I move every year and this isn't the easiest thing to move but is definitely coming with me.
5.0	Works Great easy to install and extremely fast delivery
5.0	used these light inside above my kitchen and bath sinks, they are exactly what I wanted
5.0	This product was exactly what we needed but at a third of the cost. The item was boxed well and shipped in a decent amount of time. There were directions included and installation was as easy as stated. No problems with installation and item works fine. Additional ceramic wire nuts were included. Would buy from this vendor again.
5.0	You know when you think something is no good, and you by chance come across some info that tells you how you can save hundreds of dollars? Well this is that item.  Depending on your Microwave, all you may need is to fix the mylar cover. If you need to do that you can with this stuff.  You may need larger sheets depending, but this will do t he trick and save you from having to purchase a new microwave.  So all you college people, don't throw out those microwaves, just simply replace the sheet that covers the openin g inside it on the side or back side inside the box.  It most likely has gotten a hole in it from all those late night pizza pocket cook outs.  Grease is the number one culprit in burning holes with this little protector.  Good luck
5.0	I bought this to match my daughters Happi Tree collection and she just loves to look at it when we are changing her across the room or laying in her bed. It was easy to apply and even my 5 yr helped out. It stuck great. I did rip a couple of pieces but I dont think you can tell once I put the pieces together. instructions are small but otherwise <3 it!
5.0	I chose this item because it is all in 1.  While Sir sits on the throne he can read and evacuate the funk.  It was installed by my contractor (currently doing a bathroom remodel).  He had no complaints.  Its not as super quite as i would want.  But there does not appear to be to many that have the light and the right sones.  Have to compromise somewhere.
5.0	"This faucet looks nice and works well. I have been using it for about 1 1/2 months now. The only problem is that there is some water hammer. Also, I could not find specs for the faucet on Amazon. I went to the Peerless website to find out the heighth of the spout, and the information Peerless had for this model was wrong. The actual heighth of the spout is 11.5\\"" which seems to be pretty standard on newer model faucets. This was an issue for me because my old faucet was shorter and I had build a shelf above it."
5.0	System was easy to install. Instructions were excellent. Pumps works as advertised and there's hot water at the kitchen sink. I only wish I had done it sooner! One item to be aware of....make sure you have long enough connection hoses so unit can be placed in a convenient location.
5.0	I'm not saying I can measure it's effectiveness on filtering the air, but the numbers are there.<br /><br />I can say that it will measure out to more $$$ in my wallet.<br /><br />I have 4 dogs, so my filter clogs up a lot.  Ever since I got this one, I just run the vacuum cleaner hose over it to get the pet hair off.<br />It has a nice metal mesh covering the filter, so I'm not hurting the filter itself.<br /><br />And since I keep it clean, it's always running efficiently.
5.0	Shipping was super fast and the seller even helped me out with fixing my order after I messed it up by mistake .. And he even threw in a few other items for my baby's 6th bday.. This made me feel a lot better especially since something I ordered from someone else the same day did not go as plan .. Thanks a lot will but from this seller again
5.0	Looks great. Replaced original Closetmaid handles that were stripped. After installing, cabinets look upgraded vs. original.
5.0	Exactly as described, nice finish, matches my other hardware, good quality, heavy
5.0	Nice addition to my lamp , easy to use self explanatory , I'm hooked on amazon and so should you
5.0	I ordered this bidet cause me and wifey were fed up of using harsh toilet papers. We have used it for about a week now and it is pretty awesome ! It makes the entire cleaning process very hygienic and hassle free. The installation is pretty easy and quick - took me not more than a half hour with just the basic tool kit.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this product, as a matter of fact I had ordered the first one as a trial - we liked it enough for me to order another for the 2nd bathroom.
5.0	Over the course of building an ipe deck, the Ipe Clip kit came with some plugs, but not enough.  I re-ordered some from the same place I got the Ipe Clips from, but needed a few extras, so I ordered 20 of these through amazon.  I wish all the plugs I used were these.  Like the picture shows, they are rounded on one end which makes inserting them in the hole much easier.  These plugs are better than the Ipe Clip brand plugs.
5.0	I'm a longarm quilter which means I stand at my machine all day.  I've recently been having problems with pain in my knees and ankles after standing for a few hours.  After consulting with other quilters, a saddle stool was highly recommended.  It works great.  I now can sit and work for hours without any pain.  The stool is completely adjustable, so I can change the angle of the seat, the height, and the position of the footrest.  No more pain, and I can work longer hours and get more accomplished.<br /><br />The stool was delivered very quickly and went together easily without any fancy tools.<br /><br />A great purchase!!
5.0	I used this on two sidelight windows at my front door and it worked like a charm. Installation is the same as you have from other decorative window films I've purchased from Home Depot or Lowe's. At night, as long as the front porch light is on, no one can see inside but I can still see out, which is perfect. During the day the mirrored reflection is great too.<br /><br />I have a set of french/patio doors off my kitchen that I plan to do next.
5.0	Excellent product, I work in air conditioning and electricity in general, has been a useful aherramienta, had tried to obtain this tool until I could get it through Amazon, great attention by the seller and AMAZON, I recommend this tool for technicians. Excellent .....
5.0	beautiful and worth buying.  the quality is excellent and the star with it's punched holes gives a great light effect
5.0	Product works as advertised.  Gives a range of how hard your water is.  It works best if water is very soft and loses accuracy if your water is harder.
5.0	This filter does everything the glowing reviews had me hoping for. I just bought an older home with original galvanized pipes, and after years of using a water softener in my previous home, my first few showers here were miserable. My hair was dull--actually felt dirty--and after it dried, I could do nothing with it. I was even self conscious about my boyfriend touching it. It just didn't feel or look clean and soft like usual. Expensive conditioners didn't help. They just made it feel heavier.<br /><br />The first shower with this filter installed felt better, and my hair definitely improved right away. After a week of showering with it, my hair is just as soft and shiny as it ever was using softened water.<br /><br />Beyond this, the unit is incredibly solid and well built. I'm confident it will far outlast the new showerhead I bought.<br /><br />One tip: I had a plumber replace my shower arm to better accommodate this filter. The one I had previously was long, extending several inches away from the wall and down. Adding this filter did put the whole assembly too low for me and awkwardly too far forward into the shower space. The new shower arm is quite short, so my shower head is now perfectly positioned, even with this unit in the assembly. Well worth the trouble, as I think I'll be showering with this filter for some time to come.
5.0	Mom loved them. My mom loves candles. My step dad hates fire. It looked like they were doomed until I saw these.
5.0	As described, fast delivery.
5.0	Read about leaks.  Mine did very slightly between water input and filter housing.  Noticing the washer in question seemed to be fiber, I thought after it absorbed some water it would expand and stop leaking.  No leaks since I've been using it'
5.0	So sorry for this review being so late.  Product came on time ever and was an exact fit.  It was as described.
5.0	It was sent on time, packaged securely, very bright, and works excellent.
5.0	This is exactly what we needed for our roof replacement project.  It was about half the expense as what Home Depot had to offer.  Very pleased.
5.0	What can be said when it is an item you have to have?  Of course you still get fluoride through bathing but the taste and quality of the water makes this a must.  Until you get your town board to de-fluoridate this is your only option because it takes out the toxic derivative of fluoride that is a byproduct of Chinese mining.
5.0	Excellent Quality, Bigger than i expected.  We used it in our bathroom and it looks fantastic against our Tiffany blue walls.
5.0	I HAD USED THEM BEFORE AND COULD NOT FIND UNTIL SOMEONE TOLD ME TO LOOK ON AMAZON.  YOU WILL LOVE THEM
5.0	Great little safe. It fits in a bed side table and looks great. Very worth the money!!
5.0	Very stylish. Touch dimmer works great. Throws a lot of light with flexible goose neck. Would definitely purchase another.
5.0	Not installed yet. I have used Toto soft close toilet seats in the past and have two installed now. The remodeled bathroom will get this one.
5.0	Very nice product. I inspected it thoroughly: takes 0.25A what is 30W, as specified. It is bright, I did not measure the brightness but visually comparing to other bulbs it is a solid 2000 lm, close to 2 x100W bulbs. I have disassembled it, nothing loose inside, nice seals around glass, cable hole sealed,  seems to be very well water proof.  Very solid aluminum body. I just got it so I do not know how long it will last but the first impression is very positive. For the price you cannot find anything better. I will order another one.
5.0	I've been using this for a few years now.  It definitely keeps your disposal fresh smelling when it starts to get a bit stinky (if you know what I mean?)<br /><br />Very easy to use also.  Stick the bag in your disposer and turn on the water and turn on your disposer.  Just a matter of seconds. And watching the blue foam come up is fun. :)
5.0	This was so easy and quick to use! I was able to do all my kitchen counters in just a couple of hours.  Highly recommend!
5.0	Well constructed and sturdy, lamp has excellent color and brightness great for reading.
5.0	I have had this for about two years now. It is invaluable for keeping track of which items in my house use the most energy. About the only thing I would change on this, is i wish it was back lit somehow to make viewing in dim areas easier. Overall though no issues and highly recommended.
5.0	Delivery was as expected.  Will look great in my son's room!  Go Cards!
5.0	Very easy to install and use.  Surprizingly strong spray.  Great for a really fresh, clean feeling.  Self cleaning nozzle fearture a BIG plus.  If you don't have room in an older home with baths not spaced for a serparate Bidet, this is the best alternative, in fact, for both expense and convenience, a better alternative.  Very reliable and nearly maintenace free.
5.0	Good orange glow.  Perfect for Halloween.  A little pricey for a bulb, though.
5.0	This thing is cool on so many levels.  The colors are bright and defined, the transitions are really nice (except for strobe... don't really know what it does), and one remote can control every light!  I'm thoroughly enjoying mine thus far though I have no idea how long it will last.  I'll try to remember to add a comment when that happens.
5.0	Exactly what I was looking for
5.0	Was very pleased to receive this box of bulbs. I have many candles that use them,and at times they are hard to find where I live, or are very expensive to purchase .
5.0	its work, but not really exact fit.  The plug connector  is kind of difference size. You have to spread to fit.
5.0	amazing price and fabulous product - we clean tile and grout often as we work at vacation rentals!  buy this on Amazon!
5.0	Great product abd shipper.
5.0	Needed a way to talk to husband in kennel building.  This works just great.
5.0	Good water filter. What I like is that you can change the filter and not water runs out the process. Also, the time of use is relatively long.
5.0	This is just what you'd expect if looking for a standard white cover for two switches and a outlet cover. Purchased on Amazon.com, because the local hardware stores didn't have.<br /><br />Price is on par with what the hardware store would likely charge, But delivered right to my front door!
5.0	Works great, looks great, easy to install. Shipped quickly and was in one piece when it arrived. Good product!
5.0	I was very surprised with this purchase. Very high quality and super low price. Great quality. 100% recommended. Thank you so much.
5.0	These are a perfect size to use on luggage or backpacks. Holds up good with repeated use and lives up to the master lock name
5.0	Last year the Whirlpool drier in my wife's office stopped working. Seeing it was an easy, and more importantly quick, fix I repaired it myself having sourced the heater part from a local shop as I try to support local businesses when I can. Fast forward less than a year and it broke again. Heater element failed again. So, after reading reviews here I bought one without leaving my chair. Amazon was the seller and Prime shipping was available. I was surprised to see it was in a box saying it was a Whirlpool part. Anyway replaced the heater and time will tell if it lasts as long as the original part which went over 5 years.
5.0	Man this thing is the cat's meow for your front porch light (it is pushed for security type light control, as it can turn your indoor lights on and off at different times on different days to make the house look occupied...but I don't use it that way). Is very simple to install (if you  are capable of changing out a simple light switch, you can install this just as easily - but you will need to purchase a new cover plate).<br /><br />The programming is super easy.  The testing however is more difficult. I had to sit out on the porch with a glass of wine for a while just to be sure it was coming on at the correct time. If it had needed adjusting, I might have gotten a second glass out of the deal, but it worked just fine at the right time, the first time.<br /><br />But just to be sure I repeated the process the following evening. :0)<br /><br />Seriously this is a great product and it looks great too!  I am buying another for the back yard light.
5.0	i received this as a gift, & i'm very happy with it. it was easy to install compact size, highly recommended.
5.0	It says auto paint, but don't expect to buy 6 cans and give you car a new paint job.  Has the nice sprayer, what else can I say other than the paint is still white and the metal, outdoors NE USA 365 days per year.  Based on purchase date, very good.<br />YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR
5.0	It's the first time I bought a lamp for my desk.<br />I didn't know which one to pick since Amazon has a lot of great options but this one was cheap and looked fine.<br />The overall stability is better than the old one this one is replacing. I can orient the light in almost any direction without problems. Its 12&#34; flexible neck is very solid but easy to move.<br />You have to get used to the on/off switch. I spent about 5 min trying to press &#34;the button&#34; before realizing you have to turn it.<br /><br />This one takes 60 W max E26 bulbs (the common ones), but I am using it with a 14 W CFL (900 lm) that I also bought here in Amazon (it was one of the suggested things that other users bought together with this lamp). I also tried to use a 65 W halogen lamp but it's too bright (1519 lm) for a desktop lamp. Moreover the lamp itself got quite hot after just a few minutes.<br /><br />I suggest to use it with &#34;Warm light bulbs&#34; (2700 K to 4000 K) since it doesn't produce the glare on the white pages of your notebook that is typical of the daily-light bulbs (6500 K or around this &#34;color temperature&#34;)
5.0	I purchased the Opteka EF-600 DG Super flash as a secondary for my Sigma EF-500 Super and after a week of use, I can honestly say the Opteka has performed up to the or better than the Sigma. Impressive battery life and short recycle time. Very versatile.. The best valued flash on the market.
5.0	works great. Lights are much brighter than I expected. Perfect to put over door when you can't find the key hole in the dark.
5.0	These are excellent quality locks for your luggage. They come in a nice package with easy to follow instructions on the back.  The locks feel very solid and it’s very easy to turn the dials and set your own combination. I like that they are TSA accepted, which means they won’t get cut off and if the little red pole is raised, you’ll know that TSA went through your Luggage. They are the perfect size – easily slipped through the zipper pulls on my suitcase. You never know when your plane might get delayed and your bags are out waiting for you. Great, inexpensive theft prevention.
5.0	This is an exact replacement for the factory unit, same numbers on the motor as the one I took out. Easy replacement just renove a few screws. Great price, fast delivery Thanks  Amazon you are the best for someone who lives outside a small town.
5.0	Look & behave like normal bulbs
5.0	Fantastic Colors and Price. Made in England, Great Markers
5.0	fantastic-perfect fit- right color
5.0	With the tape attached, it is a cinch to to apply a protective border prior to taping. The tape has not damaged any of the surfaces I have taped.  So far, I have used it to tape of moldings and also some sections of cabintry.  Easy application and easy removal
5.0	This garage vacuum is everything it claims to be and more.  It mounted very easily in our 50 x 30 two story shop.  We put it in the center and there is plenty of hose to reach to both ends and to reach upstairs. Even with that long hose, it has lots of power to pick up dust and scraps. The attachments are very sturdy and there are attachments for all your needs.  We are extremely happy with this product.
5.0	Came with plenty of wire and chain, it looks great in the arbor over our pathway gate. I used a 2.5w LED bulb with standard base.  Very attractive indirect soft light that's completely &#34;dark sky&#34; with no direct view of the bulb or glare thanks to depth of this fixture.  The shade is fairly heavy and solid, quality feel (not thin or easily dented
5.0	works well. wish bracket was metal but will fab one when this one breaks, pretty simple other than that. buy it !!
5.0	.I need vent register filters in my bedroom because of asthma.  I've noticed less dust, for sure.  When I changed the filter, after about a month,  I was surprised at the amount of dust that had collected on the filter.  I wish they were a little thinner because, unfortunately, they also allow less heat to enter the room.  The instructions caution not to use on all registers in your home for just this reason.
5.0	good product quick delivery
5.0	Fast Shipping, great price
5.0	I use one side for the hand towel and the other side for an extra roll of toilet paper.  Looks cool and everyone loves it!
5.0	Easy to install and look great.  High quality product.
5.0	This seat is just what it needed  fit perfectly very comfortable would highly recommend this seat to anyone needing this type of seat
5.0	Nicely made handles. My hand fits under the arch and doesn't feel pinched.
5.0	Product is better than I expected considering the price. Looks more expensive. Would purchase again amd recommend to others as well.
5.0	Perfect, This really does help keep your veggies and Fridge fresh longer.  I have noticed that it keeps things for just under 2 weeks, that's a money saver.
5.0	This is the best garbage disposal that we have ever owned! It works beautifully and is so much quieter than any previous garbage disposal. My husband installed it and he said that the instructions were clear and it took no time at all to install it. Everything you need to install the garbage disposal, including a beautiful stainless steel sink stopper, is in the box except the InSinkErator CRD-00 Power Cord Kit. We purchased it so that my husband could hook up the electrical system.
5.0	This night light is the perfect addition to our beach themed bathroom, and it shines quite bright and is not too large. Thank you for quick shipping.
5.0	I have used MagLite flashlights of various sizes for 15 years and always found them to be very well-made, durable and dependable.  I also have a 5 watt Surefire flashlight and a 1 watt LED flashlight that is similar in design to the Mini-Maglite.  I have also used a MiniMaglite LED upgrade module (not made by MagLite) - which did not perform to my expectations. <br /> <br />I recently purchased the 3 watt LED Mini-Maglite and am very impressed with it.  It is very bright - at least 3x as bright as the 1 watt MiniMag clone that I have.  It is not as bright as my 5 watt Surefire tactical flashlight, but I wouldn't want it to be.  3 watts is great for a general purpose flashlight.  In short, the Mini-Maglite LED has exceeded my expectations. <br /> <br />The only negative that I have is that it took so long for MagLite to make their LED flashlights available.  Other LED flashlights have been available for several years and it was beginning to look like MagLite wasn't going to develop any LED products - I'm glad they did because this is a great little flashlight.
5.0	No problems so far. Ive done everything but tried to talk on it
5.0	Would be hard to miss the warnings about moisture. They may have added because of other reviews. Very happy with the box.
5.0	was deliver on time, the instructions was really easy to install, great product. i match the products that i have at home.
5.0	Ordering online makes my life easier, now I don't have to go to the department store every few months.  Plus when you buy a package of certain quantity you save!  It's the original requiered by the manufacturer of the fridge so it works great too.
5.0	These lamps are so beautiful. They do look exactly like the picture. However, they are hard to install, and the directions are not helpful. Luckily, I had an uncle visit from Fl the week I rece them and he was able to hang them for me. I really do love these lamps so much. And, they are great for reading in bed as they move every which way. I hope you enjoy them as much as I do!
5.0	Just exactly what I needed! I will definetly be purchasing more of these!<br />The price is very good also, in comparing with others that sell this item.
5.0	Exactly what I wanted!!
5.0	Solved our problem of the screen door staying closed.  Before the wind would pull it open then shut over and over.
5.0	Love it, it is very bright and the clip is strong without being destructive to the book.  I want another one to keep in my travel bag. Highly recommended.
5.0	Wish i bought two. Range is awesome.
5.0	Does the job!  Excellent light for a tight space.
5.0	Very nice product.  Took a little time to know how to program, save the instructions.  But once it is done it works like a charm every day.  Now our pet is not in dark during short winter days.
5.0	Sent this to my son for his home which has a wood-burning stove as its ony heat source.  Thought this was a necessity.
5.0	Great desk lamp. It's portable and out of the way. Put it over any table you need some light over and your set. No complaints here. The rooms of my house change in range of lighting so the dimmer helps out a lot. It adapts to any room in my house.
5.0	Exactly what I expected and I received the item several days before the expected date.
5.0	Practically indistinguishable from an incandescent, especially in a sconce or something that covers the bulb. Also dims well, though not quite as well as incandescent.
5.0	Sbsolutely incredible value. Nothing better for the price just about perfect. Cup seems a bit hard and possibly fragile but just treat it right and it will be fine
5.0	This solved my gutter clogging problem completely. Even in a fairly heavy down pour my gutters do not overflow anymore. Debris just blows off with a gust of wind. I got rid of of my pine trees so I don't have any pine needles to worry about. I do have gummy balls, helicopter seeds, and various leaves that do not get into the gutter brushes. This stuff really works.
5.0	No more wax seals for me ever! This sticks to the bottom of toilet and makes removing the toilet very easy because it stays attatched to the toilet. If you need to replace the floor or add tile to your bathroom additional height is not a problem since the rubber fits inside the pipe and can't leak when fully seated the flange is slightly compressed and flexes to provide a tight seal.
5.0	I use these Grip-Rite screws for all kinds of things and they are very hard to strip the heads..... Danny Ramaviglia.
5.0	Part worked well and less expensive than other vendors
5.0	I live in a motorhome in a motorhome park.  My water heater is 6 gallons, which is typical for a motorhome.  For years, I've put up with a lousy shower head that would use up all the hot water while not giving me a very satisfying shower.  I purchased this shower head at my local Ace Hardware, hoping for a better spray without limiting my time with hot water.  (I had to get an adapter to fit this to my smaller sized plumbing.)  This is great!  Wonderful spray, plenty of pressure for washing my hair and rinsing fast.  I never have to worry about running out of hot water.  I could take a longer shower if I used the trickle button, but I'm used to taking quick showers-- 6-7 minutes.  I love it, wish I'd bought one a long time ago!  Green, shmeen-- I just want a great shower, and this does it!
5.0	"Good quality for a low price. Classic Accents provided excellent service. Initially, they sent the wrong finish but quickly corrected the error. And I was able to keep both finishes. As another reviewer noted, the provided screws are too long for standard 3/4\\"" doors; I simply snipped the ends off to the needed length."
5.0	Two things were important to me:  I wanted it to snap shut securely, and I wanted the magnet strength to be very strong and solid.  This item does both.  When sliding the door open, it can't come off, it has a stop in it that only allows it to slide open, but not fall off.  I found a place under my vehicle that has a metal wall in the way, so even if it did come open, it would immediately hit that &#34;wall&#34; and the key would stay inside.  The door snaps closed securely.  It is made of plastic, not metal.  I imagine it would be even more secure if it were made of metal, but this will definitely do the job.  The plastic is strong plastic.  Also, I bought this after buying the $2 one at walmart.  My car key was too big for that one and the two little magnets on the back I doubt would hold anyway.  I would be in constant fear of it falling off when I hit a bump or drove through water.  This one by Master Lock has one large magnet on the back (not the entire back of it, but pretty big nonetheless).  I will come back and update my review if this thing falls off over time.  I can't imagine how it would.  It is super strong.  I would be VERY surprised if this thing came off.  Excellent product.
5.0	This item saved me lots of work and hard labor. It took less than 2 minutes to install and it works better than the original one that came with the bathroom faucet it opens and closes with very smooth action.overall I recommend it to anyone that needs it.
5.0	Works  well on tape removal.
5.0	Beautiful, sturdy and easier to install (and uninstall) than other brands.  The only thing that I don't like is the spray pattern.  It is a wide straight line that splatters too much.  I would prefer a controlled circle.
5.0	These were everything I thought & really made the rooms look polished! I'd been looking around & pricing these for some time now & was thrilled when I found such a great deal on these! They all worked perfect & were defect free!
5.0	Had just updated my faucet and sink in the main bathroom with oiled bronze fixtures.  Unfortunately, this left my plastic faux-chrome toilet handle sticking out like a sore thumb.  The Plumbest fit the bill very well in matching with the other fixtures (such as my new lighting) and seems to be very well made with brass lever replacing the bendy plastic one on the previous handle.  So far so good!  Great value for the price, as well.
5.0	Fantastic value!  Firs perfectly in my Kenmore Elite and can't wait to check out how long it lasts.
5.0	purchased this two yrs ago and still works hard on the farm
5.0	I put this decal over my bed and looks amazing. Just the little things can make a  difference in a room.
5.0	I Installed two of thes closers at my cust location.....Its a great replacement  and great adjustments its a plug and playor plug and close HA-HA
5.0	I like it I got it today March 13th 2015
5.0	Easy to use, High quality materials. I used a Dremel cutter do make the cuts as a saw prooved to be impractical. I used a better set of drywall anchor than the ones that came with it. If you use the ones provided use a drill to pre-drill a small hole to get the anchor started. We put two coats of paint on it and it matches the wall perfectly. It currently fits the power and HDMI but there is room for 1-2 more cords if needed. Definitely would recommend.
5.0	Because I was pleased ,and my friends liked my decoration on them,I want order more, of those 6&#34; wood clothespin.
5.0	Perfect fit. Super easy to use.
5.0	This handle was very easy to put on,having no problems now.
5.0	The sprayer came well boxed and protected.  After reading the enclosed owners manual, I went to the workshop and sprayed my latest project.  I am not new to spraying furniture, but I am with this type of HVLP system.  I found it to be very well made and easy to setup.  It took me about 3 tries to get the spray/volume mix correct, but once I had that done, the rest came easy.  I was really surprised too see how little overspray and mist was in the air as compared to my compressor type setup.  If all my projects turn out this well, I will be a very happy camper.  I would recommend this sprayer too anyone who is tired of all that overspray and misting.  Give this Fuji sprayer a try, you won't be sorry.  And to me it really doesn't break the bank to get this kind of a quality product.
5.0	Awesome service and easy setup!!!
5.0	I was in the market to replace metal half-hook shower rings that were dreadful. That awful screeching sound, the metal on metal rusting from the shower moisture, and constantly halving the half-hook shape flung from the shower rod to the floor whenever the curtain was drawn. NEVER AGAIN! These plastic full rings are great. No horrible sound, a nice solid locking process that keeps them securely on the shower rod and no rust! Just what I needed.
5.0	i have been very pleased with all of their products, i would highly recommend them
5.0	Gives excellent light - love this product.
5.0	Glad I found these.  Replacing halogens with LEDs in sconces.  Works well.
5.0	Adorable for a child's room.
5.0	We purchased this to show our Luminaria Slideshow during our local Relay for Life. Much cheaper than an actual projection screen this size and displayed the images beautifully.
5.0	I am using this to give paper projects a nice glossy shine. Works very well.
5.0	Finally, a candelabra LED bulb that has some brightness to it.  A great way to reduce electricity costs and as a side benefit reduces heat in the light fixture.
5.0	Very good product for what I used it for. My kitchen has a double pass through sliding window with outside counter that is about 18&#34; by 8ft. When I replaced the laminate countertops in the kitchen the granite I selected did not have enough in the piece of rock to do the countertops plus the pass through. I didn't want to spend another $1200 for a piece of granite. With this kit and the order of a few additional colors I was able to do the pass through fairly close to the countertop granite. I would heartily recommend that you use Helmsman Spar exterior polyurethane varnish satin brushed on for sealing coats if you want exceptional durability and nice finish. I tried the sealer they sent with the kit on a sample board and I felt the result was substandard. Easily scratched and finish not as smooth. The Helmsman product fully cures in 30 days to a very tough finish. I am not sure I would use this for a kitchen countertop with large areas. It would be difficult I think to have a nice even result.
5.0	i kept finding myself locked out of door from my backyard into my garage, without my keys on me.  this way i can easily get into that door anytime i want, keys or no keys, to access all my lawn care and garden tools.  i am very happy with this keypad lock and the ease and convenience.  no more getting frustrated at being continually locked out again!
5.0	This was exactly what we were looking for to put on the front door of our new vacation beach home.  Very high quality and the packaging was excellent.  Would definitely recommend!
5.0	The filter I needed with very good package and it arrived earlier than expected. Very satisfied with this purchase. Thank you!
5.0	Great investment at a great price.  Fast shipping.  We love it!
5.0	Better than I expected. Good quality and VERY quiet.
5.0	I am using it to lube the slide outs in an RV. It works. In my experience dry lubes don't last as long as oil based lubes. So they do require regular applications depending upon the usage, climate etc. However they don't attract dirt and make a mess.
5.0	Nice plunger for sink and shower with drain in center.  Not meant for toilets!
5.0	This worked out very well in my Entertainment room.  Good quality and it was exactly what I was looking for.  Installing this gave me access to the cables I was running behind my wall while looking tasteful.
5.0	This is a great mailbox, nice study plastic, made by Rubbermaid. It seems a bit larger than the standard mailbox I have been using. We had it together and out by the road in less than ten minutes. Would recommend.
5.0	The Little giant pump showed up on time and after a month it's been running fine. The one it replaced, also a Little Giant worked fine for ten years. Very Good value
5.0	The product I received was exactly the right item it was very easy to install and it works great. I am pleased with my purchase
5.0	Love this vanity. However I it is deeper then a normal vanity. The drawers and cabinets are odd shaped beware of this as well Otherwise great piece!
5.0	"For a \\""low flow\\"" shower head, the performance of this merchandise leaves nothing to be desired. I will mention, even concur with previous posts, if you want a shower head that delivers water with \\""piercing force\\"".. well this is not the shower head for you. On the other hand, if you imagine yourself to be a conservationist, or simply a more conscientious, lowering your water use/expense user, then cheer on! Our (my family's) primary need for this type of set-up was to deliver stand-up showers to toddler sized kids (parent assisted of course), and that function receives an A++. Other use from adult perspectives, a very comfortable shower with surprisingly sufficient delivery of water for a \\""low\\"" flow. Also to mention, multiple setting, (all of three..) so if one desires 16+ settings to take one shower, again this one is not for you. The one fall back is, this shower head can be easily \\""out of reach\\"" if height challenged, and not a six footer like me-self. Nonetheless, excellent buy!!"
5.0	Product competitively priced, great quality just as promised. Will order from them again when need arises.
5.0	they were happy so I'm happy with it as well........ recommending this product its legit and exactly what u expect
5.0	"This is the identical item that is at my local big orange box store but about 1/5th the price.  Under the laminate flooring it gives a cushion and seems comparable to the foam rolls you see typically.  There is a little self adhesive strip that allows you to attach adjoining rows and keep the waterproofing properties.  This works OK but the \\""overlap strip\\"" (the wide red stripe on one end) is a bit flimsy and wrinkles up as you install the flooring, making it a bit tedious.  This appears to be small styrofoam beads sandwiched between sheets of plastic.  I don't know how it will compress over time but the documentation states that it will return to its shape and will not crush.  Seems a little hard to believe... That being said, it does give adequate soundproofing for the floor and is pretty quick to install overall.  A good value."
5.0	A little pricey but I love it! I found I could get about an inch of separation from the magnet and still work. I use Velcro tabs (from Amazon) for the main unit. You can just leave it mounted and pry open the cover to change the single AA battery but I'd rather just remove it first.  Right now it's linked to an LED Insteon light.  The unit does have an external sensor terminal. Exterior of case has a 'set button' which can also toggle the mounted unit on and off regardless of magnet position. A status led blinks on opens and closures then goes out. Only one AA battery powers the unit.<br /><br />Using Houselinc program you just drag and drop to link to devices and not need the computer (once linked) or use the computer program and make Insteon 'Actions'.<br /><br />If they were a little cheaper I'd buy a truckload.<br />Happy with item.<br />UPDATE: 3 years later and they still work fine!
5.0	Works great - no noise. Hope it lasts.
5.0	Looks great on the boat and emits a lot of light at night. Made well.
5.0	Great product worked well with charging iphone and ipad while in Ireland FYI travelers to Ireland or uk you need this not just an adapter.
5.0	This are much better than I was expecting. I first bought them because I needed a bunch of cheap zip ties for a project but these are really nice. They are tough but still easy to use.
5.0	Super cute, and stays stuck!
5.0	I own this book light in two sizes - original and paperback - and love them both.  The light is very bright and focuses only on your book so that it doesn't disturb anyone else who might be trying to drive or sleep nearby.  Everyone loves it so much that I've stared giving them as gifts.   The one caution I will offer is that it scratches very easily (though the scratches do not impact the functionality of the light).  I recommend purchasing the accompanying soft case to protect your book light.
5.0	Very good price and arrived in timely manner
5.0	Replaced all my crappy CFL's. Color of the lights is definitely white and not the normal yellowish you would get from older style lights. Replaced all the bulbs in our small chandelier over our dinner table and it's almost too bright now!
5.0	After visiting my sister's new condo with it's souped-up shower (3 nozzles on the wall along with an overhead??!?), I was looking for a quick upgrade for our rental.  Yea, I rent, so I'm not about to go pouring money into a shower I'm probably not going to ever see again next year.  My HGTV-minded half says changing a showerhead is quick, easy, and adds a touch of luxury with low overhead (pun intended?).  When i move out, i can just unscrew it and take it with me.  Easy PEasy.<br /><br />This isn't the most luxurious of shower heads. It's plastic painted like chrome. The hose is pretty standard as showers go. The easy screw-this-into-the-existing-install has it looking a little bulky in a shower.<br /><br />For me, the important thing is that it works.  I did look around to find one that explicitly states you can have water coming from both heads at once, and this one does so nicely.  There's is a noticeable reduction in pressure with both on as opposed to just one or the other.  I think our house must have less pressure than some of the other reviewers'; i wouldn't mind a little more pressure from having both heads on.  The massage settings pretty pathetic when you have water coming from both. I do notice the hot water runs out from our tank, but it's been pretty cold here so i'm not sure if we're taking longer hotter showers, or this thing is spitting out tons of water.<br /><br />There's a toggle on the side that switches from the main shower head to the hose attached head, to both heads.  There are no labels on indicators, but it's pretty easy to switch back and forth and figure it out.  One thing to note here: if you start your shower with one shower head and decide &#34;oh, i feel like having the other one on (or both)&#34;, you'll want to stand back a bit when switching.  There's probably 60 inches of cold water sitting in that hose ready to ice you.<br /><br />Another nice thought, the actual shower heads themselves use standard fittings, so you can replace them with nicer ones.  I've set it up with a really wide shower head on the attached part and the hose running around the side of the shower (held by suction cups) so the other shower head hits from the other end of the shower.  60 inches isn't enough to go to the far wall, but good separation.  I guess you could attach a longer hose, too.<br /><br />I don't have a lot of hair, so i can't comment definitively on that.  I think it would do, though.them with nicer ones.

5.0	Only buy the original Maytag filter like this one. More money than the others but 10 times better water.
5.0	I purchased this item at a great price, I wish I had bought 2 more. It was easy to program additional user codes and is easy to operate. This will save time and also allow access to the house with out passing out keys.
5.0	OEM part shipped quickly.  No issues.
5.0	My parents are cave dwellers. Well, they were. I have been trying to figure out a way to brighten up their living room for years. The ceiling light didn't cut it, even the addition of a lamp failed me.<br /><br />When I was offered this led strip for a review in accepted, defeated in moral I figured that this would be another failed attempt to brighten the room... But I figured why not.<br /><br />I talk a lot so ill let my four year old  sum it up here then go back to detail : &#34;I can see the ceiling!&#34;<br /><br />The above was an unprovoked and instant response after he walked into the renovated room for the first time.<br /><br />The strip is bright! Clear cool white (6000k) was the key to success. Shame on me, and led manager and advocate for not thinking sooner. I always thought 5000k+ was for commercial applications, boy was I wrong.<br /><br />I decided to run the majority  of this strip facing  upwards on top of their wall unit. I cut the strip into three pieces and secured them together with solder.<br /><br />There are copper cut points but the soldering iron I had was from the 70's and could barely warm a peice of chocolate. With that being said I cut at the solder points and connected from there. There are less solder points than cut points so if you plan to dice this up,  male sure to invest in a decent iron.<br /><br />I wired two strips in sequence and a third behind the tv. Sequence one and two met at the power supply.<br /><br />Be sure to get the proper power supply! I'm using a $15 20w model that I found on Amazon.<br /><br />I try to upgrade or change at least one thing everytime I'm home. This has without a doubt been one of the most significant in years. You will be amazed at how clear the color is and how much it makes colors pop. See the picture of my nephew and the knex pieces as a reference.<br /><br />From the initial email to the final piece of electrical tape this was truly a five star experience. I highly recommend this for a fun home project. It will take some basic wiring knowledge and be sure to have shrink tube or electrical tape to secure your connections.<br /><br />Product provided for fair and unbiased review.

5.0	I must say I was very impressed with Vasari products, they delivered everything they promised, especially the quality level of this product, I must say to all venetian plaster artist out there this has to be the best product and bang for the buck, you can't beat it, and I you have any questions there staff was always there to answer them. Give them a try, you will see😜👌👍
5.0	Screen fits door perfectly. Installation was super easy. It comes with super sticky velcro strip which mounts around the door frame after which the screen is attached to. Also comes with push pins which you can use for extra stability after the screen is installed. Magnets work well with shutting the screen after its opened.
5.0	it was the right part and it was cheaper than anywhere else by at least $30 after I searched the internet and local sources
5.0	It's great for my headaches(the red colour), my sister ordered one for the same problem, and I gave one to my friend who loves it very much. Just wish there was a timer on it, then it will be the perfect product! Will be great for Christmas.
5.0	They are extremely bright. Used on a 4 foot shop light for my laundry room. Only 3 4 foot sections where used for this and they are brighter than the old flouresents. Only issue I have is they aren't as warm colored as the picture but that is no problem since it looks better than the old lights.
5.0	Great. I replaced the incandescent bulbs. The brightness is the same as before. I am not sure those are 25 or 40W.
5.0	This decal is over my sink on my newly tiled backsplash.  It is a good size and sticks great to tile, no complaints at all! We've received many compliments on it.
5.0	Our dryer quit working and after being told it would be well over $150 to get this part installed for us it was nice to find this on amazon for a MUCH lower price and the install was VERY easy to do on our own. I'm so glad we bought this, after a quick 20 minute install our dryer is working like new :)
5.0	I used to buy similar product from Home Depot, these are cheaper and do the job just fine. NO issues, provides great lighting and I will use these bulbs again when the time comes.
5.0	Sturdy.  Will pinch on closing use caution
5.0	Having owned a GE Spectra XL44 for over 10 years, I've had two ignitors eventually wear out for the stove ignitor. This time the broiler ignitor had worn out, so instead of driving 20 miles to the closest appliance repair warehouse, I checked Amazon. Sure enough, same kit at a third of the price. When it arrived, the paperwork instructions included where identical to the ones I had bought years earlier to replace the oven ignitors (I tend to keep all paperwork).<br /><br />This is a ignitor complete kit (4342528), which includes:<br /><br />* Ignitor<br />* Mounting bracket if the previous ignitor was a square ignitor, being replaced with this round one<br />* 2 porcelain wire nuts (didn't hold my wires, so used plastic ones since the wiring is outside of the oven cavity<br />* Mounting screws<br /><br />The original ignitor and this ignitor use slightly different plug-in connectors. Simply snip the plugs off and connect the wires with the wire nuts (doesn't matter which one connects to which - no polarity issues). To access the wires, I simply pulled out the oven, removed a metal door (two screws), and easy access to the wires.<br /><br />If this unit fails abnormally early, I'll update this review accordingly.
5.0	Perfect<br />Beautiful sink. Nice and deep<br />No issues with undermount with granite. Hooked up to a disposal easy
5.0	it arrived promptly and was just what we needed.
5.0	Keep your electronic clear of dust is a must and this easily performs that. I can see where some would find it a bit loud, but it isn't ear shattering. The cord is very long, and the attachments work as expected.  I would suggest buying the accessory kit (Doesn't cost much). I got tired of running out of canned air, and besides this has much more thrust of air...Great investment!
5.0	It worked!!!!!! Not much to say here. I bout this thing for under 10 bucks. I needed it to fix my washing machine, I ordered it, got it fast, and fixed my washer.
5.0	I purchased both the left and right cap for the register cover.  They fit perfect and look great. Will purchase again.
5.0	THIS PRODUCT SHIPPED QUICKLY AND WAS IN GOOD SHAPE WHEN RECEIVED.ONCE INSTALLED AND VERIFIED IT WAS CORRECT PART.COULDNT ASK FOR ANYTHING BETTER.
5.0	ITS THE BEST THANKS A LOT DEAR  I WILL DEAL WITH U GUYS LATER<br />REGARDS THANKS A LOT AGAIN  .
5.0	"I got this product for my Mom who is nearly deaf.<br />It was about as easy to install and use as it gets. It was literally \\""plug & play\\"".<br /><br />NOTE: Be sure to buy the model that includes the push button. Then all you have to do is mount the push-button (using 2 small screws provided) and plug in the strobe chime.<br />I also purchased 2 more of these receiver chimes so she'd have them in a few strategic locations around the house.<br /><br />My only \\""nit\\"" is that I wish the chime and strobe light \\""rang\\"" for a little longer (duration). They blink/chime for only about 5 seconds each time you push the button. It would be better if they blinked/chimed for 10 - 15 seconds.<br /><br />All in all though, it sure beats having to route doorbell wires all over an existing house."
5.0	This is one of the better access panels. It is easy to use. The drywall hole does not have to be exact. I needed some access to low voltage wiring below my security panel. I cut the hole using the provided template. I was not exact. The access panel has a spring activated latch on opposite sides. Just line up with the square hole and press in. Thats it. To remove just grasp on two sides and pull. The latches release. Couldn't be easier.    This product can be found at many price points. Amazon had the best prices.
5.0	Great product,I love it. Wish it had a longer pipe, but all my guest enjoy the lights and it has improved my bathroom's decor.I received the head and installed it easily. The color starts at a blue (cold) and when the faucet is turned to a warmer setting, it turns purple. I would recommend getting a 9 inch shower arm (2-1/2 inch diameter flange that fits all standard 1/2 inch pipe threads that will accommodate the 8 inch square shower head). I did not find a problem with the &#34;sound&#34; that other people discussed when the shower is used.
5.0	What a great product! I've relied on the &#34;Honeywell&#34; name over the years mostly for commercial-grade products, and I was pleased to see this available for consumer use in the home.<br /><br />Honestly, this was a bit more than I had anticipated spending on a wireless doorbell, but the Honeywell brand convinced me to take a chance on this unit.<br /><br />&#34;Installation,&#34; if you really wish to call it that, was simple. I mounted the &#34;base&#34; unit on the wall under the existing doorbell chime (the mounting bracket is virtually idiot-proof, I promise!) and it looks pretty spiffy up there in the hallway. The push-button unit mounts either with screws (provided) or a two-sided sticky tab. For now, I'm taking my chances on the overly-plump sticky pad; we'll see how that works out.<br /><br />The three chime options are appropriately loud; they're not at all wimpy nor modest. You could easily hear them in a 2,000-sq-ft home with no problem, provided you put the base unit in a central location. (You don't have to hang it -- it will sit on a tabletop or shelf with no problem.) The visual indicator is a very nice touch, and would be great for a hearing-impaired person.<br /><br />Honeywell indicates pretty robust battery life on the instruction sheet, so I'm hoping to not have to replace these four batteries but maybe once per year.<br /><br />I've had this up for a week or so (the push button is outside our laundry door) and so far, every one in the household is very, very pleased with the performance. It's definitely worth every cent it costs. :) (And appears to be extremely simple to add additional push buttons -- each with their own sound -- should you wish to do so.)<br /><br />Recommended without reservation! You'll love this little problem solver!
5.0	Works great, just what we needed.
5.0	Use it for locking my bike up at the gym around a large column and it has just enough cord to get around this column.
5.0	lets me know when someone is in the house
5.0	Very classy.  Easy to operate with 1/4 of full circle turn to full on.  There is some water noise when operating.
5.0	Beaitiful, clean finish! Installation was easy
5.0	Excellent product and vendor!
5.0	These are cute the only problem I have found is that they start to peel off every once in awhile; I use the blowdryer and press them back down.
5.0	We have a spa tub in one of our bathrooms.  This rain shower type shower head will be a perfect addition to that tub.<br /><br />The web site states this is 8” in size but when I measured it I find it is 7.25”.  I know, that’s only a ¼” but there are some places I wouldn’t want another ¼”.  My quilting squares come to mind.  Anyway, it is a nine by nine spray in a square pattern.  Silver (chrome?) is the color.<br /><br />The packaging comes with plumber’s tape.  I find this a wonderful idea.  Most shower heads do not come with the tape and you have to be sure you have some when you install it.  With this, you are sure to have the tape.  Very nice.<br /><br />The head is position adjustable so it can be angled to just where you want it.  If you love the rain, why not have it in your morning shower?<br /><br />&#34;I received a free or discounted product in exchange for providing an unbiased review.&#34;
5.0	These filters fit my Trane heat pump perfectly, and the cost is reasonable. I would recommend this product to anyone.
5.0	look great and is sturdy. It&#34;s great..I get double bars so my 2 towels are separated in between and air out so they dry quickly!
5.0	I couldn't find these bulbs locally.  Decided to order this even though one reviewer (incorrectly) said these were not Xenon.  They work fine, they are Xenon.  I'm satisfied.
5.0	Just perfect lighting of my back yard trees...
5.0	I surprised my elderly mother with this unique gift in January 2014.  She was pleasantly surprised when she sat down on the warm seat!  She invites EVERYONE to &#34;have a seat!&#34; when they visit her and brags how she was given one for her birthday.  It spoils you when you sit on the warm seat at home in the winter so much so that you don't want to &#34;sit&#34; anywhere else!  It is also lit with a warm blue light that doubles as a night light so one does not have to turn on the bright lights in the middle of the night.<br />Several of her visitors have purchased one for themselves and my brother was gifted one for his 50th b'day this week since he had fallen in love with this unique seat.  It has become one of the most popular seats in the house!  It is well made and easy to install.
5.0	Exactly what we ordered.<br />Great quality.
5.0	Got this as a replacement bulb for a piano lamp. It gives off the appropriate amount of light and is working as expected.
5.0	This seat is a product I've used before. I like it very much. The ease of removing it to clean it and the toilet was a big reason to get it. None of the soft seats I have used in the past last for a long time, but I really like then.
5.0	We've purchsed a few of these drawers for our office furniture and have gotten overwhelmingly positive feedback from users (one person even purchased a few on his own to use as additions to his sleek, modern Ikea desks that are great, but lacking storage).  We'll absolutely buy more as the need arises.  Thanks for a great product!
5.0	perfect fit.  running good after 2mos
1.0	Junky Chinese Product. BUYER BEWARE! This product fell apart on me within 2 days of ownership. I returned it for a quality product.
1.0	Very poor choice to replace 40w incandesent lamp in microwave mounted above stove top range. Reviews indicated LED provided greater light but after installing during daylight, could not tell if this lamp was on or off. Might make a desent night light but is not at all sufficient for illuminating cooktop.
1.0	A mouse makes more noise.
1.0	In February 2015 I bought three KEYART SBFLMT/FTCANDLE/LED/4W/2700K Sabre Filament Flame Tip Candle LED, 4W 2700K from Amazon for around $15 each, anticipating that their long life would amortize their cost.  At first I thought they were the coolest LED lamps I had seen.  I was really impressed with the &#34;incandescent&#34; look.  However, all three have burnt mostly out during the past three months.  It seems like each tiny LED burns out in turn as the filaments get fainter and fainter.The Amazon posting mentioned a one-year warranty and I have asked the vendor  for warranty replacement.
1.0	Item was defective and was returned
1.0	"Zephyr's version of \\""white\\"" does not match any other white appliance.  It looks almond and I absolutely hate it.  The lights shine into the eye when cooking.  The sound level is just awful.  Then there is the design.  The hood looks a bit pitched up and the underworks can be seen from across the room. The grease cups, the idea of which I find disgusting,  can be seen from across the room and are grey, not white. I cannot find one good feature that I am pleased with.  It deserves zero stars."
1.0	UPDATED!!! My original unit lasted for years until it suddenly started filling at trickle. Tried replacing the Seal (#242) with no luck, so I purchased this item. After only 6 months it now doesn't shut off completely. Seal looked fine so I cleaned and flushed everything. Still leaked so I replaced the seal. Still leaked.  Original Post: Installed in seconds. Worked perfectly.
1.0	in the words of many reviews of wretched items, &#34;I wish I could give this zero stars&#34;.<br /><br />If you purchase and use this plunger may I also recommend:<br /><br />fishing gaiters<br /><br />rubber gloves<br /><br />a face mask, with accompanying goggles.<br /><br />plastic trash bags to protect your floor.<br /><br />The upside is, our downstairs toilet is now useable. Too bad the floor is now covered with sewage spray...<br /><br />Seriously, I would've been better off purchasing a whole new house. And there's was nothing wrong with our  house.  Our son just decided to be &#34;helpful&#34;.<br /><br />Also, if you want this item, it's available for $5.99 at any local discount store.
1.0	My Ottlite has had quality problems from the start.  Half the time I turn it on the light doesn't come on and I have to tap the fixture for the light to come on.  Other times I switch the light on and off and the light works.  I remember seeing an Ottlite in the store and being very impressed with the light quality.  The light certainly isn't poor, but not as crisp and easy-on-the-eyes as I was hoping.  The lamp comes with one bulb.  Update: Either the lamp or the bulbs are defective.  Have tried 2 replacement bulbs and the lamp won't hold a light.
1.0	Only 45 days old and I have had 6 false alarms very sad for a companies primary business is making smoke and CO units. Stay away from this one
1.0	The bar which goes across the top to hold the screen immediately broke out of the box.  Also, there are no magnets to help hold the screen closed, only square patches of plastic. I think whoever in China made this screen only saw a picture of it and tried unscccessfully to replicate it.  PS It really stinks and it smells bad too.
1.0	This is a disappointing bulb. It only lasted for three weeks with very little usage. There are many reviews like mine. Amazon should not carry this defective item.
1.0	I installed this seat four months ago and one of the hinges broke.  Underneath the sturdy looking hinge cover is a hinge with thin plastic that breaks easily.  Kohler really needs to pull this one out of production.  I have had other Kohler toilet seats with more conventional hinges and they were replaced because they wore out after decades of use.  This one is garbage - DON&#34;T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!
1.0	I bought two of these - Both leaked from the beginning  As one of the other reviewer said the sink faucets leaked from its internal soldered joints.  I also have the same problem with Amazon who does not understand that new construction and major renovations take more than a month but the products need to be purchased for the subcontractors to plan the installation.  I too am out hundreds of dollars!!!
1.0	Didn't fit my headphones, complete waste of money
1.0	The wall pops looks great but does not stick on the wall longer.... it peels off! Little disspointed with the product.
1.0	This is ALL plastic.  It is so cheaply made that it wouldn't even hold the head up.
1.0	Returning. They won't work.
1.0	i order 6 of these, 4 of them only work, 2 didn't work out of the box, what surprise me the best- it says (  48 hours aging time) - witch means the were on for 48 hours, before they ship to the costumer, i will not buy again.
1.0	Item seems to be defective, new frig, 1st filter change. Idiot light will not reset and my water line/frig is now making very strange noises.  Will by from Home depot going forward. Will not buy this item from Amazon again.
1.0	Outdoor Light Sensor Socket by Miles Kimball does not work.<br />I will return all 4 of them some time this week..
1.0	And they wouldn't let me return it. The lamp is liht pink, which, After doing further reading, I found is the sign of poor quality Himalayan salt. You get what you pay for.
1.0	I purchased a couple of low profile bulb holders that have this bulb in them for my basement from one of the big box stores. I thought it would be the perfect solution to a problem I was having. The fixtures in my basement are pretty low and I have hit them with my head a couple of times, broken glass and mercury from the bulb everywhere. The fixtures were great at first but the bulbs only last a couple of months before they burn out. I have replaced them 4 times now in a year trying a couple of different brands all with the same short lifespan.
1.0	If you have months to wait go for it if not look elsewhere<br />Repeated words don't count.<br />I believe this is a good toilet only I cant afford to wait many months to get it
1.0	Poor performance from the start. Water didn't taste very good when the filter was new and started smelling foul within weeks. I've replaced the filters and membrane a number of times since purchasing the system. Haven't had another RO membrane that went this wrong before.
1.0	Received the bottle with it half empty! The container had a broken cap/seal and the box was drenched in product. I would not recommend this product. Very bad experience and waste of money!
1.0	DO NOT BUY! I'm on my 6th faucet mount and like the others, it has started to leak from the seal where the water filter goes. Even with low pressure, the screw seal eventually gives way causing a mess. I do like Pur water pitchers, so if you are in the market for one of those, you can't go wrong with Pur. However, this product is just cheap crap that won't last very long. NOT RECOMMENDED!
1.0	I purchased this lamp in late October and it was working fine (light-wise) until now. The upper arm just snapped off as I was trying to adjust the angle.    NOT a good buy.
1.0	I also though thse alram would bark like a dog.  I will be returning immediately.
1.0	We returned this item. We went with a full rise sink. We felt that the low rise center would not hold much water to wash any pots by hand.
1.0	Metal bits in soap after 6 mo use. Broke out in hives. junk. had to replace. Did not use anything but soft soap in.
1.0	This is the 2nd control assembly I replaced.  This one caused a fire that smoked up my entire kitchen.  Good thing I was home, as It could have burned my house down.  I threw away my dishwasher and replaced it with a different manufacturers.  Stay away from Whirlpool Quiet Partner dishwashers!  Google and and you'll see a movement to start a class action law suite due to fires caused by their dishwashers.
1.0	This filter is a waste of money. After approximately three weeks filtered water started just dripping out of it (not running) and I am using it just to make tea or cook some pasta (that is it). Within two month it would take it five(!!!!) hours to fill two liter bottle. Had to leave it running overnight to have some water for the morning coffee and the day. And the filter indicator was green (not even yellow). Had to change cartridge. Have to tell you, cartridge cannot handle 100 gallons and should be replaced much sooner then every three months with light use. I am dissapointed...
1.0	First: the left hinged I ordered came with a right hinged back plate! (meaning the handle was facing the other way)<br />Second: Installed it, worked great the first day. Never saw the keypad light up though. Next day... nothing. Changed batteries 3 times... nothing.<br /><br />My advise.. install as soon as you get it and don't wait like I did until my project was over and I can't return it because I'm a week or two outside my return window.
1.0	I ordered this since it was cheaper then the original GE filter, but after using the filter I understand why.  I assumed all filters would be about the same, but boy was I wrong.  I don't think this filter does anything!  The water tastes the same as coming from the tab.  I am now going back to ordering the GE filters and down about $20 for this filter plus the waste of time ordering it.
1.0	After only two and a half years, the unit started beeping and displaying an ERR message that repeated after pressing reset.  Upon my unplugging it from the wall to get rid of it, a continuous ear-splitting alarm sounded until the battery was removed.  I will not buy one of these again.
1.0	No good quality . I need return this item
1.0	This is an example of how bad this filter leaks.  As you can see it doesn't leak from the fittings or the O-Rings but it leaks from the body of the filter itself.  It was installed last night but purchased a few months ago and the return policy window has expired.  Please be aware that the quality control of this product is spotty at best and always test your filter before your return window expires. Otherwise, instead of throwing your money away on Junk like this, you can just throw you money in an envelop and mail to me. I promise to do something good with it. lol
1.0	"The part I received was not a Moen 1200 cartridge part but a \\""made in China\\"" look alike. I installed it and after a week it was very hard to operate. I replaced it with a real Moen 1200 cartridge and every works perfectly."
1.0	Purchased 3 of these and 1 quit workng a few days after we bought it.
1.0	purchased this item about a year ago.  Heard some unusual running noise, and opened the toilet lid to check.  This product has a leak and won't shut off the bottom-portion.  Will need to replace.  Item gets 1 star because, although it worked well for about a year... the fact that it is broken after less than a year of use in a half-bath which gets minimal traffic... means it is a cheaply made product which is not meant to last.
1.0	"I had one of these installed in my kitchen on the default frequency and it worked great, so when I put two ceiling fans upstairs I bought two more figuring it would be easier than running wires in the walls for the switches...  Both units would turn on and off randomly.  Hunter's solution was \\""change the frequency\\"" which we did... multiple times.  They ended up sending us a new receiver for the one fan and that resolved it's problems, but they won't send us a new receiver for the other fan.  Instead they keep saying \\""try another frequency\\"" and that if I want a new receiver I can buy one from them for $35 + $7 shipping which is pretty much what this thing runs with the remote included.  I used to think Hunter made quality products, but not anymore.  The line they throw out there about \\""interference\\"" is complete and utter BS.  FCC regulations state that licensed RF equipment MUST accept random interference.  The fact that I have two receivers working perfectly happily and the third is buggy tells me that it is not an interference problem, but a design and/or manufacturing problem.  I stopped counting the number of frequencies I tried after 4 or 5 and none of them work.  Even if I thought interference was a valid concern, the fact that you have to go through so many different frequencies to find one that works makes this product more than worthless.  If changing the frequency was an easy process, it wouldn't be that big a deal either, but in order to change the frequency, you have to un-mount the fan.  You then have to wait until the light turns on randomly in the middle of the night to see if it works.  It would have been easier, less time consuming, cheaper, and more convenient to knock holes in my wall in order to run the wires than deal with trying to get this thing to work.  The sad part is that the two I have that work, work great.  So if you can convince Hunter to send you a good receiver you will be set.  Unfortunately they don't seem to want to sell products that actually work or admit when there are problems with their products."
1.0	Had to return the item.  Would not stay attached.  Material not firm enough.
1.0	Did not fit.  Water leaked out of the flapper.
1.0	this tree has been discontinued.  it took them 2 or 3 weeks to let me know.  i found another one i love much better.  its a four foot balsam hill tree.  its prelit with 250 lights.  the branches look real and feel real.  it was half price before thanksgiving.  very happy with it
1.0	Purchased these bulbs as replacements for our Dacor range hood.  Each light burned out within a week.  Total crap.
1.0	it's NOT cloth. I ordered it just because it said cloth but was NOT.  looked like someone's left over tapes.
1.0	You get what you pay for with these! I ordered 50 of these for a memroly for my mom and more than half were ripped!
1.0	Product seemed fine, however when attempting to apply it to a clean surface as directed, it bubbled and stuck together almost immediately.  I am usually very good at placing things like this onto surfaces, screen protectors and stuff, but this one was very uncooperative and it lost its stickiness very very quickly.  Overall not a very good product, at least the one I was sent.
1.0	This is down driven with a (3) THREE WATT internal limiting ballast folks. My cell phone provides more light than this thing. I ordered the 20w version as well and it is driven by a (10) TEN WATT ballast, and had a floating (non-insulated ground inside the housing). Avoid these lights - chinese manufacturing and cost cutting at their absolute worst.
1.0	This Clicker is horrible. Only one for sale at Sears, Radio Shack, Wal Mart. 10 max range. Pitiful piece of junk. Garbage, but no other choice.
1.0	Not impressed since it fails to fill properly, if at all. I will need to replace.
1.0	It looked cheaply made and a piece was broken.  I sent it back.  I don't think I would have kept it even if it wasn't broken.
1.0	The item in the picture looks great but dont let that fool you .. When i actually recieved it , this thing was sooooo small and looks nothing like the pic ( as far as the size) . I ended u not using it . I might actually return it
1.0	I work for a coatings company so I've seen some pretty amazing stuff. The video I was shown made this product look fantastic. I would have recommended it to anyone. After using it on a hiking back pack I recently purchased I wouldn't advertise this product if they paid me. I will vehemently destroy this product to anyone who asks me about it. I was so disappointed.<br /><br />Followed the directions to the letter. All it did was leave a sticky, opaque coating on my bag. Coatings usually fail due to prep work or unclean substrate. This one failed because it's a faulty peoduct. Save your money and shop around. If you do buy this garbage, get some cardboard and try the substance out to be sure that's what you want. That was my mistake. Should have used it on something else first.
1.0	"To be fair, while the unit worked it warned us 1 or 2 times when the flames on the stove went out. However, the display only says \\""Err\\"" now."
1.0	These bulbs made a loud humming noise in my fan.  Returned them.
1.0	I give it 0 stars. I had to mark one star for it to allow me to review. Been fighting with this terrible water heater for 8 years now. Time for it to go in the trash. I absolutely hate it. Have hated it since we put it in. you can not adjust the hot water when taking a shower at all. Turn on a little cold water to get the temp right and it shuts off all together. Turn off the cold and it may come back on or you might have to wait a min or so . Then do it all again. Take a bath, you have to fill with hot first then add cold to it til it is right or you have the same problem as with the shower. Can't get hot water in the dishwasher or the washing machine because they are water efficient models. . So they do not activate the  water generator. Grrrrrrr. Wish we would have researched it much better than we did. It should not even be on the market. HATE IT!!!!
1.0	"I never received these dowsing rods. I contacted the seller. They said, \\""Too bad!\\"" and refused to give a refund. I had to contact Amazon for a refund. Terrible seller."
1.0	I was disappointed!  I paid an electrician to install it.  The light comes on but doesn't dim.
1.0	Openable using bare hands without any tools or straining, just pull the sides apart.
1.0	Purely decorative. Two of these lights' combined light output is still not enough to see around the room, even in a small closet or half bath.
1.0	Broke after 4 months.  Very poor metal used.  The original hinge lasted just over 20 years.
1.0	Lasted less then 2 months of actual use.  The motor runs but it doesn't have the power to pump water up the 12 feet needed anymore. When I originally ordered, I got my old one working so the new one sat in a box until past my warranty time.  Then once I did hook it up it stopped working after about 2 months, I'm not buying a little giant again.<br />Note: when it broke I manually emptied a bucket for a while, it did have a heavy load of up to 5 gallons on a hot GA day.
1.0	The plastic that covered the weight at the base was broken badly.  After returning them once and receiving three I gave up and sent them all back.  They need to find a better material to cover the  base. Shipment was fast and on time, but I  wonder how they where handled on the way here.  I am not sure about the working part of the lamp never got that far.
1.0	Maybe I got a defective kit???  This this was pretty bad, none of the thumb screws would actually screw in to the nut, when I would force them I would not be able to tighten them.  Not sure if this is a case of 'You get what you pay for' since it was such a cheap price.  Not happy with this at all and had to return it.
1.0	We bought two Toto Guinevere toilets, to replace both of our old toilets, which dated to the mid-70's.  I didn't want to buy Japanese toilets, but we were assured that this is the only one Made in USA and that Toto is absolutely the best.  We wanted the best, so we took the plunge (ahem).  We could've bought 3 or 4 cheap toilets for each bathroom at this price, and judging by the superior performance of other peoples cheap toilets we'd be better off.<br /><br />Flushing was pathetic as we received the toilets. The only way it's now offered is the 1.28-gallon-per-flush model.  It took 2 or 3 flushes for even liquid waste to be visibly removed from the bowl.  Saving the planet?  Maybe not.  I went looking for the 1.6-gallon flush valve, and learned that all it takes is the Toto BLUE flapper valve.  That worked like magic - the blue flapper stays open longer and allows a full flush.  They now flush very well.<br /><br />They have the Sani-Gloss premium finish.  Another Toto joke.  You can't use cleaners like in a regular toilet - just mild soap.  Scum and pink mold build up and all I can do is scrub every few days with a brush and soap.  Worse than that, these toilets get the worst skid marks I've ever seen in a toilet.  After a solid-waste use, you need to wait 5-10 minutes and come back to re-flush, or be embarrassed when someone else uses the toilet later.  Since we see this even with guests, I don't think it's our family's diet.<br /><br />Also on the embarrassing front... Whenever anyone urinates while sitting, the shape of the bowl causes urine to splash up onto the underside of the seat.  Something else to clean a time or two per day.<br /><br />The plastic parts that form the attachment to the floor aren't confidence-inspiring, but I used long screws and added a steel reinforcement on top of the plastic, and nobody's knocked one loose yet.  I hope they continue to survive.<br /><br />The toilets look OK, but are somewhat weird because they're massive on the bottom and small on top.  Maybe they should be called the Hillary.<br /><br />Soft-close seat is very nice.  We do NOT have the weird noise issue others note.  After buying the 1.6-GPF replacement parts the toilets flush well.  Probably the only satisfactory things about these toilets.<br /><br />All in all?  I DO NOT EVER plan to buy Toto again.
1.0	There is a diode that must be connected to the push-button doorbell before this unit will work properly.  After I installed this diode the LED light on my new push-button doorbell wouldn't work.<br />Since that's unacceptable, I'm going to send this chime back.<br /><br />By the way, if you have a non-LED light maybe this chime will work.  Ours is a Heath/Zenith HX-301-PB LED Halo-Lighted.
1.0	the item would not sound the chime ( in our house) much more then about 50 feet<br />not the 100 feet as advertised. Unit Returned.
1.0	It has been my experience that Wagner makes quality products, however this was not the case.  The paint would hardly come out of the roller.  What little did left imprints from the roller cover and it would not roll out.  After attempting to paint a section of about 2x3 ft I threw it in the trash and went bought a regular roller/cover to complete my paint job.
1.0	Did not fit my refrigerator as stated but ... refund was very prompt
1.0	This item is cool at first but is a total piece of garbage, it's like it's designed to fall apart after the first 4 hours of use, the thing makes a load load scratching noise every few seconds and the lights go out and the pressure drops everyone that happens, do your self a favor and skip this one and do a different one on the list.
1.0	I actually loved the hose because it is light and easy to manage, but out of 7 hoses we ordered,  4 have failed.  The plastic casing inside breaks and renders the hose unusable.
1.0	This light was installed and burned out in one night. The batteries had to be replaced after 3 hours, and the bulb burned out shortly afterwards.
1.0	This light was so weak that we had to replace it immediately. I am in the process of changing all my lights to LED. We see the savings in our electric bill are substantial. But this bulb is far to weak to use, so we are still looking for a bulb of this size with more output.
1.0	Do yourself a favor and don't buy these lights. I bought 3 sets of these from Lowe's and they stopped working correctly after just 1 day. I bought and installed them for my mom, who lives in a nearby town. I didn't see that they had actually stopped working correctly until 2 weeks after I had installed them. My mom is 85 and she told me over the phone that she thought there may be something wrong with them, but I assured her I would &#34;fix&#34; them when I could get back over. I was thinking loose bulb or something (which actually can't happen with these I don't think). I foolishly didn't keep up with the receipt for these sort-of expensive lights and now I have to eat it. Now I read in several places where people are having problems with this product. What a shame that we cannot buy a product off the shelf of a major retailer and expect them to perform as advertised. There is no shame with the importers and corporate buyers of junk to sale to us at probably a very high profit margin. So sad.
1.0	Nice idea but weak poor light.  The remote works only about 10 ft from it.  Most frustrating, the autoshut off attempts to work, shutting off for about a second before coming back on.  Uses old fashioned big batteries and manual states that it may act up when batteries go low.  You best buy a bucket of batteries to go with it.  Better would be to manufacture it to use Lithium rechargeable batteries.  Since it is working not as advertized, it is going back.
1.0	This is the second time I ordered these and both times 1 light doesn't work and I have to go through the hassle of repackaging it and returning it again.  I will be returning this time once again.
1.0	The picture in the ad was for a different version of the hair trap than the one that was actually sent.  We did not get what the picture represented.  When contacting the company we were told that we could sent the three we ordered back however the shipping to return the items would not be refunded and the cost to ship would be as much as the refund.  We feel the product was misreprsented!
1.0	This item is noisy to the point that I took it out and replaced the regular switch.  You cannot turn it off once you turn it on.  You have to wait for the time to run out.  Poor piece of equipment.  Then when I wanted to return it, I was required to pay the return postage.  I payed to have it shipped and then I had to pay to send it back.  It ended up in the garbage where it belongs.
1.0	I should have paid attenion to the previous reviewer. This curtain rod is of poor quality. The mounting hardware is  terrible. Pay a bit more and get something substantial.
1.0	The item I received was wires and bolts and not the item prictured. I have no idea what to do with the parts I received but they were so cheap I'm sure I can find some use for them..
1.0	Disappointing since they are mostly made of plastic.  Only the the top plate is thin metal.  Made in China.
1.0	sending lamp back , doesn.t work. not a 3 pin uk plug. lovely lamp but didn.t work.wouldn.t recomend it to a friend.
1.0	I also bought one of these lamps and it died after a couple of years of infrequent use, and thought it was the bulb. It wasn't nor was it the switch. The electronics in the base apparently went bad. I am angry that Bel & Howell is so elusive about their products and not supplying parts lists so these can be repaired instead of throwing the entire unit into a landfill or shipped to Africa so a child may rip it apart for useful materials to reuse by these same corporations that are raping the planet. When you buy something to reduce electrical energy consumption and it becomes useless in a couple of years and having to purchase another device which requires more energy to produce that you ever saved makes no sense. Isn't this called Planned Obsolescence by corporations, that don't give a damn about our habitat??? .Why isn't Amazon more demanding of their suppliers?
1.0	Was advertised &#34;Valve with Two-way volume control Trim&#34;.  Beware false advertising.  This item does not come with the &#34;valve&#34;,  you will have to order the valve for an additional $300 - $500.
1.0	Trim plane only apparently means no hinges, mounting plate, or hardware. It is not like the photo and is useless to me like this.  I can get hardware but I am not going to fabricate a hinged mounting plate to attach this product. I just need new tabs, not the whole kit with Rams. The tabs I was trying to replace were one piece hinged and able to mount to the boat. These are going back.
1.0	Nowhere in the description is it noted that these put out only 300 lumens. A typical 40 watt bulb puts out 450 lumens. If you really need light, as in a dimmable multi-light bathroom fixture, these are not for you. Will return and get standard base- to-candelabra adapters.
1.0	I ordered the lamp because it was brass and used a 3-way bulb.  When the lamp arrived, it was a very dull finish - didn't look like brass at all.  Very disappointed.  Shipped it back and am waiting for my refund.
1.0	I bought 4 of these bulbs, delivery was good but, the first week one blew out.  I have not replaced it because I'm afraid it will blow again.  Lets see what happens to the rest
1.0	Sadly, I bought this about 7 months ago and I'm here today looking for a replacement. A plastic component broke and cannot be fixed. The pull down sprayer won't stay up anymore. It was beautiful while it lasted, but not at all durable. I guess you get what you pay for. :(
1.0	Motion sensor doesn't work
1.0	This lamp was perfect for where I was using it----until it stopped working.  It won't stay on. After a few minutes it stops working and I have to fiddle with the bulb to get it to light up again---for a little while. The bulb seems to fit tight and does not flicker when it is lit. I am not sure exactly what the problem is.  I just know it does not work and I did not abuse it or, for that matter, even use it very much. I would not recommend this lamp to anyone. AVOID
1.0	I am not sure what the problem was. But, these bulbs lasted anywhere from 3 to 10 days. The vendor however, was nothing but nice. They asked some questions and then gave me a complete refund. I didn't even have to send the bulbs back. I am still looking for MR16 5 Watt bulbs that work..
1.0	not as described. item does not match the description . its only 2&#34; long, web site states its 5&#34; long
1.0	When I purchased this item it is shown containing 25 bulbs in a box. When I received them it was disappointing to see them in an envelope wrapped in bubble wrap, no box. They looked like someone just gathered them together, bubblewrapped them and rubber banded them. I expect more out my Amazon products.
1.0	"I notice the box states \\""Lasts 5 Years\\"" here. The box I saved in my closet states \\""Lasts 6 Years\\"" so at least they're headed in the right direction. I just changed out a GE Energy Smart 13-Watt bulb that lasted 12 months and 8 days. Maybe eventually they'll have truth in labeling and state \\""Lasts 1 Year.\\"""
1.0	Very cheap and poorly done product. Lasted only for one week. all lights were filled up with water after one rain fall. some of them still working  others do not work.<br />I would not but it again. The price does reflect the value. Total Trash.
1.0	XL wasn't big enough for size 14 men's shoe, I tried to read the description to see what sizes they did fit but found no info on it. So took the chance, had to send back. Not only did they not fit, but were so flimsy thumbs went through material when trying to put on over shoe. If your shoe size is smaller and you don't care how thin they are then these may be okay for you.
1.0	Bought several packs from Costco about a year ago.  One in my kitchen went out recently.  For the higher price and expected lifetime, these bulbs aren't worth it.
1.0	Bought 5 of these through Amazon. Out of the 5 PAR 38... 3 are functioning as they should. 1 was blown... the other one works but the base its broken so it can be hang from the ceiling. At almost $30 each that's $60 wasted. Be aware...
1.0	Not MOEN!!!!<br /><br />Don't be fooled!  They send a non-moen product.  I didn't read the reviews beforehand, and by the time I opened the box to install a little over a month later, I was shocked to find some cheap brand towel bar.  Now I have to deal with getting this returned after the return period.  Big waste of my time!  Dishonest description!
1.0	Hard to believe that Intermatic screwed up such a basic manufacturing process.  The very last step of installing this timer switch is to slide the white plastic knob onto the keyed white plastic shaft.  It wouldn't slide onto the shaft. The shaft was clean and perfectly formed. It was just the wrong size for the knob. I added more force until he shaft started to bow and was ready to break. I tried adding soap as a lubricant.  No joy.  I would have just packed this item up and sent it back, but I really needed to get it installed rather than postpone the repair.  I resorted to spending 15 minutes filing the diameter of the plastic shaft down until it finally fit the knob.<br /><br />You don't want to go through this.  Shame on you, Intermatic.
1.0	Have you ever tried to push a pin in a piece of wood? It is not easy! So, hands free, don't think so!
1.0	Very disappointed in this product. The name suggests a permanent flow when running the faucet. Even turning the wheel does not make food go away, it sits in the bottom.  Not worth the money.
1.0	Worked fine for about a year then the keypad failed. seems to be a very consistent problem  (see several other reviews)
1.0	I was very disappointed in my experience with this product. It left a white residue that never cleared up. I eventually pressure washed it off and moved on to another product.
1.0	Cheaply made and tore very easily
1.0	This device really does not make the troubleshooting process any easier. You still have to remove every light bulb one at a time to find the problem and the built-in bulb removal tools is no easier to use than the traditional way: fingernails.<br /><br />The live line detector is over sensitive and beeps when near other lines, so if trying to work on a strand that's built into a Christmas tree, forget it. Maybe it will work better on a single strand that's not built into a tree?
1.0	Half the lights didn't work. returned
1.0	I bought 5 or 6 of these solar lamps.<br />At first they worked great, but a couple of weeks later, one by one they stopped working just like that.<br />I tried contacting the manufacturer, but it was not possible (e-mails bounced back)<br />I will definitely NOT recommend to buy this product, or for that matter, any product form this company.
1.0	I would recommend not wasting your money on this item as it is not worth purchasing. Waste of time and not worth the return postage. Avoid.<br />The thermostat did not work as advertized in fact once hooked in line it did not work at all. Very poor quality and no performance.
1.0	Great Stuff 187273 20-Ounce Window and Door Sealing Foam Gun<br /><br /> I just got this in the mail, and the description says it is a &#34;Foam Gun&#34;. But it is not. I was reading the directions and could not figure out how it worked based on the product. I realized that it is false advertizing, and that it is not a foam gun, but just the foam that needs a separate gun in order to work.  I really needed to use it, so I used a nail to compress the foam into a bowl and used a palette knife to push it into the window. I lost more than half of it, and think I'll ask for a refund since it is not at all as described.
1.0	The pack has lots of pockets which is nice if you have things those particular sizes to put in the pocket. The lid does not velcro so it usually blows or falls open. The durability is very poor. I took in/out of car only 2 times and upon the third time, the bottom completely fell out and was broken.
1.0	The title of this listing is &#34;Lamp under 40.... Dollars&#34;. The price I see listed is $42.95. Time to readjust the description or the price, I believe!
1.0	Amazon sent me, not once, but twice, the wrong shade. The second time it arrived completely smashed in.  I am a loyal amazon customer and have never had issues. However if you like the lamp shade pictured, DO NOT BUY THIS, because it is probably not what will arrive at your door step.
1.0	I ended up calling a repairman and returned this igniter for a refund. We were pretty disappointed considering the time the oven was down, the analysis of the problem, the time spent finding the correct part, waiting for the shipment, the time and effort to install the part, and then finding out you were shipped a defective part and having to start all over.
1.0	no noticeable improvement.
1.0	Low quality, cheaply made, frail inside and out, prone to fail, and to operate erratically...Once I set it up and tried it for the first time the chambers lightened up, the water got hot enough, and lots of melted solder came out of the unit.... That should say a lot about what to expect from this unit... Low and behold: it would work erratically, sometimes it would not work at all for no good reason, and then after 3 short  months of sporadic and sparse use it went completely south...
1.0	Horrible words would not come off onto the wall.  Waste of money. Had to throw away.
1.0	I purchased this for my bathtub, and initially thought it was going to do the trick.  It went down alright, but by the next morning 3/4 of the strip that I had laid was pulled away from the sticking point.  I would recommend the caulk over this product any day.
1.0	Poorly made and some ripped right out of the packet. Why waste so much money individually wrapping the lanterns and how about making higher quality lanterns instead?
1.0	Stealing someone else's art for a shirt is not cool. Do not support this store by purchasing any of the items they sell!!
1.0	Man...... This device sucks. SUCKSSSSS. Horrific setup when attempting to connect it the IPhone. I had to lay my phone on top if the spotter to connect then wait for this piece of garbage to connect. Thankfully my phone didn't fall and break when it vibrated to let you know it's connected. Once connected it's all down hill. The motion sensor sucks because it's only vibration. That's not a motion sensor it's a FREAKIN SHOCK SENSOR!!!! Stevie wonder can detect light faster than this piece of garbage. Worst device ever right next to leap motion and the vizio streaming box.
1.0	This works great. It takes a few seconds to load it and then probably 10 seconds to empty it. The handle is pretty big so you need a place that you can swing it through the full range of motion without hitting anything. We put it in the garage above a recycling can, which makes it very easy. So far no jams or issues with it.<br /><br />[EDIT] - After about 3 weeks of use I'm updating my review. While it worked very well, unfortunately the plastic body broke in half during normal usage. It has been used lightly (maybe 4 - 5 times) and was not being abused or crushing anything other than a regular tin soda can when it broke. I've contacted the company and will update again if they replace or refund my money. Very disappointing durability and would not buy again at this point.
1.0	Very complicated to install. I had an electrician come and look at it and had Honeywell on the phone as well and no-one was able to help me program the device.
1.0	Terrible. Not a stainless finish. Painted over with primer.
1.0	"I initially purchased 3 of these lights from Staples or Office Depot and they were exactly what I was looking for - a white light (5000+ Kelvin) that was good for a hallway or next to a bed for getting up at night without turning on a light.  I later purchased some additional units from Amazon and was VERY DISAPPOINTED.<br /><br />The pure white light version was replaced by a \\""Yellow\\"" (~3000 Kelvin) and this is definitely inferior to the original.  When the light is on it looks like an old bulb incandescent bulb that has turned the white plastic to yellow from age.  Don't know why they changed the design but they didn't change the product designation or specifications and there is no visibility to the fact they made this change so it fooled me into buying an inferior version.  VERY DISAPPOINTING - will not recommend this product to anyone."
1.0	I ordered Aube TI033 which is compatible with CFL. What I received is Honeywell PLS530, which is different and not compatible with CFL.
1.0	The easy caulk is not worth the time it takes to put on  so save your money
1.0	Had to return it.<br /><br />Description claims &#34;5/16 In. square drive … accepts a 9/32 In. square spindle&#34;, but the square drive on the one I received was too small.  I measured everything multiple times to make sure I wasn't at fault.  Square drive was 9/32 In, which would have been for a 1/4 in spindle I guess?  Very annoying.<br /><br />Seemed well built though.
1.0	First day of use almost landed coworker in hospital after the ladder step completely broke away from the plastic bracket that holds it.
1.0	Arrived broken! In a bunch of pieces. No way to fix it.Tried and tried to contact seller! No response ever. Shame I really want the lamp to cause I love The Walking Dead!
1.0	The edge of my roof was leaking during a rainstorm recently. I bought this so called Liquid Rubber Selant after fooled by its TV commercial. Because the amount of liquid in each can was very small, I had to buy 4 cans to seal the edge of my roof (a small area). It cost me $70.<br /><br />Another rainstorm came the day after I sealed the roof. The edge of roof leaked as bad as before. What a waste of money! Should we ban deceiving TV commercials like the one run by this product?<br /><br />I bought Henry Henry 208R Rubber Wet Patch Roof Cement from Homedepot for $17. I sealed the edge of my roof with this cement and finally fixed the leaking roof.<br /><br />[...]
1.0	"This product is absolutely horrible!  Let's start with the cons, because there are no pros.  The package clearly lists the weed-eater I own (Ryobi 725r) as one of the weed eaters this products works with...WRONG!  None of the nuts included fit this type of weed eater...why???  Because the weed eater is in METRIC and the nuts are standard!  Do I give up?  Oh No...I attempt to locate the correct nut in my vast collection and then even trip-it to the HW store for a replacement nut.  Well, at the HW stare I can find the nut, but not a nut that is the right \\""outside diameter\\"" to properly fit the cutting housing.  At this point, this \\""no tools required\\"" project is getting on my nerves and I have wasted more money in gas than I paid for the stupid thing.  The only nut I am concerned about now is myself for still messing with this useless device.  Back into the packaging and back to the seller!  DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!"
1.0	it was too big. it did not block the water and did not fit my toilet. I still have my toilet on the floor.
1.0	Thought this would be a ultra bright solar spot.  Yesterday I purchased 1 from walmart with 70 Lums<br />and it makes this product look cheap a best.  The westinghouse unit was solid aluminum and $7.00 with<br />3 maybe 4 time the brightness.  Went back to Walmart and got the last 3 they had.  I will find others to<br />meet my needs.<br /><br />If I had the box which I dont and it did not cost so much to return it I would send this unit back..
1.0	as soon as i received the box which is the original box shipped from china, i knew this will not be a good product, the lights go out after 2 hours, they have cheap rechargebal batteries. you will have to go out and buy real rechargebal batties which will cost you about $10.00 for 4, i would not recommed this product. Target have the best solar lights in pack of 4 for $30.00 but they are much better quality and ligths last all night.
1.0	This is not good like what the web said!!!
1.0	TERRIBLE TRHU THEM AWAY UGH!<br />I SPENT ALL THIS MONEY ON THESE THINGS AND THEY<br />WENT UP ONE PIECE AT A TIME<br />THEY SHOULD GO ALL AT ONCE<br />REALLY DIDN'T LIKE THIS PRODUCT AND WON'T<br />'PURCHASE ANYTHING LIKE THIS EVER AGAIN<br />TY SORRY HAVE NOTHING GOOD TO SAY
1.0	Bought this item April 2nd 2011. Inside chime unit quit working May 1st, 2011. Amazon is sending me another. Hope it last. When the unit was working, it was great and you can hear it well.UPDATE MAY 28, 2011. 2nd replacement unit just quit working also. You can smell the inside chime unit ( burnt smell). I believe that when the unit picks up a continuous single and chimes alot, like someone is standing in front of the unit and it keeps picking you up, it gets too hot and burns up. It can't take it..Manufacture needs to look into this problem. Amazon may be sending me my 3rd replacement, going to try it one more time if they will send it to me. No reply from them yet, but I have shipped the other one back...
1.0	Don't be fooled by this vendor's misrepresentations that this is a genuine Whirlpool icemaker part.  A reasonable person would think from reading this Amazon listing that includes the words &#34;By Whirlpool&#34;, &#34;New OEM Whirlpool Control Module&#34;, and &#34;Whirlpool W10190935 Motor&#34;, as well as the correct Whirlpool part number, that he or she would be purchasing a genuine Whirlpool-manufactured part for their icemaker.  Not so!  What you in fact get from this seller, despite the representations in the listing, is a cheap Supco generic replacement with a different part number.  It's the equivalent part and it works, but for how long?  I specifically bought from this vendor because I wanted an OEM quality part, and I made the mistake of believing the vendor's misrepresentations in the listing.  I won't make that mistake again.
1.0	It may just have been a bad unit, but the part that I got did horribly with lower flows.  At full rate, it worked ok, but if you tried to run in at a low rate, water came pouring out of the vents in the vacuum breaker - more water came out of the vacuum breaker than came out of the hand shower.  I returned it for the Delta one which worked great (even though you see some black plastic so it doesn't look quite as nice).
1.0	This thing is a piece of crap. I've had to reset dozens of times in the five months that I've had it and it has now stopped working. The lights just stay on 24/7. It started having issues after about a month of use. Don't buy this. It is a piece of crap.
1.0	We have 36 fixtures, inside and out, that use these bulbs.  Our older bulbs lasted years.  Of the six new bulbs we purchased here, one burned out in less than eight hours, two made it about 20 hours, and one less than 50 hours.  The other two have probably 500 hours of use and are still working, but overall -  not happy with a 66% failure rate in such a short time.
1.0	If I could. I'd give this light no star. The directions and fittings were for a different fixture. I returned it
1.0	Would not suggest purchasing this product. I thought it would be an improvement of the Everpure 300-H . The water does not taste good and I have decided to discard it and replace it with the orginial H-300. A waste of $$$. The water has a bitter taste to it.
1.0	Package arrived with three broken bulbs. Two additional bulbs broke while hanging them (and we were gentle). Hung them outside and yet another bulb broke and then the string shorted out entirely. For 23 dollars, I was hoping to at least use them once.
1.0	This product has a warning label that says it contains harmful chemicals including lead that can cause cancer and birth defects! Then says to wash hands after handling! No way do I want to get cancer from a string of globe lights. I can't believe this can be sold without disclosing that before a consumer buys it then handles it! Returned!
1.0	I received a used item that does not work.  I opened the box, took out the unit, and it had paint stuck to it from where the previous owner had pulled it off the wall and returned it 9Likely because it also did not work.  I'm not picky - would have given it 4 stars if it had at least worked....
1.0	Item did not have the lengthened shackle as pictured and did not come with the 2nd key (control key).  Should have trusted the other bad reviews.
1.0	I am an avid Sons Of Anarchy fan who collects this related to the show so when I seen this lamp I jumped on it. Don't get me wrong it is a good lamp but the gun looks very cheap and like a toy and the knife is even worse. I was really disappointed in the quality for the price paid.
1.0	These are junk. They do not stay on all night. They light for a time then go on and off at random. They fill full of water and stop working. DO NOT BUY THESE.
1.0	It came damaged with one of the legs bent way out of whack, with some damage to the packaging.
1.0	It sooo complicated to put it together. I had to tried every single combination and write down and different angles. I am sending it back also it's so bright than hurts your eye, the switch tu turn it on and off it's very far, it should be attached to the platform, the base doesn't look like the one in the picture. :(
1.0	Box was already slight torn open when i received, but everything was still intact. Controllers are hard to fit into the station as the connector is on a weird angle. Then when i plug it into the PS4 it turns blue (indicating its on) for 2 seconds tops and shuts off and doesn't work. pay the extra $10 and get the energizer ones it's what i have for my PS3 and it what I am replacing this piece of crap with.
1.0	This is the second and last order i'll place from this seller. The dimensions on this wall plate are INCORRECTLY listed. The actual dimensions are 6.5&#34; x 4.5&#34;, I would love to know where they came up with 8&#34; x 4.9&#34; because that is a flat out lie and in my book that's false advertisement.<br /><br />Why does the size even matter? Well because now I have open dry wall showing on the side of this tiny plate cover.<br /><br />I hand tightened screws, just barely snug (since this is my second experience with Leviton's merchandise), and wouldn't you know I wake up the next morning and the face plate is cracked all the way across.<br /><br />Seriously, i've tried several of there face plates and hoped they would work every time because there aren't a lot of other options out there, but the fact of the matter is they are smaller than what you're replacing and almost guaranteed to break. Keep looking and save yourself the trouble.
1.0	I also tried this product.  Last weekend I went to my local Ace Hardware store and they recommended this DAP product to seal our shower stall. I cleaned the surface area as recommended, let, wiped the corners dry, with a compressor blew out any residual moisture and dried everything out. Then I sat for 48 hours of not being used. I them applied this product and we let it dry for 48 hours. It initially looked good, but today after a shower I just happened to touch it with my finger in the corner joints and it just pealed off!!! This product is TOTAL CRAP and GARBAGE... What a waste of my time to ever use this product.    I originally told my father to get me GE Silicone II Bathroom Tub and Tile Sealant, but Ace told him this product. They are SO WRONG. Now it's got to be totally removed and replaced with some other sealant product like the GE. I am so totally disgusted and highly recommend buyers beware and AVOID this crappy product if you know what's good for you. This deserves 5 negative stars...
1.0	They did not work.  Very disappointed.
1.0	I bought two switches and when I got them they were without wall plate.<br />The picture shows the switch with a plate.<br />I am very disappointed, now I have to order wall plates and to wait coupe of days again.
1.0	Started to leak 24 hrs after installing it.very light and poorly built.
1.0	This was a total bust for dealing with my small sump hole that is too small to use a pump with a conventional float.<br />I tried pairing this switch with Amazon's Superior Pump 91250 1/4 HP Thermoplastic Submersible Utility Pump.<br />Turns out that my sump was too shallow for the switch to work reliably, something that wasn't clear from the online description.<br />So now I'm stuck with an expensive piece of equipment that I'd gladly sell.
1.0	wasn't the style I was looking for.
1.0	purchased 2, one fit while the other didn't.  the one that did only lasted a week.
1.0	Product looks great price looks great but no information any where to what type of cartridge and what is the cost or where to buy it.  that kind of dum to sell a filter withou cartridge specialy on internet!!!!!
1.0	This is my favorite finish. Too bad you can't get it out of the can.  I bought two of these (and they aren't cheap), the spray nozzles are awful!  Very little pressure and most of it comes out in dribbles.  Much of the product is left in the can when the gas runs out.  The product IN the can is excellent. I'm going back to a gallon can.
1.0	This is by far the cheapest built, worst item I've ever purchased online! Not only did it have more than half the hardware missing, but the strength of the steel is very poor.. I would recommend the mfg. discontinue this item or improve it's stability.
1.0	These die out faster than any other type of bulb I have tried.  Yes, while they work they produce a nice mild light, but I have to replace them every couple months.  Not worth it.
1.0	This gadget has been nothing but frustration for me. The first unit I received had a note attached to it indicating the keys didn't work. The 2nd unit I got only works once in a while, the 3rd unit they sent me didn't work at all. This is ridiculous.    [...].    When the gadget is working, it has two functions as near as I can tell. It will show you the instantaneous kilowatt usage, and it will show you the cumulative usage for the month. The first function is pretty useful and is an easy way to tell how various appliances work. I can see that my heat pump has at least three different modes of operation: 5kw, 8kw, and 10kw. With a little work, I could probably isolate my hot water heater, etc. That would be neat if mine worked long enough to do it.    As for the second function, I can't for the life of me figure out how this could possibly be accurate or why you'd care. For it to be accurate your power company would have to read your meter at midnight on the 1st of the month, right? Mmmm, I don't think that's how they do it around my town.     I believe there's another product on the market that will also show whole-house power usage. Better look into that one before spending this kind of money on TED.    [...].They also felt like the units they had sent me couldn't all be defective. So by implication the TED unit must have a design flaw, not a manufacturing flaw. In desperation I decided to try a bunch of random experiments. Guess what? It turns out that TED works *fine* on an outlet on the other side of the house in a room full of flourescent lights and other appliances.      Is it something about the wiring? the electrical outlets? the breakers? It's a 30-yr old house. You be the judge. I guess if it was easy to send data through the power system you'd be getting internet access though the electric company. I would up my rating to 2.5 stars if I could.
1.0	I installed the filter but the water didn't flow properly.  Flow was very slow and intermittent as if air was trapped in the filter.  Even after several gallons of water (took a long time), it never cleared up.  I returned the filter.
1.0	We purchased this as a gift for our daughter for Christmas. When we turned it on, the light bulb that came with it immediately popped and blew out.  We tried another (the size they recommend) and that also popped and blew out immediately.  There are warnings on it about it going on fire if you use the wrong lightbulb, which is scary in itself, but even the lightbulb they gave us didn't work. I would not recommend this.  It did not meet our expectations.
1.0	When I recieved the bulbs I put one in and before the week was over it was out and didn't work again.
1.0	must be very close and at 90 degrees to work, waste of money. get sometihng else. I was hoping for a good product.
1.0	I am a Volunteer fireman was resonding to a call hadnt even hit 50mph stupid thing blew off my roof scratched and dinged the side of my truck. I  would not at all recommend this unless you plan on driving under 40 mph absolutely useless if the magnetic base is so pathetic.
1.0	followed instructions. wanted to repair small rip on sofa. MELTED IT!!! Tube also stated can be used on leather, but I would not use this on anything. My sofa is of fabric and apparently fake leather. Melted like a horror show.
1.0	A real piece of garbage compaired.to older model I wanted to replace it with  thisis the only drawback to online buying online.
1.0	took forever to recieve it...very small not at all like the picture, ordered it for my daughter because she picked it out from the companies ad on amazon, uhmmm lets just say i still havent put it up.
1.0	After 3 months the filter starts to leak water from every seam (not at the gasket where the front screws off but the seams where it is put together).  The manufacturer, Procter & Gamble, is evidently aware that this is a problem because when I called in last year (after owning it for 3 months) they replaced the unit as soon as I described the problem.  After using the replacement for about 3 1/2 months, it started exhibiting the same problem and the leaking gets worse each month.  I have owned much cheaper Brita filters that never had such problems and I now wish I had never given PUR a chance.
1.0	This is cold water only faucet. It did not advertise that. Sent it back
1.0	Orange red in color and does not stick well AT ALL; wish I could return it, but bought it for a project, and didn't open the package to use for the project until the return policy had already expired. WASTE OF MONEY!
1.0	its does  not work I put in new batteries still does not work waste  of money no address for a return no paper work do not buy this it does not work useless
1.0	moldy and should have been 15 sticks per box.  i counted and some boxes had only 10 sticks of incense.
1.0	I bought two of the patio door kits. They were both half the height they were supposed to be. Beware of this product!!!
1.0	The clips are not flush when they are slid into each other. Poor machining quality. Very difficult to slide one into the other when one is mounted to a surface. Had to return 8 bags and delay a project.
1.0	I followed the instructions to the letter to set this light up; I waited until it ran smoothly for 2 nights before throwing away the packaging and return shipping label.  On the 3rd night it failed to work.  I took it apart and made sure all connections were tight and it still does not work at all.  A lemon? maybe......  Made in China.  Need I say more?
1.0	The lock does not work properly. I locked the box, picked it up and then it opened and everything fell out.
1.0	I could not get the job done with this tool.
1.0	14 months ago I bought and installed 2 Danze bathroom faucets with a rubbed bronze finish.  They were very expensive and looked nice at first but soon the bronze plating begin to wear off around the aerator and the drain.  The aerator is difficult to remove for cleaning and needs to be cleaned almost daily to keep water from spraying in all directions when the water is turned on.  This week the faucet, not the plumbing under the sink, began to leak copiously.  When trying to troubleshoot the problem on the telephone with the tech. rep. it was clear that although he bragged that he had been working at the job for 5 years, he didn't know anything about the construction of the faucet.  He even insisted that the aerator and the piece that holds it into the faucet were 1 piece, even though it was clear that I was holding 2 pieces in my hand.  He insisted that I didn't know what I was talking about.  Would never buy another Danze faucet.
1.0	I find it hard to believe that this thing has worked as often as people claim. I would guess it works maybe 1 out of ten times; and with dents that are the easiest to be pulled. The glue is a mess; not strong enough; doesn't remove easy from tools or car.<br />I would experiment with suction pullers, an actual plunger, etc.
1.0	Not enough light for big flag pole like the pictures show.  Was easy to install when I went and purchased some new clamps.  The ones supplied were for a small pole that might attach to your house but not for the one in the ground.
1.0	About 11 months after ordering this it burned out. Another disappointing fact was the LED lights were on a single side of the bulb, which caused it to only shine light in a single direction.<br /><br />I would not recommend this product to anyone.
1.0	Disappointed..We bought one faucet to put in the main bath and it worked fine.  So, we decided to replace the master bath faucet.  After 30mins of install time on the master bath faucet, I found it immediately had a leak at the cold water handle.  I returned it and got a replacement and found the replacement had a leak in the hot water handle.  After wasting 2-3hrs on install/uninstall of the faulty faucets, I purchased a similar Moen at Home Depot with a much sturdier feel.  Although it cost twice as much, it didn't leak and should last a long time.
1.0	The lamp gave a very high photometer reading as soon as it was installed and could not be used.
1.0	Disgustingly discolored.  Will not clear up after 10 minutes of running it.  Gross.
1.0	Bought two. Neither worked turn on front porch light.  Purchased Westek Dusk to Dawn light control to try.  Working fine so far for 2 weeks.
1.0	Somebody must be crazy to think  one lightbulb should cost $7.00 or whatever it was.  I thought I was ordering 25 0f them as the small print said (case of 25).  Imagine my surprise when one lightbulb arrived for that price!  Amazon was great though and I returned it for a full refund.
1.0	Couldn't make it work!
1.0	Was not impressed with this item. My umbrella pole did not fit without inserting shims. And when I did,  the first light breeze and the stand fell over.
1.0	Needs to be pic of the mounting kit because that's what it is. Not a medicine cabinet.
1.0	One was good and one was broke.  I tried and the person I bought another one for tried but it just didn't lock.  I do like the one I have that works.
1.0	Poor quality, and packaging. The liner is incredibly thin and flimsy, and doesn't fit inside a standard paint tray.  Also, the photo is of a clear liner, that appears thick.  I was sent a garbage bag thin white liner.
1.0	I don't recommend the Titan SCR2 tankless water heater. It never performed well. Then failed completely. I will replace mine with a better product from a reputable company.
1.0	only beeps when line is broken, so if a car moves past it's beam it will beep just a few times.  So if you are not in the location of the speaker, how are you going to know someone is in your driveway?
1.0	"Looks ok, and mounts easily over a 4x4 post (48\\"" must be above ground). However the mailbox shelf is shockingly flimsy/poorly mounted, and can be easily moved from side to side (yes, I did install it correctly). I will have to figure some addition mounting brackets just to make it minimally acceptable."
1.0	Light is not wired correctly.  It lights up but that's it.  The switch will not turn it OFF.  Also there is no AUTO mode as its always on.
1.0	Not sure if this is for sale in 2013 anymore but after around 7 years this is toast. You'd wonder in modern times it would last longer. The comments out there are not favorable on this insinkerator. Sounds like I'm the lucky one apparently. Appliances should last long time.
1.0	This flow rate of 10 GPM is very miss-leading.  You also need to read the chart that is provided.  For NC this unit will only heat 2 to 2.5 GPM, which will probably cover your shower, with a small faucet head and your sinks.  You would think they would simply say that like many of the other units listed for sale (heats 2GPM on average in mild temperatures).  Please understand that it will also cost about $500 or more to have it installed.  So be sure you have the right size unit because the larger the size the costly the installation.  If you need to upgrade the size of the unit, all wiring will need to be changed which means hundreds more dollars depending on the amount of wire needed to connect the unit to the breaker box.  One good thing is they are willing to make an exchange but the question will be, can you afford it based on the fact that you will have to change all of the wiring and the breakers. The second issue is, if you have a single hand faucet for the hot and cold water,  it is hard to get warm water.  It will either be hot or cold. When I try to adjust the faucet from all hot and move it toward the middle, not to the middle, it comes out cold.  I think it's great to have continuous hot water but make sure you have the right size because changing it will be very costly for the benefit.
1.0	I had great hopes for this oven liner, and as long as I didn't actually USE my oven it was great!  BUT as soon as I had the temp to 425 for an apple pie, the portion of the liner that was directly below the heating element melted or burned through, leaving a large hole under the element.  What's more, it was very difficult to clean the liner after it cooled...the apple pie syrup drippings were very  hard to clean.  Save yourself and buy a higher rated one, that's what I am doing, this liner is going to go under some houseplant pots.
1.0	These are not OEM quality, they are cheap plastic knobs.  I was looking to replace my original GE profile knobs and wanted the original high quality knobs, not these cheap imitations.
1.0	I am very serious.<br /><br />Not only does this paper product ship internationally in an unsupported plastic bag, but it took almost two WEEKS to arrive. The metal interior was bent and there are actually HOLES in the lantern.<br /><br />Given the time that it took to ship and the low cost, I just wrote it off and tossed them away. It is not even worth it to go through the return process.<br /><br />On top of all that, One of them shipped with a peanut shell in it. Haha, I am serious! Someones snack trash ended up going overseas and that is just creepy, gross and irresponsible.<br /><br />YOU ARE BASICALLY THROWING YOUR MONEY AWAY WHEN YOU ORDER THIS PRODUCT.
1.0	The Shade and Coponents were for a fan light and not adaptable as a Ceiling Light Fixture as advertised on the website.
1.0	What they send is the G2 series barrel valve with a sticker over the label with the Kt part number. Basicaly you pay for good KT but get cheap low temp rated G2.
1.0	This lava lamp became very murky and the &#34;lava&#34; became a cloudy glob. We returned it and tried another one and within two days it did the same thing. We used the manufacturers light bulb, followed the directions and didn't allow it to overheat. I wouldn't recommend this brand to anyone.
1.0	The driver did not dim as claimed.  The AC input was varied, as planned but the DC output did not reduce.
1.0	Puchased this item about 1 month ago. In this time frame I have used this pre-lit palm tree appx 2-3 times.<br />Now, one month later one of the top potions of the palm tree will not light up.<br />I would think twice about puchasing this expensive item .......
1.0	Took it out of the box and it never turned on. Tried for three days to charge the batteries and still nothing. Even tried know good batteries still no success.
1.0	This didn't even come out of the box.  It looks so crummy and cheap it had to do back. I've no idea what it sounds like but my guess is that it's cheap too.
1.0	What a piece of junk, don't waste your money.  Worked (dimly) for about three nights then quit completely.
1.0	This faucet was installed in a new house I had built.  It wasn't the faucet I was told I would get at the plumbing supply, but that's another story.  This faucet is a terrible design. The control buttons for spray or stream is on the top of the wand and it's very, very hard to push, even once you've pulled the thing out of the base - which isn't easy either. It has to be jerked out and shoved back in.  The hose kinks if you try and do any maneuver with the spray wand unless you swivel the faucet base in the direction you want to use it.  I put up with it for 10 months, when the spray/stream function quit working.  I thought it was the aerator (which has 9 parts!!!), but wasn't, so I bought a nicer looking Delta for about $50 more, with the old conventional separate spray which goes wherever I want it to.  I know I'll get squirted now and then but it's preferable to fighting with a faucet just to use it.  I disliked this faucet more than any I've ever used, and at 60+ - I've used plenty!
1.0	This &#34;magnetic&#34; primer doesn't work for regular magnets! I didn't know until after I received the item that it only works with rare earth magnets. This was hard to use/apply, hard to stir, not water soluble and doesn't work. Don't buy this!!!
1.0	I bought 2 spare bulbs.  One burned out in 2 1/2 weeks, the other was dead right out of the box.  It says right on the box not to use where there is vibration.  Hello, what do they think their fan is going to do ???  Perhaps we should not use the fan or the heater.<br /><br />Panasonic should be ashamed of this product and get a bulb that will work in this application!
1.0	No template to mount, the rails are shaking right off the bat (box!).  Absolutely no literature, not even a warranty card.  I'm not used to &#34;this&#34; Delta company.  The Delta I know was awesome.  This is in the mail already on it's way to the warehouse.  Stay clear.
1.0	These do NOT have  timer feature.  I turned them on and they were still on 12 hours later.
1.0	Although the product functions well, it better be used in a garage or other remote area.  Mine is in the laundry room and the clock groaning can be heard in the adjoining bath as well as the laundry room.  It was relatively quiet for 2 years then became noisy.  in addition, unless you live in an area with extremely expensive electric rates the $56.00 cost plus installation might put your payback time in the distant future.  Fortunately I installed my own but remember it is 220 volts we're talking about here. I have been told that the efficiency of current hot water heaters (better insulation etc.) makes the use of this clock to save money a dubious endeavor.
1.0	We have had 3 of these pumps in 10 years.  One was in the house when we bought it.  I have replaced the switches about 5 times.  This pump system is terrible. The switch usually would stick on and the motor would get very hot.  I have read that you need to maintain it by periodically replacing the switch.  I have had switches go out much earlier than expected in a couple years.  I don't think it is worth replacing a $30 switch every year.  Will not buy another Zoeller pump.  I will never be comfortable with this pump again since the last failure has flooded the basement.  Zoeller really needs to rethink this switch design.  Now the challenge will be to find a different reliable pump.
1.0	I REALLY wanted to like this product and hated giving such a horrible review but it didn't help the chip and crack in my bathroom sink at all! I also used the Sheffield 1126 Porcelain touch-up kit. I used this with the brush provided (big mistake) so I purchased a small/fine art brush in hopes that this would help. I used this filler for about a week (letting each light coat dry), sanding, and then applying again. I probably had a total of 4 coats (light coats that had dried for a day before applying another). The residue was gummy even after a week after the last coat was applied. I could take my fingernail and whisk it away which was very disappointing because I really wanted this product to work. I went ahead and applied the porcelain touch-up to see if that would help. It only helped the filler to match the color of my sink (which was a perfect match, by the way). The filler itself never hardened even under the touch-up. I had to make the daunting decision to just replace my sink altogether.<br /><br />If you do decide to purchase this please make sure the area is well ventilated as the odor is very strong!
1.0	I should have paid more attention to the bad reviews on this product--I wrongly figured that the bad reviews were written by crybabies, and that a GE product would be quite acceptable in the right hands. Actually, it's a piece of junk, poorly made, gives very little illumination, takes too many expensive batteries, and worst of all, quit working after two on/off cycles of the cheesy switch. Back she goes to Amazon. I was very happy with their return service, including printable RMA packing slip and prepaid USPS shipping lable!
1.0	This thing was cool.  I stuck it on my wall and my whole house turned rainbow colors at the touch of a button.  But then.  EVERYTHING IS ONLY SHADES OF RED NOW.  Solder connections broke a couple of days after I purchased it.  Received an email from the company to contact them if I had any issues and I contacted them and they didn't respond.  It was a good ride while it lasted though!
1.0	Worthless ripped the next day
1.0	Out of 36 reviews for this product, only three Amazon shoppers, according to my research, have made purchases from other vendors before June 2015. All 33 positive reviews read as if they were written by the same non-English speaking individual. Although &#34;verified purchases&#34;, it is apparent the 33 positive reviews were contracted. Disgusting and transparently deceptive.
1.0	Should have fit my door frame, but didn't.  Was on vaca when item arrived and didn't have chance to return -- now I'm stuck with a product that doesn't work for me.
1.0	No assembly instructions!
1.0	I would like to give this no stars. Did I recieve the wrong item? The decal I got is a slim bright green Christmas tree. There are all kinds of pieces to decorate it. The description states it's one large piece. I am very pregnant and on bed rest with a toddler. I can't run this to the post office to return and it was our alternative to a Christmas tree. How disappointing.
1.0	Fulfilled expectations.
1.0	The inner clasp piece on the inside of the safe is cheap, bendable metal.  Someone tried (and was successful) breaking into my safe just by prying it open.  What's the point?  You get what you pay for, I guess.
1.0	Pros: Bright, white light. Very flexible mounting options. Excellent motion sensor.    Cons: Poorly constructed. There was a condensation problem inside the light which ended up shorting out the electronics. The circuit boards are not protected from getting wet and there are no drain holes in the bottom of the unit. Customer service so far has not been responsive. So sad that this poorly engineered junk is on the market at this price range. I likely will re-build the unit using  high quality components and I'll fix the condensation problem!
1.0	It doesn't work, water shoots out from all over, I'm a builder and I just got my final city inspection and now finding out it doesn't work and it was 800 dollars, and u don't back up what usell because its past 30 days. When it's impossible for me to try it prior to final inspection. Seems like a scam to me.
1.0	I had read a number of positive reviews of the product. I have a air hammer issue with my water pipes and they are constantly banging when the water is shut off. The worst is when the LG washer is operating. I installed these right on the back of the washer like is suggested and was hopeful they would make a diffence. They made no difference in the sound at all coming from the pipes. Disappointed thought this would be easy quick fix at least when the washer was going.
1.0	I was very disappointed with this towel bar.  Compared to the Victorian stainless steel model that I purchased earlier, which I considered to be well manufactured this model was made cheaply.  The mounting tabs that attach to the wall are very flimsly compared to the Victorian, and the mounting brackets on the towel bar did not properly align so I had to loosen a screw to rotate bracket to get the thing to line up.  The bar itself is made of thinner tubing, and the stainless steel finish was tarnished.
1.0	I missed the deadline to return this product and regret it. Not useful and somewhat annoying with all the alerts.
1.0	One side of light won't work. I messaged the seller had no response. The side that works is fine
1.0	Ther bulb doesn't work.  Life issues kept me from returning the bulb by the return date<br />My excitement quickly evaporated.
1.0	Echoing the negative comments that have gone before, you'd think that if someone had taken the time to devise a timer for a SHOWER, it might be (a) waterproof, (b) equipped with a suction cup and not an adhesive pad that loses its stick in a steamy environment, and (c) audible above the sound of running water. Back to the drawing board, guys.
1.0	Very small and it came all separate. Each letter was basically separate and it took forever to put on the other sticker that it came with to put on the wall.
1.0	First of all, the decal isnt even attached to the transfer paper, which doing yourself is a total pain. Normally, I would just be annoyed and move on but with this decal it wasn't even close to worth the effort. Don't let the picture fool you, the decal is TINY. The vinyl is a joke, thin as thin can be, not to mention the letters were very very very crooked. I literally threw the whole decal away. Such a waste of my time and money.<br /><br />Do not purchase this, there is other's out there that may cost more, but you definitely get what you pay for!
1.0	This bulb is advertised as being over 800 lumen.  I just received this bulb and tried it.  The lumen output is about 200 at best.  my 15w regular bulb is brighter than this LED bulb.  I have other LED bulbs ranging from 5w, 7w and 9w. My 5w LED is at least twice as bright as this 9w LED.  This is the worst LED bulb I've bought so far and the most expensive lumen to dollar ratio.  I'd give it a 0 star if I could.
1.0	I bought a Mr Scrappy Wireless Control Switch on 4/16/12 from Wayfair, to go with my new garbage disposal purchased the same date.  The remote control switch stopped working on 2/12/13, and I was advised by Wayfair that there was no warranty.  So be aware that this product is made in China, and you will never know when it will stop working.  I did send a e-mail to the company (Joneca Corporation) to advise them of my problem.
1.0	All in all this is a pretty good little product. It gives off a lot of light and the light intensity is adjustable by using the power button and by adjusting how wide open you have the lantern. I love the fact that you can charge the lamp by using the crank or via USB. But at the same time the USB charging is also the problem because it's a DC to USB plug, which means you have to use the supplied cable. If you don't happen to have the supplied cable with you or have lost it you're out of luck. You won't be able to charge or power the lantern without it, and you won't be able to use the lantern to charge a cell phone in an emergency. I know the description states that it uses a DC to USB plug, but I don't think everyone is going to catch that. Considering how common micro-USB is I think this is a pretty big flaw and greatly reduced its overall functionality, especially in an emergency, and that is the reason for my low rating. Replace the the DC plug with a micro-USB port and I will gladly buy another and give it a 5 star rating.
1.0	HATE IT!! THE WORDS ARE ALL OVER THE PLACE!! AND IT'S WAAAY SMALLER THEN THE PICTURE!  IT'S PROBABLY AS BIG AS A PICTURE FRAM! I HOPE NO ONE BUYS FROM THESE PPL AGAIN!
1.0	I purchased the Kwikset from Lowes and have had issues the entire time!  The first one I purchased when I installed it the lock would not go in and out smoothly.  I realized there was an issue with the lock itself and exchanged it for what I though was a brand new one.  When I opened the box, which did have ties and shrink wrap around it, there were parts missing and it had obviously been used before.  I contacted Kwikset and asked for a replacement part.  It has been over a week and I am still waiting.  As well, the lock this time moves smoothly when I turn it by hand but cannot seem to get it to work with either the key or my cell phone.  I contacted Kwikset and heard nothing back.  Then I got an email saying I needed to reply or they were closing my case.  This lock is going back!  It has been a huge hassle and it has not worked at all, plus is still missing parts!
1.0	"The size isn't exactly 4\\"", as stated in search. It is actually 4 3/8\\"". Make sure you check the manufacturer info before ordering."
1.0	Threaded bungs are too close together to use fittings for 3/4 inch conduit, if you need to install 3 connections on the same end of the box. Fittings for 1/2 inch conduit barely clear each other when using 3 connections.
1.0	The condition of the box looked like it was picked out from the dump, fan's components were fine, so I thought. After installing I went to put the glass lighting fixture up. It was broken with a large hole in it. No broken glass in the box, which means it was boxed & shipped broken. I contacted CPO Outlets for a replacement bowl & was told to contact the manufacture. Excuse me? Unacceptable!
1.0	Misleading advertisement
1.0	I bought a 24 pack of these in Feb. 2011 and am almost through all of them by Feb. 2012.  I have only 4 outside lamps for these and they go bad very rapidly.  Don't buy them!
1.0	Sorry guys, I gotta be honest. Don't get me wrong, the lights work.... but not right!<br />It goes like this:<br />-Green light works when water is cold and warm<br />-Blue light works when water is hot<br />-Red light works when water is extremely hot<br /><br />Blue is supposed to be cold, Red is supposed to be Hot, and why does green exist?<br />Wouldn't recommend getting this
1.0	Garbage. Complete garbage. I threw it away.
1.0	i was excited to get this item but it didn't even turn on
1.0	Hi all,<br /><br />Well as you can see, most of my reviews are generally positive.  I purchased this red stick as well as a white stick.  These grease sticks or whatever you want to call them do work, but there are many reasons why I do not endorse them at all.  Here's why:<br /><br />-  I used these to fill in the indented fire control group letters as well as a logo.  This is not a precision product.  You will get it everywhere to fill in the indented letters<br />-  It's very difficult to remove and leaves a residue.  I hope someone else whose used this can email me back or post on my review some instructions or product that will allow me to remove the residue.<br /><br />Red:<br />I also purchased Red. It is not a true red. It's like a pinkish red.  it is NOTHING like the red as shown in their product pic.  Do not be deceived.
1.0	This lamp made it through about three months of light use and broke. Replaced the bulb to no avail.  Now I am out 60 bucks plus the replacement bulbs. Drat! Beware!
1.0	I had this installed professionally a year ago. 2 of the handles which kept getting loose stripped themselves so will no longer connect. Then to make matters worse, when the middle knob is set to shower about 25% of the water still comes out the tub spout. I will NEVER buy another Kingston brass product again.
1.0	It took a month to get, however that wasnt the problem, the color of it is teal not neon green.
1.0	Wld not hook up to wifi 2.4 (
1.0	The hardware had several paint and metal flaws.
1.0	Too sticky on both sides....put it on my screen door and all it did was attract tiny bugs to stick on the tape...it is a darker color than the screen and did not blend in well.....very disappointed
1.0	I ordered the Xhose Pro (w/ brass connections) in May 2013, didn't even receive my order until October due to backorder that I was not informed about until I called multiple times. I used the hose maybe 3 times but it appeared to kink /block. By December it had burst inside and water was coming out the middle of the hose. Got replacements under the &#34;lifetime warranty&#34;  Those both burst within 2-3 months also. Got another replacement set. 1 had a bad connection from 1st use (water squirts out at main connection) and 2nd hose just burst, been 2 months of daily use. Company will only replace under &#34;lifetime warranty&#34;  twice. After which you have to mail them your broken hoses + a check/money order for shipping and handling of each replacement hose ($8.95 each). Rip off. Please don't waste your money.
1.0	We searched the internet for the gasket that will fit the Jennair 27&#34; wall oven.<br />This came as a fit and we bought it.<br />It is not a fit. The pins do not match the wholes and we had to move almost all the pins in order to fit it.<br />This is not easy to do, even if you are very skilled in fixing things around the house.
1.0	Cons - Functionality.  Towel warmer barely warms the towels. I can grasp the towel warmer at full strength with no discomfort so<br />I'm guessing the temperature maxes out at around 100 degrees.<br /><br />Pros- installation was easy, and aesthetically it's very nice looking.
1.0	I used it to hold an inline 6 for my old Jeep.  It barely supported the weight.  I was always waiting for the engine to snap off and smash my foot like a giant mousetrap.  Between this and the cheap &#34;Best Choice' hoist that I used, I only felt safe with BOTH attached at once.
1.0	Product does not work at all. Tried both a load of towels and a load of regular clothing. Used as directed and even tried the longer settings to get rid of the smell and after eveything was done the smell is still there.
1.0	I needed a bit more than 100 feet for my corded lawnmower, so I used this to connect a 50 and a 100 foot cord.  But, since I use a reel to store the cord, it puts stress on the connection.  This box does NOT keep the two cords connected.  At least it is easy enough to open to reconnect, but it just doesn't do what I want.<br />This is probably good if you're not reeling in your cord often, but for my use it keeps coming apart.  Actually, the picture does the best job of showing how it doesn't work; that's the way mine always looks when I open it up.<br />On the plus side, the color is great to see in the snow.<br />If you're reeling in your cord ever, I'd avoid this one.
1.0	I thought I'd save some money and buy a no name brand version. Bad idea. Water had a bad plasticy after taste that never went away even after gallons of flushing. Ended up going back to buying the Amana name brand and now water taste great. I guess you get what you pay for.
1.0	The holes for the bolts were broken the either because the package was open or that it was just poorly made or both. I'm still not clear on how this thing fits into my router. And the this has this yellow hue that is really annoying.
1.0	Cannot be used to replace an existing outlet as it doesn't fit in a typical electrical box filled with wires.
1.0	I found this lock in one of my wife's bins.  It's locked open, and she forgot the combo.<br /><br />I've never picked a lock before.  But I managed to get this one open on intuition alone.<br /><br />Here's how I did it.  Remember it was locked in the open position:<br /><br />1.  I pressed down on the lock to put a bit of tension on the combo dials<br />2.  I slowly rotate each dial.  Two of the dials will rotate with relatively even tension.  One dial will have a sudden loosening of tension.  This is one of the combo. Then with the same tension, rotate one of the other two wheels.  One will have a sudden loosening.  Repeat with the third wheel.  That's it.<br />3.  If it's locked closed, pull on the lock rather than pressing down on it.
1.0	Don't waste you money.  Not sticky at all.  Wouldn't trust it to tape and 1st grader's picture to the refrigerator.
1.0	Be sure you know what you are buying.<br />I had purchased several A19 bulbs which were made by LG at Costco<br />These bulbs closely resemble what I got at Costco, but are NOT<br />made by LG.  My bad.<br />The price I paid at Costco was around $5 or $6 each, and not only did<br />the A19 match the LG brand, but the picture of these looked the same.<br />I'm sure this was not by accident..... they appear to be knock-offs<br />made by some other company.<br /><br />Also, the reviews of this bulb indicate they are NOT same quality.<br />I have around 15 of the LG and have had ZERO problems.  One of the<br />2 I got has quit working and the other one is no where as bright as<br />the LB brand that it resembles.  Since these cost the same as the LG<br />that I got at Costco and are not as bright, I will give these bulbs<br />a ONE star.<br /><br />I will be more careful in the future, but I sure wish Amazon would do<br />a better job of policing their vendors and take care of their customers.
1.0	Agree with others, stopped working after 5 weeks. More crap from china, don't buy!
1.0	I bought this rod for a window 100&#34; wide.  It took a while before I have a chance to open the package, it is NOT 120&#34;  the most I can make it is 90&#34;.  I now cannot return the product, I have never had this happen before from Amazon, and therefore the security for taking my time in opening the package, now I am out of luck  How can a product be so far off?
1.0	I purchased this remote because it has a rolling code and thus should be compatible with any garage door motor.  However, it did not work with my Craftsman 139 (built in 12/04).  It is not a universal remote.
1.0	The product you will receive is not the same as the product that is pictured. The bulb still worked for me though, I just had to disassemble it and put the bulb into my original bulb housing on my TV.
1.0	THIS ALARM DOES NOT BARK LIKE A DOG. WHEN I BOUGHT IT, I THOUGHT IT BARKED. I DON'T NO WHY THEY CALL IT A WATCHDOG DOOR KNOB ALARM. IT SOUNDS LIKE A LOUD CHIRPING BIRD. IT IS VERY SENSATIVE EVEN WHEN YOU WALK BY IT.
1.0	This item is a piece of junk and does not work.
1.0	If you buy this, save yourself potential headache and IMMEDIATELY call the Brita 800 # and ask for metal connectors. I haven't had success keeping the connection tight without the metal ones. The cheap plastic connectors included in the original package are almost guaranteed to fail. Brita must know this...I wish they would fix this problem and just include the metal ones standard.
1.0	The part does not fit properly into the tube.
1.0	Very orange-colored than I would have liked.  Does not resemble a natural giraffe hue at all.  More like traffic control tape.
1.0	Used this outside to keep a pool supply box closed.  Lock was rusted in a week.
1.0	Just got this shower head last night and am returning it. The head is too heavy for the mount resulting in the head swinging down plus it elevates the head to high. I thought the ecoflow would adjust to almost no flow but theres still a significant amount coming out at the lowest setting.  I decided to not experiment anymore and just get the PW Shower Flow Controller valve from Menards and get a shower head I like. This flow controller is easier to control and easily screws to the shower pipe. I can shut the flow if i want to.  I'm using it in our other bathroom and am happy with it. Its only $4.97.
1.0	wrong size my fault, had to return
1.0	Worst customer service experience I've ever received. I was on hold for 45 minutes until I got a supervisor. I called because my unit broke and was still under warranty. I called once and troubleshooter with Honeywell's tech department and the unit still did not work. I called back this second time and was told I had to go through Amazon.com for the warranty. When I called Amazon.com they told me it was Honeywell. So I called back with Amazon.com on the line, which is when I was on hold for 45 minutes. They still haven't honored their warranty because they need me to troubleshoot it AGAIN! I'M GOING NEST OR ECCO NEXT TIME!! NOT WORTH MY TIME AND AGGREVATION.
1.0	Description not accurate
1.0	This product is made of cheap nylon material that slides off the door EVERY time the door is opened. It does not fit snugly between the door and the door frame and cold air still comes in. The only way I think this can be salvaged is to put velcro on the bottom of the door and on the top of the draft guard and attach it. Very disappointing and a total waste of money.
1.0	Recently one of my knobs started spinning on the shaft that turns on a burner. Took it off and found the stem was cracked. I checked the other four knobs and three of them are in various stages of getting ready to fail as evidence by cracks on both sides of the shaft. The one that isn't ready to fail is on a seldom used burner. When I checked the prices online I saw around $30 which I figured wasn't bad for a set of five knobs but then I realized that was for a single knob. If I buy four knobs that's $120 plus tax and shipping. Amazon's price is less but I'm still looking at around $80 to replace four cheap plastic knobs. I'm going to attempt to repair them with JB Weld.<br /><br />The cooktop itself works great but LG is ripping people off on these replacement knobs so I'll think twice before buying another LG product. I once had a broken knob on a previous non LG cooktop. I think I paid $20 for a set of four.
1.0	These are just plain butt connectors. They are not adhesive lined as described. Do not buy if you want a watertight connection.
1.0	The instructions to put the item together are on a very small slip of paper with very vague directions. Cans are constantly getting jammed instead of falling out like they are supposed to. They way the lever is set up makes it very awkward to use.
1.0	The Gonesh Incense Cones are the worst.  No matter how I tried to light them, I was never successful.  Very disappointing!
1.0	Although advertised as &#34;universal&#34;...  Did not work with my gate and had to order a special remote that required additional pin dip switches.
1.0	First, when I buy a ceiling light I expect it to use standard medium E27 screw base light sockets. The included GU24 two pin base fluorescent bulbs might be fine but since I've never seen them before in my life I don't want them in my house.  I have plenty of CF bulbs that I'd rather use than go on a scavenger hunt to find theirs.<br /><br />Second, since the fixture is designed for a maximum 18 watt bulbs (not 3x60W = 180W as I read it), all of the wiring is 18 gage rather than the 14 or 16 gage commonly used.  I had planned to use 2-40W CFs and 1- 60 W incandescent since this is replacing a four bulb ceiling fan and the room needs the light.  If the fixture used standard base sockets my two CFs alone would have overloaded it.<br /><br />All of the wiring is rated for 90°C, which is fine, but there is no insulation inside the base.  If your house has a draft problem you will probably notice cold air leaking through the fixture whenever the lights are off.  I'm not sure how Energy Star certification is worth much if it doesn't take things like this into account.<br /><br />The fixture looks nice but if you're expecting a normal fixture then this will seem very underbuilt.  With products like this one on the market I would rather buy from a brick and mortar store so I could see what I am getting.
1.0	"After searching for a new septic aerator I found flagg-air at [...].  I read the info on the website and seen that they said they have been making aerators back in the 80s till now.  long story short we ordered one.  It till them some time to get in parts they needed (called into to find out when it would be here) because they said \\"" we are waiting for he manufacture to send up some parts \\"".  We got the aerator at the house and I was shocked at how lite it was.  I could not see how something so cheaply made could last but we tried it anyway.  Less then a month or so later it locked up.  We contacted septicsuppliesinc and told them what happened and we UPSed the aerator back to them.  When next we contacted septicsuppliesinc they said our aerator was under water is why it failed and refused to fix it.  The system was just installed and flowing with no problem.  We have video tape of over a month flowing freely without an aerator (it has been over 6 months and we have not even gotten the old aerator from them back so we got a new one and it has been working with no problems ).  After them refusing to repair this cheaply made product ( look closely it does look like a washing machine motor attached to a shaft up close also ) and seeing pictures or the water damage ( caused by condensation not by an overflowing septic system ) I looked alittle more closely at this product and flagg-air itself.  This aerator has no condensation protection at all.  It is made from thin metal at turns so fast that the motor gets hot.  If your system is on a timer then once it turns off the hot motor will draw condensation and with no protection you will get damage.  Another thing is that the \\"" been making aerators back in the 80s \\"" is not even close.  Flagg-air is a trademark.  It is owned by septicservicesinc which owns septicsupplies and any of the other websites selling this cheaply made product. It was not even a registored trademark till 2010 so the website is very misleading.  I contacted septicservicesinc by phone asking for the phone number for flagg-air. I kept getting the run-around from them.  Even when I demanded for a phone number they would not admit that flagg-air is an inhouse brand.  This product is very cheaply made.  The only website with any info on this product ( other then amazon ) is owned by the makers of the product ( more then one website all shipping out of the same building with more then one phone number traced by google maps ).      I am hoping this information will keep someone else from have the problems I had with this product.  I am also going to post this info on the -j because they are more or less the same motor (looks like a maytag with a air port on top to me ).  Stay away from this product if you want it to last more then a month or two."
1.0	I purchased this to replace a smaller size shower head fixture (in an effort to match the existing one). I was really disappointed in the spray, it is very weak, it seems worse than other water saving models I have tried in the past. I ended up taking it off and replacing it with another brand. I have been happy with other Moen fixtures I have purchased, but this particular one was a miss.
1.0	Cheapiy made, cracked in half (not fixable) during instillation so never got to use it.
1.0	I order one of these and received it, it was damaged.  Returned it the same and which generated another order.  Received the second one and it's CHROME not aged bronze.  What in the world is going on?  Maybe 3rd time is a charm with this company?
1.0	I use this all the time
1.0	"Warning...the box is designed for installation before the sheetrock goes on.  No instructions are provided to install it in an existing wall.  I had to heavily modify the box - I cut off the install tabs and enlarged the box's tube hole to get it on the hard metal vent coming down the wall.  Plus it was very difficult to cut the metal vent inside the 3 1/2\\"" wide wall without damaging the sheetrock.  For all the trouble I only eliminated one 90 degree turn, so not sure the box was worth it.  Suggest using a box truly designed for aftermarket use with better install instructions."
1.0	About a week after we installed the first one, it started chirping (like a low battery warning).  We swapped the battery and after a few days it started chirping again.  We returned it for a replacement, but the same thing happened to the second unit.  I tested the batteries and they were fully charged.  This may be just a faulty lot of detectors.  We will be returning the second unit and looking for another model that we can depend on.
1.0	I got thee hooks to hold a flag for display on July 4.  I am disappointed.  I put the hooks out about two weeks in advance so they would have time to set.  As soon as I put any weight from the flag on the hook it came off.  I would recommend these hooks only for the lightest and unbreakable items.
1.0	I received this panel damaged and exchanged it for another one.  It arrived damaged. I exchanged it for a third one which also arrived damaged even though the outer box was not.  I am sending it back for a refund. I'm sure this is a great panel.  I really like the fact that it is generator ready and that you don't have to buy a second panel for a generator hookup. I hope someone has better luck getting this in usable condition. The three that I had would never pass an electrical inspection.<br />At least I can return them without any fuss.
1.0	Item arrived broken, badly damaged. The item was a CFL light which is known to have mercury, so the mere fact that it was cracked upon arrival was beyond worrisome. Add to that the product didn't even arrive on the date it was supposed to.
1.0	Very hard to work with.  Covers wood unevenly.  Minwax stains in the can (liquid) are impressive and easy to work with but their use of a stain cloth is a total failure.  I bought all five of the avaible colors and am disgusted with all of them; I'll stick to liquids and gels!
1.0	I live in a very old, drafty townhouse. We could see light under our front door and drafts were definitely a major problem. This draft stopper was not what I expected, but works. I had seen other draft stops and they were all pretty heavy so I was surprised when I opened this one up and it was so light. It fits perfectly for my standard size front door. Will save us money this winter.     UPDATE: It is impossible to close the front door when the foam roller on the outside gets wet from rain or snow. It gets stuck on our wood floors when the door is opened and won't budge. Very frustrating. I ended up just taking it off and don't plan on putting it back on. Waste of money.
1.0	I was very very disappointed at the size of these lamps.  I guess I forgot to check the dimensions.  These things are tiny.  They are not table lamps.  I really don't know who would want to buy these little things but I made a huge mistake.
1.0	I received the bellow in 4 days instead of the 2 day prime...huh..wonder why i pay for prime then......on i got the bellow i installed it.....last one i installed 2 yrs ago...an this new one is already went to s***..........if i was you id buy 2..na..make it 3.........thanks everyone
1.0	Cheaply made but it is made in China. What a waste  of ten bucks minus a penny
1.0	I was looking forward for the arrival of the item because my old cash box broke. Unfortunately, when I received the box, I feel like I've just wasted 30 bucks. The lock was broken and the numbers will barely turn. I can't even lock the box and hold it with the handle properly without the box coming apart. This is the worst thing I've gotten from Amazon EVER!!!!!
1.0	Not worth fiddling with this thing. Didn't really work for me, I tried it with 100-feet of outdoor extension cord. Wouldn't buy again.
1.0	Bought this remote from Home Depot for my 2-year-old's room.  A week later during a thunderstorm at night, our power went out and when it came back on the light turned on and woke her up.  What a terrible design!  Not only is this remote going to wake you up at night if the power is interrupted, if you happen to be on vacation and that happens, it's going to waste electricity until you get home.  (Yep, I checked the user manual and in the fine print it says that's what it does, so this is the way it's designed--I didn't get a faulty remote.)
1.0	I threw them all away. Very brittle plastic that will crack with the slightest tightening. I expected more from Leviton. Went to Menards and bought some wallplates that worked much better and were a lot more forgiving on tightening.
1.0	I just purchased these recently and was really liking them. They are strong and sturdy.  I have been using them for water, and I even started to use them for my protein drink mixture when I go to the gym.  They are a nice size and the lids seem to keep a good seal, though other reviews said they didn't.  I shake up my protein drink all the time and have not had them leak. The problem I noticed today is the inside of the cap and seal.  I would just throw them in the dishwasher.  Well I notice that the lids have a small white seal to keep the contents from spilling.  Well I was just staring at my cap today, and noticed this black stuff in there, has to be mold.  I tried to wash the cap out with soap and water, but it was still there.  I am looking at it and realized its inside there.  I didn't realize the seal can come out, though its not easy to remove.  I used an exacto knife and it came out pretty easily.  Then sure enough I was able to remove the black mold that was in there between the seal and cap. Yuck!  I put the seal back in and don't know if it will keep the same seal now or fall out easily.  But now I will have to very carefully clean these caps all of the time and examine them.  Seems like moisture easily gets under the seal in the cap.  So a newly designed cap would be ideal.  I like the bottles though and will still use them, will just have to carefully clean the caps and seals now and probably not put them in the dishwasher any longer....
1.0	Don't waste your time or money.  The pry tools are break easily and don't really fit. It was much better to use a razor blade
1.0	I assembled the lights,  one was not lighting up.  I removed the bulb, SPARK!  That was end of that. The lighting provided 5 minutes of enjoyment,  What a rip off.<br /><br />Update:  I contacted the manufacture and they sent me a replacement transformer, no questions asked. This one has a built in reset button.  Not sure why that wasn't included in the first place.  Hopefully it will work.
1.0	I decided to give a shot to this product a couple of month ago... Works fine for 2 weeks and then... NOTHING ! Received a new unit, works fine for 2 months and just died again. I finally decided to replace this product by a Saniflo unit and I couldn't be happier !! The Saniflo unit works like a champ for almost a year now !!
1.0	I have never given 1 star to any other product here in Amazon. But I had to give  a low rating as I don’t think this product is ready for use. I have a plastic toilet seat and so I didn’t want to buy bumpers with screws. I decided to use this product that sticks to toilet seat. The package contains 4 bumpers as shown in the product photo’s and a rectangular adhesive tape with bumper shape perforations. One side of the tape sticks to the bumper and the other side goes on to the toilet seat.  The tape adhesive is of poor quality and cannot hold the bumpers. 3 of the 4 bumpers came off in less than a week. The tape is still sticking to the seat but the bumpers are gone.
1.0	Good, heavy heat shrink tubing, but was supposed to be 10 or 12 inches long per the description. I received one 7 inch piece in the package. I needed two 5 inch pieces for the job I was doing. Total rip off for the price. Don't waste your money.
1.0	I regretted buying, very poor quality. but for the price, I would have returned it! vent opener is poorly designed, very fragile and rips off easily. Buy something else, I hate it!<br /><br />PA.
1.0	Did not work.  It will not shut off.  We tried covering it, laying stuff over it ,etc.  It just will not shut off.  Don't buy this item.  It doesn't work.
1.0	Junk! Each of the 3 leaked worse than the last.
1.0	Not what I expected....not well made....looks are misleading
1.0	This is not for a sink, maybe a bathtub or shower but not for the sink.  This also needs special handling to return?????
1.0	Update: Stopped working after 3 months. Troubleshooting indicates the solar cell failed.<br />Yes, there are 200 LEDs. However, at least 8 feet of the string near the power source does not have any LEDs. So if you are buying these, know that they only cover about 64 feet (4 less than I needed). Also, there are supposed to be a lot of different operational modes. I get more modes now than the first night. Alternate blinking is a nice effect. It's summer, and they are lasting all night.
1.0	We absolutely loved this nightlight. We used it in the bathroom for the nighttime trips as well as in the morning, while you are still adjusting to being awake. The motion sensor worked perfectly and the light was just right. And it looks very attractive. However, in the 5th week of using it, it burned out! Amazon's returns policy only accepts electronic returns within 30 days. I emailed Amazon but did not receive a response. So, buyer be warned - it's the luck of the draw. (I am, however, ordering another. Let's see what happens.)  ** Update: The second nightlight worked great for a week and then would not turn off! Sadly, returning this one as well. The search continues for a motion detecting night light.  ** Update 2: The third night light worked from Sept until Jan. A decent run, I guess. But is that OK? Not to me. I won't be buying these again and am asking Amazon for a refund.
1.0	disappointed - these are HUGE not at all lifelike and ugly from the back
1.0	Had to return. Bulbs stopped working after a week of use. Some were dead on arrival. Go buy brand name bulbs or just go to your local hardware store. Buying these online was a waste of my time.
1.0	I bought this based on the positive reviews here. My AC/furnace is standard issue, nothing special.<br />Buyer beware: Using this filter could kill your HVAC system before its time.<br /><br />I measured the pressure drop across this filter (at heating speed, which is lower than the AC speed, so things are even worse in AC mode). The filter (in 20x25, smaller sizes would be worse) with a furnace that's supposed to get 1650 CFM of air dropped 0.23 in wc (brand new filter, so things are bound to get worse). That's half of what the system is rated for - but it still needs to get through the AC coil, the supply ducts, and the return ducts! Using it all on the filter leaves nothing for the rest of the system! This restriction will cause insufficient airflow, resulting in a cracked heat exchanger, iced AC coil (potentially leading to compressor death).<br />For comparison, the EZflow II dropped 0.05 in wc<br /><br />To me, this means I will have to find another way to clean my air.
1.0	No Hardware for installation is included. No hose, no filter, no mount.
1.0	This lamp was described as having a four inch magnifying area when it is actually only 3.5 inches.  I could have purchased the same lamp from another vendor for half the price or less.  Not happy about this.
1.0	this is terrible!!! It stopped painting after 30 seconds!!! Do not buy!!!
1.0	Be careful.  Avertised size to fit Lennox  furnace with 20x25x5 unit but does not fit.  And for me they would not honor an exchange, so I am stuck with $60 unusable filters.  Thickness of filter is really a full 5&#34; and does not fit into my 4.5&#34; opening..
1.0	Just stopped working for no reason after only 5 months! Have no idea what happened. Just stopped working for no reason.
1.0	Certainly not worth the price! More like a dust cover than a test cap. Seems to me the description was not complete as usual.
1.0	It doesn't block the sun at all.  Not happy about the product!
1.0	How frustrating to find that this timer buzzes loudly working with my bathroom exhaust fan. The fan is new, having been installed with the timer and is small and modest as fans go. When I first heard the loud buzzing, I thought the fan was failing. I had thought the timer was solid state, but apparently there is a relay or contacter inside it that is going nuts. Well, I'm not going to allow this thing to burn down my house so it's coming out.<br /><br />What a waste. I expected better from Leviton. Maybe I fell for marketing hype. The reviews here seem to tell a story.<br /><br />I'll get a timer from a different company and be done with it.
1.0	Bought these expecting Leviton quality, ended up getting some knock off Chinese brand, much poorer quality.  They ended up not even being the right item, I ordered 8P8C (8 pin network), received 4P4C (4-pin telephone).  Look elsewhere for true Leviton parts!
1.0	This &#34;lantern&#34; did not include a lighting unit for the bulb.  Poor poor poor- threw the lantern away since it's useless.
1.0	To save a few pennies, Honeywell made this switch with thin gauge stranded aluminium wires. Highly dangerous when connecting to 12 or 14 gauge household copper wiring, without special precautions.
1.0	There is not much to say other than this product did not work.  The light bulb would not turn on.
1.0	I bought three of those. Two 2000W and one 1500W. The thermostats of the first two stopped working in the first year. The wall mount of the third one didn't fit in the holes of the heater. I do not recommend any of the Decorflame heaters.
1.0	Would have been nice if they were clearer about that - in the description it said &#34;aluminum, brass finish.&#34; But I thought that meant you had your choice of aluminum OR brass finish. Then I read one of the reviews that said it was solid brass, with solid brass screws...AND I BELIEVED THE REVIEWER! I should know better. But you can believe me - this is most certainly NOT brass.
1.0	These are crap!  Two out of the box went PFZZZT! immediately.  Not bothering with the other four.  Do not waste your time, money, or energy on these.
1.0	The chair slipped while I was attempting to sit down on it.  I hit the back of my head and sprained my wrist in the shower.  Thank God, I didn't hit the tile harder.
1.0	There are other mixed reviews but I can tell you I ignored the negative reviews thinking people were probably too stupid and didn't know what they were doing. I was wrong. The video image is useless at best.  It crops the image to the point you cannot view who is outside. There is absolutely NO adjustment. NONE! I purchased the sensor. Don't bother. Again tried adjusting the none existent settings, moving the sensor to different areas. No matter what I did, a person could walk up, ring the doorbell and walk away and I would get a shot of the back of their head. Don't waste your money.
1.0	While these lights initially worked great, one by one all but one light failed.  I contacted customer service at Northern International Inc. and they agreed to send me another twelve lights to replace the eleven that HAD failed and one that WOULD fail.<br />Unfortunately, they only sent one replacement.  Their customer service rep begrudgingly agreed to send the other eleven at a later date.  When the next package arrived there were eleven new lights inside, but none of them were the light I had purchased.<br /><br />I am still waiting for them to send the correct replacements.<br /><br />Bottom line...poor product backed with incompetent customer service.
1.0	The product looks great design wise but we had to rewire half the piece. DO NOT PURCHASE IF YOU DO NOT HAVE ELECTRICAL SKILLS.  When I received it I did not install it right away do to renovations that ended up taking place so, the return time has passed. Once we put it in two of the lights would not light up.  We checked them and realized that the wires were not connected to them. The wires were not even close so we had to take the fixture down and add wire to fix.  5 days after we had the light installed 2 of the bulbs burned out.
1.0	Onlly utilizes one socket for all 6 outlets.  Junk.
1.0	They were in a box. No padding. Not shocked one was shattered and the other one barely stands up straight. It's also covered with dirt like someone splashed mud on it. Not happy at all and certainly not wasting my money to send them back
1.0	The height adjustment slider part does not stay in place, it keep sliding  around and down even when in locked position. Would not recommend this product.
1.0	The original unit had a 10 year warranty and died after three years - they sent me a new replacement that has only a 2 year warranty.<br />That unit just died a week after the 2 years warranty.  It serves no-good having these units malfunction when they're supposed to be providing security and safety.
1.0	Ordered two of this item to run. Defective, will only display red color. No other colors will display. Will be returning and asking for refund.
1.0	I bought a new faucet and It arrived without some pieces :( . I can't install it. The interior envelops were oppend.
1.0	"Let me start by saying that this item looks NOTHING like it looks in the picture. Here it looks like it might be a light pink/white. It is actually a weird \\""natural\\"" color and the base looks so cheaply done that I CANNOT believe they charge $94 for this. I rarely write negative reviews on websites, but this thing is so disgusting I couldn't help myself. I hope I can stop at lease ONE person from buying this thing.<br /><br />To add insult to injury, the lamp was missing a vital component, so that I cannot connect the base to the lampshade.<br /><br />I'm not a fan."
1.0	This was not an Amazon purchase. I bought mine on E-bay.<br /><br />Right out of the box I had my doubts about this stand. It looked to be made of a very thin metal. The clamp, except for the bolt, is a medium grade plastic that could conceivably break if you tightened it up too much.<br /><br />When I went to set mine up the telescoping poles would not stay up. I never got the chance to see if this unit would hold up to the weight of a Dremel. I do believe that if something happened that would cause you to jerk the flex shaft this stand could easily bend. I don't think it could take any abuse at all.<br /><br />I returned mine for a refund. Even if they sent me another one I don't want it because I don't think it will hold up.<br /><br />Conclusion;<br /> I am going to build my own stand. When I end here I'm going to Google the terms Dremel stand DIY . I already have an idea but I want to see how others do it. Some of these units they want $35 for not including shipping. I think I can make one far cheaper than that.
1.0	Didn't come with a key to program the combination so totally worthless.....<br />I would not order it again<br />Not worth it.
1.0	Go to Mennards or Lowes or Home Depot and get an $11.00 Cooper instead. You will be happy you did.
1.0	UPDATE JAN 2016: These used to be the best, bar none. Not so anymore. Based on the last two boxes we received (Nov 2015 and Jan 2016) it appears they've changed the formula. They're much harder to break into individual squares and there's far less wax content. Where previously they broke apart easily and lit instantly, these are a nightmare to separate without getting dusty tidbits all over and are actually quite difficult to light which defeats the entire purpose. I thought perhaps I got one bad box, but this newest box is the same if not worse. I won't be buying these anymore.<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW: Quit frustrating yourself with rolled newspaper, fire starter gels and other starter logs. These are the goods. One or two squares is plenty to get our woodstove going. No kindling necessary if the wood is properly seasoned.
1.0	It's ok I guess<br />Haven't put it together yet.<br />Lots of pieces.
1.0	Both broke very quickly after purchasing. Not sure what happened to them but they are called WORK lights, they should be more durable than they are.
1.0	do not waste the money the gun had issue.will not work.leak air all over.go to -and -.
1.0	The wall plate that I received was only 8 1/4 inches wide vs 9.2 in the spec sheet.  Check dimensions closely, these come in different sizes.  Not sure if Leviton has wrong spec or Amazon pulled wrong pc.
1.0	Don't waste your money. After days in the scorching Florida sun, no glow could be found. They're a nice color green.
1.0	This is a &#34;Mini&#34; strobe light, very small.  Similar items can be found locally for less than $5.  This product description is misleading, and I thought I was ordering a larger product that justified the higher price. Very disappointed, will keep because to send it back would waste the money I could save buying it elsewhere. Seems to work ok, although smaller so not as bright as I expected.  Fine product if you know what you are getting, just know it is a &#34;mini&#34; strobe light, not a full size.
1.0	WILL NOT HOLD RECOMMENDED CAPACITY; USED FIVE TIMES. FOURTH TIME THE FRONT WHEEL CAME OFF AND FRONT PIPE BENT ABOVE WHEEL. TIGHTENED ALL NUTS DOWN WITH A WRENCH. AFTER STRAIGHTENING THE BENT PIPE ,FIFTH TIME OUT THE REAR WHEEL'S BOTH BROKE AT AXLE. DON'T BUY THIS; IT IS GARBAGE. GET ONE WITH STEEL WHEELS FRONT & BACK.
1.0	Horrible. It's actually hard to read with... I gave up trying to use this after a hour or so....the light isn't focused well on the page..it doesn't hold well on the page/book etc....then after awhile the light became very dim. If it wasn't' so cheap I would send it back. It's hardly worth all the effort for a $3.99 refund.
1.0	I definitely do not recommend buying this.  The actual lamp really does look nice when it is all set up. Unfortunately, assembly of this lamp was easily the worst experience I've ever had. I won't even bother going there because I'm not interested in writing about that nightmare. Trust me, it's not worth it.  Even after everything was assembled, the switches you twist to turn each individual lamp on - they break. I have to replace the bulbs on average every 4-6 weeks because they burn out. There are much better options. You get what you pay for. There is a reason this lamp is cheap.
1.0	I am so tired of ordering simple things and getting plastic that gives off toxic fumes because the Chinese make unsafe plastic.    Personally, I will pay extra to avoid made in China products.  This stupid light switch is back in the container a few feet away and I can still smell it and my eyes are itchy.    I never ever use any Chinese product when it comes to my motorcycle and cycle gear for safety reasons.  I'm adding electrical outlets to the ban.    Who imports this stuff and why don't they pay any attention?  I want to know!
1.0	Followed instructions exactly. Product is easy to use and sets hard but not water tight so there's still enough of a leak to require the pipe to be replaced. Waste of money.
1.0	It will only last you for a couple of weeks.
1.0	I bought about ten of these.  After a year or two, three have failed due to leaking.
1.0	it barely has a scent. I am very disappointment. I do have their discount card, I will not be using this item again.
1.0	Don't fall for this!  It's just one refill!<br />There's a 24-pack of refills available for just four bucks more.<br />I made the mistake of assuming this item was a 24-pack, because all the other matches that came up when I searched for it were 24-packs.  If I realized that this item was just a single brush I never would have ordered it.
1.0	This transmitter did not work with my Liftmaster garage door as stated. I had to return it. Very disappointed because it is so cold out!
1.0	I got this lamp for my college dorm room, and i was really excited about it. but then i opened it up and try to turn the light on and nothing happened, so i got a new light bulb and tried again and still nothing. I sent back the first one i got, and they replaced it with a new one. I just got it today, and the same happened!! It would spark for like a second, and then go away. I recommend going with another company because i am highly disappointed.
1.0	It looks okay but  it is thin and not a good fit.  It was for the guest bathroom and no one likes it.
1.0	Does not work with my garage door opener.  No instruction on how to program and no compatibility chart to check if it works with my opener.  Waste of money.  Don't buy.  Can't even look up on the internet for information.
1.0	Waste of money. Comes with no hardware or instructions to mount it so you have to end up jerry rigging it to fit.
1.0	requires special can, does not fit regular 4 inch can...
1.0	Price for the item is cheap, so are the nozzels.    Shipping costs were more than the items, shades of Ebay to up the profits!
1.0	THE LAMP WORK GOOD THE FIRST FEW DAYS AFTER THAT WHEN IT ACTIVATE THE LIGHT STAY ON AND NEVER TURN OFF
1.0	This Sunpak solar charger and flashlight combo was a complete disappointment. I left it in the packaging for a few months. Then I tried to charge it with natural sunlight near a window for a whole afternoon. I tried again the next day. It never turned on. It never charged up. Only two solar lights I've purchased have worked. This one was a lemon. I'm glad I didn't wait till I really needed it in a power outage.
1.0	It's a sturdy toilet seat, but the veneer was already peeling when we installed it. We kept it because the other toilet seat was broken and really had no choice.
1.0	I replaced by expensive furnace filter that got clogged up pretty quickly. This one stays clean ALL the time for months. What does that tell me? That it's not filtering anything. I was hoping that at this price I could change my filter every 30 days, saving money and catching more dust and pollen. But it doesn't seem to stop anything. It might as well not be there.
1.0	Not what I expected but have to live with this purchase. Something that happens to us all from time to time.
1.0	Waste of my money, this arrived and did not work for a second. I used different sets of batteries more than once and still nothing. Horrible
1.0	cheap looking  Cheaply made  does not look like picture
1.0	I just received this product today. On two spots outside the box it says (1008) then one little tiny tag says (new 1009)<br />I then open the box, unzip the carrying case and inside is little tag that says (1008). I ORDERD A MR. LONG ARM 1009 which has another extension rod and price high then a1008 kit. NOW I HAVE TO RETURN IT AND WAIST ANOTHER 3-5 DAYS . HOPEFULLY IT WILL BE  RIGHT THIS TIME !!!!!!!!!!<br />Also there is no how to DVD inside either .<br />WILL SOMEONE THERE PLEASE GET IT RIGHT
1.0	I bought these thinking they were an upgrade from the &#34;Home Depot&#34; fasteners...  (Looked better in photo & were more expensive)  WRONG! These are a cheap imitation of the &#34;Home Depot&#34;  cheap ones!
1.0	I bought 10 boxes ended up with 2 different shades of tile they are super thin but very cheap guess I got wat I paid 4
1.0	This is a thin material which ripped the first time I attempted to put it on my seat. I didn't even want to waste the money to return it. It was in the trash within several minutes of opening it and was a very disappointing experience.
1.0	"My experiment with cheapo offshore LED bulbs has ended badly; after 67 days the last \\""HitLights\\"" one flickered its way to an untimely death. I ordered new ones this time from a different Amazon vendor and  [[ASIN:B007V1VO06 Lighting EVER Dimmable 4W GU10 LED Bulbs, 35W Equivalent, Recessed Lighting, Track Lighting, Warm White]] it's too early to tell how they'll hold up, but the bulbs seem to be of a higher quality and the packaging is better. Avoid the HitLights bulbs."
1.0	Good knife, but mine had been used, dents and scratches in it. It was labeled as new.
1.0	The product failed during installation.  The door latch has a soft plastic retainer that is supposed to hold the bolt and spring in the unit.  This plastic - where a metal stud or screw should be - is remarkably poor design and workmanship.  This is an example of down-engineering to save money in manufacture.  Don't buy this.
1.0	Tube arrived on time and fit my lamp perfectly.  I am an avid reader and it lights my material so I do not strain my eyes from reading many hours.
1.0	The bulb brunt the plastic because the bulb socket was angled so the bulb was too close to the plastic .At least the return went nice and smooth.
1.0	Not sure how the other people are reviewing this. Door bell is not waterproof. Got it for less than a week and top part of the bell show stain from the rain. Door bell would go off by itself randomly throughtout the night. Really want to like it but with all these flaws. It really show have no stars.
1.0	Description said it was 3 pole.  It is not.  Don't be fooled.  Not worth the trouble to ship back, maybe someday I'll find a use for it.
1.0	"This recession applies to all sentry safes with an electronic lock and a separate handle to open it.  After 3 years of usage the safe refused to open sporadically. Even punching in the right combination using fresh batteries, the handle to open the door could not be pushed down. Sometimes it opened, sometimes not.  Sentry customer support knows about the problem and provided the following instruction to solve the issue:  \\""Try the following if this doesn't work it might be necessary to drill open the unit:  If the safe still does not allow entry, but hears a click - if the safe is not bolted down, I have the customer tip the safe on its back and leave for 12-24 hours. This allows all the air pressure built up in the gasket to release. With the safe on its back, lift up on the handle as if the safe were upright, enter the code, and bring the handle down.  If you can't hear the click after trying lift/push or if after laying the safe on its back didn't allow entry, lift the handle up and give 5 quick, firm taps to the right of the keypad on the door with a rubber mallet. After tapping, keep the handle up, push in on the door, enter the code, then bring the handle down. This should allow entry.\\""    Unfortunately this is not a joke. I followed the instruction and the door opened indeed. Luckily I did not mount the safe to the floor so I could turn it.  I looked into the door from inside and was amazed by the cheap and bad quality I saw. The locks of all Sentry safes with an electronic look have a general design issue, that results in clogging the electronic lock after some years of usage.    There are groups who talk about the issue:  [...]  [...]    My Advise:  Stay away from this type of safe. It looks like for a real safe some more money must be invested. It does not help at all to lock away your belongings like passports and documents, if you have no access to it any more."
1.0	Waste of money.... you will be replacing batteries about every 3 weeks.  I thought this was a good sensor when I first received it, especially since it was talking.  I have replace the batteries five times already and I received the product on April 1st and it is now June 21st.  When you check the reviews, you might want to pay closer attention to the verified purchaser, not the reviewer who received the item for free for a review.
1.0	The paint is peeling. The lights didn't work. Cold Solder joints. Draw grinds. Track hardware is horrible. Customer service wouldn't replace the draw. They only sent light strip NO transformer... Even that was like pulling teeth.
1.0	After struggling with the mechanical issues of this light we gave up on using it.  It is difficult to keep it open, take out the magnifier, etc .. it likes to keep closing itself up, so we just let it have its way and got a different product.
1.0	ARE. YOU. SERIOUS. $69 FOR ONE CAN....
1.0	I bought this to put on the top of my brother's pickup tailgate (protected by a plastic bed liner), so that when the tailgate was down the driver behind him could see it. I used it to mix with strips I cut of red reflective tape I bought at an Ace hardware store. Within three months all of this product had peeled off. Over a year later the Ace reflective tape is still holding strong. I cleaned the tailgate with rubbing alcohol and applied both tapes in around 65 degree weather. Maybe this product adheres better to non-plastic surfaces but it didn't work well for me.
1.0	I have two Zoeller m53-D pumps installed. Twice now on one of them the switch has become stuck on and the pump runs continously. If I hadn't noticed this fairly quickly the motor would have run dry until it had overheatd and burned out. Works fine until this. Extreme safety issue.
1.0	did not work in my sink
1.0	after owning for 2 years the finish is fading badly and the deadbolt no longer works correctly.
1.0	I could not use it because of size issues.
1.0	SAVE YOUR MONEY.  WORKED TWO WEEKS....NOW GOES OFF ALL THE TIME.  GOES OFF ARE WHEN NO METAL OBJECTS ARE NEARBY, SS  USUALLY ABOUT EVERY 10 MINUTES.
1.0	This lamp was great. After having it for a day it broke. The lamp would no longer turn on. It was not dropped or anything.
1.0	The bulbs I received were not the G30 Globe size.  They were much smaller and they did not match the bulbs I already had in my fixture.  I returned the bulbs (without any issue) and purchases bulbs from another web sight and the new bulbs matched my current bulbs perfectly.
1.0	Horrible product not what I expected!!!! Almost all the lanterns were stuck together and when we tried to set the off they caught on fire..... I will never buy these again and do not recommend this product to anyone.
1.0	Wish I could give zero stars! Definitely a waste of a few dollars. The actual decal is ridiculously smaller than the actual picture. Horrible.  Just horrible.
1.0	the bucket does not touch the ground and it has sucky rc reach i would not recumend this toy it SUCKS it will not even pick up the plastic rocks with out you putting them in the bucket.do not buy this item unless you want to waist you money on a peice of JUNK.
1.0	Glass was cracking on the ends
1.0	These were great for about 2 minutes and then went dead.  I'm glad I had time to try the one since I needed about 8 strings total.  Also, these took a very long time to ship.
1.0	Functioned fine for little under 2 years.  When the arm began to slip and had to be tightened to hold the showerhead in the desired position, the plastic part (made to look like metal) split and water sprayed all over the bathroom.  Called the company (twice, as they lost my tracking number the first time) for a replacement part (product has a lifetime warranty), but they would not supply the holder that I needed.  Instead I had to pay $19.99 as &#34;shipping and handling&#34; for a replacement showerhead..........some warranty!  I would not purchase an Oxygenics product again.
1.0	It worked really well for almost two years.  I think I calculated it was saving almost $10 per month!  Two nights ago, this item failed.  It melted all the wiring and a small fire/explosion happened in the box, causing the circuit breaker to short and our house losing power.  This happened while I was on a business trip and my wife had to fix this problem at 455am.  I am not happy.<br /><br />Worst of all, my house literally could have burned down very easily as a result of this matter.  My water heater is a 240V, 18.8A.<br /><br />BE CAREFUL!  DON'T RISK YOUR HOUSE BEING BURNED DOWN TO SAVE A COUPLE $.<br /><br />I am hoping someone from Amazon or Intermatic will contact me immediately to discuss this matter.
1.0	The piece that the hose and shower head connets to was made of plastic. It broke as soon as I turned on the water. No way to fix it or get a replacement. Had to go to Lowes and get a regular hose setup.
1.0	It will not fit over the lightbulb.  I have attempt several bulbs but the clap will not fit tightly around it.
1.0	Didn't realize i.had to be pludded into wires in the wall, just sitting here no use to it, wish they had switch ones instead of wire hook ones
1.0	I received this frame with the hanging hook installed crookedly.  Rather than wait to send it back I decided to fix it myself and when I unscrewed the hanging hook the frame cracked through to the front.  Ended up repairing with glue, spackle and spray paint and hung it up with command strips.
1.0	The product broke when I tried screwing the posts together.  When I called company, was told their products do not break and I had to forcefully break product.  They will not allow a refund on this product.  I did order another lamp post that did work and I am allowed to return that.  But, I am subject to $18 postage and $15 restocking fee and if lamp is not packaged &#34;exactly&#34; as it was shipped to me, they return it and I am charged another $18 postage.  The lamp could not be packaged as it was originally because it was taken out, put together and the tape, bubble wrap was torn.  So, in other words they want to charge me $51 to return a $60 lamp.  I would not recommend ordering from this company.
1.0	This switch cover looks as if a child glued a computer printout to a plain white wall plate.  The corners show gaps with the white wall plate underneath showing through.  The screws are plain white and stand out horribly.  My 8 year old will touch them up to match - which will be an improvement to this very disappointing product that looks like it came from a flea market.
1.0	Cute if it works, I have had it less then a week and in full sun it will work off and on, mostly off. Was shipped fast, however due to the working issues I would not order again or recommend this item.
1.0	The light color is WHITE and does not match the prescription of 3000 K ... This is a definite false advertisement!
1.0	This item is not the one pictured.  I specifically ordered it because the cord in the image is round and looks nice.  The one I received has a standard cheep looking grooved lamp cord.  This might get the job done, but it looks budget.  I didn't buy it for the price I bought it because the picture was the one that I wanted.  Now I have to keep shopping.  Waste of time, cost and shipping.
1.0	Started out fine.  A nice effect on shrubs and trees.  HOWEVER, after one month of use, the laser light quit, burned out, or whatever it did, but it doesn't light anymore.  VERY disappointed.  Will contact the Sparkle Magic supplier.  A very expensive decoration to just quit after a month's use.
1.0	Box says they have a timer but there is no separate setting for the timer.  I gave similar candles  that turn off automatically but I used these for the first time last night and they did not turn off, I had to turn them off manually this morning..
1.0	Broke the first time I used it. Most inexpensive air tools I have purchased before are good enough for the limited use I give them. But this lasted about an hour. Not interested in dealing with time consuming returns. Call it a lesson learned.
1.0	Product came to me with a huge dent in the side. Item is to big AND HEAVY to repackage and take to return!!! I am dissatisfied and unhappy with the product that I spent $200 dollars on. Now I'm stuck with a damaged safe!!!!!! Next time I'll be going with my gut instinct and buying it at Costco
1.0	I opened this product on Christmas Eve to record my message to discover a dirty smoke alarm with a missing battery cover and mounting bracket and another family's message recorded on the machine. When I filled out the return it could not be replaced. (not sure why because it met the qualifications of being damaged and having missing parts) Not sure I could trust somebody who sends damaged and used products out as new.
1.0	THE PHOTOS OF THIS PRODUCT ARE DECEPTIVE. THE ACTUAL COLORS ARE NOT AS PRETTY. THE FILM LOOKS NOTHING LIKE STAINED GLASS.  THE FLOWERS AND LEAVES ARE BIGGER THERE IS A LOT OF A MURKY GREEN COLOR IN THE BACKGROUND AND A BUNCH OF THE GREEN LEAVES LOOK LIKE THEY WERE SCRIBBLED WITH A GREEN MARKER OR GREEN FINGER PAINT (WITH LOTS OF UNEVEN STREAKS/SMEARS)  IF THIS PRODUCT LOOKED ANYTHING LIKE THE PHOTOS I WOULD HAVE BEEN THRILLED BUT IT WAS JUST A DISAPPOINTMENT.
1.0	sign was late and bent up when it arrived
1.0	Order #103-0219172-5323453<br />We installed this toilet seat yesterday (11/7/2013) and found that the mounting brackets (2) are defective. The bolts are 1/2 in lenght they should be and the plastic nuts are split on the 4 sides, therefore they expand and the bolts slide in and out of the nuts causing no tighten and thereby making everything about these brackets useless.<br />We solved this problem, we think, by using the old bracket, bolts & nuts from the old seat. Why Amazon are you selling defected items like this? Since we  have the seat installed now, and don't want to unbolt it again, I think we will keep it. BUT YOU ARE CAUSING YOUR CUSTOMERS REAL PROBLEMS SELLING THIS DEFECTIVE ITEM. STOP IT!!!!<br />Erwin H. Moller
1.0	Difficult to set up on uneven surfaces,.and never never drop the alarm,   it is definitely not a timex! broken broken broken.  Do not waste your money. Buy a freaking set of bells and stick that on your door window etc.
1.0	This unit did not fit in the box and stuck out a quarter inch or so. I tried to install in older receptacle box however. After about 5 days the lower outlets stopped working. Now none of the ports work and actually drain the phone when it's plugged in. I will return. I'm disappointed as it's such a good idea. I gave it one star because it worked great for 3 days.
1.0	I suppose there is some utility in reviews of items like this that are written by folks that have recently bought and installed them, but there is probably much more value in reviews of the product after it has been in service for a while. We installed this faucet and drain, matching soap pump, and matching shower mixer valve, shower head, spigot and drain when we refinished a bathroom eight years ago. Although good-looking and expensive, these fixtures have been a source of continuous problems over that period, and we have no reason to expect that they will not continue to be less than reliable.<br /><br />We probably should have considered it to be a warning when the plumber that did the original bathroom work refused to install the Kohler bathtub drain mechanism, telling us in no uncertain terms that this would break and that the repair would be extremely expensive. He instead used the mechanism which came with the tub, which has been trouble free. As far as the Kohler products go, the soap pump broke within the first year, as did the popup drain plug that comes with this faucet. We replaced the pump with one from another manufacturer and have had no problems since. We replaced the popup with one from Kohler, and it has broken again. Also within the last couple of months both the shower valve handle and one of the faucet handles have loosened up. It is not obvious how to tighten these, and to do it you'll need special soft jaw pliers. Now, one of the faucet cartridges is leaking, so that will have to be replaced. All in all, everything we have from this manufacturer has not been very reliable, even though it is all pretty expensive.<br /><br />A word about Kohler support. They have one of the worst websites on the planet - very pretty, but just try and find a replacement part or repair info. If you send them email (form mail) they will *eventually* get back to you, and the service folks are knowledgeable. But the minimum wait for us has been three days for a reply.y.
1.0	I was wanting an emergency light for our frequent power outages. No way with this, unit would not charge; when power was out only one LED glowed and extremely dim (barely visible). Seems the company has a lack of quality control. I have returned to Amazon.
1.0	They did not last long dead in days. And they were not on. I hope they were not already used
1.0	The bronze color came off almost immediately. I bought it to go with my Moen Oiled Bronze Faucet. I had to pay a plumber to install it and the bronze color came off almost immediately. Very disappointing. I had to buy a rubber cover to go over it because it looks so bad.
1.0	The handle was a defective product. screw holding part broke off soon after I installed it.  The seller refused to warranty the product.
1.0	We opened the box to find 2 of 3 cans opened (leaked)-burnt my hand & face<br /><br />We followed directions-tried different sections (sunny & shady). Left it on from 5 minutes to 36 HOURS-it was  as if we painted on WATER!. Not one spec of paint was removed. Used steel wool, puddy knife, hot gun, pressure waster, hot water, cold water...............results ZERO! No change! Waste of time, $$$........
1.0	I used it as instructed, but it didn't work at all.  I don't  understand, but it just rained some and the faux suede futon cover is soaked.  Thank goodness I have a vinyl mattress cover under it, or the mattress would be soaked also.  Maybe it works better on tent material.
1.0	Pulley disintegrated after 7 months.  Did not spin and belt ate a hole in it.  Cheap fix, but now I get to do it again, and I won't replace it with this one.    Followup: After 3 years with a different pulley and no issues, I'm pretty sure the quality of this pulley was not great.  Yes, I did the work on both replacements, and yes, I had/have the belt on the correct way.
1.0	Not worth one star!  I put in the ingredients and turned to compress and that's where it is no, still stuck in that position.  No amount of twisting and turning would loosen it.  A waste of money.
1.0	Very weak light, requires modification to my light housing. Did  not provide light that would be required to see at night.
1.0	Ordered and Received, Package Looked OLD, took time to Connect and Does Not Work. Disconnected and put on Bench and powered 110v, No 12 v. Output to lights. Hope Second works for have Mounting Already Installed in Ceiling.
1.0	Dont waste your money
1.0	2 of the 3 of these bulbs that I bought burned out within the first year. They're a little cheaper than other brands but don't last. They look ok when working but I have several Phillips bulbs of the same type that are brighter and still working.
1.0	This product does nothing. I couldn't even get it to stick to a flat wall, much less a dent in the car. Save your money.
1.0	The pin was bent, when I went to push out a link the pin snapped making the tool useless. It also messed up a link on my $350 watch. The picture showed 3 extra pins, they were not included. It was hard to adjust to make the watch fit in it. I thought this would be safer and less damaging than using whatever tools I had lying around, I was wrong. I only ordered it because it shipped from the US, now I wish I would've waited for one of the overseas tools to ship.
1.0	Remote doesn't trigger fan. Dip switch settings are matched to fan and old remote, but nothing happens with the fan.
1.0	We purchased this sink 4 years ago and it immediately scratched and has continued to look worn.  I don't know if Kohler has changed how they make these sinks but this one is a disappointment.  Maybe it would be better in a color other then black which seems to magnify the scratches.
1.0	Nice looking but color isn't 2700k. Kind of doesn't match my other landscape lighting.
1.0	I could not wait to use this on my RV and around my shed . What a let down. They just didn't work , the cans must have beed real old , very little product came out and the nozzles clogged up on all the cans I bought.
1.0	The Installation of this item is very easy, BUT the material of this item doesn't Fully. Because the user menu was written very hard to understand, thats why after install the system it didn't work for the first time, and when I contact the company for more help the company's customer service was very lame, then we have to contact some local service to deal with the problem, so after all its not as good as you think it is.
1.0	I am highly disappointed in your false advertisement of item Asian Wooden Electric Oil Warmer.... There is nothing made out of wood and glass as you advertised.  Instead, I received an item made of cheap plastic and what felt as thin crepe paper.
1.0	I just received days ago (Feb 2010). The packing was really poor to be a fragile item. The filament was broken. I email the vendor asking for shipping instructions. Never reply back.
1.0	This review is from: PUR Advanced Faucet Water Filter Chrome FM-3700B (Tools & Home Improvement)<br /><br />This product is not worth the money. While easy to install it does not last. Within 6 months, the indicator light goes out. When you try contacting PUR customer service, the admit its a known issue. But to resolve it you have to do a lot of leg work.  After 6 emails and a month long email chain, PUR  finally they agree to replace the unit but you have to pay for shipping? What? How is that fair?<br /><br />First, they admit that they have a KNOWN malfunction with the unit and now they want you to shell out more money to replace it. But rest assure, according to the TWO customer service reps I had to speak with, PUR is committed to quality and KAZ, PUR’s customer service company is also committed to quality customer service.<br /><br />I would rather pay more money for a company that provides superior quality and customer service.
1.0	Even when the two are in the same room, they do not work.  Waste of my time and money.
1.0	"What in the world would make someone designing this product think that I want a set-and-forget-turn-on-time that synchs with sunset but only, and I mean ONLY(!!!) want to be able to have it turn off after set number of hours? The elapsed time between sundown and a set time (say, 11:00 p.m.) can vary in my area from 2.5-5.5 hours. This stupid device only lets you use the auto-on feature if you also select a fixed duration for it to stay on after sunset of 2,4,6,8,etc. hours. In otherwords, if I set this in December I'd have to select a 6 hour duration for a light to stay on to 11-ish, but in June that would have my lights still on at 2:30 a.m., also 6 hours after sunset.<br /><br />Of course, you can select to use the program settings and use whatever on-off times you like, but that can't be used at the same time as the sunset timer. Unbelievable. You'd think at least once, someone at Sylvania would have actually used this and thought \\""hmmmmm, this is really stupid, maybe we should change the design options!\\""<br /><br />If someone reads this and has found a plug-in timer that can use auto-on settings based on sunset in conjunction with a fixed off-time, please post a comment for me and others. I've had lightswitches that do this, so I know it's not THAT complicated. I'm using this in a hard to access area and need it to work without me having to dig it out. Ever.<br /><br />Sylvania - dumbest design ever. I hope Amazon dumps all their returns at your doorstep and insists on a refund. Mine is on the way back to them."
1.0	I had great hopes for this completely sealed Kidde smoke alarm that supposedly would go 10 years without needing new batteries.  Mine lasted about 10 months and it was never in a real alarm condition, only monthly testing.  So much for hoping that 9V battery powered detectors were a thing of the past.
1.0	"I've been using DAP caulk for over 20 years now, and have to say that I have never EVER had such a \\""caulking nightmare\\"" as with this stuff.  I'm very upset at the moment with this.  I bought several tubes of this stuff to caulk two showers and one tub in a house I've been doing work for.  The stuff went on without a hitch, but then 4 days later, the customer calls to tell me that the caulk is turning into \\""cream cheese\\"" in all the bathrooms!!!!!!  I went out to look at the job, and sure enough, the caulk turned into mush.  The people blamed me for it, and I had to take responsibility.  They even waited at least 3 days before using any of the showers.  I spent several hours ripping out this crap and putting in a silicone caulk in its place.  NEVER AGAIN!!!!  Please don't waste your money on this stuff if you plan on using it in a shower or tub."
1.0	Horrible.  Most complicated piece of worthless equipment ever.  In your home you should be able to seamlessly adjust the temperature - not with this device.  You will be lost trying to override over and over again.  Avoid like the plague.
1.0	"Bought two pack to replace standard bulbs. Noticed they were going out sooner than \\""normal\\"" . Started writing the date of installation back in 2009. These CFL bulbs don't last as long as incondecent. Don't waste your money."
1.0	UPDATE: This beautiful faucet broke after two months. We are outside of the return window so we are stuck. I replaced it with a $100 faucet from Home Depot that's not as fancy but seems to be lasting. What a bummer!    We searched high and low for a faucet that would look good in our newly remodeled kitchen. The sink is quite deep, so I wanted something relatively low to avoid splashing. The spray feature does splash a little but I mostly use stream. I do wish the handle would glide a bit more easily, but it's very easy to adjust, and beautiful. We have only had it for about a month.
1.0	not the best stickers
1.0	We had this unit professionally installed with a 3 year in home warranty from the installer.  Six months after the warranty period ended the touchscreen stopped working at all.  At first I thought it might be &#34;locked&#34; which is a feature, but spent the better part of a Saturday afternoon trying to unlock it to no avail.<br /><br />I'm loath to buy another unit to replace it as I've seen several people respond to the questions for this unit with the same problem... dead touchscreen.
1.0	It did not come with the clamp to attach to the desk. It is also missing the reflector.
1.0	Pros: I was excited when this timer arrived to discover that it actually handled 20 on/off times, when the product description said it only had six. The unit was easy to program and operate.<br /><br />Cons: Within 3 days, the unit malfunctioned and reset itself; losing the time/date and all programming. This unit was controlling my cat feeder, so I'm glad we weren't on vacation when this happened. The next day, the screen went blank; and I had to hit the reset button to bring it back to life.<br /><br />I'm returning the unit for a replacement, and will update this review if the replacement turns out to be more reliable.
1.0	This filter performed worse than the 2-year old one that I replaced.  The water comes out slower and it is absolutely useless.<br />Do not buy anything from this seller.
1.0	Once we did the meticulous work of putting the decal on the wall, we measured our boys and realized something was wrong.  We took a tape measure and lined it up and saw that the measurements were off.  The whole thing is off my 2&#34;.  And I can't return this since this is a decal product.
1.0	Thanks, everyone, for your helpful reviews!  We are replacing our countertops and just bought a new Grohe kitchen faucet.  I REALLY want to get a matching dish soap dispenser but my spouse will not let me.  We have had a different one at our old house and he was never fond of it.  I read all of your reviews in hopes I could tell him, look, Grohe has a good model.  Oh well, I guess I am stuck with having a dish soap bottle on my counter.  Guess it is better then cleaning up spilt soap and other headaches.  I really appreciate everyone's informative reviews.
1.0	"Don't buy these, if you want the warm white color advertised on amazon.  I'll explain.  Light bulbs have color temperature ratings.  \\""Warm white\\"" gives off a slightly yellow cast, and is measured between 2,700 and 3,000 kelvins.  Cool white is stark, with a blue or green cast, and measured between 4,000 and 5,000 kelvins.  The light produced by these bulbs is cold, stark, and harsh.  It would be unattractive for interior lighting."
1.0	No matter what was tried we could not get the set-up to work and interface with the computer.  Actually reordered it in case the first one was flawed.  However, still no luck with the second one.  We really wanted it to work and quite disappointed.
1.0	I've installed other system and this one is of very poor quality.
1.0	Avoid until they fix the false alarms issue. Bought two units and both suffered from false alarms.  Had high hopes based on recommendations from friends.  Had to return both units.  Sure hope they can find out what the problem is and fix it rather than pretend there is not a problem.
1.0	you can see the back ground clear tape - and it wont stay on the wall!!! this product got a big clear tape back ground which irritating.
1.0	I was very excited to get these lights in the mail but when I plugged it into the wall .... NOTHING. No lights. Now I just have a bundle of copper wire with some LED lights that don't work. HIGHLY DISAPPOINTED.
1.0	Sold as LED. NOT Halagen!I asked for LED in search and these came up. Amazon needs to  police their descriptions better
1.0	super small...and the magnifying glass is not clear.  you cant see anything through it.
1.0	I got this ladder and returned it instantly because I noticed too late it is one time use only. Not that I expect more than one fire but I think use by children requires at least one fire drill.
1.0	not happy b/c there is a gold large tacky &#34;c&#34; on the sides of the boots which is not displayed here (or I would have never gotten them) they are giant definitely not a women's boot more like men's boots. not happy and not paying for shipment return they will just sit in my closet or until big foot the monster needs a pair of boots I will give them to him.
1.0	Immediately began to see sawdust under the screws and within three months the screws fell out. Replaced it with a 20$ version that has already lasted longer with no signs of wear.
1.0	This product is no good. I ordered two of them and now they both are not working. The top lock that goesn the door does not stay closed and the bottom compartment where you put the key does not stay lock.
1.0	I wondered if they collected used batteries and repackaged them for selling. When my garage fob was out of power, I changed to these and the fob still failed to open the garage gate. I knew it wasn't a connection problem because when I used it for the door that leads to the garage, it worked -- the problem is, this door requires very little power to open. Whenever my fob's battery is too weak to open the garage gate, it is still good enough to open the door leading to the garage. These new batteries just did exactly the same thing that my used batteries do - too weak to open the garage gate but still can open the door to the garage. That's what makes me think they recycled used batteries for selling...otherwise how do you explain new batteries having no power??
1.0	I was very dissatisfied with this item.  The workmanship was very cheap, the plug was loose in the socket and I was, frankly, afraid to plug them in.  I am returning them.
1.0	Hard to put together and get around a pot-would be much better if S-hooks were attached to chain. All my pots were too heavy to fit these small chains<br />Service was great-got here quickly-just thought they looked more sturdy in the picture.
1.0	Product did not work after going thru the trouble of installation. I wish they would go thru the hardship of testing the product
1.0	These take 2 &#34;AA&#34; batteries and have 500 hours battery run time instead of 2 &#34;D&#34; and 1000 hours as stated in the description.  What a disappointment!<br /><br />They do give off a nice amount of light that looks quite realistic.and glows through all but the lower inch of the plastic body.  The top appears to be waterproof but the bottom is not.
1.0	"Good luck finding the bulb for this one.  My original purchase was from one of the big hardware store whose name rhymes with \\""Snows\\"".  I never thought that the light bulb replacement for the fixture wouldn't be carried by the same store that sold the unit; that would just be silly.  Its not carried by any other local hardware store, either.  Looks like we'll be munching our Cheerios in the dark like the cavemen for a few days till the replacement comes in from Amazon."
1.0	I've had to replace several of these over the past seven years. Just replaced another, and it broke second time I opened the dishwasher. I'm making my own out of steel and cable instead of flimsy plastic weakened by the idiotic way they attached the nylon cord to the part that hooks to the door.
1.0	Having read many of the reviews on here, and seeing that many people had received an earlier revision switch that caused LED bulbs to flicker, I took my chances that I would receive the later revision. I didn't. Installation was simple, and it worked well for a day. Then the flickering began. It drives my wife nuts. She in turn, drives me nuts. I am returning the switch and will most likely avoid Lutron products in the future.
1.0	It couldn't even clear up an area that I had wire brushed and sanded. A waste of my money-DO NOT BUY IT!
1.0	you get what you pay for... with all the good reviews i took the chance $17.50 wasted. not sturdy enough to hold curtain and liner. rods do not lock together feel i may have received defective rod have since went to home depot to physically see what i am buying.
1.0	Never have received the corner peices.
1.0	After a few years, our Ott Lite floor lamp quit working one day.  I ordered a replacement bulb, but the new bulb did not work either.  I called the &#34;customer service&#34; line and found that there is little in the way of customer service from this company.  While the individual who answered the call seemed helpful at first, he would not step me through the diagnosis of the issue.  In fact, he was immediately suspicious that I had purchased the wrong (not Ott!) bulb.  When that was not the case he was no longer interested in helping me identify the problem.<br /><br />While this lamp is an excellent product, I will no longer do business with them or recommend them to friends.  It is sad that such a good product will eventually succumb to such poor service!
1.0	Spring loaded toilet paper holder came, not pivoting arm. Didn't realize it until after remodeled put it up. Do not like quality of item. Contacts seller and waiting to hear.
1.0	I bought this product and it worked 90% of the time for 9 months and then stopped working.  Since it was under warranty, I shipped it to the manufacturer.  Unfortunately the manufacturer sent the replacement to the wrong address.  Instead of correcting the issue, they offered me the option to buy a new one for more than the amazon price.  It's disappointing.
1.0	I purchased this bulb in early December of 2013. I ran it 12 hour on, 12 hours off. It worked great for indoor plants and seedlings but to only last 550 hours is much worse than the 10.000 hours listed. The bulb melted at the base and formed a 1/2&#34; hole that smoke and liquid was coming out. The smell it gave off was so bad that I had to open all the windows in my house and run every fan for 6 hours (in the middle of Winter) and still the smell lingered. It is a great bulb when it works but I did notice a reduction of brightness after about 20 days of use. I did buy another one and will give it one more chance (just in case i got a defective one). From many of the reviews here and other places, it seems to be a common problem with CFL bulbs. Why advertise at 10,000 hours when it can't produce even a 10th of that?
1.0	Would not work for the watts it was supposed to be rated for and the remote would not work.
1.0	I Tested indoors before placing outside where they were strung with solar lights from a previous year. Indoors, both strings I purchased worked. Outdoors, performance was very unreliable. With a sunny day one string would stay lit for a short period if time. The other string never lit. The old lights with the collectors placed right next to each other would. It's too bad because when it worked the light was pretty, but I won't buy again.
1.0	This thing flew away a few times due to its flimsy strap and once I found it 3 houses down! How can they expect a gimpy strap to hold down the what is essentially plastic when even small winds blow it away!<br /><br />Save yourself the waste and get something else.
1.0	The 2 smaller drip pans were fine, but the 2 larger ones did not fit my stove.  They're slightly too small, so now the eyes of the stove do not fit down into the drip pan the way they're supposed to do.  Clearly they're not &#34;universal.&#34;
1.0	The range of this unit is maybe 15 feet, and even at that it's completely unreliable. Look elsewhere, this is worthless.
1.0	This is the second one I have purchased that leaks. I threw the other one out because it was too late to return it. I had one that I purchased several years ago that worked great but was looking kind of rough so I figured I would get a new one. The quality of these have really taken a downturn. The one I have now leaks at the faucet. I wrapped Teflon tape around the connection but this one is leaking IN BETWEEN the metal threaded part and the plastic outer cover. For some reason the other three fittings they send with it are all plastic. Since it is also too late to send this one back, I guess I will either have to live with it or buy another one to get the connection and hope it is not defective as well. Unless someone happens to know where I can get the connection I need to replace this one? [[ASIN:B00A6QRB8C PUR Advanced Faucet Water Filter - Black FM-3500B]]
1.0	This literally broke a week after I got it. No instructions or even an alarm feature. Definitely NOT WATER RESISTANT.  It's cool for the simple novelty of having a speedometer for a watch but I feel like it was very cheaply made and not at all worth the 7 bucks. You get what you pay for.
1.0	Purchased 6 bulbs. Out of the 6 two did not light.<br />I purchased as a stock item and as it turns out two did not light.
1.0	Purchased this product to get Kwikset keyway to re-key to other locksets. Not the Kwikset Keyway!<br />Key wont go in nor can I get a duplicate key. Returning this product.<br />Don't buy this Product if you want to get another key made.
1.0	Went out after only two months use.  $25 down the drain. Not worth the hassle and cost to return it.
1.0	It's very difficult to use with apple extreme.
5.0	My girlfriend likes em, great price compared to the mall. Package came on time. 5 stars.<br /><br />My girlfriend likes em, great price compared to the mall. Package came on time. 5 stars.
5.0	While on a trip this past summer Tanzanite seemed to be the new  new gem to have. Tanzanite is expensive and I wanted a pair of studs to wear as a birthstone earring. These studs are just the right size and they sparkle so prettily! I love them!
5.0	I just got my ring and I love it! It is beautiful and a perfect fit. I also love that it's stainless steel and hypoallergenic. I have hand eczema and it doesn't irritate my skin at all. I will definetly be ordering from KONOV again.
5.0	My friend is a huge GA fan and she lovvesss it on her pandora bracelet
5.0	I was a little intimidated with buying my first &#34;hoop&#34; nose ring. There are so many different shapes with different mechanisms for staying in your nose, not to mention the varying gauges and diameters. This one is practically the smallest width (gauge) you can get, so it's super dainty and once my hole closes in around the ring, it will be pretty unnoticeable if I have to take the ring out for job interviews, cleaning, etc. It also has a pretty simple closing mechanism, as you just pry it apart at the gap and then squeeze it closed once it's through your piercing - that way you don't have to try to insert it from the inside of your nose like you do with most of the other nose rings I'd considered. I also measured the distance from my piercing to the end of my nostril in order to determine what diameter of ring to get (I wanted mine to lay flat on my nose and not dangle), but this nose ring is pliable enough that you could bend it a little to get the fit you want! It was also shipped in a really convenient screw-top jewelry tin that's perfect for storing my old nose ring. And on top of all that, it's totally affordable. Definitely an awesome buy!
5.0	Love these earrings, just the right size! They are cute and perfect for a night out. Thanks so much, would order from them again.
5.0	pretty and it fits my hands perfectly. my wrist is rather small, and bracelets always fall off but this was good.
5.0	the necklaces are beautiful and perfect! i really like them! im never taking mine off :D great product! and thank you!
5.0	I have worn this ring continuously for over a year. I swim in a chlorinated pool almost daily. I frequently do yard work and carpentry work. The ring still looks almost new. Tungsten carbide is the way to go if you are active. Also, this ring is tapered on the inside, so it is very comfortable. Be warned, however, that tungsten is a darker grey metal, so don't expect it to look like sterling silver or even stainless steel. I like the color, but some don't.
5.0	I get tons of complements on this and people asking where I got it from.
5.0	This necklace has a more substantial weight than I expected, and a lovely burnished glow as well.  It doesn't look cheap.  I'd order from this brand again.
5.0	I ordered the Pink Pearl Sterling Silver Christening Baby Bracelet for my grand niece and she wore during her Christening in February. The bracelet is so delicate looking and perfect for a very tiny wrist.  She looked like a tiny doll and the bracelet was a perfect gift and keepsake.
5.0	Without a doubt, this is one of the prettiest pendants I've ever owned. The pendant comes with a sterling 18&#34; chain, but I switched it to my own 20&#34; chain to hang a bit lower. I just can't help smiling when I look at this lovely pendant...
5.0	Wear this ring every day! Very Nice!
5.0	I ordered this ring for my mother after she saw the one that I have (though, mine has a clear stone). It came very quickly and she absolutely loved it. It looked exactly like the picture, and fit perfectly.
5.0	Good Product. Works well.
5.0	Beautiful angel wings!  Friends keep asking where I got it from!  It was a bought as a gift and the recipient absolutely loves it!
5.0	Beautiful necklace. It looks very nice. Well worth the price.
5.0	This is a great piece of jewelry. Goes on easy, and STAYS ON no matter how fast the action gets. Adjustable, and gives the right amount of pinch.
5.0	Excellent!!!  My husband put it on right away and has not taken it off once.  He had to adjust the links a little.
5.0	[[ASIN:B004WO9P56 Sterling Silver Hand Blown Venetian Murano Glass Earrings Blue and Silver Drop Shaped Fashion Fashion Jewelry for Women, Teens, Girls]]<br /><br />My son gave these to me for Mother's Day.  I love them, as they are the style that I like.  The blue color is beautiful and just the right length, while not heavy.<br />I would totally recommend these earrings!

5.0	Best deal all around!  B3autiful!
5.0	Very nice. Good size. And my girlfriend loved them. Came fast ship
5.0	The color is so vibrant.  Love these rings will be back for more colors.  The fit is very comfortable. ACE!!!!
5.0	The birds are gorgeous and perfect for everyday wear. The metal is brass but looks like 18k gold. It's a nice choice for girls of all ages especially animal lovers.
5.0	Brought as a gift and love it
5.0	Perfect size for a 3 year old girl.  Dainty, small, and chain a good length.  Keepsake box is a great addition for safe-keeping.

5.0	Well priced, good size, and super cute.
5.0	I just got this beautiful ring in the mail it's awesome, and it is nicer than I imagined!!! Would be a nice first ring for a teenager!!!
5.0	I love to bake, so this is such a cute conversation piece to wear!  Love the fact that it is handmade, and that it is large enough so people can see what it is.
5.0	These earrings are a nice gold color, not cheap looking. And the size is awesome- especially since they are super light. I am really enjoying wearing them.
5.0	Loved how fast they came in! So glad and happy both earrings are good & new & super cute! Thanks for the earrings ! ❤️
5.0	very happy, super cute  definatly exactly what i wanted,
5.0	When I originally received my package, I was sad to find the earrings were defective. I called the number and to my surprise, they sent me a prepaid return label. This is a rare thing to find in a company and I appreciated their fast response. I will definitely purchase from this company again knowing that they are their for their customers.  They are beautiful and I highly recommend them.
5.0	I wanted an initial charm for my beloved deceased grandson for my Origami Owl Locket. This is a beautiful little charm.
5.0	Have worn this every day since it arrived!  Perfect!!
5.0	Absolutely beautiful. Knock offs just can't even come close.

5.0	Even more beautiful than I expected they are the perfect length not to heavy I adore them and they came so quickly I was surprised!
5.0	Beautiful! My niece is going to love this!
5.0	Enjoyed everyone but have not received the Crackers yet
5.0	Rembrandt charms have every kind of charm under the sun that you could wish for--and all of them beautifully made. This latest that I purchased was a blue enamel-on-gold U.S. Passport charm, on the back of which I had engraved the year & place of my husband and my most wonderful trip to London. It makes a wonderful addition to a bracelet and is a real keepsake. I will be depending on Rembrandt to fill out my bracelet(s) over the years to come!
5.0	I love this necklace! It looks so good on and is very comfortable to wear too. It looks better then in the picture and I have received a lot of compliments on it. It's a great necklace for a great price! If you like the way it looks then you better purchase it now before they run out. You won't be sorry! :)
5.0	Very nice.  Perfect size for a charm bracelet
5.0	Loved everything about them
5.0	For the price I paid I definitely  have no complaints. The necklace which slides open and close, adjustable, was kind of tricky at first but I got the hang of it eventually.  Thanks Konov Jewelry
5.0	I love it! I can't wait to give it to my sister!
5.0	This ring is beautiful and sparkly. I was a little concerned when I read from other customers that it wasn't real sterling silver, but mine has the stamp and everything. It's really pretty, though a bit big, so I would advise getting a smaller size.
5.0	Bought this for my boyfriend and he absolutely loves it!<br />I am so happy with the ring, its exactly what i was looking for and fits perfectly!<br />The Tungsten brand is the best way to go when buying a ring for a guy! :)<br /><br />Thank you!

5.0	SO BIG. BIGGER THAN I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE.  COOL  JH
5.0	I ordered this chain to replace another one that had broken. I anxiously awaited for it to arrive so that I could wear my pendant again and it was absolutely perfect! It looks a lot sturdier than the original one that came with the pendant and was purchased from a major Jewelry store. I look forward to purchasing more from this seller. Now that I have seen the quality of his work, I feel confident in investing in other pieces!
5.0	I received this a day before I went to Vegas for a week so I took it with me.  I love, love, love this ring!  I had bought a similar ring on a shopping network paying about 3 times this price and that was with it on clearance!  That ring I returned, the center stone being way too big making it look fake.  This ring from Amazon is the PERFECT size and is gorgeous to boot!  I wore it EVERYDAY in Vegas and it looked just beautiful!  I'm looking at buying the matching necklace and maybe the earrings...buy it, you won't be disappointed!
5.0	Beautiful and perfectly made
5.0	i absolutely love this ring sizer. it's easy to use and i can just clip it to my ring stick when i'm done.
5.0	Liked this product on-line, and then when I received it I was very pleasantly surprised.  It was even nicer in person.  Really well made, true to size and would highly recommend to others : )
5.0	If you carry a Rosary daily this is the one that you want. It is tough, good looking and perfect for men and women. I bought my first one directly from the Church Militant site and second one through Amazon. Amazon shipped much faster.  Gave the second one to Godson as a graduation gift and he loves it too!
5.0	This pendant is beautiful. Larger than I expected.  The stone is beautiful  Delivered earlier than I expected. Carefully packaged. I will definitely look to make future purchases from Ana Silver Co.
5.0	Really nice. Worth the money
5.0	Gorgeous necklace, deep red color, sparkles with brilliant fire, my husband picked a beautiful necklace for me this year.
5.0	Got it the other day. I love it. Only wish the gold was a little darker. It almost looks pink. But other than that its a great buy and I love my new ring! Came weeks before it should have.
5.0	as indicated. nice pins and arrived on time.
5.0	I love these earrings.<br /><br />They are lightweight, light blue in color, have a nice sparkle to them, and the clasp works!  I've worn them for days in a row now, and they still look great.  Compliment any outfit, just a simple, slightly sparkly everyday earring.  Very elegant, simple, classy.  I would recommend purchasing them for yourself or as a gift.  When mine arrived, they were in a very nice jewelry box, perfect for gift giving.
5.0	Grateful that i found such an amazing deal for this ring, turnaround time for delivery was amazing and the ring is in perfect condition and it's beautiful, thanks to SuperJeweler
5.0	I got this necklace as a gift for christmas and it absolutly stuning! I love it.
5.0	I bought 2 necklaces for my kids for Christmas gifts. I choose this product base on the descriptions and positive reviews I read. The necklace looks beautiful and sturdy with their initial and birthstone and no one can beat the price of this necklace. Something simple and elegant and most of all they love it after seeing their initial and birthstone. Thank you Efy Tal.
5.0	I just recieved this nice cable cuff bracelet. It is soooo nice and cute. I bought it with greaat price and recieved it in a very short time.
5.0	Love this belly ring! The picture does it no justice, it looks better in person!
5.0	It is very pretty and just the right size for me.  I like dolphins and am very happy with this cute necklace.
5.0	Handsome. Perfect gift for the man in your life. I bought these as a gift for my husband to be about a week before I needed them. The were processed and delivered very quickly.  The oval cufflinks look nice with the circle monogram.
5.0	Very nice finish for a sacred symbol.
5.0	great for everyday wear or if you just sized up! quality is great for the price, shipping was surprisingly quick
5.0	Great gift! My husband loved these cufflinks! They have a clean, professional look and are great for any tech lover!
5.0	Husband loves it. I would buy from them again
5.0	was a great buy has not turned finger green and it looks very nice. just would like to know how they are made.
5.0	Even prettier in person.
5.0	This necklace is so cool. It is everything as described and came with a free gift, which was a leather bracelet with a yin yang amulet thingy.
5.0	The whole experience was nice. Opening the oyster and waiting to see what color pearl i'd gotten (it ended up being peach colored). the pear itself is quite small, it's not perfectly round, but it's charming. the chain is a nice touch, it's twirly, and although my hair gets caught in it a lot, it looks very nice and fancy. a lot of people have compliment me on it and i wear it a lot. however, lately it's been turning dark (the necklace). i guess it must be from my perfume, or because it's a cheap material. i'm ordering a new one to replace it, just cause the first one was so nice, it's worth it.
5.0	GREAT pin all should wear one.
5.0	Item was shipped quickly and well packaged. Very pleased with size of earring. Too big for middle ear holes but perfect for third or bottoms.
5.0	The ring is beautiful and the center diamond is not too small, just the right size! We received many compliments. The center stone sent to me is a better color than the one described. Only negative is that they use USPS and my package was lost. Pay for UPS or FedEx!
5.0	Beautiful colors. Nice sparkle. They arrived in a nice box for storing when not in use. I wear them each frequently.
5.0	I bought this as a gift for my very &#34;picky&#34; grandson and he loves it.  Excellent price and surprisingly good quality.
5.0	so bright!  I bought the large size and they fit over my hands perfectly
5.0	I think the Opalite Teardrop was beautiful.  I bought a nice sterling silver chain to go with it, and it made a really nice gift for a friend of mine.
5.0	My daughter adores these earrings and I do too. I ordered these approximately 6 months ago and they're still going strong. No tarnishing and most importantly, they're still in one piece. They snap into the closure part pretty firmly so you don't have to worry about them falling out and getting lost too easily. This is the longest my daughter has had any pair of earrings. I highly recommend.
5.0	Well crafted and should be a nice centerpiece. It appears sturdy and strong enough to take a nice bead.<br /><br />Again I am sorry for the tardy review.
5.0	I bought this for my sister's 60th  Birthday  she loves it !!
5.0	This is a really nice delicate multi color gemstone bracelet.  I love to wear.  The stones are small but the length and design make it a nice bracelet to wear every day of the week.  Won't snag on your clothes.
5.0	Got this for my sister for xmas, wish i got two, the detail in the ring looks way better in real life then the photo.<br />totally worth every penny spent she loved it.
5.0	Very pretty charm. It looks absolutely beautiful on my pandora bracelet.
5.0	My wife loved this charm and it showed up in a timely manner and in great condition. I would buy this again if I needed another.
5.0	Bead is beautiful. BOught for mymother and  perfectly with her cobalt blue, slver and turquoise charm bracelet.<br />East to add to the bracelet.
5.0	Love the detail of the bead really happy with it .
5.0	Love it and great service.
5.0	My Son's girlfriend loved this bracelet. It looked very classy on her. Very happy with the quality of the silver.
5.0	Perfect. Can't wait to wear it!
5.0	I absolutely love this product........ I am so glad I purchased it, the CZ's really look like diamonds so brilliant.
5.0	I just got this today, & it is aweosme it looks good! It's very nice. I think it's a must buy. & it came 4 days early (:
5.0	I love these earrings.  So much in fact that when I lost one of another pair, I reordered them.  This pair came with just the right size wires.  They are not so thick that they have trouble going through my holes, nor so thin that they slip out without warning.  I love them!
5.0	Very nice, and it looks much better in person.  The picture doesn't give it justice. I only wish the band was made from real leather.
5.0	Love them!  They arrived on time and are exactly what I needed

5.0	These are gorgeous, huge pearl earrings that are so glamorous and classy, you'll want to wear them constantly. Each earring is about the size of my thumbnail! They are quality and I can't wait to wear them on New Year's Eve!
5.0	I needed a Valentine's day present and this caught my mind.  It hit the spot with my wife.  What I like about it most is that it can be used for some many purposes. It's discrete enough to go with casual wear, and yet fancy enough to hold its own when she's dressed up.  I'm very pleased with myself about buying this. And, the price was reasonable.
5.0	Thank you for your beautiful earrings.  I love it!  Will buy again from seller.
5.0	I ordered this ring based on what size we thought he wore. It was a little big. The vendor was extremely easy to work with for the exchange. Thanks!

5.0	Love it! Looks exactly like I thought it would. Wraps around wrist three times no problem.
5.0	These are so attractive. The gold swirl sets off the black onyx. I pair these with the 4mm [[ASIN:B00H7DYCKM Onyx Earrings in 14kt Yellow Gold - Round Shape - Pressure Backs - Mesmerizing]] in my second hole. Its a great look and I receive so many compliments.
5.0	My girl almost got melt with this pendant, she looks more beautiful with it, great product and highly recommended specially for gemini stuff fans
5.0	i ordered these rings on august 13th and they were delivered on september 11th. they took about a month to get here, but they ship from Hong Kong i'm pretty sure, so i understand why it took so long. my fingers are kind of skinny, i think my ring size is 5 or 6. but all of these rings fit good on any one of my fingers. they are kind of thin but thats the style of the ring. i like them! they're only a dollar i mean i cant complain! theyre very pretty.
5.0	It is very stylish and has a nice lifespam. Instead of just breaking its still in the beautiful shape that I bought it in. However it took FOREVER to get here!!. But Ive had it for two summers now :)
5.0	Beautiful-catches the light so well- is good quality and came very quickly with standard shipping-very happy with purchase- fits as expected and have received many compliments
5.0	I love it and get complaints in regards to my achievement! very excited it was what I expected! Thank you!
5.0	would recommend. loved this, its just theyre so transparent i misplaced them and couldnt recover them ): i will reorder soon.
5.0	I was kind of skeptical about ordering a ring on line but to my surprise the reviews were right this is a great ring at a great price. It is small but remember it is 1/4 carat it is beautiful and goes great with my engagement ring. It has a lot of sparkle to it and the shipping did'nt take long at all I was surprised it came so quick. If you need a nice band this is it I saw the same band for 600.00 in some stores this is a bargain and it's beautiful! Thank you Fine Diamonds9 and Amazon for great products at great prices!
5.0	works well with pictures

5.0	very festive.  Great for any holdiay
5.0	Loved it!  It was small but very beautiful! Got this for my best friend and she loved it just as much as I did
5.0	This is a very cute nose ring. Spike is just barely noticeable. Perfect fit for me
5.0	I came across this when I was surfing around amazon and it really caught my eye.  It's a gorgeous pendant of Celtic-Viking influence.  The design and quality of this pendant is worthy every penny and then some.  The image on amazon just does not do it justice.  Great with turtleneck sweater.<br /><br />I especially loved the large bale to where you can easily switch to a longer chain.
5.0	This product fits very nicely.
5.0	This is green onyx jumbo ring in a silver band beautiful ring thanks. for great price and delivery perfect gift for all
5.0	This was the first time my wife had seen earrings like this and she was thrilled to get them.  The quality seemed good and the price was right.  I'm very happy.
5.0	Beautiful--the center stone is not terribly faceted, so it's more clear than sparkly, but it's a lovely clear, light-colored amethyst. Overall, beautiful piece.
5.0	Its exactly how the picture is shown. I absolutely love it. They even included an adorable bracelet with my order! <3
5.0	Diamonds and gold on a lucky horse shoe
5.0	Super cute belly rings! I was sad to see that several came broken, but the seller was quick to reply and make things right. They were wonderful and I will definitely use this seller and buy this type of body jewlry again.
5.0	EXACTLY WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR .. Looks awesome. .... And arrived promptly !
5.0	I bought this for my Grandmother she loves butterflies and I know she will love this!! She will get it for Christmas!
5.0	Looks great. The little blue balls are a bit cheap, but they have held up through many showers and nights sleeping with it in. Never has gotten caught. Definitally recommend esp for the price!
5.0	Love these super light weight earrings. If you like bigger and not so subtle earrings I would recommend these. I would def buy these again!
5.0	Bought as a gift for my daughter.  She had said she thought it was a bit cheaply made but I just saw it and I disagree.  I think it is well made, especially for the price.  As described but she said it is too big for her to wear.  She said it makes a great letter opener and that is what she is using it for.  It is very pretty.
5.0	Just as charming as displayed online. Can use on bracelet or necklace. This was a gift for someone else, and they were thrilled w/it.
5.0	Beautiful.  Wear it everyday!
5.0	Love this bracelet!  It fits nicely and looks great.  I receive many compliments when I wear it!
5.0	Gave this to my Grandma for her 100th Birthday and she absolutely loves it. She wears it every day and it is holding up nicely!
5.0	These were my favorite plugs when i was 8g they look good you can wear them with the bulb end forward or for a rougher look go stud end forward.
5.0	Bought these for a friend. She was very happy with them.
5.0	This apple with the worm charm is one of my favorites. The detail is great!<br />Awesome for a teacher or someone that LOVES to read. SO cute!!! Love that it is<br />sterling silver.
5.0	loved these plugs, true saddle fit, obviously you're not going to get the exact same as pictured but mine were def nice.
5.0	Beautiful earrings, quick shipping!
5.0	This bracelet is even better than the picture.  It fits perfectly and is very comfortable.  The stones are all lovely.  I enjoy wearing it very much with my other turquoise jewelry pieces.
5.0	Really nice ring. Very shiny metal and sparkly stones! My husband loves it!
5.0	I had an issue with bracelet. They shipped the part with wrong color. I left my feedback just for the sake of it. I was pleasantly surprised when seller contacted me next day and offered full refund and apologized about the error.    They let me keep the the bracelet as well.    Great customer service. I don't have any issues with the product as well.
5.0	"My husband purchased this for me after I was named a White House \\""Champion of Change\\"" and we went to Washington for me to receive my award.  It fits perfectly on my Pandora bracelet and I am so proud to tell people what I received it for when they look at my bracelet.  It is the ONLY White House charm on the market that fits a Pandora bracelet.  For me it was a truly wonderful surprise and a very thoughtful gift."
5.0	They stand out. Some people do a double take, but for the most part I get smiles and &#34;nice!&#34; They are a little on the heavy side, but they were lighter than I expected. I can't wear heavy earrings all day, and I can wear these with no problems so I was pleasantly surprised. They are not cheap flimsy earrings. I wore them on a windy day and had to put them in my pocket because my hair kept getting tangled in them, and was pleased to discover at the end of the night that they were not dented or bent in any fashion. in short, LOVE THEM!!!!! Honestly if I were looking at them in a store I would think they were $30 at least.
5.0	i just got mine today. it took only three days .. it is well worth the money. easily my favourite necklace now.
5.0	This is really fun, and cute.  I bought it for my Halloween costume, but it is so cute I might be wearing it when ever the moment feels right.  The mustache on the ring is blinged out with black crystals.  And this ring can be worn as a one finger, or two finger ring.  The band is very stretchy, and will fit different size fingers.  Super cute, and worth what you pay.
5.0	I<br />As an Air Force wife I really love the treatment of the insignia. Thanks Alex and Ani creators. Love all the designs.
5.0	Very good quality and attractive.
5.0	Not too small, not too big, long enough post and secure back, substantial but lightweight. These earrings are very comfortable and have just the right amount of sparkle and shine - I'm a volunteer docent at a local tourist site and had two compliments on these earrings yesterday. Looking at the picture I wasn't quite sure if they were appropriate for an older Senior but they look great- just the right amount of shine and sparkle and a classic flower design done in a modern way..
5.0	Wear it everyday.  Very comfortable and stylish.
5.0	Very cute, does not look cheap at all. I was surprised with the quality of this, I love it
5.0	Beautiful! Sent this as a gift to my mom who lives out of state. Amazingly quick delivery. Alex and Ani are fantastic bracelets and we always like to add to our collection. High quality and made in the USA!
5.0	I bought 2 of the Flower Vine Clips.  They fit my Pandora bracelets, but are half the price.  The width of the clip is slightly smaller than the width of my Pandora clips.  I had to hold them next to each other and scrutinize them to discern the minor difference in width.  The flower and vine pattern is detailed and pretty.  These blend in nicely with the other beads on my bracelets.  I'm happy with this purchase.
5.0	I bought this for my daughter and have &#34;borrowed&#34; it several times to wear myself.  I always get fantastic compliments on it when I wear it.  I absolutely LOVE this necklace, it is even more gorgeous in person, so needless to say I was quite pleased when I got it and opened for the first time, even prettier in person than the pictures.  The accent diamonds are simply stunning!!  It isn't some cheapy, thin material either, it is quite sturdy and I think will hold up for a great long while (my daughter is rough on jewelry!)  Love that it is such a high quality necklace for such an affordable price!!
5.0	I Love It, the Gem is big enough for my taste, exactly as the titled measurement.<br />The color of my purchase is a little brighter red, but still very rich.
5.0	When I first got this a friend of mine was here with her daughter who was about to turn five. It was her first time seeing Hello Kitty. She squealed with delight when she saw it. She squealed with delight again when she had a Hello Kitty theme party and was overjoyed with her birthday gift from me. The necklace, of course.
5.0	I love it and get many compliments on this ring.
5.0	This is a very beautiful ring. Anything from the S&G collection is simply marvelous, but this swiss blue topaz ring is extellar. The ring is on the contemporary side with a  quality stone and set well. I highly reccomend this ring
5.0	This came just as advertised and I even took it to a jeweler to confirm it was gold filled. It was worth the price!
5.0	Bought this necklace for my sons girlfriend and it definitely exceeded my expectations. Very, very beautiful!!
5.0	This ring is elegant and stunning while making a statement. I receive oodles of compliments every time I wear it.
5.0	"I wear this these every day. I wish they were in the longer 30\\"" length.You can see the details on the beads."
5.0	I think that this is such a cute necklace, and that it is made really well. I do feel that it looks much like something that a child would wear. I could see me wearing it if I were given it from my niece or my own child to show they that I appreciate them giving it to me but not an everyday wear. I did give this to my niece and she was stoked. She had to call her dad and show everyone that came around. At her age she was not sure what BAE meant so I told her and she just smiled. So for a child it is on key but for an adult or teen I think there are or could be other designs to show more sophisticated taste or more adult designs.<br /><br />I did receive this product in exchange for my honest and unbiased thoughts and opinions.
5.0	Very pleased with this item. Had a question regarding clasp - they responded very quickly. Shipping was fast. It was an anniversary present and the bride was extremely happy with it. We went out to lunch last weekend and the waitress commented on it immediately.
5.0	Amazing I love it! My favorite bracelet
5.0	Item is just as it appears in the picture, if not lovelier!  I would highly recommend this as a gift to someone you love.
5.0	"Anyone, like me, that has spent a lot of their life on boats.... would know the PFD's are dirty as sin.  The weather takes its toll.  I accidently saw this charm while \\""surfing charms\\"".  Looks great in the photo - better in person.  Of course you would never have such a \\""fancy\\"" PFD onboard a boat.  The charm is perfect and extremely well made."
5.0	This seems to be a hip thing with teenagers.....it looks just as in pict with little more glitter......bought it as a requested present...gift was well received
5.0	Looks badass, the only slight flaw is the weird funky smell it comes with when you open it
5.0	Marcasites are my favorite, and this ring is stunning. It's even brighter and more sparkly than the picture. The flower design is so different and unique. If you like marcasites, you'll love this ring!
5.0	love this ring great looking
5.0	I was very unsure about ordering this particular ring because the picture isn't so great, however it was stunning when I received it. Very sexy ring, I would definitely recommend. I wouldn't wear it in water though because it looks like its going to fade and discolor, I have to take mine off to shower.
5.0	Beautiful piece of jewelry
5.0	I did not know what to expect when I ordered these beads. They are tinier than I thought they would be but so delicate and beautiful and sparkly! The order came very quickly and they are a great price! I have been looking for a purple crystal bead and the other places I have searched the bead has been twice and even 3x this price. Love it!
5.0	I really love this ring.  Everyone that has seen it thinks it is real.  It is just such a beautiful ring.
5.0	Love this ring! It comes exactly as it looks and doesn't leave my finger green. It's real amethyst and I was very impressed
5.0	Haven't taken it off since I received it. I have received so many complaments on it. I can't imagiane wearing any other necklace
5.0	It's everything I wanted.Just like the pic.but better in person. Want to purchase more bracelets like this!! Thumbs up. Pleased
5.0	Was looking high and low for the perfect sterling silver bracelet for my boyfriend at the time. When I received it in the mail, I was blown away at how beautiful it was. He loves it!
5.0	Love the long length. I wear it with a plain black shirt and it really stands out. The chain is nothing special but it is light enough to let the stone stand out. I get tons of compliments on this necklace. The stone is large but not so large that its too much. I would recommend this to add to your jewelry collection. However its difficult to find matching earrings but a simple gold pair looks great with it. The earnings inspired by Jolie do not match but do look great alone.
5.0	I am very happy with this product
5.0	"Love everything about it! Got one for my Aunt who rides and my husband loved it so I got him one too. Outside of his yellow Lance band, it's the only \\""jewelry\\"" he'll wear."
5.0	it looked great when i got it
5.0	Wish I would have ordered more, great size, not to large for a Granny.
5.0	I get a ton of compliments all the time. It is so beautiful. Very impressiive quality
5.0	Beautiful necklace!  I get compliments all the time.
5.0	Simple, but seem well made.  They were the perfect compliment to outfits in that color.<br />As mentioned before, the posts are a tad long [uncomfortable] if you forget to take them<br />out before sleeping.
5.0	Very pleased with my purchase! Fast shipping and the earrings were nicer than I had expected. Very pretty and sparkly, love the colors! Also love the pack of earring backs they came with.
5.0	Thank You so very much for my order ! It honestly took no time to get here! I thank you all so much for a satisfied gift !:) Hope my friend likes it! I know I love mine!
5.0	this is a significant piece!  I truly love it.  Solid, excellent sterling!  Looking for matching earrings!!!
5.0	Delivered promptly. Great price. I bought it for<br />a present, and it looked better and more pricey that one I purchased for higher price.<br />Good buy.
5.0	I bought this for my GF for Christmas, It came in a good box and looks awesome.
5.0	arrived early love the size
5.0	Were well received when given as a gift.  Well made and beautiful.
5.0	Exactly as advertised. Great buy
5.0	I also feared the worst with this product just because of the low price however when I received this I was pleasantly surprised by the fantastic quality of this necklace. I've had it for a couple of months now and it is still in perfect condition:)
5.0	Fits great and looks great !
5.0	This was exactly what I was looking for. The quality of this product was great. Made from very strong and sturdy metals.  Great transaction with seller.
5.0	I love it! It looks just like the picture and I could not be happier
5.0	I love them so much I already bought a second pair for a gift and I plan to get a third pair for another gift. They are beautiful.
5.0	I really enjoy it. It's a beautiful elegant piece, looks good on its own or with other bracelets on. It doesn't look cheap either. I have much more expensive pieces, but this one gets more compliments than them. Go figure...
5.0	Sturdy chains, great price
5.0	My husband lost his wedding band so I ordered this and he found his wedding band the next day. But when the ring came it was better than his other and it fit him better so he decided to wear the new one instead. Would recomend this ring to anyone on a budget.
5.0	Love the earrings, substantial weight, but not heavy on the ears and they are a great size.  Just exactly what I was looking for!
5.0	This ring is awesomr... it fits bperfectly. If you want a nice piece of jewlry that will last a while this is the one to choose.[[ASIN:B0054LB6JY Sterling Silver and White Sapphire Journey Ring - Size 7]]
5.0	"I didn't react to these earrings with red swollen ears after wearing them for 12hrs like I do with my older earrings.  They are sooo comfortable.  The clasp is a small loop that the back of the wire rests in (see picture).  My fumbling fingers took a couple of tries the first time I wore them to get it hooked.  The \\""jewel\\"" is very sparkly and has a mirrored back to it to prevent it from being totally translucent and washed out.  The hoops are 1/2\\"" diameter and the \\""jewels\\"" are 3/8\\"" at the widest.  They maybe small for some adults (not me), but would be cute on a girl for sure."
5.0	Got these for my son for Christmas and he loves them. He is a bit of a watch fanatic so the fact that they actually wind up and there is movement is really cool.  The other kids on his debate team that they were great too.
5.0	Nice for the price.  Got them for a bed-ridden relative who admired my real gold plumeria earrings that I bought in Hawaii.  I couldn't afford to buy her earrings like mine (which were about $400.), so the gold-plated over silver version made a nice substitute.  She loves them.
5.0	For years my aunt, an avid teddy bear collector, had wanted a silver teddy bear pin.  She has several gold ones but could not find a silver pin. I took up the search and was very pleased with this design.  My aunt loves it and wears it regularly.
5.0	I bought these for Christmas gifts for friends and family. Every person I gave it to loved this necklace. The loved the unique copper color, and the fact that it reminded them exactly of a fall leaf.
5.0	I based my purchase on the reviews for this ring and I was not disappointed.  It is looks like a very expensive ring.
5.0	I loved the cameo Victorian watch.  It's just what I wanted and it keeps time perfectly.
5.0	They do not turn on me and my ears are very sensitive. I can wear them all day without my ears hurting
5.0	I am a female who is 5' & has small hands.  It is extremely hard to find size 4 rings for an adult. I just received the ring today. This ring fits perfectly, is very comfortable,  is bold & beautiful on my finger. I am new to Celtic jewelry, but I like it.  I am well pleased with this purchase as I was with a previous purchase of Celtic Earrings from this seller.
5.0	Perfect, came right away I put it in and haven't taken it out...I'm loving it will diffidently order more jewelry.
5.0	I absolutely love this bracelet. It's simple and so pretty.  The smaller charms have positive messages like 'made in the usa with love'. I wear it every day. It like a constant reminder that life is good.
5.0	My son spotting another item that he really love continue to post item like this and my son will continue to get his wish.
5.0	love them. I have super sensitive ears and they haven't irritated them at all.
5.0	I received my purchase today and it's beautiful. It looks exactly like the picture. I'm so  happy with my purchase, I'm going to order a few more fiord my hubby to give to ladies in his department as Christmas presents. I'm Aldo going yo buy one fir my sister and my bestie. The toe ring  comes in a had box inside a copper and gold see through gift bag. Cute cute cute.
5.0	Very nice quality.  It features the palm trees, the Hollywood stars and its buildings in the background, all the things I remember from my visit there.
5.0	A bit smaller than expected, as others have pointed out.  Beyond that, very sturdy and actually a better value than many other similar styles from chain jewellery stores.
5.0	great gauging kit, does the job for when your just starting. I would recommend it to anyone wanting to start gauging their ears
5.0	My sweetheart and I got the matching set. I haven't taken this ring off for anything since ordering it back in September. I don't take it off at work, playing my guitar, cooking.. I don't even take it off during my work out routines. And I certainly put it through some Hell while doing P90X.<br /><br />Yet after all that abuse, the ring still looks as good as it did the day I got it. And the same can be said for my baby. It's a gorgeously simple ring and received many compliments. It's completely true to size as well so you don't have to worry about it being smaller or larger than expected.
5.0	it was a little smaller than i expected from the photos but it is so beautiful and im very happy with the rings!!!
5.0	I couldn't pass this piece up because of the price. Initially, I had my heart set on a more solid piece but I didn't like the price for the size dimensions being offered on my first choice.<br /><br />Since I've received my Hamsa I am happy with my final decision to buy this even with a bit of minor apprehension. It's beautiful, and looks amazing on me. ;)
5.0	This delicate little pendant is lovely, well made, and just what I was looking for.  Delivery was timely and it was well-packaged, to protect the stone.
5.0	These earrings are beautiful, exactly as pictured.  Shipment was rapid.  I am very pleased with my purchse and recommend this seller.
5.0	I have gotten many compliments on this necklace.  It is very beautiful.  It also has not turned my neck green yet, so that is a plus too.
5.0	This is a super cute plain ring that I literally wear every single day. I wear it on my thumb and I just love it!
5.0	this ring i got my girlfriend is really nice. it was a little smaller than i thought but it made up for it in the shine and clarity it produced. defiantly would buy again.
5.0	Bought these for my girlfriend and thought it would look beautifully on her... and well Feels real, looks real my girlfriend LOVED IT!
5.0	This product is very thick and sturdy. I am giving this as a graduation present and I think it's perfect! My favorite part was a simple personal note that was hand written on the receipt. That really made my day :) simple and sweet! Thank you I know she'll enjoy it!
5.0	Exactly what I was looking for. A great purchase.
5.0	this is so beautiful, Im so glad i ordered this again. thanks so much and ill be ordering more soon
5.0	I love this mala. Have many malas and have made some. Bought two because usually one mala is too small for my wrist so I had planned on combining them to make one bracelet but wasn't necessary...plenty big...well packaged...like receiving a small gift in the mail today. Very pleased.
5.0	Love this piece as well love the print and it is so cute. Can be paired with any type of style.  Highly recommended.
5.0	1.00 Carat Authentic Gemstone Simulated Princess Cut Aquamarine Pendant is simply beautiful The Gemstone in Aquamarine Pendant ans sterling silver necklace are definitely a set I would recommend to a friend.

5.0	Very nice quality for the price. Quality meets or exceeds Pandora name brand. Going to make Grandma very happy to recieve birthstone charms from her Grandchildren.
5.0	JUST WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR.
5.0	These are a nice size, sit nicely on the earlobes and have a natural looking pattern in them.  The color is a bold blue and really brings together any turquoise necklace or other jewelery.
5.0	for the price this item is a steal. it just sparkles and looks gorgeous on hand. it would be great as an engagement ring or just a right hand ring.
5.0	Thomas Sabo jewelry is so unique and for any generation. Recently added to my collection while shopping out in Las Vegas - 2 Thomas Sabo locations made shopping easy.
5.0	I loved it! It didn't fit so I can't say much about wearing it, but it is really good quality. Loved the matte. I was upset about not being able to wear it so I gave it to a friend. So far no bad news.
5.0	this was completely a pleasant surprise. it is substantial piece of jewelry for such a low cost.
5.0	i love love love this Bracelet and it was so cheap and looks and feels sooooo real!!!
5.0	I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS RING! I've been wearing it everyday since I've got it. I wash my hands with it on. I've had it for a few months and I have not seen that green ring show up on my finger! The material is awesome and they finally had my size (5). The script is hard to see but it is noticeable. Overall, I love this ring and if I ever lose it or just want another one. I'm definitely buying from here again!
5.0	I absolutely love these earrings.  They are well-made and go with so many styles of outfits.  The crystals are not gaudy, but are a perfect size and the hand blown glass is beautiful.  I can't say enough good about these earrings.  They have become one of my frequently worn pairs.
5.0	Pretty Jewelry Fast Service
5.0	This is a beautiful stone and well worth the money.
5.0	I orded this ring because I kept banging my real ring up and wanted something pretty to wear at work.  I have gotten so many wonderful complements on it and it is very comfortable to wear.  I ordered a size 5.5 because that is the size of my wedding right and because this ring is so much widder it felt tight at first.  The sizing is correct but my finger just wasn't used to it.  I considered ordering half a size bigger but I am lazy and didn't get around to it.  My  finger has adjusted to the new width and it is very comfortable.
5.0	Amazing deal. Amazing price. Just what I was looking for. I will be back for more.
5.0	I was pleasantly surprised by every aspect of this piece.  The shipment was perfect, the packaging outstanding.  The presentation spot on and the necklace nicely sized.  Could not be more pleased.
5.0	These earrings are absolutely gorgeous!! Very well-made, a little bit heavy, but you would expect that with all the beautiful stones. Anton Heunis is certainly a fine craftsman. You won't see yourself coming/going,they are a one-of-a-kind!
5.0	This is a great bracelet. My 11 year old daughter is going to love it when i tell her she is going to be a big sister. It looks to be well made and the bracelet itself is actually weighty. I  am thrilled with this product.
5.0	Bought these for my 2 year old daughter. Screw backs stay on great. Beautiful 14 karat gold. Perfect size for a toddler.
5.0	Bought this for my husband and couldn't be happier. This is a unique piece and perfect for a rune worker
5.0	The bracelet is very nice!  I recommend it.  My boyfriend is thin and I was afraid it was going to be big and almost slide off his wrist, but it fits perfect. It's shinier than I thought it would be, but it's classy.  I went to Jared's to compare men's stainless bracelets with this one, and this one definitely exceeds the quality of Jared's.  The one in Jared's had a couple scratches and the clasp was smaller and not as good quality as this one is.  This one was perfect.  Better than the jewelry store!  It came in a very nice box so it was a nice presentation.  My boyfriend loves it!
5.0	Love this necklace!  Excellent quality and sparkle.  Looks like the ones that cost a whole lot more.
5.0	It's snug, easy and fun! Good price too! The look without the pain and permanency of a piercing. Win-win formula!
5.0	Our 10 year old niece who was one of the Spanish dancers in this year's Nutcracker put on the necklace immediately and kept admiring it all through Christmas dinner. One of the best presents we have ever given her.
5.0	this item matches description and picture, so it would be looking nice with party dress and official dress. I like it
5.0	I bought matching rings for me and my boyfriend. We absolutely love them but the finish does scratch, it is not very noticeable, but being scratch resistant is one of the reasons I picked these rings. these rings are perfect for couples engagement rings or make nice anniversary gifts. This is a great ring for a man or woman that doesn't want a traditional diamond wedding ring or plain wedding band.
5.0	It came very quickly. Was the correct size. I ordered the same sizes that were on our receipt from our wedding rings 29 years ago. They are the perfect alternative for us because we live in a developing country, so if they steal them there will be no crying! Very good buy and smart looking.
5.0	I love this ring it's so stylish. I bought it for myself and it changes to the blue in certain lights otherwise it's mostly purple. Perfect. Just as pictured.
5.0	My Granddaughter loves it!!
5.0	I got close to what I expected.  It is a very nice bracelet. It is a little smaller in the with. I thought and the fillagree it a little closer together than I expected, but it is nice. The bracelet is a hair under one inch thick.
5.0	I love this ring, it has a nice heavy weight to it, and it looks good.
5.0	I received this ring very quickly from the seller. I was more than pleased when I opened the box and saw how beautiful it was! It is a large ring, but very comfortable. It is smooth and feels good on the hand. Even though it is large it does not extend high above the hand and therefore does not get in the way of normal movement. I wore it to work all day today and it was very easy to wear. It is definitely a statement piece - very unusual and gorgeous! The detail in the silver is beautiful and in the sunlight you can see a little gleam in the yellow jasper peeking through. I really like the way it looks on my hand and I've already received many compliments!I feel like I can wear this ring anywhere, casual or dressy, and it will be perfect. If you are looking for something different and eye-catching that is enjoyable to wear and beautifully made, then I highly recommend this piece!
5.0	Best stretching kit ever... every pair comes in a separate bag with the size printed on it...shipped extremely fast... you'll be receiving a pair of tapers and a pair of tunnels for each size... the extremely polished blue titanium looks and feels like the healthiest material for your earlobes... I'm utterly satisfied...would recommend it to a friend anytime...  update: I just lost my pair of 00(the last step) after 2 years using this kit, I can tell you with all certainty that I have used these and only these, every day for the last 2 years and my ears have never been nor infected or have it been painful to jump to the next size...  NOTE: The only bad thing I've encountered over this time is that the rubber bands are not really tight and they tend to fall off and one ends up losing them cause they're so light one won't even notice...the tunnels without the rubber bands are impossible to keep in the ear they will fall...  Apart from that everything is perfect...just be sure to remove the gauges before any physical activity and before going to bed​...
5.0	Product is high quality and arrived very quickly.  It was purchased as Christmas gift for my daughter.  Hopefully, she will love it.
5.0	These earrings are very cute, comfortable to wear and fashion forward. I receive many compliments when wearing them.
5.0	Much for beautiful than I expected.  Very nice sturdy quality.  Excellent price.  Lots of compliments on this one....Fast turn around
5.0	When I received this bracelet, I immediately fell in love with it.  The stones are not so large as to look fake but large enough to sparkle brilliantly.  I was concerned about the clasp as I had read other reviews that it easily becomes unhinged.  A pair of needlenose pliers tightened the security loops and I've worn it numerous times without having any problem.  I must say that I have purchased other more expensive bracelets with the same type of clasp and I had to do likewise with them.
5.0	giving this to my mom. I know she'll like it. very fair price.<br /><br />it chactches the light in a really cool way and appers to glow.
5.0	I ordered this necklace for my daughter to wear for her wedding.  It came today and it will be perfect for her winter themed wedding.  It's very pretty and well made.
5.0	Love the charm, have received lots of compliments on the stones
5.0	For the rapport price/looks, it is a great deal. Lovely man ring. My uncle loved it.
5.0	This necklace is just too cute. If you are familiar with the Dogeared line, their necklaces are simple and sweet, pieces you can wear everyday and easily layer. I bought this necklace for myself, and I wear it all the time. Quality is sound. It is sterling silver, and is non-irritating, especially if you have sensitive skin or a nickel allergy. Really cute item, great for that special Virgo in your life.
5.0	This chain is beautiful! I purchased this as a gift. I had already purchased the same chain in 18&#34;. It is incredibly tiny and delicate in appearance, but the &#34;box chain&#34; styling makes the chain incredibly strong. I am now going to purchase this chain in a 20&#34; size.
5.0	I love this pendant!  I was expecting it to be a little bigger.  The face of the sun is detailed well.
5.0	Amazing in multiple ways!<br />-Shipped in no time at all (came back from vacation to find it waiting for me in my mailbox)<br />-Shipped well and packaged with care<br />-Quality and appearance are just as presented on the selling page<br />-fits well and feels good
5.0	The quality of the product was as expected and the packaging was excellent.
5.0	It's exactly what I expected. I read the reviews that said it was &#34;not Pandora&#34; so they weren't pleased with the product. What do you expect with the price that was paid. If you want something less expensive than Pandora but still higher quality, spend a little more. I think this product is perfect for the price I paid for it. I love the green color and it is very shiny. I wish I had purchased more in different colors to use with a necklace I have. I would recommend purchasing this product.
5.0	This was a Christmas present for my granddaughter and she loved it. It's hard to find something for a 17 year old girl that she would like and according to her mom she wears them all the time.
5.0	I have not taken it off since I put it on the day I got it.  It is so light weight and comfortable I just leave it on all the time.  I have even worn other bracelets with it at the same time.  It is adjustable so if you have a small wrist you can wear it without having links taken out.  Does not tarnish because of the platinum coating on top of the silver.  It is always shiny.
5.0	Absolutely gorgeous! I get so many compliments!
5.0	I would recommend the Chuvora moonstone ring. I don't even know it's on my finger, it's so comfortable. I think it is<br /> a very pretty ring.
5.0	not bad for the price. fits a wee bit large but overall its a good product. looks nice and i would recomend.
5.0	Looks great and quality is good.
5.0	For any mother who loves and is proud of their daughter, this necklace is beautiful and says it all. Very satisfied.
5.0	Perfect replacement band.
5.0	I bought this in white and black. It's a fantastic little accessory and it looks and wears great. I would totally buy again. Cheap and perfect for wear.
5.0	Love it! I have bought three of theses each one for one of my friends and they love it!
5.0	"Ordered this last week, and received it today. Oh my... It's so beautiful and very nice. I can confirmed it is real silver due to stamped on it. I highly recommended this to whoever like \\""humble\\"" and tiny. (What I mean, this isnt too thicky as Rapper/or ego's)"
5.0	my wife loves this bracelet i recently purchased another bracelet for her for a christmas present and i broke two times in three weeks great quality jewelry from ice and gold
5.0	Haven't worn them yet, but I like the way they look. Perfect size...not too small and not too big.
5.0	"[[ASIN:B0006HB4XE Attractive Sterling Silver 1 MM Italian Box Link Chain 14\\"" 16\\"" 18\\"" 20\\"" 22\\"" 24\\"" 30\\"" Necklace]]    I ordered the 30-inch chain, and am very happy with the result.  The quality is excellent, it is very beautiful.  The real silver is very shiney."
5.0	Beautiful simple design that looks great!
5.0	I get so many compliments on these earrings and I absolutely love them.  At first glance, I was worried because of the price they may be too delicate, but upon receipt, they are well crafted and sturdy and just appear delicate.  They also make a pleasant little jingling sound if you shake your head hard enough.  The perfect accent whether for work, going out or even a casual day.
5.0	GOOD AT ALL  FATA  FATI
5.0	Very classy with a lot of sparkle.  I also purchased the smaller 4mm size which is great for a more casual look.
5.0	Great looking, well constructed product; thank you.
5.0	I looked for the perfect ring for 6 months and finally ordered this one. I received it in the mail and it literally took my breath away. I just hope it still looks this good in 2 years. Fantastic find and price.
5.0	Very few pearl charms have &#34;real&#34; pearls and this is one.  Larger than I expected.  Well made and looks very nice on my bracelet.  Excellent quality for a low price.
5.0	Exactly what I hoped for
5.0	I purchasd this almost 2 months ago, and haven’t taken it off.  I usually buy only white gold chains, but couldn’t afford one this thick, so I figured I’d try a plated one.  Well, this chain hasn’t been off of me since I got it, and I work out 4 to 5 times a week and Sweat a lot, and this chain hasn’t tarnished or lost any of the luster at all!  Hope it will last a lot longer.  For the price, you can’t beat this chain.  I pay more for a cab ride.
5.0	I'm putting together a charm bracelet for my mom for the holidays and this is exactly what I needed!  The quality is great and I know my mom is going to love it!
5.0	This ring really can withstand anything! It is a great product, extremely durable.  I would highly recommend the purchase of this product.
5.0	just what I was looking for
5.0	It is very beautiful. I was very impressed with the quality and the price of it. My daughter loves it.
5.0	Very pleased with this order. Got these right on time and got everything you see in the picture. Would deff by this again!
5.0	GOT THEM AND MY SON AND GRANDSON WEAR THEM
5.0	This design is beautiful and when I came across it I had never seen anything like it before. When I saw it in person, the beauty was remarkable. I would recommend this product to anybody.
5.0	Have bit worn yet but they are very pretty and bright.
5.0	I absolutely love this wolf moon pendant. It very beautiful and I will wear it for a long time to come.
5.0	Very Pretty Bracelet.
5.0	I love this body chain it adds pizazz to crop tops and bikinis
5.0	top shelf all the way wife and I have been collecting for maybe 20yrs now. simply the best...
5.0	This is exactly what I excpected.  However I was supposed to get a free gift and have not recv'd it yet.  I would order from this merch again.
5.0	very nice.  would buy again from this seller
5.0	Love them! Wear them almost every day.
5.0	my friend loved it as I did with mine.  unfortunately it's easy to get stuck and broken.....mine just lost the butterfly :(
5.0	I gave this to my mother as a present, she loves it. It's a little fragile but so beautiful!
5.0	These earrings arrived two days before expected and we're so beautiful! I'm very forgetful and often don't remember to take them off before I shower but they are still in such amazing condition and are so sparkly and lovely! 100% would recommend these to anyone looking into buying them
5.0	This necklace is very fun to add to many different outfits. I prefer to wear it with more casual outfits and really like the length of the necklace too. The size of the owl is about the size of a half dollar and the colors are bold, but not so bold that they take away from your outfit. They are a great accessory to a fall outfit, but I plan to wear it this winter as well. Goes best with neutral colored clothing and I prefer it most with a brown cardigan, jeans, and coganc boots. For a necklace this fun, remember to tone down the size and colors of your earrings. Something gold and simple would work best to complete the look!
5.0	Love KONOV! It does take a bit longer to ship/receive than domestic retailers but the quality is top notch and you can't beat the price! Both my husband and I have a few KONOV pieces, we wear them frequently and they've held up extremely well. Even when he forgets to take them off before he showers :-|
5.0	Very happy, lots of sparkle!
5.0	Retirement gifts should be treasured. Mary does indeed treasure these.  She will keep these forever, until she hands them down to her daughters, many years from now. Thank you.
5.0	I received this as a Mother's Day gift. It is beautiful! It came in a beautiful box secured with padding and a velvet bag. The color is stunning and each setting adds to the beauty of the necklace. I haven't worn it yet but it will go perfectly with the outfit I had planned to wear for Mother's Day. I am so pleased with the design and the placement of the rhinestones. Beautifully done and such care in shipping.
5.0	Was a gift for my wife. 2 things happened, I got out of the dog house. And I got lucky. THANK YOU!
5.0	The stainless steel rolo chain was just what I wanted at a great price. Fine quality and nice looking. Great value.
5.0	[[VIDEOID:74b0ca5415975a3ae4134796e9ce57a1]] I love the design of this ring. I've had it for about a month now and wear it fairly often. It has held up well so far and has had no tarnishing or other issues. My only complaint is that it turns my finger green when I wear it for too long, but that problem is easily fixed with nail polish.<br /><br />The sizes for this ring seem to run a little large. I ordered a size 6, and the ring that came was more like a size 7. Size 7 still fits on my finger, so it wasn't an issue for me. But I would suggest ordering a size smaller than what you normally wear.<br /><br />I also wanted to point out that the ring appears to be upside down in the picture the seller has posted. The design looks better if you flip it over (I couldn't figure out how to add a picture to the review, so I've added a short video of the ring facing the other way). Also, the 925 marking on the inside of the ring is upside down when the ring is held the way the seller shows it in the picture.
5.0	Nice Size, Granddaughter Loves it
5.0	The ring looks great, my wife needed something to wear while she's pregnant.  Didn't want anything too expensive but a nice temporary replacement.  Smooth transaction.
5.0	Beautiful ring fits perfect and is nice and sturdy
5.0	Beautiful pendant. Got it for my daughter so she can always have some of her beloved Husky with her. She loved it, and so so I.
5.0	The silver leaves with the large crystal catches the light perfectly and draws your eye right to the earrings. Excellent craftman-ship and quality materials are very evident. I am giving these as a birthday gift in February 2014. I purchased them when I saw them because they are sure to disappear!
5.0	I got this charm for my best friend as a thank gift for throwing my baby shower. Fits her pandora bracelet perfectly. She loved it!
5.0	I use it all the time.
5.0	This came on time and was soooooo cute! I received so many compliments on this item. I also purchased the necklace and it was the bomb.com as well!
5.0	Perfect size for my 12 year old daughter!  Worried that it would have that fake gold look but it's perfect - just what I was looking for!
5.0	Looks beautiful, it has a nice weight to it. It was a perfect gift for my wife
5.0	I love how it looks and fits! I would recommend it to anyone who loves guns like I do and has their naval pierced! I've got a lot of compliments on it!
5.0	Very pleased with this purchase.  The earrings are lovely just as they appear in the picture.  They arrived in a timely manner.  I was very happy with the entire transaction.
5.0	This is a much better quality than I expected and it also arrived quicker than  I thought. I was really impressed because I must admit that I didn't think it would be this nice for the price. I immediately ordered the necklace to go with it. It was a great but and I am hairy that I purchased it.
5.0	My wife has a rose gold ring and loves it. When we went to Hawaii, we saw a necklace just like this (only pure rose gold and a real diamond) and it was $400. She didn't care that it was only the finish that was rose gold or the fact that it was only a ZC. She loved the necklace and it was her favorite christmas present this year.
5.0	My go-to everyday ear wear. Backs snap on securely, and the posts are the perfect length, so they don't poke you in the head while you sleep.
5.0	Looks great, fits perfectly, nice and comfortable. Couldn't have asked for better.
5.0	This is an item that has been around forever.  The prices vary...and they always try to get you to buy some special cleaner with it...Buy from this company for the real deal,  great price and speedy delivery. (at Amazon)
5.0	I love this bracelet.  My Thai friend gave me complements on it.  I would recommend this bracelet to Amazon customers.
5.0	Just what we were looking for and good quality to boot.
5.0	These are small, but classy elegant huggie earrings. They are perfect to wear for dress up, or my favorite is with jeans and a t-shirt! I highly recommend. I got them in the white gold but I think the yellow gold would be just as beautiful. Thank you Amazon for offering such diverse and wonderful products.
5.0	great buy for the price...husband couldn't wear his original wedding band as he was having an allergic reaction to it for some reason...but he can wear this ring and no irritation at all. :)
5.0	These stones are absolutely glorious.  Truly beautiful.  Just smaller than I thought.  I should hace clarified that point with seller.  Nice stones.
5.0	Lost my wedding band some years ago. This one was just as advertised, works beautifully, and very reasonably priced. Thank you.
5.0	I started with the 14g acrylic neon blue tapers and just had to keep getting these :)<br />They aren't as small as I thought they'd be, about an inch and a half long. I've had no problems losing them, they've never fallen out, I even slept in them 3 hours after I sized up with no difficulty. Super comfortable, they don't irritate/poke me.<br />You really can't get a cheaper price, and these are REALLY great quality (personally) I mean you can order them elsewhere and spent $20 just on one pair that you're probably not going to use ever again. Although people recommend just borrowing plugs/tunnels instead of buying them I like having my own, and at this cost I can buy as many as I want without a budget problem.<br />Pain: probably a 5 on a scale of 1-10, it burned and got red. I used the stretching balm which helped  a lot to lube it up and soothe the irritation. Also helps to avoid infections, (I highly recommend the stretching balm if you size up quickly like me! ;] )<br /><br />Overall, I will definitely keep using these until I get big enough to use plugs! :)
5.0	A great prodcut. This ring is well made in stainless steel, making it much more durable. Looks more like a high priced ring, but is a great value. My wife loves it.
5.0	"As one reviewer mentioned, the backside of this ankh is hollow (but who looks at the back?) I added two pictures so you can see the front and back. I think it is a beautiful piece of jewelry. It's a nice size and weight, comes with an 18\\"" silver chain, in a nice small silver cardboard box. It is definitely a great value. It took exactly 7 days to arrive. Very satisfied."
5.0	Absolutely gorgeous and the perfect size!!!! Love it and how it shines! So well worth the money. Shipped fast, as well. One very happy customer =)
5.0	Simple, delicate and well manufactured
5.0	Love, love! Thanks so much for a great quality item.
5.0	BEAUTIFUL bracelet!!! weighty and was as described. More beautiful in person!
5.0	My bracelet looks exactly like the picture. I love it so much! I cant wait to get more!
5.0	I was so happy when I received my ring..Simply Gorgeous!! ...Exactly what I was looking for!!
5.0	Love them so much they are so great and because they don't have the backs they don't fall out, I just love them.  I use them for my ears...
5.0	I stumbled on this by accident looking for a gift for my gfs birthday and I'm so happy I did, when I first saw this I fell in love I knew it would fit her perfectly she has blue eyes and we both love The Legend of Zelda games. I was worried that it wouldn't get here by her birthday though with the time it gave me was about a month to be delivered, so when I woke up today and it came with the mail super early I jumped with joy, I couldn't wait to give it to my girl, and when she seen it she had the best expression on her face. Over all got here early, real nice box it came in, with a bag, beautiful piece, I'd definitely purchase from seller again. I'm so happy it really made my day. Highly recommend.
5.0	It was all I expected & more...My husband loved it, too...Great price, great presentation.  Recommend for all couples...Nice size for men or women.
5.0	Very well made! Product exceeded my expectations! I would buy from again and would recommend this as a gift or for personal wear.
5.0	Love it...wear it every day! :)
5.0	Nice stones, the silver is heavy and quality looks great with an enhancer or just by itself, I recommend this necklace
5.0	"Bought this to wear as an alternative to wearing my \\""real\\"" wedding band.<br />Not quite the same color as a platinum band, but the tungsten carbide is MUCH more scratch resistant."
5.0	Very cool earrings! Fit great and long studs make them very comfortable.
5.0	In love with these earrings they are the perfect size bow not to big not to small. This a great deal
5.0	There's nothing more important than family and hopefully this will keep her on track as she goes through her teen years. :)
5.0	I ordered this for my daughter as a stocking stuffer for christmas, it came in a good packaging.  I cant wait for her to open it.
5.0	love this jewelry, bought it several times, and will be buying again
5.0	I received this bracelet as a gift from my husband for Valentine's Day and it is even more beautiful than the photo. The length of the chain lets it float freely and settle around the forearm and it is heavy enough to keep the flowers right side up and showing at all times. The crystals are beautiful and richly colored and the rose gold accent at the centre of each flower adds a nice contrast to the black centre crystal. Such delicate little details like the texture on each 'petal' make the design all the more alluring and the craftsmanship is of high quality. An absolutely gorgeous addition to my jewelry collection that I would recommend to anyone.
5.0	Muy bonita ..buen precio..y luce elegante.. todos me dicen algo
5.0	Keep up the good work Silver Closeout! I am a returning customer and I am looking forward to buy more items from you. Thanks!
5.0	I love these earrings. They are the perfect size for my second ear hole and so sparkly. I'm thinking of buying them in the size larger as well to go in the first hole in my ears. The only negative is they do snag on my satin pillow case but I still love them.
5.0	This ring is well made and posses beautiful sparkle!  The quality of the craftsmanship is that of a MUCH more expensive piece of jewelry!  This company's product are beautiful and a spectacular value
5.0	These are gorgeous happy I selected these for my bridesmaids. Good Quality and stunning.
5.0	It's very beautiful! I'm very happy with my purchase.
5.0	It's very pretty. I use these these to make my circles for festivals here in my home town. These are great for summer.
5.0	I love this necklace.  It was exactly what I was looking for.  I might have to get some additional colors
5.0	Beautiful color and nice length and weight.  And the turquoise skulls are a unique spin.  Love them!
5.0	I absolutely love these earrings. They looked like they would be heavy but they are very light weight, without taking away any of the beauty. If you don't like long earrings, these aren't for you but I personally love the lenght. They a very shiney, but has a classy look. The lapis stones are great and match perfectly. They also, have a shine to them but not like a bead. The post are long, which I need because I have thick earlobes. These were packaged in a blue velvet like bag, then placed in a small box and then put in a bigger cardboard box for safety. They did arrive before there due date. These remind me of something that would be made by American Indians. I also, bought the necklace.
5.0	It was amazing! Loved it, and loved how careful they packaged it!
5.0	We wanted enexpencive wedding rings that can take a beating. We both work outside with our hands. And this ring is perfect. A ring that looks nice, and can take outdoor work, that is under 50 bucks, amazing. Great buy!
5.0	I bought it for my bf n we both love it , I hope ya guys enjoy so much like he do.
5.0	beautiful! They will make fabulous gifts!
5.0	Very different and beautiful piece!!!
5.0	Very happy with my purchase.  The pearls match each other in size and shape and look far more expensive than what I paid.  I have received many compliments and they are an integral part of my jewelry wardrobe.
5.0	I just got these today and they look really nice. They have a bunch of different colors so you could change it to match your outfit for the day. Its really nice for somebody that just got there lip pierced because it gives you a basic selection of different colors.
5.0	love the necklace. a little small, but that's ok.  It's very pretty and had many compliments on it. I've had this for a while now and has not rusted or turned colors
5.0	I absolutely love these earrings. They look exactly as pictured and are so dainty and pretty!! I love the rose gold tone and they look great with everyday wear. I am thinking about purchasing another for my 2nd earring piercing.<br /><br />Very cute earrings, great quality and at a great price!!
5.0	I LOVED this ring got numerous comments on it. The feelers bent a little and caught on clothes but it's my fault I never took the ring off. I ordered a second one. LOVE IT THAT MUCH
5.0	Exactly what I was looking for
5.0	This bracelet  is perfect. Goes well with my collect. I get so many compliments I even bought my niece one
5.0	Love this...gave it as a gift and they loved it as well.  Ordering in black now and possibly other colors and you can never have too many pearls!
5.0	Its awesome having a bit of memorabilia from my favorite anime. The pendant is lovely and I wear it quite often as its very fashionable. Although the necklace itself isn't a black cord but a silver linked chain, its still awesome and doesn't take away from the overall look.
5.0	Very classy necklace tree!
5.0	Just what I've been looking for!
5.0	Quality was better than my expectations. Received in the expected delivery time!
5.0	the stones have a dark pinkish hue in the sunlight, but it doesn't detract at all from the beauty of the piece.  I bought this for my daughter's birthday.  We have been raising her son together for the past 20 months and the fact that it had the two diamond hearts (which is our shared birthstone) on either side of the ruby heart (which is her son's birthstone) made it a perfect choice.  I am very happy with my purchase.
5.0	How can't you love it OH.  IO
5.0	This was a gift. She LOVES this bracelet!
5.0	Love it!  It was hard to find one for Mother/Son, but I found this one and I really like it.  My son thinks it's great too!
5.0	This Item is Very Cool I wear it Every where, I Get asked about it All the Time? Are there any More to Order?[[ASIN:B00310XWRY Character Pin - Making the Difference]]
5.0	These are cute.  Not sure if I'll actually use it for a necklace, but the octopus alone was worth the money.  I might make it into a key chain.
5.0	Beautiful! Doesn't shine as bright as other diamonds I've purchased but it's still a stunning and elegant piece.
5.0	I was so pleased when I got these earrings.  I have a loop and examined them closely and found them to be perfect.  I  gave them to a young lady and she was so pleased.  I could'nt believe the price.  These same earrings (3/8 Blue Diamonds) were at a jewelry store for $600.00 -- I kid you not.  BLOWN AWAY
5.0	Just as pictured. Adorable.
5.0	Pretty. Good quality.
5.0	6mm is a perfect size for a beaded bracelet. I previously bought a 12mm which was so heavy the beads loaded the elastic holding it together.  This one is just right.
5.0	This is great for my grandaughter she wants all I purchased  did not see this one  the  B  her Mom purchased a letter for herself so I know Brooke will love this
5.0	Bought this for my mom for mothers day and she loved it!!!
5.0	bigger than I thought it would be. very pretty.
5.0	This ring was more than I could ask for! For the price this ring was worth it. Fits perfectly and I love how the rings stack into a 4 leaf clover. I wasn't sure I was going to like this ring but I do.
5.0	Very cute necklace! Looks really good, i thought better than the picture here, when i opened it!
5.0	Love it... Had the same necklace years ago and it got lost. I'm so happy to have another.
5.0	I bought this for my bf and he loves it!  He likes the simplicity of its design and has been wearing it often.  Glad to find this company's products on Amazon.
5.0	The braceler is nice and beautiful. It is hard and strong enough. I will give it to one of my friends as a New Year gift.
5.0	I love my ring and it did arrive on time but i am disappointed in the size of the symblos, so small i can hardly see them but other then that it's perfect
5.0	This necklace is gorgeous and it looks good with any color. It's a great purchase.
5.0	So beautiful. This arrived in the time it said it would. I wear brooches all the time and this is one of my favourites.
5.0	These earrings are absolutely perfect for a baby girl's christening.  The picture online did not do them any justice they are just absolutely gorgeous.
5.0	Such a great ring! I TRUELY love this ring! It is so stylish. Trendy too. It fits great & I receive so many compliments!!
5.0	Looks beautiful can't wait to put it on my gfs finger
5.0	Perfect size , quick shipping , reasonably priced
5.0	I love the bracelet am looking forward to feeling the difference with the magnets. I had a little trouble with the link removal tool. Worked great on the larger braclet,,, maybe just me.
5.0	Amazing product. Is as describes 5/5
5.0	My dad has everything. If he wants something he goes out and gets it, so sometimes it's hard to think of something clever to give him. Well, this humidor fit the bill. It is small enough he can take it with him when he travels, carry it with him to the office, and take it home and keep in his office there. Was really impressed with how well it is made. The case itself is cedar lined inside then felt over that. I saw some at the mall that were way more than this, but not near as nice. They weren't built as good. The leather on this feels real supple. Dad is pretty picky, but this he will not be able to find fault with, I am sure he's going to be thrilled with this and he and his buddies will have a new gizmo to look over and use. The little tools that came with this seem like they will be handy, too. I know dad's always looking for the cigar trimmer, now he can keep it handy in his case. In my book, this was a great price, no shipping costs, it got here fast and this is high quality. I am happy I found it and bet my dad will be glad to get it, too.
5.0	This is a beautiful ring gift box and worth the price. Unfortunately for me (/=0) I did not notice the &#34;Double&#34; in the description and actually, until now did not know &#34;double ring boxes&#34; existed. We originally planned to use it to sell a very fine diamond ring that has not been in use (from previous engagement many years ago) for a long time. The ring needed a really nice box to hold it but when we realized it was a double box, we just decided to use it for my three wedding rings; a princess cut center diamond w/princess cut channel stones, and 2 channel set matching Eternity rings. They all fit perfectly side-by-side in this lovely Mahogany Box.<br /><br />We are using my original wedding ring box which is also nice but not as wide for the other diamond ring so it all worked out well.<br /><br />If you are looking for a truly nice &#34;Double&#34; ring/gift or ring storage box, you will not be disappointed!
5.0	Great chain. Love the length.  Perfect for Florida, not too close to my neck!  Would buy it again if need be.
5.0	It fits well, I wore them for a very longtime!
5.0	Very pretty and rich looking.  Love the leverback. Would like more with this style and in silver too.  Looks good with long or short hair
5.0	THIS IS A GREAT BUY...Was very pleased with this item..the quality was great . Alot better than I had actually expected. I would buy this product again
5.0	Very beautiful.  Much better quality then I expected.  The options are endless.  I wear it with a plain shirt to dress it up.  I highly recommend this to everyone  =)
5.0	Love it. It's absolutely beautiful. If you want something simple and elegant, this is it.
5.0	It's beautiful! Great buy
5.0	My fiance' loves his so much he wants to wear it even though the wedding isn't until July!  He says he likes that it isn't big or gaudy, but is still very classy and masculine.
5.0	I love this. It's the perfect size. The details are gorgeous. Simply love it. Would be a great gift too.
5.0	what can I say, just like the others I bought, great.
5.0	This ring is gorgeous! Sparkles and just looks beautiful on the finger.  I love it.
5.0	Very vivid colors, very good quality... overall beautiful.
5.0	It is adorable!!  I wish it was a little bit larger.  But it still looks good around my neck.  Thank You!!
5.0	I must admit, I wasn't expecting this ring to look at all like the picture. When I received it, I was in shock. It looks better than the picture! The ring is absolutely gorgeous! No one would think that it is CZ. The CZ diamonds shine like authentic diamonds and the sterling silver band has a nice polish that adds to the rings' effect. I highly reccommend this ring at such a cheap price. People would think you spent some $$$ for this ring.
5.0	Exactly what i was looking for. Very delicate Rosary! live it!
5.0	Wow, what a nice quality made bracelet, from the leather to the stainless steel buckle. The price is very good as I have seen others at twice the price!!!
5.0	I also bought this to replace a lost one.  He loves it!  It's nicer than the first one!!  I'm going to look at the women's for me!
5.0	I could not be happier. It is beautiful, and sturdily wrought.
5.0	these are really lovely.  Well-made, came in a pretty box.
5.0	Came super fast 😌 super cute and looks like the pic .
5.0	I got this charm for my niece (she's 8) who has recently become obsessed with The Little Mermaid, I have attached it to a little bracelet chain for her and it is so adorable!! It's very durable so I know she won't be able to break it within the first 20 minutes lol  she just loves it and was so excited to wear it to school! My brother told me she has not taken it off since she got it, so I am a happy buyer right now! :D
5.0	These earrings are adorable. They are exactly what you see on the picture. I love the heart shape. The quality and the price are very good. They are shiny and fit me very nicely. I am glad I got them! The shipping was fast.
5.0	The earrings are beautiful and I am happy with them. Yes, I recommend them.
5.0	I love, love, live these earrings.  The size was as pictured and they are so cute! Great purchase for the price!
5.0	my grand daughter is 7 years old and this will be her first piece of jewelry to wear, she feels like a grown up having her own necklace
5.0	I bought these earrings for a dear friend of mine who was going through a difficult time... the amethyst is meaningful to her and she was absolutely thrilled with the earrings.. thank you.  A great pair of earrings that made someone smile....
5.0	These earrings are gorgeous. I bought them for my mother, and she loves them. They are very light and well made. I would highly recommend these earrings.
5.0	Looks just like the pic and I got one extra yay!! and the length is at a attractive placement.
5.0	Look great, excellent price. Long time delivery though.
5.0	Again just as for the pendant, the actual product was a bit darker than I expected but that turned out to be a blessing because of the more edgy masculine feel that came with that. Really nice piece of jewelry for such a good price, I've worn mine everyday since it arrived. Sadly, I lost touch with the person I was planning on giving the other ring to. He misses his would-be owner!
5.0	I got this for my wife to replace a broken chain she had. She loves it, so I love it
5.0	Beautiful garnet pendant. They go well with the earrings I also purchased. They arrived in perfect condition.
5.0	B-day gift for some one, I will hae to ask her how she likes it and now good it is.
5.0	Love it it never leaves my neck . I love the way it fits around my neck also it doesn't clutter with my other necklaces
5.0	Beautiful great value
5.0	These are beautiful, simple, and provide just the right amout of flash in a business setting. Subtle and professional.
5.0	Beautiful beads! They are so expensive looking and very colorful. They fit the bracelet well and love the glittery shine!
5.0	Bought it as a gift. It was very well received. It looks very elegant when wearing. The stone is colorful and beautiful.
5.0	The necklace is beautiful and matches other purchases that I have made with you I have received<br />Many compliments when I wear it to church
5.0	These earrings are absolutely beautiful.  The craftsmanship is insane!  I am already looking to see what else I can buy  ...LOL
5.0	For those of you who follow the left hand path or simply love Satan/Baphomet this necklace is for you. It's got weight to it, the necklace itself is strong and theres also a great amount of detail put into the sigil. It's also bigger than I thought. I plan to wear this every single day.
5.0	I love this little earrings! they are small and stay shiny after many uses without constant cleaning. Great everyday wear!
5.0	This  chain wears very nicely. I would recommend this chain to a friend. The weight of the chain is solid and my diamond cross looks nice on it.
5.0	Shipped pretty fast! It seemed a whole lot bigger based on this picture but it's pretty cute anyways. Perfect to add to a simple outfit.
5.0	Its so delicate and pretty. I bought it a month back. I wear it all the time. Love to see it on my waist.
5.0	i love this ring,it looks great,i got size 7,it fits my ring finger perfectly!<br />the topaz is a little of a different color,than the picture. not teal but deep green,emerald color
5.0	This ring is beautiful can't believe the cost looks very expensive. I truly love this ring.
5.0	Got this for my daughter for her birthday and she loves it!!!  She is a sloth lover.
5.0	The pendant shipped in a very short period of time from China. I am impressed by its weight and the Scripture..but can some one tell me is this Old Testament, Italian, Spanish??? And what does the ring represent?
5.0	The delivery was quick and the quality of the bracelet is great. It also comes with an Alex and Ani bag, which was perfect because I gave it as a gift!
5.0	She loves it  but could be shiner
5.0	I like it, and it was interesting to find that some of my friends ask me if it was the real designer's set. All the pieces are heavy and well done.
5.0	I cant say enough about this ring.It is beautiful. The quality is exceptional.It looks very exspensive. I recommend it highly
5.0	I purchased these earrings for my daughter to go with the tanzanite ring of her grandmother's.  The blue purple color is quite srtiking and looks great with so many complementary colors.  I highly recommend, you will enjoy them
5.0	this is a nice necklace  - it has a substantial feel to it.  Not cheap-feeling at all. The length is good for us bigger gals.
5.0	These earrings are great.  They look real and they are a good size.  They are an excellent value.  You can't go wrong with this purchase.
5.0	I am an Italian Grandmother and it is tradition to give the Italian Horn to children and grandchildren for Luck.<br />It was perfect size and price for my liking and budget
5.0	Bought this for my wife for mother's day.  Will look beautiful on her and she will love it's petite look.
5.0	Great looking ring.  I ordered it for my fiancee since we do lots of outdoor activities and her engagement ring and wedding band are much to valuable to be taken on these adventures.  We call this one the camping ring.
5.0	I can't always carry my big shield around everywhere.  These little studs work just fine without being so cumbersome.
5.0	I love this.  Sometimes I just want a plain no fuss wedding band, something where the prongs dont catch on things or the profile of the diamonds isnt too high.  This ring has a very rich look while being so totally easy care.  I am delighted with this purchase, and can highly recommend it.
5.0	Came around time dated, very happy. Glad it won't rust or tarnish
5.0	I bought this from a gold box deal in the turquoise color.  It has a nice weight to it and feels well made.  The larger glass beads are a little darker and greener than the more aqua-color in the smaller beads in the middle.  Overall, this is a nice piece and I am very happy with it.  I will probably purchase more similar pieces from Amazon.com collection based on this experience.
5.0	Lovely bracelet and great price! I bought this in blue sapphire. The sapphires are simulated but look much more natural than others I've seen; these are dark, deep blue, almost opaque, rather than the see-through, ultra-sparkly simulated stones that look like rhinestones. The bracelet has a strong clasp and a lovely drape.
5.0	I wanted to find a ring I could wear to work in place of my wedding ring. This ring is perfect. I do not worry about ruining this ring and I get so many compliments on it. A lot of my customers think that this is an old heirloom and very expensive.
5.0	perfect , great quality , ordered a few of these types of bracelets and this is by far the best quality one i have gotten. prettier pink than even pictured.
5.0	It fit my granddaughters Pandora bracelet perfectly and it is beautiful.  It is good quality and looked exactly like the picture.  Thanks
5.0	I am still AMAZED that I was able to find a genuine labradorite and sterling silver ring for such a bargain that also has classic elegance and power.  I will be purchasing from this company again and have already informed countless friends.<br /><br />Thanks!
5.0	beautiful my daughter has not taken it off since we purchased this well made piece :)
5.0	Stones are very clear and sparkle, setting is secure. Very nice pair of earrings. Well worth the purchase. I have to order another pair fory daughter now.
5.0	Works for me really well helps protect my already broken wrist.
5.0	I was quite nervous about buying this ring because I was overseas but I didn't need to be. The ring is gorgeous. It fits my husband well and is quite comfortable. The box it came in looks quite classic. I'm happy with the purchase.
5.0	I really like it and it is a very different type of bracelet.
5.0	Love the price on these two bracelets!  The clasp seems strong enough, and it will accommodate the large hole charms and beads.
5.0	We found the same ring in town for $300.  He was excited to get it in the mail and it fit perfectly.
5.0	My birthstone is Amethyst andI have 2 traditional dark  purple rings.I finally bought a green amethyst ring & this pendant matches perfectly! It's more beautiful than the photo shows.
5.0	recently got this item and I really like it. A little bigger than I expected but still a good size. They sent me a complementary extra chain to give a 5 star review so here you go (: keep up the good work
5.0	I think I wear these the most out of the grip I gauges I bought last month. They aren't hard to match with an outfit or another set of earrings.
5.0	Everything was on point, came early, excellent packaging, very nice quality
5.0	bought this for my son and its shinny and has held up from 2 deployments , it is starting to come apart where the clasp is but for the price its a good product
5.0	Very pretty but have not had a chance to were yet. But they are very nice.
5.0	It was a larger flower embellishment than I thought.  Great price!!  My daughter wore it the first day it arrived.
5.0	These earrings are just what I wanted.  Perfect size and look very nice for the price.  Would buy them again in a minute!
5.0	very cool rings... i would buy them again
5.0	Has gotten a few stares.
5.0	Great rings. You could not tell they are not real. Love them. Wear them everyday and I am hard on my rings. Great quality.  Update:. Years later they still look amazing. Would buy again and again and again.
5.0	prettier and more sparkley than I expected!
5.0	Very nice quality but the chain was thicker than I thought it would be.
5.0	"What a gorgeous necklace!  The \\""family\\"" is nicely sculpted and the diamonds are a wonderful accent.  The 18\\"" chain is a great length and weight for the pendant.  Awesome value and lovely gift idea!"
5.0	The Irish pendant dog tag is better than photo promised. Would have appreciated a word on the length of the chain, as it's longer than I like. But thanks overall for your prompt, quality service.
5.0	This unusual necklace makes more than a statement.  The color, while probably not seen in nature, is startling, the necklace is substantial, and  I'm sure that no one else in my world has one!
5.0	My sensitive ears are a litmus test for genuine 14K gold and these passed the test.  They seem sturdy and well made.  I get compliments all they time.  They're a good in-between size so they work for casual, office, or dress-up.  I take them on and off daily and have had no trouble with the wire bending or breaking.  I expect they can stand up to ordinary wear and tear.  They arrived well packaged in an attractive velvet pouch.
5.0	Product matched the description and my expectations. They were bought as a gift and we were both pleased with the cufflinks.
5.0	Nice necklace.  Think green pearls with subtle grey vein running thru them.  I dont look good in clunky jewelry and this set is colorful but smaller scale then some of the other necklaces I viewed.  The earrings are nice but more casual than the necklace.
5.0	The stone is much darker and looks like a huge emerald.  It's a perfect addition to my pirate garb.
5.0	The ring is of high quality. It is shined to perfection! the size is dead on. I'd recommend it to anyone!
5.0	Beautiful ring but does scratch easily.
5.0	Loved these earrings, the perfect size.
5.0	This ring is Beautiful.  I fell in love with it!  I have to mention that the customer service at Front Jewelers is outstanding.  Neda, Maria, and Miranda were terrific, they are professional and patient.  Thank you all for everything you did for me.<br /><br />Claudia
5.0	I am allergic to metal alloys, so I was happy to find these titanium earrings.<br />They are just as stated and were mailed in a timely fashion.  Thank you
5.0	These fit my 22 month old perfectly. I do wish they had 5mm in screw backs, but these 4mm ones are big enough for her now. I love the screw backs because she can't get them off.
5.0	The necklace arrived on time previsted, well protected. the wood hook is beautiful, well crafted, with rich veins in dark brown and black color; the glass beads are in diferents sizes and forms, but between a petty range and that makes looks more beatiful, it has 16 strands of beads.
5.0	Awesome ring. Fits true to size
5.0	Constantly getting compliments on it, fits wonderfully, and is actually really durable for how thin it is. Definitely recommend buying
5.0	I usually break anklets within a few days but this is very well made and very pretty
5.0	Love these! Perfect size and not heavy at all. Easy to put in
5.0	Super cute earrings, earrings came fast- love them
5.0	Husband loves it. Get comments in public Jacuzzi at Gold's Gym on what it is.Have gotten several requests on where purchased. We live in Texas at the current time so, of course, they first wonder if its a bullet. Thinking of purchasing more so that now I can get a small business going & get a profit.
5.0	I wear sandals all summer long. I try and wear different rings for most of my outfits. I love all of mt accessories.  It is going to be a great summer
5.0	my husband loves the bracelet! He says it really work!
5.0	A+ Amazon Seller! Highly Recommend! An Asset to Amazon!  Great Products!
5.0	A beautiful bracelet.  The beads are smaller than I expected (⅛th inch to 3/16 inch diameter), but overall the bracelet has a more delicate, elegant look than other awareness bracelets I've seen.
5.0	Gorgeous jewelry piece to add. Arrived very fast.
5.0	It was so beautiful. It wasnt to big but my aunt loved it! It was a beautiful blue and it looked so nice and shiny.
5.0	I bought this charm but with 3 children when it came it was beautiful!  After I saw that they made it for 2 children I asked to return and they did so no questions asked.  Was very pleased with service.  Wife very pleased with charm
5.0	It's very nice I really like it will order more
5.0	I bought the earring for my granddaughter, and she loves them
5.0	This is a great ring. Very nice looking. Bought it for my daughter, but it ran a little big so I kept it and bought a second smaller one for her. It does run a smidge big but not too bad.
5.0	Great on my pandora bracelet. It's a little smaller then my other charms, but nevertheless it looks just fine on my bracelet.
5.0	this belly ring is sexy, glad i got it its worth it i absolutley love it , its a bit long , so its great with cropped shirts
5.0	Wife bought this as an &#34;extra&#34; ring- she loves it.  We bought several in various sizes as sizing is a huge headache.  This is her favorite.
5.0	Omg I love love LOVE this necklace!! I just got it yesterday and I really didn't expect it to be so bright and sparkly! The quality is amazing for the price, and I when I wore it out last night, I got tons of compliments.  I will definitely be looking through to buy some more stuff from this seller!!!

5.0	sky blue and sea blue with cute little turtles and sparkles.  Fits my Pandora bracelet.  Love it!

5.0	Beautiful Earrings. LOVE Them.
5.0	This ring fits as described. It looks good even though I have been wearing it during work. Great transaction A+
5.0	It was a perfect gift for me and my boyfriend ...we love them...I did not like much the necklaces but the pendant is so cute and we are already using them all the time...I will recomend them
5.0	This is a very pretty ring and a very nice size.  It has a lot of bling, but it's not too big and looks real and believable.  Love it!
5.0	My favorite necklace and it came fast, it's just as shown
5.0	The infinity necklace i bought was beautiful. Better than the picture i have seen. Worth every penny. Shipping was precisely on time. Well deserved rating.
5.0	Arrived correct and true to its description! The size is perfection. I ordered a size 7 and fits perfectly on my forefinger.
5.0	I had a lot of common on how pretty the looked. They have a nice sparkle when you move your head.
5.0	Great quality! Beautiful piece of jewelry. Have gotten lots of compliments. Reasonably priced.
5.0	Very pleased with these earrings. They look as good as my real diamonds!!!
5.0	I purchased this ring as a gift for my daughter's best friend. It arrived in a cute box within days of ordering, which was appreciated. Although the prongs aren't very thick & this isn't considered&#34; heavy&#34; ring, the color of the peridot and the design can't be beat for the price. Excellent value for the money. Would recommend this item to anyone.
5.0	My husband and I bought this ring because I have a tendency to lose and misplace things. So instead of buying an expensive ring that I may lose totally accidentally  (more like misplace...forever) we went with something more affordable just in case. I was not disappointed. The ring is gorgeous I've had it a year now still just as shiny and beautiful. I always get compliments and no one knows the difference.
5.0	My fiance loves this ring! We looked through jewelry stores but couldn't find anything near our budget...we came across this ring and can't believe we found such a sturdy, scratch resistant ring for such a great price. He loves how heavy and durable it is.
5.0	It's beautiful. .the pictures do not do it justice. But I'm here to tell it's very beautiful. ....
5.0	I was looking for something to clean my tarnished silver jewelry. I thought there had to be something to clean better than those liquids that you soak in and then have to scrub. They never seemed to get the jewelry clean and you can't soak gemstones in them. Well, this cloth is like magic. I really was going to toss some of my sterling chains that I had put way beacause they were so black they didn't even look like they could be saved. I got this cloth and rubbed them and instantly, shiny, beautiful jewelry again. They haven't looked this good since the day I bought them. I cleaned gold and silver and I cannot believe the difference. I am NEVER going back to those liquid or cream cleaners again.
5.0	The necklace is tiny but very sweet. I thought I chose a right one to be a present for girls. But I don't why the package seemed like being touched before I opened the package. But that's fine, I still got the right thing.
5.0	It was the perfect size for my daughter to always have her granddad with her. Its a heart that she will keep by her heart forever.
5.0	My son is ever Happy with it. It was delivered 3 weeks before the estimated days!
5.0	had this for awhile then lost it.great earring for the price ,plan on getting another soon.have not seen another like it.
5.0	Can faster then specified! Nice. Instead of paying alot for one my daughter saw at American Eagle I got this for dirt cheap but looks the same and descent quality.
5.0	nice quality.........................................................................................................................................&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62;Now why would you require more words that's not what I want to do! you folks suck! suck suck
5.0	"Purchased these as gifts for friends, and was very pleased with both the quality of the pearls (freshwater, minor blemishes on 1-2 beads per strand, only noticed because I was really looking for them) and the necklace itself. Beads are individually tied, and the clasp is sturdy. The necklaces were nearer 16\\"" long, as other reviewers have indicated."
5.0	very nice but I lost my second hip dermal within a few days. Wish I hadn't because I really like these I will get more
5.0	it's a greaduation gift for my daughter and it really is very pretty and I'm sure she will love it.
5.0	I love this ring. I bought not fully sure what I would get by other reviews. The sizing was dead on. The stones sparkle great and catch the light just perfectly. One ring is slightly larger than the others but I put the larger one in the middle and actually like that look better than I would if they were all the same. I would recommend this ring to anyone!
5.0	These are very attractive.  I'm an onyx lover and I'm enjoying these very much.  I often get compliments.  Worth the money.
5.0	For the price ($9.27) and free S&H, this cannot be beat. Good looking, sturdy, and I love the steel band~ the part that always rots out on me as I wear it when I water the  garden, wash the dog, etc. Just be prepared to wait 10 weeks for it as it ships from Hong Kong!
5.0	beautiful bracelet. I bought this as a Christmas gift , and i'm sure it will be a hit .
5.0	This was a gift for a family member. It was the perfect size and color needed to match a ring. She loved it.
5.0	I left the jewelry industry about 10 years ago, and absolutely Loathe paying retail.  My daughter had a similar necklace I'd gotten elsewhere years ago, but even though it was sterling, it had become discolored due to contact with chemicals.  To cheer her up, I researched having it remade in scrap gold I had (would've cost over $200... with ME supplying gold), then tried finding one in sterling.  Not only is this one about twice the weight of her original one, it had a much better chain (snake style), and Looks Fantastic!  I was really leary about buying jewelry online, even going as far as to contact the seller to ask a question, which they promptly answered.  It was a great purchase, Excellent value, and great customer support.
5.0	Got these to replace my larger CZ studs and I really like them. They look just as pictured and are a really good price. Also they came with a extra chain, cloth bag, and box.
5.0	This pendant is beautiful, just the right size. Not to small not to large could be for male or female. Came really fast too. A lot of value for the price.
5.0	This is a great bracelet and great quality.  My husband wears this and it really does remind you to take a minute to think and remain calm.  I would definitely recommend.
5.0	These pink rings are very cute and fit perfectly in my second ear holes. Love that they<br />are shiny and Titanium, perfect price!
5.0	This anklets great! I bought it for a friend for her birthday, it came about a week or two earlier than expected. You could say she really liked it. It might come a bit big, but it doesn't look bad if you leave it as it is, or you can always tie it together. Definitely would recommend.
5.0	perfect on it's own or as an accompaniment to other similar bracelets.
5.0	Even better in person
5.0	Very nice necklace.  I love it!
5.0	the charm was as pictured.  is so hard to find something nice for autism.  I gave it to my daughter in law and she loved it.  thank you
5.0	I was pleasantly surprised when this order shipped in early than the estimated shipping time. The likeness that it has to the original $5,000 Cartier Love bracelet is phenomenal. It has screws on both ends of the bracelet to put it on and it even came with its own mini screw driver. The color appears to be brass in the picture but the bracelet came in a very nice tinted rose gold color. The color comes soft and not harsh as it seems it would in the picture. The engravings and the placement of the crystals were all evenly spaced out.  For the price listed and the sturdy quality of the bracelet, it was an amazing deal!
5.0	This pendant was exactly what I wanted--the description was accurate, and while the diamonds are extremely small, I love how subtle they are--most of the necklace is metal work, which I love, and its the perfect size--not obnxious, but not so small that you dont notice it. It was exactly what I was looking for--a beautiful, delicate, and elegant key! Shipping also went really smoothly--Thank you!
5.0	It was what I expected, the person receiving it also loved it. It was the symbol he was proud to wear.
5.0	I LOVE the 6 I got. I honestly didn't think they would be so amazing since they are at a low price compared to big stores I usually go to. They are GORGEOUS :) I got awesome colors and my favorite colors on one {Red and Black} they are comfortable and just the perfect fit :D I also like that they included a clear/white ball one. just because it is nice to have.
5.0	Loved the price of this item.  It arrived on a plastic type cord but will look very nice on a black chain or rawhide.
5.0	Nice buy for pretty earrings for my 9 year old daughter for Christmas.  They are a pretty color and good size.
5.0	I received a complimentary pair of these earring during a promotion.  They are attractive little studs.  They are stainless steel, so I haven't experienced any problems with metal sensitivity.  The posts were just the right length and the backs were slightly larger than the backs that come with most studs, which made them easier to put on.  They are maintaining their finish and have turned out to be good every day earrings that I can wear any time.
5.0	First items were not very good quality, but this vendor made sure I was satisfied and sent me another complete package.  I am very happy with the earrings now.
5.0	the pin is very nice and look is great. However it was too small for my taste. I was looking to replace a pin I had previously purchased from Amazon that I like the size and look
5.0	Absolutely adorable ring, I love deers and this ring is a wonderful representation. Great ring for the price!!
5.0	I bought these for my brother in law's birthday. They look just like the photo and come in a nice box. I'm very happy with the look of them and they are well worth the money.
5.0	Nice.  My twins granddaughters are well represented.
5.0	Very impressed with the look and quality of the ring.  Wasn't sure what to expected because I have never bought jewelry this way without physically seeing before purchase but was pleasantly surprised.
5.0	It took a while to get my order but it is OK since I got a free heart pendant other than the pyramid and round pendant shown. I also got a hand written thank you letter. I've done research on orgone energy, it is too early to tell right now but I am positive it will work wonders.
5.0	Bought this for my mom. An amazing price for an amazing product. Looks very vintage.<br />The chain is pretty long though if that's a problem for anyone, now you know. The pendant is also considerably large, about if you arranged three quarters next to each other.
5.0	I think this is by far the cutest penguin brooch I've seen, the crystals are nicely done and it's solidly constructed.  I feel I got my money's worth and look forward to using this cutie :)
5.0	Great quality! Great fun!
5.0	I just got this piece....I'm already wearing it.. <br /> <br />I love it <br /> <br />Marge
5.0	This ring is very sweet.  The package arrived on time and the product is in excellent conditions.  The size was also true.  I am very happy with it and I recommend both, the product as well as the seller
5.0	I bought these as a gift for my 12 year old daughter and they are beautiful. She loves them. They are larger than I was expecting and sparkle. They are now her favorite!
5.0	A real gem to convey family love!
5.0	I ordered these earrings for my niece (they were on her wish list) and I was pleasantly surprised that when I received them I found that the quality was much nicer in person than seen in the photos. They were perfect little stocking stuffers.
5.0	i really like the ring but i was wondering how i would exchange it for a different size?? if i could
5.0	Love the color and the workmanship.  Beautiful!
5.0	I love this chain.  I'd bought a horn pendant for it and it fits perfectly.  High quality clasp, chain is sturdy and silky to the touch.  Love it!
5.0	These earrings are very high quality for the price. I got them on a sale for $12.99, very worth it.
5.0	Very nice quality and looks cool
5.0	Excellent in every way. I'm not normally into men's necklaces. Once I saw this necklace,  I had to have it.  I am very glad I bought it.  I love it!
5.0	Amazing detail fast shipping
5.0	I love this ring! It is very beautiful and I highly recommend.  I like that it is thicker and it has a nice presence on the finger.  The other day in the elevator, the UPS man (of all people) commented on it.  He went on and on about what a good looking stone it is and how my husband did a great job.  I just smiled and thanked him.  It's totally believable.
5.0	"I absolutely love this cuff--it is beautifully crafted and has a lovely silver presence. I typically wear a 7.5\\"" to 8\\"" bracelet depending on the style, and this piece fits me perfectly (I can even tighten it more if needed). I also bought one as a gift for my sister, who typically wears a 7\\"" to 7.25\\"" bracelet, and it fit her perfectly as well. The packaging for this cuff is also very nice, and I like the fact that the cuff is made using fair trade practices that benefit women. In short, I highly recommend this piece!"
5.0	This ring is just beautiful. Fits perfectly on my short fingers. Best Christmas present ever. The only thing I was concerned about is that the middle stone stuck up higher than any other ring I had everyone but it doesn't and has never bothered me. And it is so shiney!
5.0	When I opened the cute little box, I was pleasantly surprised , the fit is great and the ring looks just like picture. Great ring for a great price.
5.0	Very sweet little bracelet.  The clasp does NOT have a catch chain and the bracelet is definitely for a child.  This adorable bracelet makes a perfect gift for a little one.
5.0	.. it looks authentic and for the value i received many compliments. its light weight . material was high quality and it does not fade and shines like the real thing!
5.0	anyone who travels a lot should add this charm to their collection (passport charm, etc.).  Incredible in person.  Lighter in color and opens/closes perfectly.  Also love the moveable tiny little twin handles!
5.0	Very cool item - neat curvature makes pendant stand out - well made and complements already!!
5.0	I was amazed at how pretty this ring was, all the stones matched perfectly and it looks so elegant.. Love the red stones, looks like regal rubies.
5.0	I got this for my sister for Christmas and she absolutely loved it! This was by far, her favorite gift this year.<br /><br />The great thing about this ring is where the two ends meet, they are welded together in a small area, that isn't noticeable unless you're closely inspecting it like I was, so you don't have to worry about it stretching out when trying to find the right figure to put it on or if someone wants to try it on.
5.0	After Reading The Reviews,There Are More Good Reviews Then Bad,So I'll Buy The Ring,I'm Asking My girlfriend To Be My Wife,good Looking Ring For That,we'll Get The wedding bands Later.Thank You All For Your Reviews.
5.0	Got the 2mm and 4mm ring for me and my wife. It's been 2 weeks so far and they're still shiny and scratch free, they came exactly as specified. No complaints.
5.0	this is honestly one of my favorite products ive bought. It looks just like the picture. The stone is very big. I thought I was going to have issues with it cause its a tie on and i worried about it falling off but i havent taken it off for 2 weeks and its been completely fine it hasn't come undone once. Very nicely made necklace. I really do love it.
5.0	Love the variety of colors.  Still not sure what project to use them on yet, but I have a pattern in mind and this will be great for making several.
5.0	Great product! Definitely a great bargain! You get more than what you pay for with KONOV! Flawless pieces that don`t get discolored after a month of wear! I recommend KONOV to anyone looking to buy quality at a bargain price! I will continue to purchase items from them!
5.0	I originally purchased a pair just like these about ten years ago for my daughter who has sensitive skin. We love how comfortable they are! In fact, she sleeps in them and never takes them out except to wear dangle earrings for a special occasion. They hold up extremely well and we've only just purchased another pair because she lost one of her other ones. The gold coating does eventually wear off, but they still look nice when they turn silver. Definitely giving this 5 stars!
5.0	I really think this is a beautiful ring. The druzy is a pretty color and a very good size also.
5.0	This bracelet is absolutely gorgeous. The price was not comaparable anywhere. Saw one similair in BJ's wholesale club and the charms were much smaller; the price was also higher. The weight to price is excellent; compared to what they want in my area per gram for gold (currently $32.00/gm). This is a 10gm bracelet and you can feel the weight if you know gold. Would definitely recommend to buy for a starter charm bracelet or just to add to a collection of gold bracelets for anyone and there is room to add on more.
5.0	I am very happy with the bracelet. It is so pretty and delicate, but looks very well made.
5.0	I keep all my used guitar strings to make different accessories for friends and family, but I haven't been able to make a bracelet correctly.  It's a really cool gift for a music lover, male or female.  I purchased this for my brother-in-law, as he is an amazing guitarist.  I almost kept it for myself because I really wanted one too.  He really liked it and wears it practically every day.<br /><br />I went with the simple silver one as it looks the least flashly, and it's actual guitar strings without anything added to it.  Because these bracelets are made of actual guitar strings, I would advise taking note of what different oils can do to strings.  Treat it like a watch; don't wash your hands with the bracelet on, don't get it really oily or dirty, etc. If you do notice them getting rusty or dirty, a little bit of WD-40 goes a long way!
5.0	This locket is little in terms of the picture it will hold, however, the size of the key itself is pretty good and it is very noticeable. My daughter received this for her birthday and she only complains it is hard to open. It really is not if you have long fingernails. There is a tiny indented space where you can plug your nail to open it. Otherwise, without nails it is pretty hard to open. Overall, I think it's beautiful and worth the price. The necklace chain is beautiful as well. You really cannot go wrong with this price.
5.0	These are quite cute in person.  Just the right size.  It has a flat black appearance rather than glossy and I really like that.  They aren't too heavy which is also a big plus.  They are pretty cool looking.  Arrived earlier than expected; nicely packaged.
5.0	Love everything about it! Already gotten so many compliments!
5.0	I'm so excited to be able to give my friend's baby her first Hello Kitty and her first item of  jewelry! This is a delicate, well made piece of jewelry that is just right for a baby girl. It will be a wonderful keepsake in her jewelry box as she outgrows it. I can't wait to give it to her!
5.0	These are well made and very pretty.  A great pair for a very reasonable price.  If you are on the fence about these, waver no more!
5.0	Fit well, looks great. Sturdy but not heavy.
5.0	thanks friend stay the ring and hope is to your liking in the future continue to count on you for my future purchases many thanks their services are reliable and fast .....attentively soledad
5.0	Because I had read the reviews before I ordered this necklace, I was aware of the small size of the pendant and the flimsy chain.  Regardless, I was very pleased when the package arrived. I will purchase a heftier chain before I send this gift to my friend in Europe.   I noted some nice chains here on Amazon, and I'll ask a jeweler what a better chain size might be. The small size makes this a perfect gift.  Something larger would have been too gaudy and inappropriate.  My friend is my overseas E-mail buddy; she is very dear to me, but not in a romantic way in the usual sense of that word.
5.0	"As the subject says, I bought this as a gift so I can only review it based on the opinion of the receiver.<br /><br />* She was very happy with the appearance; her exact words were \\""very nice\\"". You can translate that as you see fit.<br />* I bought size 8 as that was identified as the correct size for the target finger. Unfortunately it was a bit small so it fit a 7.5 finger<br />* Um, that's all I got. More when I actually see it in person I suppose. What else would you want to know?<br /><br />PS: It is always my endeavor to provide helpful reviews. If you find my review helpful then great! If you do not, then please leave me a comment indicating what you want to know and I'll be sure to do better next time."
5.0	Super helpful for making the stretch from 2 to 0. Would buy again, if I had to!
5.0	This ring is beautiful. It seems a little thinner than I would have liked my self buy my Fiance really loves it. it dosn't have alot of weight to it but it is very pretty, It says comfort fit but I didn't see it but then again my fiance said that it was. I would buy again from this company.
5.0	THIS IS BY FAR ONE OF THE BEST JEWELRY COMPANIES ON LINE. I HAVE NOW ORDERED 4 OF THE TUNGSTEN CARBIDE RINGS FROM THEM & THEY ARE ALL PERFECT & LOVELY. THEIR CUSTOMER SERVICE IS BY FAR THE BEST EVER! THEY ARE VERY FRIENDLY, VERY COURTEOUS & VERY HELPFUL. IF EVER YOU ARE LOOKING FOR JEWELRY, GO TO THIS COMPANY FIRST!!! OUTSTANDING PRODUCT, AND STELLAR SERVICE!
5.0	Absolutely beautiful!
5.0	Everyone thinks it is real gold/diamonds. It is small enough to not be obnoxious, and big enough to be noticed.
5.0	This gift box is absolutely beautiful. I bought a  beautiful gold bracelet to give as a gift and this just made the presentation so much more special. Its more like a jewelry box for the bracelet something to be treasured . Very well made. Do not hesitate in purchasing. Delivery was incredible fast, which was also a plus.Great buy.I love it.
5.0	it's smaller that I thought, but is pretty
5.0	They're one size smaller than I originally expected but I love them. They look nice and it's been almost a month and no fading in sight. :D
5.0	I bought this pearl necklace for my granddaughter's 8th grade graduation.  The pearls are very nearly flawless and are sized uniformly.  They are lovely and she was thrilled. I would not hesitate to make another purchase.
5.0	Love this necklace. I wear it all of the time and constant reminder of my K9 friend at home. I liked it so much i purchased another for my mother-in-law for her birthday from the dog.
5.0	Good value for money. It is a reasonably priced, good quality item. The rhinestones make it look like a vintage piece.
5.0	I ordered this as a companion piece to the ruby and pearl band the seller offers. The pair make a fetching match. The ruby stones are on the lighter side, not the highest quality but also appearing more historically authentic. I appreciate the Victorian/Edwardian design of the metalwork.<br /><br />It should be noted the color of this silver does not match most .925 sterling silver on the market. It is not rhodium-plated so has a more natural silver sheen, almost appearing like white gold. You may have a difficult time finding another ring to pair it with.
5.0	Very different and exceptionally nice.
5.0	I wear this cross daily.  It looks great and holds up to daily wear.  It was a tad bit bigger than I expected.<br /><br />Excellent price and product.  You can't go wrong with this cross.
5.0	These earrings are just as pretty as shown.  I am pleased with this purchase and feel they were well worth the price.
5.0	Love everything about it. Every time I wear it people compliment about it. I would buy more. yay! ! !
5.0	Gave as a gift to my Niece and she loves it.
5.0	I got these for a Ms. Frizzle costume, and keep wearing them because they are awesome. They are a little heavy, and not made from the best metal, but if you don't have any allergies or problems with nickel silver, you should enjoy these as much as I do. Would buy again in a heartbeat.
5.0	I only wish they were larger, but I knew their size before I ordered em. And they were here in just a few days. Thank youuuuu.
5.0	This is a nice versatile necklace.  I love that it's two-tone.  I also like that I can change the length of the necklace based on what I'm wearing.  It's a great size too.  Not huge but definitely not tiny.  It's different too.  I really haven't seen two-tone multiple ring necklaces out in the marketplace.  It's also a great price for costume jewelry.  This is a great piece to add to your collection without breaking the bank.
5.0	I bought this for my daughter as a special gift on her wedding day because she wore a &#34;Cinderella&#34; wedding gown and she's always been our &#34;princess&#34;.  It's very pretty and my daughter loved it!!!
5.0	it looks great :D too bad when I ordered there was only one left, I wanted one for my mom
5.0	I have ordered over a dozen of these special commemorative Michael Jackson silver heart necklaces to give as gifts to very special voluteers who are helping to make a beautiful tribute to Michael Jackson.  Each person who received these necklaces were delighted to have them.  I've received beautiful thank you notes saying that they will wear them proudly.  The seller of these products was very prompt in filling my orders, and extremely generous in sending me a free gift because of my high volume order. I would highly recommend this product and its seller.  If you're a Michael Jackson fan, this item is a must have keepsake!
5.0	Beautiful for a wedding!
5.0	Customer service is top notch and the earrings are to great mothers day gift. Very satisfied and I highly recommend.
5.0	I love my new bracelet. It's very dainty and the design is unique. It goes well with my other bracelets and completes my trio.
5.0	I am a collector of nice jewelry including crosses and other types of designs. This cross is really beautiful and really nice. Truly some great craftsmanship. The price makes this item a straight steal! You cannot find a better value for the money. I bought one for a friend as a gift and they loved it. You will pay upwards of $100 if you bought this in a jewelry store.
5.0	Just as pictured. Very happy with it.
5.0	This bicycle charm was a really good buy and well made.  The wheels spin and my Girlfriend loved it!!  Great gift idea!!!

5.0	Absolutely beautiful pendant.  My wife loved it as a gift for the birth of our second child.  I would absolutely purchase this for someone important in your life.

5.0	the quality was fantastic and my mom thought the wording was beautiful it made her cry on Christmas day! she showed her friends
5.0	Very Cool! Mirror finish! Bale will accommodate a chain 3/8&#34; tall x 1/4&#34; wide or 9.5mm tall by 6.3mm wide. The shark is nearly 1.5&#34; long by 3/4&#34; tall with bale, just over a 1/2&#34; without bale.
5.0	I am not sure if I received this item, if I did I dont remember it and so very very very sorry
5.0	Daughter purchased for b-day gift.  Her friend apparently LOVES it.  Seems to be made well, so far as I can tell.  Shipped quickly, in nice drawstring bag.
5.0	The pictures do not do these earings credit. They are gorgeous! I gave these to my wife as a present and she was very happy.
5.0	Delivered on time and it's exactly what the description said!
5.0	I only use acrylic ever since I chipped my tooth (a tiny chip, it didn't break or anything, I could just feel that it was jagged with my tongue) these worked, I had also bought some other acrylic ones somewhere else, and I know I've had some break, but I couldn't tell you if it was these or not. But acrylic ones aren't meant to last forever either. they break, its just a fact of life. but I would absolutely buy these again!! Oh and I didn't get any repeats!!!!
5.0	"\\""These are beautiful pieces. For those of you who don't like these pieces in a larger size, please speak for yourselves. They're beautiful in the bigger sizes and more appropriately so, especially for some of us Texas women.  In fact, we prefer them \\""bigger\\"". The bigger, the better. Thanks so much Susan and Reverend Bobby. Please keep some of those bigger sizes on reserve for those of us who prefer them that way!"
5.0	I love it so much, it was a present from my fiancé  saw the same exact one for 250.00 in store and got it here for less than 60! Literally a steal and a beautiful necklace
5.0	I bought these for my mom. She is 81 and can NEVER find clip earrings.  They came in a blink of an eye and were packaged perfect. What a nice early Easter gift.  She LOVED THEM.  Great deal...So happy I bought them and also another pair for her.  Look like they came from the jewlery store.Thanks so much....mom I extra happy..
5.0	Great quality!!!! As is in picture,  thanks.
5.0	I collect swans and when I saw this, I caught my breath.  It is so elegant and mystical.  It is well made and just lovely.
5.0	Gave this to my son for Christmas last year.  He loves it.  The only problem is that it is in two parts in order for it to spin so it cannot be re-sized.  Make sure you get the right size!  But it is a very attractive ring.
5.0	My sister asked for this for her birthday and it was the perfect size and charm to signify her friendship with her best friend.
5.0	Good option and excellent price... I love it!
5.0	Gorgeous chain. High quality and perfect length. Great price too!

5.0	Beautiful !!!!!<br />looks like a Million $$$$$$$$
5.0	I purchased this for my upcoming wedding in May. It's exactly what I was looking for. Plus, I appreciate the extended clasp being that I have large and wide hands and small wrists. It also come in a velvet baggy for safe keeping.
5.0	I love this necklace. Everyone always asks me about the key and if there is a picture in the locket. I just like the look of it and the long length. It looks great with any casual outfit.
5.0	I saw mixed reviews on these chains, some people complaining about the quality, others about their packaging/condition upon arrival.  Mine arrived  each in it's own  little bag...no tangles, no problems. The chains are a little more delicate than more expensive ones I own, and the clasps are a little smaller, but for as inexpensive as they were, I was pleased with the quality.  After wearing them over the past seven months, sometimes with relatively heavy pendants on them,  the are still in great condition.  I polish them with a silver cleaning cloth about as often as I do my others, and they are still bright and shiny. The selection of lengths make at least one at a time perfect for what I need any day, and they also fall nicely in sets of two or three.  Good buy for the money spent.
5.0	Another Christmas gift<br />It's beautiful
5.0	I bought this ring for $15 (including shipping) and it is very nice. I like the weight it has to it, and it is much shinier in real life than in the picture.

5.0	Beautiful, just the right addition for the Halloween Costume!
5.0	got the gold version of this one it was so cute.  really easy to get on and off because of the mesh bracelet, which makes it a little stiffer than a chain, and the toggle clasp, so you don't need a third arm to put it on.  matches all my locket earrings and necklaces.  girly but not overly so.  good price, too.

I give this bracelet and this seller five stars. I fully recommended this seller...l would buy more from this seller. Thank you for the good quality and good price.
5.0	Definitely above expectation. I wasn't expecting something as decent in this price, but -- Voila -- classy Emeraldish necklace + earrings! The colors are pretty vibrant, and they make perfect suits. If you have a tight budget but still need something stylish for a decent night out, try this.
5.0	These rings are a excellent by and the co they are from did make a mistake by made it right before the wedding
5.0	Looks real...get lots of compliments
5.0	Very cute and a great price!
5.0	The earring are of nice quality and very beautiful. I got them<br />for my daughter for her birthday and she loved them!
5.0	Loved the earrings. For them being long , I thought they were going to be too heavy, but, they were nice and light.
5.0	Very pretty! Liked it a lot!
5.0	i purchased several items from Netaya and im so happy with all my purchases and items i got and also the people i got them as gifts, they loved this chain and the little ring so cuteeeeee.. will purchase again from this seller,,
5.0	Bought it as a Christmas gift.  Now I want one for myself.  Arrived in a pouch in a gift box.
5.0	Plain and simple.  I just wanted something with Mom and Dad, the fact it has the two little hearts is all the more perfect.
5.0	I love the detail and it is not heavy around the neck.  A perfect gift of expression to a relationship of mother and daughter that can be passed down from generation to generation.
5.0	Thanks for the item. I bought them for my mother in law so I know she will love them. Great.
5.0	This is a lovely ring for the price.  The diamonds are tiny, but genuine (I tested them).
5.0	This was a gift for my daughter. She loved it!  Very cool!
5.0	Beautiful sleeping beauty earrings at a great price. They aren't huge, very understated, but sleeping beauty turquoise is going to be harder to find and more expensive. Shipping was fast and I would definitely purchase from this seller again!
5.0	The quality of the earrings are great and she loves to wear them all of the tiime!  I highly recommend these earrings to any lady to wear!
5.0	Konov always has beautiful jewelry at a very affordable price, have bought lots of quality jewelry from them
5.0	Obviously this is a very special piece of jewelry for me. This was a gift from my husband on my last birthday. Price doesn't matter to me. I am much of the quality and the durability that I can rely on no matter how hard I used it. <br /><br />The beauty captured my heart. As it gives me the pleasure of wearing an expensive ring, knowing that it is cheaper than expected. <br /><br />I had it on my fingers just taking it off before shower. And indeed no issues of fallen stones, deformation, and discolorations. There were few scratches thou because I still wear it even playing tennis. My fault of course &#34;just being too lazy to take it off&#34;. And I can't keep it on my jewelry box as I love to show my husband how I love wearing this ring. <br /><br />Hopefully, will be ordering something to pair with this. I am playing around Caperci jewelry collection, and so happy they are on sale. <br /><br />Anyway, this ring can be very good to go with just any other jewelry. It can definitely stand alone as engagement or wedding bands. Or rather wear this ring along with your platinum or white gold wedding rings, surely you'll have a better trendy style. <br /><br />Kudos on the good jewelry from Caperci always had for us. This princess cut cubic Zirconia eternity band is pretty awesome. Very good quality, durable performance and gorgeous. This will complete your precious collections. 
5.0	Thank you Shop4Silver!!! I just got my cross today and I LOVE IT!!! It's beautiful!!! I am so happy with it that I'll be ordering again from you! I can't believe how fast I got this! Ordered it last  Weds and it came today!!! Way cool!! Good place to do business. Thank you again!!!
5.0	Nice assortment no doubles which is great!

5.0	Very nice-looks great.
5.0	got one for my sister then had to have one too. love the way it looks on me and my sister
5.0	Very pretty! Just the right size for me, I'm a short woman so I don't like oversized jewelry. This is not too small either, looks great and many compliments.
5.0	This was a gift for a friend who collects snowmen.  She loved the earrings.  I wish I had ordered a pair for myself.  They are beautiful.
5.0	Amazing ring with elegant design and material. Look a thousand dollars ring that display the two tones as real gold.
5.0	I actually bought this for my niece who loves anything Spiderman.  It is pretty yet is built tough so it will last.
5.0	items looks great but 2 year old still pulled earring from ear even after screwing back on (sad) can't find earring
5.0	Love this ring. It is very sharp looking. You would never know by looking at it or holding it that it cost under 5 dollars. This is a must have. I am about to order two more. It fits multiple fingers due to the open sizing. Dont hesitate buy this one.
5.0	Smaller than I expected, but still an awesome ring. Looks a lot more polished in person and it hasn't turned my finger green. Would recommend this to a friend!
5.0	Loved this, just what I hoped for and expected!!
5.0	I love purple and this bracelet was beautiful . The purple bead makes the bracelet amazing. The black cord makes the purple show more.
5.0	I ordered two of these for Christmas presents. They arrived quickly and we're beautiful!
5.0	These were so pretty I had to get them for my sister as a birthday present! She loves them, barely ever takes them off, and says they're lightweight and don't drag her ears down. The price is amazing, the shipping was fast, and the earrings are beautiful. I would recommend them to anyone.
5.0	its beautiful!  I will order another for my other arm.  very delicate and kinda copper colored more than gold colored.  bracelets and cuffs always slip of my wrists because my wrists are small.  this slips around a tad but not badly.  yeah, I will buy another one soon.
5.0	I saw this and thought it would be cool to have as I love anything to do with the solar system &#34;and ALL that is out there.&#34;  For the price it is fun and I have received many compliments on it as it is very unique.  Love the matching black chain.
5.0	This was for one of my Grandsons and he was so happy to get it.  He wears it all the time as these titanium necklaces are the big thing now for baseball players and he is that all the way.<br /><br />Thanks
5.0	I bought this for my husband, because he lost the one he had. This is the 2nd ring he has had like this. The ring is great! He is an auto mechanic & works with his ring on. It still looks great everyday. Very durable!
5.0	beautiful!!!  Great price for hamsa
5.0	This was perfect for my granddaughter. Small, a little fancy, but not overdone - perfect!  I'm sure she will love it.
5.0	I bought this item for my 14 yo son. He loves it and wears it everywhere. It is of good quality and durable. It was also shipped quickly and safely.
5.0	My wife's tits have never been sexier!!
5.0	VERY NICE FOR PRICE  !!!
5.0	Look brand new<br />Fit prefectly<br />Was what I had execpted<br />Very shiny & lovely looking<br />Hubby loved it & was suprised
5.0	I love them, they're gorgious
5.0	I received one of these from a local jeweler after I purchased some Trollbeads. (The one I rec'd actually has Trollbeads stamped on it, but the instruction sheet says Blitz Moonglow Silver, Gold, and Platinum Care Cloths #20463).I am so impressed with this cloth that I'm checking Amazon for prices. I'd like to order some for gifts...just need to decide how much shipping I want to pay.<br /><br />The instructions state: These cloths use the same non-toxic and gentle treatment trusted by generations of Blitz users.....Buff lightly to remove tarnish and your dull precious metal will shine again.<br /><br />The jeweler told me never to wash it no matter how dirty it gets. (Buffing your precious metal with this cloth will leave dark gray marks on the cloth).  Not only did this cloth shine the beads that have sterling silver on them, it shined every bead on my bracelet, including the glass ones.  Just one use will leave the cloth looking dirty.  I used this cloth to shine all my gold and silver jewelry. Everything I used it on looks shiny & fantastic! I never thought a buffing cloth could make such a difference so I pulled out some I've had around the house for a long time to see if they performed the same way. There is no comparison, my old buffing cloths are junk compared to the Blitz Moonglow cloth.  Excellent product.
5.0	Came in a lil plastic bag with the size marked on it so i knew it was what I ordered. Really satisfied!
5.0	My wife is very happy with this item. The price is right and quality is high. This proved to be a great X-Mas gift.
5.0	I bought this bracelet because I make these bracelet and I was hoping that I could add beads to make the bracelet seem fuller.  The problem with that it is -- I couldn;t get either bracelet end loose, so I am assuming that this bracelet is as is and can not be changed or added to.  I would be nice if Amazon had this info in the description.  Other than that I really like the bracelet.
5.0	The beads were just what I was looking for, heavy and small with texture. The knots are all tight and it feels like it will hold up to lots of wear and tear. Came in a small pouch, the beads are exactly as described.<br />My only issue is that the beads came lightly covered in some sort of sticky oil or powder that has a faint odor. Wiped them down and all was great.
5.0	Love the cross! Very nicely package. Great price and it was a wonderful idea to include 2 necklaces. Highly recommend this cross to give as a gift.
5.0	Sent to a great friend of 45 plus years-who lives in New mexico---my husband asked why i would send this kind of gift to someone who lived where this kind of thing is everywhere---she loves it---is why :)  Think that is half the reason she moved out there for the wonderful style of turquoise.....and this fits the bill.  Thank you for an incredible deal!
5.0	Delicate but well made!
5.0	These little ear rings are so cute!!<br /><br />They are perfect for a gun lover in your life!  Love that they are nickle, lead free and stainless steel! They are small but not too small they cannot be seen. I actually get a lot of compliments when I wear them.<br /><br />I absolutely loved getting this product for review.  The opinions are my own!
5.0	Beautiful, just what I wanted.
5.0	Arrived quickly, and in good condition.  Easy to install, and work well.
5.0	This pendant is truly one of a kind and accents the charoite stone very nicely.  The charoite stone is a little different than what I've been seeing lately with the deep black markings, but still very beautiful.  I was afraid upon ordering that it might be heavy (I do not like heavy pendants) but it isn't at all and goes nicely on a light sterling chain.  This pendant also goes very well with the Charoite earrings available from Ian & Valerie on Amzon which I ordered as well to hopefully be a nice match (and they are).
5.0	A little large for my individual taste but this item &#34;more than makes up for that&#34; by it's obvious quality in materials, style and durability....Awesome Inner Faith display which seems to present Sincerity.......Beautiful item....
5.0	A dainty, classic design piece and I would have liked matching earrings.  Good color but a bit on the small side.
5.0	No complaints. Love it.
5.0	Its very classy alone or with a pendant ...love it ..will buy one in gold&#34;plated&#34;. Has not faded even wore it in the shower by mistake
5.0	This ring certainly captures attention!  Gave it as a Mother's Day gift. It made quite an impression!!!  So much I am considering purchasing an additional one for me personally.
5.0	I love this bracelet!  I ordered it on a Friday and received it Monday afternoon.  I have a very small wrist and the adjustable strap makes it fit perfectly.  I would highly recommend ChiChi Beads products to everyone.
5.0	Valentines gift for the wife. Very nice quality.
5.0	Its great! I bought this for a birthday gift for my nephew.. he loves it.  It is a lot larger than you would expect in the pictures...but.. still worth every penny and more
5.0	Super happy with my purchase ! Arrived 2 weeks before the expected delivery date ! :o it's so beautiful &they threw in a extra chain no charge ! (: it's amazing. My boyfriend and I love them perfect 2 year anniversary gift c:

5.0	It looks great, perfect fit. It would be a great gift or just something to buy for yourself.<br />I would buy another one if needed.
5.0	Awesome. Beautiful and comfy. Doesn't grip my neck too tight but doesn't hang too low.  Perfect. Arrived super early and was quick and efficient.
5.0	These were so beautiful,  I ordered the necklace to match.  It came and is just as beautiful as the earrings.  Came within 5 business days and have ordered about ten other pieces.
5.0	I bought these to give as gifts to my kids' teachers: they're great!  The stones are lively and colorful--not at all washed out.  I like them so much, I'm keeping the amethyst one to give to my daughter in a year or two.
5.0	One of three (3) pendants of hummingbirds that I bought for my wife for Christmas.  She loved them all!  We have them for a short while in Upper Michigan in the late spring and summer and love watching them.  Now she can 'take them with her' this winter1
5.0	These look just like the picture (they are quite small, as the description explains), and seem to be high quality.  The recipient of these really liked them.
5.0	I love this ring! I'm going to wear it every day. It fits great, the size matches exactly. It's not too bulky, but it's not flimsy at all. It's really shiny and it looks even better than in the picture. also a great deal. I loooove it!
5.0	High quality products. These rings are beautiful. Nice attention to detail. Heavy design expensive looking pieces. Great customer service. You cannot go wrong with this seller. I am very pleased.

5.0	I thought this pendant would be larger because of the photographs, but its perfect size for me and is quite delicate and lovely! :)
5.0	Love this sweet Christmas piece.  Nice Quality!  Fun for  ALL Christmas people!
5.0	This ring fits true to the size it says, and it is very durable.  Considering the stainless steel, it doesn't turn your finger green or brown when contacted with water.
5.0	Bought two for my sisters and they are a perfect gift.. I want to get myself one for myself.
5.0	Awesome ring for which I've received many compliments.  Customer service from DazzlingRock is outstanding!
5.0	My boyfriend loved it!!!! He does not really wear jewelry and was very pleased with it since it was classy. His brother also loved it and wants one for himself.
5.0	Couldn't be more happy with this!!!
5.0	Received ring ... even more gorgeous than pictured. Due to an accident, the finger I wear my rings on has a bump so could not get ring over knuckle. My niece graduated High School so she is wearing it and loves it. Thank you so much! Pattie
5.0	This ring is outstanding the quality is definitely top of the line. The price was a steel and I can wear this ring when I am feeling like money.
5.0	I bought this as a valentines gift for a very dear friend and he just loved it. These cuff links looked like they cost a lot more than they actually did.
5.0	Looks great and lasted well. I liked the look of it although the leather wears easily.<br /><br />Only problems is that I lost mine. The buckle mechanism is quite solid so I doubt it would come off on its own.<br /><br />Great value - get one!
5.0	Awesome price love the earrings
5.0	My wife simply loves this pendant...it was simply very beautiful.
5.0	Simply beautiful cufflinks. Very impressed with the appearance of these and the quality seems good. No disappointments at all here.

5.0	Perfect product if you're a Pisces. I love it, cheap, nice, and long lasting. I couldn't ask for anything better
5.0	Absolutely  beautiful ring it's very elegant and at the same time makes a big statement now iam afraid to wear it it's just too beautiful lol.  After I got married I gained weight and can't fit into my original engagment/wedding ring way too small now and my husband and I can't get it sized right at this time so to wear temporarily he ordered this ring for me and we'll all I could say is wow gorgeous and very believable sparkles more then some real diamonds I've seen and even though my 1st princess cut diamond is gorgeous  too  this is a great second gorgeous  ring. When I get my rings sized iam wearing these rings on my other hand.  Great job with the rings they really sparkle love it.  Iam very happy with this order and the shipment was soooo quick.
5.0	The necklace is well-made and can be worn a couple different ways. The variety of colors in the beads make it able to be worn with many outfits.  Great buy!
5.0	I love it plus I know I can't afford the real diamonds it looks great and I have no complaints.
5.0	came quickly and was exactly what i needed! nice quality and good price
5.0	Chain was really nice, my Wife loved it!!
5.0	I bought this for my hubby as an anniversary gift and he loves it! It looks great and he shows it off to everyone
5.0	I very seldom write reviews but this bracelet deserves a five star review!  I purchased this bracelet for my mother ( who used to sell fine jewelry) for Mother's Day.  I think I gasped upon opening the package.  My husband heard me and stated that it probably would never make it to my mother's wrist!  I laughed and wrapped it up before I would be tempted to keep it.  Lo and behold, my sneaky husband ordered another one to give to me!  What a guy!  The large pearls are gorgeous and seem to be lit from within.<br />I can't say enough about the quality of the bracelet (the clasp is beautiful as well) and the very personal customer service.  I guarantee you won't be disappointed. By the way, my mother was thrilled with her gift.  Good things really do come in small packages!
5.0	I love these earring. Perfect size and the clasps actually work great. Packaging and delivery were excellent. Just what I was looking for, at a great price.
5.0	I purchased this for my husband and he loves it. It is a great looking box and the price is great too.
5.0	"I ordered this product hoping for a comfortable necklace with an unobtrusive clasp, to adorn a pendant. This necklace was perfect in size (the 24\\"" model hangs above my sternum as expected), perfect in comfort (I forget I'm wearing it), and perfect in weight (barely weighs anything). Going forward I may like to try the 30\\"" model, as I would like to be able to pull the necklace off my head without undoing the clasp each time. Personal preference aside, this is an excellent product."
5.0	Little smaller than I thought.  But its super nice and quality product
5.0	I love love this. I get so many complaints. I love it so much I brought the lavender one .
5.0	This necklace was just as described.  I love this necklace.  My 10 year old niece told me, &#34;I absolutely love your necklace!&#34;
5.0	Beautiful set of 14kt Gold Earrings that I would recommend for purchase.  I am not disappointed with this purchase as they can be used dresses up to go out or dresses down for running around.
5.0	I ordered them for nose piercings and they are perfect, they lay flat and are the perfect size. I will order them again.
5.0	It's the perfect ring for my husband! He doesn't like wearing a ring and loses it often so this is the perfect one for him. True to size and looks great!
5.0	no complaints yet..clasp hard to un do but dont if it really works any ideas as to how i know if its real
5.0	These earrings are absolutely stunning. They are more beautiful than the picture justifies. They are intricate and show superior workmanship.
5.0	This perfume bottle is a collector's dream come true. It is heavy in the hand, as well as truly beautiful.
5.0	Very good for everyday wear! I have very sensitive ears and they don't bother me at all. Would buy again or recommend to friends.
5.0	Love this!! Wear everyday
5.0	My Bichon passed away and I wanted something to wear in his honor.  This was the perfect item. I love it!
5.0	I first bought one of these to give as a 2012 Christmas gift to my sister in law. It is unique from other snowman pins. I liked the three different metal tones.<br /><br />When it arrived, both my wife and I thought it was really very nice, even better than the picture. Hence, I bought three more of these; one for my wife and the other two as gifts for other ladies in my life. A really nice pin; just the right size and well-made.
5.0	Got it as a birthday present for my future daughter in law and she loved it. She may wear it for her wedding.
5.0	They're just beautiful!
5.0	I love this charm. I bought it as a gift for my niece who is in gymnastics and know she is going to love it when I give to her for her birthday. The charm is very sturdy, colorful and well crafted. I would recommend for purchasing. The colors are bright and fits perfectly on the bracelet I bought her. The first time I saw it I didn't buy it and waited and when I came back it was out of stock for a long time, but finally I tried one more time and it was back, so I didn't hesitate to get it this time. I'm glad I did.
5.0	love the blue flash and wear almost every day. came protected well so there was no breakage or scratching Recommend this seller.
5.0	Love this ring. I have worn it everyday since I got it. The blue remind me of my late husband's eyes. It is delicate and lovely!!!
5.0	It was really nice, I gave it too my sister for Christmas and she really liked it. It doesn't look or feel cheap.
5.0	It's absoutley perfect, if you're thinking about buying this for anybody,its really fab to get it. It even comes in a little velvet pouch and ready to be given as a gift, for that someone special or keep it for yourself. I honestly could not be happier as a customer.
5.0	Exactly as advertised and perfect fit.
5.0	After waiting 2 months from being ordered, I realized that I hadn't received this item.  I sent them an email to this and they immediately said they'd send another one to me.  10 days later it arrived and all the way from Israel!  Great service and I love my mezuzah, which is just as described!
5.0	IT look good for the money ,THE back that hold it on your ear is not big, it will not hold the earring in place if you get a big one to go on the back ,it will stay on your ear.It look good as the 200.00, one  to me.
5.0	Pretty and love that it glows in the dark
5.0	This is absolutely beautiful, looks awesome, so worth the price!! And fast shipping!!
5.0	Beautiful coral necklace - vibrant lovely colour with a very solid and secure clasp!
5.0	I really enjoy wearing this bracelet set.  I was looking for a rose quartz bracelet when I noticed this set in the results.  I purchased for the rose quartz, not knowing how much I would enjoy the amethyst and tiger's eye.  Great purchase.
5.0	Fast service - great product ... just as advertised.
5.0	Very nice quality charm nice clasp made it easy to add to a charm necklace. It was a gift and was very well received.
5.0	Love them. I wear them a lot. Does not bother my sensitive ears.
5.0	This is a very beautiful necklace. I bought it for a friend and she loved it! The diamond is a great size, you can really see it.
5.0	She was happy, therefore I am happy. Good quality, chain is a little flimsy but not a deal breaker.
5.0	My grand daughter really liked these.
5.0	It's so shiney and perfect for a couple who's been together for a day or a year. Very beautiful. Very unique. I love it already! Can't wait to get mine in the mail !
5.0	Nice pendant and exactly as described? Ordered for an incoming Rice student as a graduation gift?  She was very Pleased.
5.0	Look just like picture...nice looking  earrings
5.0	I bought this bracelet and several charms from amazon after looking at a similar bracelet at James Avery for my daughter. We may decide later on to upgrade to the real thing- but for now this is fine. I am delighted with the purchases and plan to purchase other items from this line.
5.0	I love angels & where I wear this ring I get plenty of &#34;Oh how beautiful that ring it&#34; Thank youl.
5.0	Very nice, it was a Birthday gift.
5.0	very pretty although a bit fragile
5.0	My husband does not hardly ever wear it but when he does, it keeps it shape and he has had it since last year.
5.0	This pendant is beautiful! I wasn't sure what it would look like, since I usually  buy all my Hawaiian jewelry in Hawaii & NOT on the internet. But I was pleasantly surprised. The 10mm is the right width to see all the detailing & the thickness is not cheap feeling. The price is right too. Love it!!!
5.0	I strongly recommend these cufflinks to others.<br /><br />These cufflinks are stunning. The black texture sits under a thin clear coat that gives them a great depth. Although the price of these is rather low, the quality is excellent. Mine arrived in perfect condition and quickly. I have no complaints, and these are already one of my favorite pairs of cufflinks.<br /><br />Again, these are great cufflinks. Add in the amazing price and you can't go wrong with these.
5.0	Be aware that these are very small diamonds.  They were exactly what I wanted to replace a pair that I lost one earring of. Worn in a third ear piercing they are perfect for what I wanted.
5.0	Excellent quality, beautiful ring
5.0	Lovely bracelet. I had to super glue a stone back because it fell out during shipment. I am giving it to a friend. I hope she likes it!!!
5.0	I got mine within eleven days of purchase (shipped conventional mail from mainland China to the east coast USA). The hammer was in mint-condition, and gave a firm impression of being able to last a lifetime (which for me is a given expectation for stainless steel). The chain was also a keeper, although 26&#34; was a few inches too big for me. I decided to err on the side of caution when I ordered the chain length. The package also included a free gift which was another chain (of another style), that was smaller and was a perfect fit for me. Lastly, the included jewelry pouch was also of very good quality. A final thing of note that you may have overlooked regarding the hammer; It can be worn with the triquetra-side facing out, or with a more &#34;conventional&#34; non-triquetra other side. I would absolutely do more business in the future with KONOV.
5.0	Honestly, for the price, this thing is really beautiful. It doesn't look cheap, there are no sharp edges or corners, and the fit is excellent. I bought it for my wife and she's been wearing it ever since.
5.0	This necklace is so beautiful. The chain is nicer than what's pictured. The detail of the butterfly is very detailed, and the blue topaz is very nice.
5.0	Good price for a very pretty set! Shipping was a little long, but worth it! Perfect for my piercing. Yes.
5.0	+ Best color combo (black & chrome)<br />+ currently rockn' this cross with black chain<br />  (purchased black chain separate)<br />+ careful, little sharp on edges
5.0	Great product. We are satisfied with this purchase!
5.0	Great for a larger wrist!  Very Pretty!
5.0	Loved this bead charm and it fit perfectly on my Pandora bracelet.
5.0	Arrived well packed and with no damage to the product. They are smaller than what I thought, but they are also more beautiful than expected. This will be a great gift.
5.0	EXACTLY WHAT I WANTED!!!  Very sparkly, dainty, and feminine...everything I was looking for.  Also, good quality and well made for the price.
5.0	Fine and delicate looking chain.  Bright finish-- so consider this when pairing it up with a charm/pendant.
5.0	I've been having fun trying all the different ways this necklace can be worn: looped, knotted, mixed with other chains, twisted, etc.  The pearls are a beautiful shade of pink, and they match perfectly with the earrings I got at the same time also from HinsonGayle.  It's a great addition to my pearl collection.
5.0	I love my new evil eye bracelet. I wish the price was a little more affordable.
5.0	Una pulsera de plata muy bonita y de muy buena calidad. La uso a siario pues es muy lucida. La recomiendo
5.0	Item as described, super fast shipping, great price...100% recommended
5.0	Nice... but the ends are way too small
5.0	Great quality! Was hoping to find something like this in James Avery for my nephews first communion. Found this for 1/4 of the price with the same quality! He loves it! Highly recommend.
5.0	Very pretty and great quality......get compliments all the time.....but beware it is a bit big in size.....so if you like them smaller get the same one from the same vendor in a smaller size........I tell you I have both and no regrets on either :)
5.0	Great condition. It spins like it was supposed to. (The other ring I bought like this, from someone else, did not.)
5.0	Great price and value I have a problem with loosing my rings so this is a cheap and effective way to replace them.
5.0	very nice, well made, not heavy, pretty colors, doesn't look cheap, compliments a lot of outfits adds just the right amount of attention
5.0	They are more beautiful than the picture.  They are well made and have sparkling crystals on the sunshine.  I love them.
5.0	It is quite lovely. I am pleased.
5.0	Great earrings and a great price.
5.0	Just opened package the pendant is beautiful! Came ahead of time. ana silver co is awesome great merchandise at affordable prices.
5.0	First pair came broken, returned them.  Second pair fine, granddaughter loved them
5.0	This nose ring is very pretty. I bought this a few years ago and lost it after taking it out. I'm planing on buying another one just like it.<br />I have to say it looks a more gold in person. Just know that you will get noticed with this hands down. Because the flower is so big, it can easily get pulled by clothes.  When drying your face with a towel especially, be careful. Whenever this nose ring would get pulled out, I had a difficult time putting it back in.
5.0	This is a great gift for a daughter.  It is a little large for my 9 year old daughter,although she has very thin arms.  Looks pretty and comes packaged very nicely.
5.0	Great ring and price!
5.0	Great quality.  Great transaction.
5.0	This pin is absolutely beautiful!!!  The colors and the sparkle of the crystals are so rich-looking! What a great Christmas pin for anyone! I can't wait to wear it next year for the holidays.  I just love it!!!
5.0	Let me start by saying have purchased rings on other sites, not Amazon!!! And I was very disappointed . This one is a keeper!!! It has great detail, and is very well made. Sorry but I tested it on a door and it did some good damage to the door and it held up great with no dings. So if you like skull rings this one is a winner!!! And it has a cool velvet bag to strore it in, nice touch thank you Konov and Amazon great ring!!!!
5.0	Shipped quickly. They are soo cute. Only negative is they don't really &#34;glow&#34; very much.
5.0	Love it very well made
5.0	Nice and shiny and seems to behold quality! I bought this to wear to work instead of my wedding ring. Does the job so far!
5.0	I bought these for my daughter-in-laws and they loved them. I just ordered 2 more pairs. Can't beat the price.
5.0	Quality n remarkably detailed, certainly worth the wait, at the pearly white gate for any Justeel order is a great big steel of a deal.
5.0	Pretty but looks more lavender than the picture
5.0	My husband loved this for a Valentine's Day gift just before travels and skiing. I chose it because it's more original than the typical stamped medal.
5.0	Well worth 2x the price. Looks and feels like a much more expensive piece. The only complaint I have is the clasp is not the same color as the bracelet. This one is a no brainer, just do it.
5.0	its beautiful, and couldnt beat the price.
5.0	I love these earrings, I always get compliments on them! They're not too big, there just right. Will order from them again.
5.0	great quality, stamped with the sterling mark, not sterling plated as some of the others are.  Read the descriptions carefully.  I would buy from this retailer again.
5.0	Since my dog was adopted from a shelter this is perfect for me. Hopefully this charm will encourage others to adopt homeless animals.
5.0	Great service. Beautiful product
5.0	This is one of favorite beads among others on my pandora bracelet.  Very good charm to wear and represent law enforcement brother/sisterhood.
5.0	perfect, as shown, good material~
5.0	I really love your product I would have bought a few to give around at my Church but because of the high price for delivery, I question myself...? At least $2.00 per cross would have been acceptable. The  cross is great. So far I have purchased 2 of them. I wanted to buy various color, but... !!?!  I REALLY LOVE IT ! Very strong.GREAT LOOKS ! Will not break. Thanks to the seller and to Amazon for selling this marvelous CROSS,<br />evelyne
5.0	MONTRED was great; the ring was beautiful but a little small for the intended finger (my fault, not theirs).  The return process was painless.  Would buy from them again in a hot second!
5.0	WOw Really works - If my pops didn't teach me. WOW.
5.0	This is a nice addition to any growing costume jewelry collection. Got this for under a few bucks, perfect!! Don't order this thinking you are getting fine jewelry, its cheap fun necklace!
5.0	I have been looking for a while for a longer white gold chain. The best in store price I could find was 120.00 and that was on sale and using a 30% off coupon! The diamond cuts on this chain make it glitter, but it is fine enough that it doesn't &#34;compete&#34; with the pendant that you put on it.
5.0	Loved it!  Hangs just right.  Really unique and his little feet are so cute. The diamond accents give it that perfect pop.
5.0	Really love this necklace. great quality.
5.0	I love these earrings. The one they sent were G color and VS2 clarity. They really really stand out. Almost too big for everyday, really gets attention. Highly recommend!Beautiful!
5.0	MY HUSBAND LOVED THE FLIP HINGE-PLUS THE GOOD QUALITY HINGE SPRING.
5.0	Very satisfied with the quality for the price. Love the packaging.
5.0	Probably a little smaller than I thought it would be, but still very elegant. It looked great with my wedding dress. It's a little pricey, but I would recommend it if you're looked for an emerald-looking stone.
5.0	I was concerned because sometimes the photo doesn't match the actual product, but the amulet was just as I pictured it would be. The only hassle was figuring out how to wrap it around my wrist. Opening the clasp in that position was a bit tricky, but nothing I couldn't handle. Fast delivery, beautiful design. Highly recommended!
5.0	Much prettier than picture
5.0	Perfect gift for a loved one. Always reminded of ur faith n ur true christian belief.
5.0	I purchased the GT emblem in the gold color, TOTALLY AWESOME!!!  Has great heavy weight to the tag, engraved excellently, long necklace that can actually be worn double around the neck to make it shorter, is wonderful for women and men who own Ford Mustang GT cars.  I recommend to everyone!  I wear mine driving my 2013 GT Premium 5.0 V8 Coyote Candy Apple Red Metallic Clearcoat convertible, and I wear it doing my everyday walk along with my 5.0 t-shirt on.  Everybody loves it!!
5.0	Bought the set and I received a lot of compliments but the chain part tarnished very fast so I took the bow and put it on a another necklace. .
5.0	Thank you~ thank you~ thank you~Bling Jewelry !!!<br />I am so pleased by the beautiful faceted glass and sterling beads!<br />WOW! Each time I receive a shipment from &#34; Bling&#34; I am all ways delighted! These beads are spectacularly fascinating~<br />Then just when I think I couldn't be any more impressed ~<br />You top yourselves and &#34;go the extra mile&#34; with your whimsical packaging and attention to detail~ Your Customer Care is beyond compare!<br />Everyone in my family is sporting some of your sparkily treasures~ while I have become the &#34;Delight Fairy&#34; for providing them with such alluring treats!<br />Bless Your Hearts<br />I am one thrilled and delighted customer!
5.0	Love the earrings!! Purchased because of unique style and the great price.  Look forward to doing more shopping in the future!!
5.0	I love these. They pick up some major shine for a cheap pair of earrings. They are look exactly like the picture says, and they are a very attractive pair of earrings. The blend of fake pearls and fake diamonds is a win :) I would recommend these.
5.0	It is even more beautiful in person. It looks expensive! Thankfully it wasn't. A great buy for sure!!!
5.0	great price. fingers will turn green.
5.0	Arrived faster than promised and a very good deal. Happy with purchase
5.0	It's so cute I love it!
5.0	The ring is perfect! I normally wear a 6 3/4 and got a size 7. It looks amazing, fits great, the diamonds yes are small but they do shine! It's a beautiful ring for a petite hand. I wear it a lot and there still isn't a scratch on it. (the silver is of course darker than in the picture) Great ring for the price.
5.0	It gets delivered from China.  It took 22 days for it to arrive, so if you are ordering as a gift, I would take that into consideration, plus the tracking number I was given was no help at all.  On to the earrings....the earrings arrived in tact, no broken pieces, and they are very cute.  My daughter loves them, and they are stylish.  Good for a small girl, and teenager.  My daughter is 8, and it looks cute on her.  If you are a Ebay shopper, you will probably find this set for a lot cheaper with quicker delivery time also....just putting that out there.
5.0	Love this for one of a stackable ring set!!!  It is not too wide, but perfect for stacking!  Beautiful and shiny!
5.0	As pretty as it looks in picture!  I've already gotten compliments.  Top strip of lace won't stay upright on me, but my neck isn't very swan-like.  Looks especially good with hair in an updo.
5.0	I purchased this bracelet for my granddaughter and was surprised that it came much quicker than the initial delivery date.  She really likes the bracelet and upon seeing it myself, I am impressed by the quality of the product.  Now that I have had such a positive experience with Bling Jewelry, I would not hesitate to buy from you again and would also highly recommend you to my friends.
5.0	Great piece. I love the quality and the look.
5.0	My girlfirend likes them a lot and wants to know when she should where them beacuase they are so beautiful.
5.0	Very cute.  Exactly what I ordered and the size was perfect.  It was a gift and she was very pleased.
5.0	Beautiful KJL pearls!
5.0	I have been collecting gemstones (loose), for over 3 years. It would be very hard to find emeralds that look this nice for anywhere near this price unmounted. The color is deeper, than the picture, and they have great clarity for emeralds. I have only had pierced ears for about 6 months,(I figured if I collect gems, I should wear some of them.) and these look great, with a white diamond next to them. These are good for either a man or a woman. I am a 52 year old man, and have had these one day, and have already received several complements on them.
5.0	My granddaughter liked it a lot.
5.0	If you are looking for a Tungsten Carbide ring, look no further.  This ring, and others offered by this seller I suspect, are top quality.  I ordered this particular ring for my husband.  I had been looking at much more expensive TC rings, but decided to give this one a shot based on price.  This ring is a steal!  The workmanship is perfect, it is a beautiful pewter color, the notches and grooves are perfect, and my husband loves it!  It is a heavy, masculine ring.  Since this ring is 9mm I would personally recommend getting it about 1/2 size larger than normal - wider rings tend to fit more tightly than narrower ones.  My husband is a 10.5 ring size and this 11 fits him perfectly.      Buy this ring - you will feel like you have stolen it from the seller!  Wonderful ring - unbelievable price!
5.0	Great leather and embellishment bracelet at a fantastic price! Easy transaction and speedy shipping with Amazon Prime!
5.0	I love Ms Garvey's work and this is a classy, tasteful, beauty of a piece. You really have to understand and appreciate the artistry and essence of true style and artistic use of beautiful materials to enjoy the majesty of the work. I feel like I have a beautiful collection of treasures! Thank you!
5.0	So I  just got this product  in the mail and it is way better  than  expected. Usually  with amber you get small pendants, the actual  stone is larger than what most  of the amber stones are. It has a nice weight, it's about the size of a pecan, the earrings  are very  beautiful  a nice smaller  sized stone. I can't wait  to  put these on I love them sooo much! Now I have to buy the cherry and green sets!!'!
5.0	On time sn just as advertised
5.0	this is it, i was waiting for the right moment. the right time to declare my undying love for PLUR and everything under the blessed blue that is our true mother, the ocean. From now on its aqua-thought. Like a tropical fish amongst the coral i will now travel through life knowing all is well, the flow of water flows through me and my hologaphic yin yang. one is all. sea is me. wash against me oh eternal tide. lay against my chest psychic Yin and trippy Yang.
5.0	Beautiful jewelry made a great gift!
5.0	"These earrings are the perfect size, not too big to be gaudy, but enough to dress up my ears for work, and very pretty.  I also bought the \\""sapphire\\"" ones too, and plan to get the \\""ruby\\"" ones.  You cannot beat the price $3.95 per pair, definitely worth it!"
5.0	I love these earrings! They are a great item for the price. I plan to order more soon. I recommend these if you want Gold Earrings.
5.0	Very pretty unique love these!!!
5.0	I bought this for my GF and she loved it. Looks exactly like in the pics, and the packaging is real nice, she thought it was just a candy bag and didnt think much of it till she opened it. I noticed that there was a small flaw in the heart at the top where the heart dents in but my girlfriend never did so i guess its not bad. I never bothered trying to replace it.
5.0	The quality and design of this bracelet is gorgeous.  It is so much prettier in person, the picture doesn't do it justice.  I wished I was the one getting it instead of giving it as a gift.
5.0	I PURCHASED THIS BRACELET FOR MY BROTHER, LOVED IT!!!!<br />THE QUALITY IS FANTASTIC<br />I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS BRACELET TO A FRINED
5.0	Very beautiful!my daughter loved it.
5.0	Our school mascot is the spider so the spider web appears on almost everything related to the school.  Great for school spirit.  Good size, sturdy and good fit.
5.0	Good！ Especially the price！
5.0	These are adorable little jackets.  They've got a versatile style, so I'm planning on wearing with various studs, including little pearls.  Although I got these for myself, I think they would also make a cute gift for a young girl (tween/teen years) if she wears stud earrings a lot.  I definitely recommend these.
5.0	Looks really nice and my mom loves it! Its made really well and is the perfect size not too big and not too small.
5.0	I purchased this necklace for my daughter to wear on her wedding day.  We looked at all the high-end jewelery stores and never found anything that was unique.  I found this necklace and it is perfect.  My daughter loves it.
5.0	These are one of the most beautiful Topaz earrings I have ever seen, they are beautiful and bright in colour.These are being sent to a special gal friend  and I know she will love them also.Thank you for having such a beautiful item. I thank you again and remain, sincerely yours , Ralph
5.0	"When I ordered this I thought - \\""Stainless steel - it won't look very nice\\"".  I was wrong.  It's actually a very pretty necklace.  Believe me, the picture you see online here does not do it justice.  The detail on this item is quite fine.  And, as I said, my girlfriend loved it.  That's really the only thing that matters."
5.0	I was a little worried that there would be issues with the size (thickness) of the rings because it’s difficult to get an accurate size representation from most photos. Turns out that these are not too small and not to big – wife said they are just right. She is happy with initial quality and look.  Ultimately, if your goal is to have a happy wife which obviously equals a happy life, I would recommend that you purchase these.<br /><br />Shipping was fast and as usual and there were no issues with billing or delivery.
5.0	Nice ring I am enjoying sporting it.
5.0	Just as advertised.  Delivery was quick and price was very good.  I would buy from this seller again.
5.0	I love these. I have 3 holes in my earlobe and wear these in the 2nd hole. They are simple and very on-trend. Perfect for layering. I do think they would get lost if you just wore them in the first hole in the earlobe with nothing else in your ears.
5.0	This is my fourth or fifth time ordering these same exact earrings. FAVES
5.0	I was looking to replace the same earrings from long ago and could'nt believe I found them<br /> perfect size as I don't do big hoops<br />picks up the light and really sparkles<br /> price was half the amount that my local jewelery store was asking
5.0	I love this little crab. He reminds me of the ones I used to see at the shore all the time.
5.0	I bought the silver and gold.  They are super cute and fit great.  I have worn a few times and so far the crystals are staying in tact.  Keep you posted if that changes.
5.0	Little girls love trinkets and jewelry. this is perfect for the little sunshine in your life. honey amber is beautiful and this item is well crafted.
5.0	I really like this necklace.  Yes, the bear is small but it is just the right size.  I wanted something to help me remember my sister, who passed away recently, but did not want something large.  When I see it or hold it I remember my sister loved me.
5.0	Bought these as a Mother's day gift. My Mom was ecstatic when she saw them!
5.0	Pretty ring.  Sizing runs small.
5.0	I orded this little necklace as a gift for my granddaughter at Christmas. I had come across it while browsing on Amazon a week before Christmas but since I'd always had good luck with ordering and shipment, and it was just exactly what I wanted for her, I placed the order. It did not arrive as expected and I was quite disappointed. I posted my complaint and was instructed to call the company.  The owner could not have been more gracious. We confirmed he had the right address and all his paper work seemed to confirm he'd upheld his responsibilities in a timely fashion. Nevertheless, he knew I was disappointed and sent me another at no charge. The little cat was enamel on metal and neatly crafted, the beads were simple, red plastic and the cord was rubber, a bit pricey perhaps, but perfect for a 7 year old who has a black kitten exactly like the little charm, so Grandma felt it was worth it. The day after the replacement arrived the original showed up. There had  been a substitute letter carrier on my route who fumbled the delivery, not the company. I owe them the cost of the second, and if they would kindly contact me with their address I will forward payment. Please accept my apologies for being so tardy with my thanks and repayment.
5.0	LOVE this cute little flat nose stud and so does everyone that has seen it.
5.0	Wife loves them, makes it easy to pick for her and fun for her to mix and match.  Will buy more.
5.0	Ok, so they are costume jewelry, but they are very tasteful and nice and look real!  I;ve had several comliments - wow - where'd you get those!  Even for costume, the price was a steal!
5.0	I bought these for my daughter, who is twelve. She wanted gauges, and I told her she'd have to wait until she was eighteen to alter her body that way. In the meantime, these earrirngs give her the look she wants without enlarging her earring holes.
5.0	A nice bracelet, combination  of metals works well..
5.0	Great bracelet...Love the weight and size of it
5.0	Bought this for Valentines day and it was a big hit! While it is a little on small side, It has held up with my wife wearing it at work for about 20 days now. Solid item that doesn't break the bank.
5.0	High quality, great gift, well worth it
5.0	OMG!  The ring is beautiful.  Maybe I just lucked out but the color of my tanzanite is amazingly intense.  It's a strong purplish blue. Simply beautiful.  Went way beyond my expectation.  I couldn't be happier.  Now, hopefully the stones will stay.  I've had a few ring that I bought on Amazon that the stones fell out in a month or two.  I've usually been able to fix that myself but I'll update this review if that happens.  But as it stands now, the ring is simply a must have.  Definitely recommend!<br /><br />Edited 4/21: added picture
5.0	Exactly what I expected ! Fast shipping and great price . I lies my nose rings a lot and these are great for popping one in quick !
5.0	The luster is fabulous!
5.0	gift for my 3 yrs old niece - so very pretty - very pale pink with lots of lustre<br />very good size - almost too big for her but she'll grow into them. 14kt old posts - looked at<br />others for $45 and decided that was absurd for a 3 yrs old so went with these and they're perfect
5.0	The earrings are very pretty.  The side view of the dragonfly is different than the typical head-on view.  The CZ sparkle very well.  The posts are a tad bit thin because they bend easier than expected.  This issue would not prevent me from recommending the earrings.  Also came in a lovely gift box.
5.0	The Bracelet Buddy works great when you need assistance with your bracelets. Easy to use too! I've purchased this item many times, people enjoy receiving these as gifts too.
5.0	My girlfriend was very pleased when I gave this to her on v-day. Looks amazing couldn't be happier with my purchase.
5.0	Very nice, size is a little large but still can wear.
5.0	The peridot ring is very beautiful. I like  peridot very much and the design is also very good.Think its price!
5.0	I love this for wearing on a jacket or sweater.  The size is big enough to make a nice visual impact.  The colors are vivid.  It's very, very pretty.
5.0	The necklace is very pretty...I love it!
5.0	This pendant is pretty than in the picture. It is abdolutley beautiful. I got it for a gift for my mom and she abdolutely adores it.
5.0	It's not wrong when it says genuine leather. This bracelet smells just like my Wilson's leather jacket. I love how it's adjusted and how it fits.
5.0	Got them quickly, they're super cute, nice and sparkly and fit beautifully!  Would definitely purchase again.
5.0	Looks like a very expensive ring that was handmade.
5.0	The glitter in this belly ring is really noticable and sparkly - all the glitter belly rings are very nice. Great quality and price!
5.0	I'm making some items for my grandchildren.  these are exactly what I needed to complete the project.  Pay the guy; he did what he said he would do.
5.0	I loved my necklace.  It looks super cool and vintage.  Totally worthe the money I spent on it.  It rocked my face off.
5.0	I received this ring yesterday and I absolutely love it.  It fits perfectly and is so pretty and delicate looking.
5.0	I loved it, but would have liked it to be the same size as the earrings.How much more can I say? It worked for me as I knew it would.
5.0	I love it. Looks great and works with my other color bars. Thank you
5.0	Good quality for only $5. Looks exactly like picture
5.0	These arrived so quickly. On top of that, they are way more beautiful than I had expected. The pictures online do them no justice. The actual stud that goes through the ear in toward the top of the leaf and not in the center. I wasn't expecting that, but it really didn't matter much.
5.0	I'm a Rice owl and this cuff bracelet says so!
5.0	Awesome ring! I love it
5.0	beautiful design.  The necklace chain is just the right size and the hearts aren't too big or too small.  It shows nicely and the person I got it for loves it.
5.0	The ring arrived much earlier than expected (which is awesome)! We ordered it August 14 and it was scheduled to come in at the earliest on September 9. Instead, it arrived in just 4 days, on August 18. :]<br /><br />As other reviews have mentioned, this is a dainty ring with small diamonds, but you'd be surprised at the amount of sparkle that comes out of these bad boys.<br /><br />The ring also complements my engagement ring perfectly. My ring size is normally a 5.25 (I'm an in-betweener with ring sizes), so we got a size 6. I know Amazon lists it as &#34;non resizable,&#34; but after doing some research online, I discovered that even &#34;non resizable&#34; rings can often be resized by a skilled jeweler who knows how to keep the structural integrity of the ring, even when stones need to be shifted or removed. I really hope it can be done, but if not, it actually stays on decently well, especially when I have my engagement ring next to it, to sort of &#34;lock&#34; it in place.<br /><br />Overall, I'm very happy with the ring and I'm incredibly excited to wear it for our wedding!
5.0	You will not be disappointed with this beautiful bracelet and the very special scripture.  I am very happy I came across it when I was looking for a cross necklace containing the Lord's prayer.
5.0	I love it, so cute, it was the size my pinkie, and my mother loved it.
5.0	Just as pretty in person as in the picture.  Nice weight; not too heavy; very comfortable.  Has tiny air holes in the braiding so my finger doesn't sweat.  Will probably buy more from this supplier.  Many thanks!
5.0	The ring was delivered in a bag, for some reason i thought it would come in a box. I did received  it before expected, which  made me happy. The ring is big and beautiful and is defenetily exactly as the picture.
5.0	Replacement for a set my wife lost. Right on target. Good value for the price. Matches the necklace I also purchased.
5.0	Ended up being a little to big for my right hand ring finger, so put it on my right middle instead:) It's great! Nice and heavy and very pretty.
5.0	Love the Alex and Ani bracelet..it made my sister very happy.. She was so excited to get the bracelet..Great item!!
5.0	Love it we did put them on our own chains but we didnt like the longer chains tgey came with
5.0	Love these adorable necklaces. I ordered three and they came fairly quickly. Each was wrapped in plastic and they were great for giving out to young girls (I would recommend them for girls about 8-16) as gifts along with a lotion.
5.0	Era la  primera ves que compraba  por Internet y tenía muchas expectativas sobre el producto, no sabía si seria igual al veía en las imágenes, a si como el tiempo en el cual lo recibiría ;  efectivamente , no solo quedé plenamente satisfecha con el broche ,si no con el tiempo  de entrega . Ademas , me gustó mucho la comunicación permanente  del proveedor a través de Internet , donde me notificaba, el estado en el que encontraba  mi pedido. Eso es profesionalismo , los felicito ....  Seré, a partir de ahora, una compradora asidua de los productos que ofrece Avalaya Londres a través de Amazon ....
5.0	Excellent gauges. Love the product. Amethyst has healing benefits and is useful against anxiety. I keep crystals on me to help with certain ailments. The only thing I don't like about this is that they do not look like the image. I understand that organic stones are never identical, but this image is far too vibrant and has probably been enhanced. Mine have absolutely no blue in them. They are pale purple and white. Other than this I love that they are genuine organic stone. They are true to their size and they are an excellent chioce for your gauges.
5.0	Perfect size for long chandelier earrings or short ones. Hangs perfectly on my display. Will be ordering more. I recommended this to my other beading friends.
5.0	"Very beautiful and elegant item for winter! This gold color broach was perfectly matched with my red sweater for Christmas. I really like it, and everyone asks me \\""where did you get this??\\"" Happy item! ^^"
5.0	gave this to my grandaughter yesterday @ out Christmas- goes perfect with her room of Paris theme in black, white and hot pink
5.0	Love these beads. Look amazing on my bracelet. Great quality for less money. I will definitely keep looking for more. They arrived quickly and were as described.
5.0	Love them. We haven't taken them off since we got them. Will recommend to all our friends.
5.0	At the great price, I did not expect it to look like an expensive piece of jewerly.  Just the same it is quite lovely and I have had many complements on it.  I really like the fact that it can be worn as a pin or a necklace.
5.0	Very very nice! I go back and forth if I want my every day necklace dainty or not. This is not a dainty necklace. I wanted something very durable due to past necklaces not holding up. I've given it a good tug and its sturdy! Well this fits that bill!! I like the little charms as well due to I do wear yellow, rose & white gold often. This style is not a &#34;go with everything&#34; necklace like some of the other small dainty necklaces. But I love it none the less and didn't return it although I found a really cute &#34;go with everything&#34; dainty necklace. You can do that with the prices of stainless!!
5.0	I bought this a week or two ago for my girlfriend. Neither of us have a lot of money but I managed to get my hands on some so I decided to buy her a gift. It was delivered quickly, it looks great on her, and she loves it.
5.0	Item was as describe. It felt really durable for a kids necklace.
5.0	I had purchased 2 pair of these earrings and they were delivered faster than they said they would be. Me & my lady love's them their very nice & looks really pretty very well made.I'm happy with these :)
5.0	very pretty earrings, I highly recommend these, they are perfect and they are just like the picture!
5.0	I bought it for my girl friend as a gift. My girl friend loves it very much. It is beautiful and light. Some friends of my honey are impressed by this chain.
5.0	I was looking for earrings to match a pendent piece. Something not too large.  These turned out to be the right size and a perfect match.

5.0	Simple and elegant and a beautiful cream color that is never boring.  They look fabulous with formal or casual attire.
5.0	I read reviews on this and I don't know how anyone could be unhappy. I ordered my chain on the 8th and got it on the 11th only 3 days later with free shipping. It was so fast and it looked really pretty in the picture, but when I opened the box my mouth dropped at out beautiful and shiny the chain was I was very happy with my purchase no complaints at all, and for the price the chain doesn't look cheap it looks very expensive! I hope this is a helpful review for others trying to decide on getting this sterling silver chain or not.
5.0	So beautiful!! Excellent quality for the price.
5.0	I wear these all the time with one other pair of KONOV jewelry and a set of cuffs I got ages ago. I love them
5.0	I was looking for a gift for my wife and this caught my eye in the Daily Deals section.  I am thoroughly pleased.  It's a beautiful and elegant set that isn't overly gaudy.  The stone and the design of the jewelry is very flattering on her and a nice addition to her collection.    My only concern is that the backing on the earrings keeps coming off.  Nothing a stronger set of backs can't fix, but just a warning in advance - it would be a shame to lose these.
5.0	Great item you can sleep and shower in. Never take off.  It's is truly a great set of bracelets to have.
5.0	My husband knows I think pearls are unique and these are comfortable and can be worn as a single bracelet or all together. I prefer splitting them up and wearing some on each wrist.
5.0	Love what I bought from HRA Works... Keep up the good work and I would definitely recommend buying from them!
5.0	Looks great. Awaiting the right moment to use it
5.0	Same price as the A and A website but free shipping here. Makes a great gift for all of the lovely sisters of alpha epsilon phi
5.0	It was as expected, Good price too
5.0	beautiful, sparkly, look like they cost a LOT more than they did! I gave them to my daughter as a gift, & she loved them!
5.0	This ring is beautifully designed and gorgeous! The stone is clear and beautifully cut, and the band is very shiny. My favorite thing about the ring is the uniqueness of it...there's a small space between the center stone and the tiny stones that form the &#34;halo&#34;, giving it a very unique look. It's a very refined, sophisticated and expensive-looking ring at an affordable price. I highly recommend it.
5.0	Great quality for the price. I only got these for comparison to real diamonds and quick size/shape to other gems.
5.0	Simple and elegant.  I was looking for something different, and this is it.  Happy to wear it.
5.0	Appreciated the prompt delivery. Nice gift for a young girl
5.0	They match each other quite nicely, and they come in an attractive package.
5.0	Bought this for my father as a Father's Day Gift.  He absolutely loved it.  I received one as a birthday gift and they are wonderful. My father had been eyeing mine up so it was a no brainer.
5.0	She gets compliments on this great pendant all the time. Its big enough to show off and it really sparkles.  Colors are bright but not childish.
5.0	Super sparkler pendant. This pendant is a quality item, with lots of sparkly ,tiny diamonds . A lovely gift.
5.0	Great quality. Looks like the picture
5.0	I wear these in my second, third, and fourth hole all the time. I can wear them in the shower and in my sleep and I don't even remember they're there
5.0	Very beautiful earrings.  They look more stunning in person.  So glad I got these.
5.0	Bought this as a Christmas gift, she loved it. Looks exactly like the picture and fits onto the pandora bracelet perfectly.  I definitely recommend this product. Its a great find for the price!
5.0	Given as a gift, the recipient was thrilled!
5.0	Loved it awesome seller
5.0	Very elegant piece of jewelry !!
5.0	If you want to be envied, slap this beauty around your neck. That's all I have to say.
5.0	It's a gift, but I liked what saw
5.0	very pretty necklace, gave it to daughter for her 18th birthday.<br />delicate looking, but should hold up and not break too easily
5.0	This item is so pretty. It is bigger that I expected and is really beautiful. This is really worth the money.
5.0	Great fit, looms beautiful.
5.0	When I got it I was very impressed the picture shows no justice it is very beautiful I love it and can't wait to put it on for my big day. I would recommend it to others.
5.0	I love the design. The ring is heavy and very detailed. The sizes come a little small so I would suggest you order at least one size bigger.  Would be perfect for a men's gift.
5.0	The included extender gave this beautiful necklace the perfect length. The pendant has a nice weight to it so it doesn't flip when you wear it. I get compliments all the time.
5.0	This charm is in 3D and very nice.  The diamonds are on both sides and it was easy to add to my bracelet.  For the money I would recommend this to anyone.
5.0	So the price was right. The earrings are about dime sized. What you can't see from the pic is the rhinestones go all the way around. I bought 3 pairs. 1 for myself and 2 for my daughters. I have gotten many compliments on these.
5.0	Nicely made and excellent for the price!
5.0	So beautiful, great gift for a young girl.
5.0	Mailing on time and packaging was nice.  I have been getting many complements went I wear these crystals..  We can all use some help from nature and the universe.  Crystals rock!
5.0	Best item on line I have ever bought. Absolutely love it.
5.0	Love this necklace. It was a great size and I got plenty of compliments on it. Great price cause I got it on sale too.
5.0	I like the dark look. Other shiny scripture rings look like wedding rings.  That might be a desirable conversation starter, but then people may think your strange for wearing a wedding ring if your single.  No confusion with this ring.  It fits comfortably on my finger. The edges aren't sharp but they're not beveled either, so it does seem to get caught on my pants pockets. Maybe they'll redesign this so the verse is in the center and then it could be beveled.
5.0	Love this design for my husband!  A Christmas gift for him so I hope he likes it as well as I do!
5.0	Gave this beautiful necklace to my sister for her birthday. She loved it. She sent me a picture wearing the necklace and it is stunning
5.0	It looks good on the picture but totally different when you actually have it in person. Still recommend it to others
5.0	This necklace is weighty and secure.  It wears well and is a great value.  The clasp is secure and not hard to open or close.  Plan to go back and purchase another for a gift!
5.0	I wear it all the time! It's huge and I love it(:
5.0	I is all I expected...it looks great!
5.0	Ooh necklace too. Very good quality for the price<br />Too good to give as a gift. I was a good buy.
5.0	There were some people that said it was smaller than they thought it would be. I sized my finger, bought the size it said and it fit perfectly.
5.0	LOVE these earrings!  Bought them as a gift for my sister in law, and can't wait to give them to her!  Much better than I was expecting!  Beautiful, sparkly, nice color, nice size.
5.0	Very cute, hoops not too big..
5.0	This is my engagement ring and I LOVE it. It is beautiful. True to the image. Shiny and colorful. Lightweight.
5.0	fits well and I have pretty thick wrist. the quality is good and got here faster then expected. and seriously I bought this same bracelet at Clair's for way more!
5.0	I purchased these because I am always losing my black earrings. Now I don;t have<br />to worry plus the earring are very comfortable
5.0	Beautiful. Arrival on time. Highly recommended. Thanks
5.0	Nice durable quick shipping
5.0	Very pretty and shinny, perfect
5.0	I've had mine for over a month now, it looks beautiful! Size is dead on, nothing has fallen out, the ring is very durable and the BEST part is, I never take it off and it has not miscolored my skin at all. I have a $100 sterling silver bracelet that I can only wear occasionally because it turns my skin colors, not these though.
5.0	This necklace is very small and delicate but seems to be well made.  I love the necklace and wear it often.
5.0	My wife loves these!  They don't have any diamonds, but they sparkle in the light as if they did!.  Love them!
5.0	I got this for my wife's birthday and she loved it! the only let down is that my daughter ALSO loved it... so i just had the buy a second one xD
5.0	I LOVE this necklace.  I was looking for a simple design that would match with everything and I could wear it everyday.  This necklace is the perfect length, I love that it is sterling silver and I get a lot of compliments on it's simple modern design.  I take it off at night- it is sturdy enough for long term day use but not to sleep in.  I liked it so much I bought some as gifts as well.  At $10 and free shipping, this was a great buy
5.0	Bought for my elderly mother. Very nice for non expensive item. Colorful.  Tasteful. Crystals look very nice.  She has had many compliments on this cross.  Would highly recommend it.  Chain very strong and nice also.
5.0	I spent some time looking for a turtle pendant that was just right, and this one is! Beautiful sterling silver & opal turtle body.  Not cheap looking at all, but a solid and shiny silver.  I love turtles, but didn't want a big gigantic turtle hanging on my necklace, but a size that people would at least notice.  The size to my surpise was PERFECT!!! Not too small and not too big, but everything I was looking for! It was the size of my thumb nail -width and length (up to end of nail bed) The picture is exactly what it looks like! The opal even prettier in person, with hues of pink, light green & some turquoise! I have recieved many compliments and have only worn my turtle for 2 days... So if you love turtles like me and your looking for a pretty sterling silver turtle pendant, this is the one.  You wont regret it!!!! Shipping was fast also...
5.0	It's a Heartagram to display my love for the band HIM. Nothing is more perfect. Great quality and well made. Beautiful!
5.0	Oh I can't explain how satisfied I am..its pretty and quality is very good for the price I paid... oh I love it...Bling has good quality jewerly...fast shipping...I'll keep buying..

5.0	I recieved great, fast, and friendly service. The ring fits perfectly and looks great. Can't beat the price or quality either!!!!
5.0	I chose this item and others similar for my Granddaughters and was very pleased with the product.  I would buy more similar items in the future.
5.0	I love it so much, I bought it as a gurft for my mom. It looks very rich, feels very smooth and came with a free neclace chain and an elegant velvet pouch.
5.0	I love these earrings.  Just what I had in mind.  The price was well worth it. I would get more from this company.
5.0	Absolutely beautiful...It is a very unique look to it.
5.0	Great value for money, a lovely casual piece.
5.0	As pictured....details are fine and it was beautiful!
5.0	Very happy with this ring I bought it for a surprise gift for my boyfriend and it was exactly what I was looking for
5.0	I was very pleased, and both my husband and I were both pleased... The rings exceeded our expectations... They fit perfect!!
5.0	These earrings are awesome. They are even nicer than I thought they would be. Four different sizes and all are great.
5.0	Just what I was looking for
5.0	it is a lot beter then I tought it would be i love it. it was werth $29 by one and youl love it
5.0	Its earliest release time was suppose to be oct.9 i got it sectember29 so around a week early the pendant is smaller then i thought but still nice
5.0	Love the ring! I wear it everyday and it still looks great!  It is heavy duty and great looking!
5.0	After reading some of the reviews I was a little worried that my mother would not like it.  When I received it I was very happy it was the perfect size, looked amazing and I could read the ingraving (with my glasses). Gave it to mom on Christmas she cried as she read the saying and was delighted. Diamonds even sparkle.
5.0	Love this ring. Gifted it to my husband who loves tungsten carbide! He loves black, this was the perfect choice for him! He wears it daily for approx 3 months now. Held up well, one small scratch so far - very hard to notice. Worthwhile purchase, would buy again if needed to! Very heavy & sturdy, well made. Love the comfort got inside!! Makes me delighted to see it on him! A++
5.0	This is a very nice letter bead...it has the right amount of shine and shadow to accentuate it...the look of this and the other 4 initial beads on my granddaughters bracelet says it all!...it is a classy, timeless look that will endure for her entire life...a great purchase.
5.0	I'm very pleased with the quality of this ring.  I've been wearing it for a year, and it is still holding strong.
5.0	I never write reviews, but I just had to say how beautiful this ring is! The pictures do not do it justice. The gold is shiny, the diamonds are bright and the band is so comfortable. Love everything about it.
5.0	I only wear this now and then as I'm an actor and I got it for auditions and jobs so I don't know how it holds up under consistent use, but I think it looks great and it can't be beat for the price I paid!
5.0	I received these earrings (pair) sooner than expected, which was a lovely surprise. I have had several tunnels in my day of wearing plugs of different sizes, as well as I am very sensitive to most metal jewelry so I have to be wary of which I can wear and not start getting itchy hives. Thus said, these tunnels work great, so far I've been wearing them off and on for several months without any metal allergy problems (*note, that not everyone has my specific allergy, so it may not work for everyone, but it has for my sensitive skin type), and the screw on hinges work well.<br />I read someone had a problem with them, but I have not. This style of tunnels, people can easily have problems with the screw on back (user error) but you just have to be patient and not cross hinge it. Advice if you have this problem: the backs have to screw on in the way they were meant to (as in one side is meant to meet up only, they usually don't work reversed). So if you're having this problem, take them off, screw them together while they are off your ear and see how they work, then retry.<br />I would say that of all the screw on tunnels I have owned (I have had stretched ears for over 14 years now), these are my favorite. I highly recommend them.
5.0	I'll be wearing this Nov for my wedding. They're very elegant and sparkly. Not cheap looking at all. I also bought a matching bracelet. I'm waiting for that one to come in.
5.0	I love this ring my husband asked me to marry him on feb 14th she I said yes. Thank you for all your help.
5.0	I love this ring. It does not have a wow factor, but it is an every day wearable ring. well crafted.
5.0	I love Alex and Ani bracelets. Thank you for the shipping quickly too
5.0	It is beautiful and just what I was looking for. The quality is nice and the color of the stones is perfect.
5.0	Loved how the balls were a random assortment! They were all so pretty I had a hard time choosing just one.
5.0	I collect gems and jewelry for fun. I rarely am inspired to write a review. This peice is extraordinary and a steal. The silver detail is gorgeous the piece is weighty and the stones deserve a sentence of their own. This combo of sfones is very common and they are usually very pale and lack the deep color that makes a stone worth the investment. These stones are large, deeply colored with much clarity. I would have bought this for twice the cost... now back to gem shopping...
5.0	I ordered this ring for my husband after his tungsten one broke. I didn't expect much due to the fact that it was so cheap. I received it in 2 days and it looked like the picture. Took it to get it engraved. I hope it lasts
5.0	Nice blue topaz cab.  Love it.
5.0	This pendant is very nice and well worth the money.  It is exactly as shown in the picture.  It is very shiny and the CZ's are very sparkly.  I have had it for over a month now and I even wear it in the shower and it still sparkle! Also, I love this seller, they have probably the BEST jewelry on Amazon.
5.0	This ring is made with attention to detail, it has a substantial amount of silver in it (not hollow and very comfortable on your finger) and what's more important it's beautiful and different! Hard to find unique pieces like this. Very classy.<br />I wear it on my big finger and get lots of compliments on it.
5.0	They're worn in the top most spot on my ears and are comfortable, even when worn 24 hours a day.  They're gorgeous on their own, don't overwhelm, but enhance other earrings worn with them.
5.0	My Granddaughter is a big Harry Potter fan.  She loves this bracelet.  She wears it all the time.  To her it is the best bracelet around
5.0	I took a chance on this ring, and I'm glad I did. It's just as pictured, the silver is gleaming and the stone has the iridescence typical of labradorite. The first day I wore it, I received a compliment. Because it was adjustable, it fit just as I had hoped.
5.0	I bought this ring as my boyfriend's engagement ring. I took it and got red rubies inserted into the eyesockets. He loved it. I recommend this ring for anyone who loves skulls, or a gift for someone that loves skulls.
5.0	Love it!! Sturdy, and beautiful!
5.0	Love! Love! Love!<br />They're so bright and sparkly, the baskets are very well made, and come with a post backing. I will wear these nearly every day as I have a pink sapphire bracelet that matches these exactly. I could not be more pleased :)
5.0	I am a big fan of Elle sterling silver jewelry.  My husband bought a few pieces for me from our local jewelry store 5 years ago. This sterling keeps its color very well and the stone quality is excellent.  These earrings are unique.  All of the parts of these earrings move, which I like.
5.0	Great look & length! Love it!
5.0	These earrings are a great gift to give or receive. They are well worth the purchase price and come nicely packaged.
5.0	bought this for one of my nieces I was happy that I did its very cute & pretty and I think she will love it!
5.0	Great product for the price
5.0	Wore them for the first time, all evening, to a Halloween party! They stayed in place and looked great! Barely felt them! I may never go back to posts! (AND therefore no need to re-pierce my ears! YAAAY! No more allergic trauma from metal allergies that not even hypoallergenic posts could prevent!)
5.0	Was looking for a short belly button ring and this is the perfect size.
5.0	look better than the picture these are awesome and i get a lot of compliments on them!!!
5.0	Was pleased when this arrived. It was a gift for my Mother. She loves it, and it looks nice in her ring.
5.0	I got this for my 22 yr. old for his B/Day. Very nice chain! He loved it! It really is a chain that works for any age & goes w/pretty much everything. Buy it you won't be disappointed.
5.0	Came fast, true to size, pretty variations oin color all round the guage. They are a bit heavy when you wear them a lot.
5.0	these are perfect for me - just the right size to fit on wither side of my diamond!
5.0	I could not be more pleased with this rosary! It is beautiful, has an excellent weight and feel to it, and for the price I was amazed at what I got. The black stainless beads and crucifix are heavy and real between your fingers, and warm with your body heat as you touch them. The chain and spacers are a nice quality and are the type that are easily repaired if you are rough on your jewelry, as I am.<br /><br />Highly recommended!
5.0	Just like the Twilight engagement ring. My niece loves it!
5.0	I got this for my wife as a present. It was very beautiful. The necklace was also better than expected. The butterfly really stands out as well as the touch of rose gold.
5.0	Shiny and pretty.. Looks great
5.0	Nice piece of leather jewery
5.0	Very pleased with my purchase.  Nice thick and heavy chain and bracelet.  The chain at 22&#34; is the perfect size for me.
5.0	This was a great gift for my daughter's birthday as she had just returned from Paris. It is the perfect size for her bracelet, doesn't hang down too far and great detail.
5.0	It is a beautiful ring, and it is not thin. Love it!!!
5.0	Bought for an Xmas gift, and my BFF loved it!!
5.0	This is GOR- GORGE- GORGU- REALLY PRETTY!!! (SORRY, MY SHIFT KEY IS BROKEN :D) [[ASIN:B000Q4SREG MySims]] MySims is a great game!!! It looks amazing... The ring would be pretty on me... Nachos are yummy...
5.0	precious! work well with my tiny lobes
5.0	We're big Seahawk fans
5.0	Awesome product! Got this for the girl whom I love and she loves it! It's an awesome product!
5.0	My boyfriend and I chose this as my engagement and wedding set and I´m very happy with it. It is small and very delicate. No need to buy a bigger or expensive set.
5.0	Really pretty in person. It's just the right size and not too delicate for a rough and tumble type girl. I did not use the necklace that came with it.
5.0	This ring is so much prettier in person I could not believe it when I opened the box.....BEAUTIFUL & I LOVE IT!! And it does run true to size. Buy it you will not be disappointed!!
5.0	Just as  pictured. Very detailed and well made. They look amazing!Gears actually work although I wouldn't recommend turning them too many times. Received quickly. Thanks!
5.0	I bought this for our grandaughter. She is 10, and she loved it. It was bigger and nicer than I was expecting, for the price. It was well made. Every now and then you find a bargain on Amazon, and this was one of them. A really nice piece.
5.0	"I am very happy that i bought this one, I actually bought the gold and blue \\""Feather Necklace\\"". Wonderful Jewelry, was Very surprised at the PVC rope was thinking it wouldnt compliment the Feather but it actually looks good."
5.0	Me and my boyfriend LOVES this! I had to return to get another size and the replacement process was so easy and fast I was amazed.
5.0	I'd read the reviews prior to purchasing these earrings, so expected them to be decent.  My mild expectations were blown out of the water upon arrival.  These earrings are GORGEOUS! Certainly well beyond the quality I would've expected given the price.  I fell in love with them immediately.  They have a weight and artistry that belies the meager expense.  HIGHLY recommend if you're looking for a taste of antiquity at a low price.  Just beautiful!
5.0	Beautiful earrings!! Wearing them right now.  All I wear is pink and I should've bought 10 more pairs just like them!
5.0	It's a very handsome mens ring. Very well made. Nice fit as well. I would recommend it to everyoneI know.
5.0	Very nice detailed ring. Nicely shining in light. Pretty width but don't look too heavy. The only thing that could be better is how much detailed it's made. In two spots the design is not matching and is slightly going up. Overall very nice ring for that price.
5.0	The color and size were just right for a family member.  They were happy with it fitting since, the person has a small wrist.
5.0	My son wanted one of these to complete his Airsoft gear.  It's solid and looks good.  Not like some cheap imitation.
5.0	Very pretty.  I'm a very slim 5'7 and it fit perfectly.  Looks much more expensive than the price.
5.0	My Grand daughter loved it and did not want to take it off, she said she was going to sleep with it
5.0	These are so beautiful! They are the perfect christmas gifts to give out this year to all my neices and god kids thats getting too big for toys
5.0	I bought this as a Christmas gift for my wife.  While I wanted to give her a vintage articulated Tiffany dragonfly, I couldn't afford one even if I found it.  My wife loved this brooch.  She liked the fact it can be worn as a pin, or it has an eye to allow it to be used as a necklace on a chain.
5.0	Dresses up a t-shirt (really!) and can be worn with work outfits as well as for special occasions.  Very versatile, classy, not over the top, just simple, elegant, fun...whatever you want it to be. Note:  Makes an excellent birthday gift-- I received it as a birthday gift and it makes it that more special to me!
5.0	Absolutely beautiful.  Delicate with a lot of sparkle.  Very unique and fun.
5.0	High quality. I bought 2 additional of these as gifts.
5.0	Love the earrings, but just wish the stone in necklace I purchased was even close to the size of the earrings (:
5.0	I love this neckalce. Me and my girlfriend love it. To me this was a token of our love it might just be a gift but to us its our love. I do recommend buying.
5.0	[[VIDEOID:b042a07564f4aaa59718d78653fb67a1]] I received the white gold plated copper version of this tennis bracelet.  It has absolutely beautiful Cubic Zirconia Gemstones that sparkle in the sunlight and give it a much more expensive look than it really is.  It wore it all day and experienced no skin irritation, which is extremely important to me.  The bracelet came with a little extra gift in the box, which was a really pretty little scarf<br /><br />Beautiful!<br /><br />Product received to test with the option to review. No financial compensation is EVER accepted, and vendor may request that item be returned. I reserve 4 and 5 star ratings for products I would either recommend to others or buy for myself. This is a great product that I would highly recommend!
5.0	Such a simple yet powerful looking necklace
5.0	this was purchased as a gift. It is very heavy duty weight wise, and durable. I like the quality very much
5.0	A very masculine design.  Any man should love to have this as an accessory to tasteful dress.  This item can make for a terrific gift for any occasion!
5.0	I got this ring along with a few other citrine rings...............when the price was right.  It is a beautiful ring.  My mom saw it and wanted one just like this one.
5.0	My wife does not like to buy online, that being said she is very happy with this necklace set.
5.0	It's pretty, looks cheap up close but pretty from afar.  The style is really cute and it falls nicely on the neck.
5.0	Exquisite detailing, uniquely designed.  Exceeded my expectations.  The price was far less than the perceived value, and that's always a plus.
5.0	I love them! They're exactly what I expected them to be and what I wanted.
5.0	These are a great value for the price.  All the colors are attractive and each set matches perfectly in size, shape and color.
5.0	Very nice necklace, It looked identical to the image, fits well, and arrived two days earlier than the given date. I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a tiki necklace!
5.0	Just received this in the mail,and had to jump on here and let you guys know....BEAUTIFUL!Not at all what I expected but in a good way.It is a lot bigger than I thought,the colors on here does not do it justice and it does weigh a little more than I'd have liked but with the size its expected.A definite 5 star purchase here.Thanks so much :)
5.0	Super cute, looks wonderful with a tan. I saw someone at an outdoor concert with a bracelet similar to this one, I loved the way it looked so I checked on Amazon and found this one at an amazing price, at just a little over $3 you can't beat it. I ordered 3 of them to wear together but I really love the way it looks with just one, absolutely perfect! It came in 10 days which is not bad considering it shipped from China. Very happy:)
5.0	My wife love it she loves sterling sil<br />stuff am happy nice job
5.0	Love the look!  I wear these in my second piercing with a small hoop in my first.  Would recommend to anyone looking for a unique look, however works better with short hair.
5.0	got this for my grandaughter, she wanted to showe the world she is waiting for marriage to show her love.
5.0	Living in Panama it is not always wise to wear your expensive jewelry as daily jewelry.  This has an expensive look and my wife loves it.  She wears it as a wedding combo with a two toned gold-plated titanium band that we purchased at the same time.  Looks great and she has piece of mind.
5.0	This is an awesome company they sent me a free leather bracelet as a gift, and since I ordered 5 items they gave me 5 free velour gift bags. No company I know of in USA would do that. I will definitely order from this company again I gave them 5 stars well deserved.
5.0	everything I expected and so much more!
5.0	I purchased this exact necklace yesterday and it MUCH prettier in person than on the web!  Because the stones are Swarovski stones, the sparkle and clarity of the stones is remarkable, and I particularly like the antique gold color/finish.  My only complaint is the length of the chain.  It is on the short side and with the extension, the clasp will not be centered on the back of your neck.  If you cannot wear a 16&#34; chain, I suggest that you not purchase this necklace, but it is beautiful!
5.0	Arrived ahead of schedule and as described. I did not expect the luck bean as a thank you. It was a pleasant surprise.  Both my wife and I love them.
5.0	Shines up brass fantastically. Good purchase.
5.0	Bought these for a friend for her birthday, she is just wild for Flamingos- I am sure that they will be a big hit.  They arrived on time and are as promised.
5.0	My favorite plugs year round, Buddhism isn't always recognized. But these let it be know, for those who know... Great responses
5.0	This necklace is wonderful. Wish I can get other colors just the size of this one
5.0	luv this very stylish, high fashion necklace, beautiful colors  the backs of the blue stones are like foam,necklace could have been 2 inches longer, clasp is left handed and awkward for me would have worked best for me if it were right handed
5.0	I was a bit worried about what the actual item would look like. The picture is so pretty I wondered if the item would look that good when it arrived but I was not disappointed. Craftsmanship is A+. I purchased this as a gift and I will be proud to give it.
5.0	Ring is stunning and the quality of the cz is amazing they look extremely real.
1.0	I am glad there were two bc the first one broke as I put it on. Shoddy quality.
1.0	A bunch of CRAP they only send like 6 rings out of 30 and it has no dice just plain balls...it almost looks like a lip ring DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY PLEASE!
1.0	I was hesitant to order this since the one other reviewer was not happy with it. I have been looking for a bracelet like this but couldn't afford the real Tiffany version. You definitely get what you pay for. I would NOT recommend this to anyone. The clasp was very poorly made and was broken before I even opened the box. Oh well, guess I should have listened to the other reviewer. Hope my review saves someone else from ordering this and being disappointed. I will be mailing this back in the morning.
1.0	"Beware!<br />There is no \\""pave\\"" in this supposed pave set of earrings. From the photo you can also see that whatever it is that they are trying to pass off as pave is only on the front part of the earrings. I bought the large loops and was extremely disappointed with them (sent them back immediately)<br />The hematite was sprinkled on the earrings much like a child with a bottle of Elmers would attach glitter to something.<br />Not pretty at all"
1.0	Thought they were going to be a lot bigger / cheap looking
1.0	I know these were not very expensive and I wasn't expecting great quality but these were worse than I imagined. And I paid extra to have them on time for a wedding I was going to but they arrived two days late. They are pretty big and the centers are definitely not as good as the picture.
1.0	I had order three hello kitty. I only received two. The merchandise was fine.
1.0	The stones have fallen out.  Poorly designed and manufactured.  AND... no returns.  DO NOT buy this product!
1.0	Very cheaply made. Clasp is very very thin. Will not hold up to any long term use. First time trying to hook the clasp it broke. If the price is cheap rest assured its cheap
1.0	They turn black real quicl,is a waste  of money. Don't buy them.
1.0	I wore the ring twice, and then the whole setting, came unattached from the ring. the quality was like a dime-store bubble gum machine ring. DO NOT PURCHASE this ring.<br />it is not stainless steel, the setting is soldered to the ring by two tiny contacts. I brushed against a yogurt container when it popped right off.<br />really disappointed since I really like the design and setting.
1.0	The item arrived on time and in good shape.  However, the first time I wore it the Aquamarine stone fell out.  Very disappointed.
1.0	Tarnished the first day my husband wore it.
1.0	Very cheap looking, smells bad. Also, it is almost impossible to contact customer service for return or refund.
1.0	Am fits teacup Yorkie
1.0	The ring looked good when I first got it. But now it is no longer shining at all. And the color changes as well. If you are looking for something that lasts long, then you may want to reconsider.
1.0	After two months the material faded to rusty. Not a great purchase.
1.0	These earring are ok but I can't give them to my 3 year old granddaughter. She loses them pretty fast. I thought the special backs would help.
1.0	It was so lightweight that the clasp broke after one wearing.  Happily there is a work around but not pleased
1.0	Nice looking chain but the clasp is not properly soldered into place- I caught the pendant on this chain on something and the whole chain broke.
1.0	Me llego roto, es mas caro , devolución, asi que me quedé cn ello
1.0	It was very cheaply made. It sucked
1.0	CHEAP. Broke within 3 minutes. I guess you get what you pay for. The only upside is I have the charms and can go out and get quality cord/fasteners for them. It's awesome to spend more money... Not. Would. Shop. Again.
1.0	I NEVER write review but i have to on this one.  I have to say that when i opened the box i was convinced it was the weakest & cheapest chain i have ever seen.  My first thought was oh my god this thing wont last a week before it breaks.  Even if it was a ladies necklace i would still think it was too delicate and would break fast but for a mens necklass, i was appalled.  Anyway, it broke after maybe a week of wearing it.  A waste of $30 and here a week later, i am having to buy a new one!  Total ripoff and not fair.  Please dont make the same mistake i did.  I wonder how many of these are actually in existance that are not broken UGH!
1.0	The quality of the earring was VERY Poor.  Would NOT recommend this product or anything made by this manufacturer ever.
1.0	The words on the bead are unreadable, nothing like the picture.
1.0	these plugs are not a standard size 2g and they were not even equal size themselves. will not buy this kind again
1.0	They were so difficult to remove from the small piece of cardboard they were clipped to that one of the lever backs was bent.  Now it won't close tightly and I am unable to wear them.  This is despite the fact that I was extremely careful with them.  The mechanism just wasn't strong enough to withstand even careful manipulation.
1.0	Bought this for my girlfriend for her birth day. She only wore it for a few weeks, I want to say 3 weeks at the most and one of the stones fell out. The ring does look nice, it is on the larger side and does draw lots of attention. Its a shame that the stone few out of the setting. I'm in the process of returning it and hopefully getting something that will last more than a few weeks.
1.0	its fake...looks like it came out of a quarter machine..its a childs play ring that is adjustable and broke easily
1.0	Really pretty but it broke within 10 hours of pwning it.
1.0	I loved the bobble part of the earrings but the clasp part of the earrings are absolutely terrible.  Very hard to use and the tend to get stuck in the ear if you can even get them in your ear.  I have since removed the bobble part and have thrown away the clasp part and am hoping to have another pair made for me.
1.0	I was extremely disappointed with this item. The pendant is very small and cheap in looks. The chain is a joke. After receiving the necklace, it took almost two hours to get the knot out and after only one day the chain broke. I would not recommend this product to anybody for the price.
1.0	I just got this belly ring in the mail the other day and it is already broken. the first day I got it, it fell apart piece by piece. I was very disappointed in this because I thought it was really cute. I would not recommend buying this product.
1.0	The crystals are beautiful, they look just like diamonds. If you get a pair that is straight you will love them. We however received a pair that has the thinnest gold possible and were so bent that the crystal was loose and the post was so bent we did not even attempt to put them in. Very disappointed in the quality of the gold. I cannot recommend because I do not think they are good quality or that they will last for any length of time. Had to be refunded.
1.0	I was very excited to receive my ring, but after a delay in receiving it I opened my package to find a cheap version of the ring in the picture. It was round , not oval and the color was no where near as blue.
1.0	Was broken before I even opened the package. The main jewel in the middle was not even the right size for the necklace so it was unfixable and I threw it away.
1.0	Arrived loose in box, metal was faded and tarnished, with scratches on the finish, probably from striking the other earring in the box. Poor product, do not recommend buying jewelry over the internet. Don't be lazy as I was, go to the store and  see what you're getting.
1.0	cheap piece of crap! looks like it came out of the quarter machine!!!!
1.0	This ring is so cheap and poorly made. The band is not as thick as it looks. Shipping took forever. I would not recommend this product to anyone.
1.0	These earrings look good and would have fit my ears perfectly, but once you get them to open, they will not close back up, unless you force them too - which you don't want to do while they are on your ear lobes.
1.0	I bought this bracelet in beige and it arrived with a broken clasp.  I will not be buying this type of product again unless I can examine it first from a retail store.
1.0	I had asked for a refund for the fact that I was under the impression that it was thicker and a mens chain, what I received was a women's chain that would not look good on a man at all.  For $186.00 I feel I got cheated.  Been 7 days and still no refund.  Tried to make a review one other time and it got rejected
1.0	Clasp is worthless...if that could be fixed, this would be a good item...
1.0	I was truly hurt when the ring turned brown and started peeling.
1.0	Gaudy, looks extremely cheap and poor quality (see pic, look at rough metal on prongs). Side diamonds are not laid flat, inserted crooked. Very disappointed, looks more like Halloween jewelry quality. I will be returning.
1.0	This broke as soon as I got it. Although I got it at a very good price, I don't think I will ever use it.
1.0	Not surgical steel grade.
1.0	Photo makes it look much nicer than it is. It's very light and poorly made. The heart is also very small also. I doubt it will last very long.
1.0	I can not give it a good rating as I did not receive what was advertise , I received my necklace but not the Bracelet .
1.0	"I am really disappointed with this product. Though this pendant might look awesome in the picture shown, but it almost looks like a stainless steel peice with two hearts not \\""floating\\"" but kept inside like two balls. The box provided to keep this pendant is so cheep with a tag of \\""Made in China\\"" written at the back of the box. The colour of my box in which this pendant was delivered was pale dirty medium green which added to my dismay. They should have at least provided a blue velvet box, standard in jewellery industry.     Overall, the product is not worth!"
1.0	These arrived tarnished and cheap looking. I was expecting this to be a &#34;grounded&#34; purchase, instead it makes me look like a naive idiot.....
1.0	DONT BUY THESE. I bought them and was so excited to try them out, and as soon as I screwed the flower back on it broke off, leaving a piece of plastic on the end. the other flower doesn't come off. I couldn't get the plastic off, so I basically ended up sizing up my nipple piercing, and it was extremely painful. very displeased with this product.
1.0	They don't glow in the dark ,which, is very disapointing .
1.0	oh my god , price is cheap but it doesn't deserve that price.. its built so cheaply and when it came, it has rust yellowish in it.
1.0	They are pretty and well made BUT they are too small.  They fall through the hole in my ear and I am going to lose them.  I needed a larger size.
1.0	It broke the very first time I used it, was not impressed :(
1.0	dont fit in ears the hole is really small and barely even noticable
1.0	The chain was broken when it arrived, so I returned it. Pretty stone, but poor quality of the chain. If it hadn't been broken already, I wouldn't have worn it due to fragility.
1.0	Fell apart the first time I picked it up. I was put together with a half closed jump ring, one. The red thing fell out also.
1.0	Terrible quality, 5 were broke upon opening the package. Save your money!  I am still trying to get them returned!
1.0	The gems are so small they're practically invisible.
1.0	I asked my boyfriend to buy this for me and was really disappointed to find that when you unscrew the ball on the lobe part of the earring, the back ball doesn't come off, the front one does! I can't even put it on! I would need to push the bar through the back of my lobe and then somehow line up the ball that is attached to the dangling part of the earring and then somehow screw it in! I spent 20 minutes trying to do so and it does not work. Completely disappointed. I want to return it and give my boyfriend his money back!!!
1.0	I spent too much money on this one bead that's not the color I ordered!! False advertisement! It shows blue and purple but what I got was brown, blue and pink.
1.0	first of all the beauty of the ring is the top ,really shiny and pretty but as you turn the ring side-ways you will frown literally not a good design there are two open spaces on each sides that just makes the ring look fake and cheap, cheaper than it really is that is. No wonder they didn't show the sides cause no one would buy a ring that loks like a pop-corn toy ring side-ways. I wanted to wear this as an anniversary ring untill I get a real golad and diamond now i don't even know if I wanna show this to my friends they are gonna know its FAKE! right away. Do not recommend at all for a replacement am sending this back
1.0	It's way too short of a post to be a tragus earring. The heart was really hard to unscrew and get on once it's in the ear. I can't even use it.
1.0	DONT BUY !  There not what you think. i dont even wear mines anymore.
1.0	received this in the mail today & i was soooo happy its a prefect size not to small the price is GREAT<br />update: I had to pawn this ring and the jeweler said two diamonds were FAKE!!! Do not buy this
1.0	I purchased this ring for my girlfriend for christmas, and was completely dissapointed when i took it to the jewelr to be sized. He told me that it was so cheaply made and the prong setting was so weak that if she wore it and bumped her hand she would lose the stone. The ring was not what the picture depicted. would never buy another piece of jewelry off amazon.
1.0	DOES NOT fit Pandora bracelet. Bought two and neither fit. Don't buy unless you enjoy wasting time and money.
1.0	I DID NOT EXPECT A VERY DARK,DARK COLOR BLUE. IT DEFINATELY WAS NOT PINK, ALMOST BLACK. DID NOT LIKE IT AT ALL.  I GAVE IT TO MY DAUGHTER WHO LIKES BUTTERFLIES.
1.0	Does not look as pretty as the picture.
1.0	This chain took a really long time to get here an it is a cheap plastic chain that looks nothing like the display pic DO NOT BUY THIS .... Very disappointing purchase wish I could have uploaded a picture
1.0	I just received this ring and it is not blue, and it does not look like the rest of my turquoise. The sterling mounting is beautiful. That's the only reason I am not sending it back.
1.0	I loved the way it looked online. The construction in terrible. It's held together with elastic, the metal is heavy. So, when I wore it for a half a day it got stretched out. I sent it back.
1.0	I got this ring on the day that I was supposed to get it and the ring was absolutely beautiful! However, within 5 hours of having the ring on, my finger turned green. Not happy about that at all as I will be sending it back and getting my money back.
1.0	i bought this for my sons first communion, i loved this piece but a week after he was wearing this it started changing color.. started to get rusty..<br />and he has been wearing silver necklace and didnt tarnish at all..
1.0	This is a poorly made bracelet. It's too large and not adjustable. Just didn't bother to return it.
1.0	I've had this cuff for months now, it's a nice bracelet but the &#34;leather&#34; is a plasticky coating that covers an inner thin leather? of some sort. Understandable for the price, but not a deal!
1.0	Do not waste your money, this was the biggest waste of money. They fell apart right out of the package I was sad because they were a gift and at least I checked them out before giving them to the person.
1.0	"These bracelets are pieces of junk.<br />Cons:<br />They took TWO MONTHS to ship, and they were only from Tokyo. Really?<br />They arrived a MONTH LATE.<br />There wasn't any tracking on this package.<br />They LOOK FAKE.<br />The metal is cheap, tarnished, and I could effortlessly snap it.<br />The \\""birthstone\\"" gem is a cheap piece of plastic carelessly glued in.<br /><br />Pros:<br />cheap. you get what you pay for."
1.0	This is very cheaply made. Also, it sits crooked and leans. This seems to be a theme with these products. I tried fixing it myself and bending it back into position to make the center post straight but it is still off and looks junky. I'm afraid if I try bending it too much it will break off the parts. It does the job and holds jewelry but if I had known it was going to look so crappy I would not have purchased it. If the manufacturer would slow down even a few extra seconds and put a bit of care into what they are doing it could be a decent jewelry rack. &#34;Made in China&#34; so what did I expect for the price?
1.0	The product would have been acceptable if it wasn't so small as to be barely visible. I know amethyst is very cheap as gemstones go, so why be so cheesy? I would never recommend this to anyone.
1.0	Very cheaply made, not worth the money. The gold was very brittle and seems as though you could just snap it in two. Don't waste your money, it is cuter in the pictures then it is in real life.
1.0	At first, I reviewed this at a higher star level; however, after wearing the item, I have to rate it lower as the metal, whatever it is, turns very easily.  Agree with other reviewer, your wrist will be coated green after wear with this right where the eye sits on the skin.<br />It's cute, just not great quality.
1.0	Only one of the four came in the size I wanted and the other two where to small. And they were not even 30mm. One was 28mm and the other three I don't  know but we're too small.
1.0	would not recommend these earrings .hate it, not worth the money do not waste your time looking at it my opinion.
1.0	Not at all like the picture ordered - will not 're order
1.0	Very poor quality.  Purchased for my wife's diamond pendant and it broke after only 1 week.
1.0	fades after a while . bought it gold, my ring has now turned silver .
1.0	These bracelets weren't even close to the size they said they were. Very disappointed.
1.0	I liked the ring but  after wearing it for a few weeks stones fell out . So I wasn't to happy about it
1.0	broke when wearing the first time and charm was lost.  waste of money.
1.0	I purchased this item based on its appearance on this site. I must say i was misled by how it looked as it was stated as being 3.1mm thick but in reality its much smaller than that. what a total waste of my time and money as i have a gucci link that is 3.4mm thick and look twice the size of this chain...would only recommend this chain for a little child.
1.0	"Okay I bought this as a little gift for my baby cousin (She's 10) and the ring literally broke in two days, with these \\""Emeralds\\"" falling out of their scotch tape glue. The ring's shine that it advertises in the picture is also another fallacy, it looks like all of the emeralds had sun damage, than the shine they're supposed to have."
1.0	Flimsy material, unwieldly, just overall low quality product; lower than expected. I guess you get what you pay for. I actually bought this precisely because it had good reviews: sometimes it feels that either people are bs'ing their reviews or the sellers create amazon accounts to write good reviews of their products on purpose. It's a pattern that I have suspected with some other purchases I've made on amazon with bad products but good reviews; can't really trust reviews on here any more.
1.0	it bent as I tried to put it one. It bends as easily as a metal brad found on yellow mailing envelops. Don't waste your money on this one.
1.0	Doesn't fit in my ear...
1.0	Can't review yet. Product delivered in UK and I'm in Australia. I will shorty be in the UK
1.0	I gave this a 1 because it is a awful necklace. not only is it cheap but it looks it also. no denying it. don't have a clue where the pretty pictures come from.
1.0	Very small and looked like crap.  Im just greatful i didnt spend alot of money on it besides a few dollars.  This is for women who are petite or small figure.  Not a full figured woman or plus size
1.0	I knew I was expecting a small stone given the 11mm x 9 mm --- however I wasnt expecting it to be cut in half!!!! and not evenly cleaning I might add...the cut side had chips missing from it - and I feel very dissatisfied with the purchase of this stone - and all the excitement about this stone is now gone.
1.0	Garbage - broke within a day of receipt
1.0	Fell apart first try to use.
1.0	Broke off upon taking it out of package! Sad as it looked pretty and it does not pay to go through the hassle of returning it! THE WORST AND PLEASE DO NOT BUY!!
1.0	It was a very pretty piece of jewelry, exactly what I wanted.. But during the first day I wore it.. It fell off on its own and to me this sounds like it's made poorly. :(
1.0	Terrible.  Does not hold onto ear no matter what you do.
1.0	Size is very very tiny and almost can not be seen in the ear but that is my own fault for not reading measurements (just didn't expect to be as teenie tiny as it is) Oh Well
1.0	The stone appears to look cloudy
1.0	This product doesn't even deserve 1 star. I think people should know that it breaks easily and really fast and not worth the 11.00 dollars I paid for it. The company even dismissed my request for a return. Very disappointing product.
1.0	Don't waste your time... stone fall out fast.
1.0	Great item with looks but looks are deceiving. Broke before i even put it on ugh, im too upset. Dont buy! Wish someone wrote a review for me!
1.0	I should have purchased these in plain silver. When the gold begins to turn it looks so cheap. And it will begin to turn after wearing it maybe twice. Not even keeping them dry. I was so dissapointed.
1.0	This product it's a joke! They are selling it as a nose stud but is a regular earring. How they think the earring it's going to hold inside the nose without a ball on the other side???
1.0	The bottom ball broke before I wore it. Not satisfied at all never even got the chance to enjoy the product
1.0	They are cheap, because they are huge, and look very cheap!  The color is pretty. But I can't think of anything else to say that would be kind.
1.0	Beautiful bracelet, but wrong inscription.  I ordered this item for my mother, and the inscription that was on it was more suitable for a spouse or significant other...  I will be returning this, and was VERY disappointed!
1.0	This arrived with a total of 9 pieces broken off of the necklace. Looks cheap!
1.0	Crap!  Don't waste your money!  It has a weird smell and changed color.
1.0	I thought this necklace was such a good deal.<br />The color surrounding the MOM is hideous and stained.<br />Completely not worth the price they have, especially if it was not discounted.
1.0	This is a beautiful ring but the stone fell out within 6 months of having it & the silver is light weight. Buyer beware!
1.0	The photo and description are very misleading. The overall length must refer to the wires alone, because the geode's are no more than 1/4 inch across. They're too tiny to recognize for what they are without a lens. For this size they are way overpriced.  I certainly won't buy Spyglass Designs products again!
1.0	The incorrect product was shipped to me.  There wasn't a packing slip inside the package, so I have no idea if the item that was delivered to me was supposed to go to someone else.  I was quite surprised to open the package (which didn't feel right as the bracelet was supposed to come in a gift box) and find a leather watch band!  Unfortunately, the bracelet was to be a gift and though given the opportunity, I did not have the time to re-order.<br /><br />Amazon was excellent with crediting my account for the purchase price!
1.0	My youngest son is 12 and was so excited to buy his sick Mother this for Christmas. IT BROKE my heart when he saw what he worked so hard to save for. His reaction was SHEER DISAPPOINTMENT to the point of sadness. He said this &#34;is not like the picture and is so small, I thought it was bigger&#34;. I went into my car and bought a new Christmas gift. This is a man made stone so they really could have represented this better. I KNOW that pictures do not show true size in jewelry. But I have to admit, I am also mvery disappointed, it is  tiny .
1.0	It does not clearly state that there is only one. I had to read quite a bit before i found where it stated there was only one. I will be returning it.
1.0	item looks diffrent than advertised, but its not worth the return postage. so its just a waste of time and money.
1.0	These are HORRIBLE.  If i could give them zero stars i would.  I was ecstatic to order them.  I am getting married in Hawaii soon and the color of these reminded me of the ocean water.  I thought they would be beautiful.  These earrings are ridiculous.  One was dark Navy Blue and the other was straight up black.  They came without any jackets at all.  They look like black diamond stud earrings.  Disappointing to say the least.  I can understand some arguing that the monitor colors vary on some computers, but i have checked home computer, work computer, and cell phone screens and would have ordered these earrings off any of them.  What they sent me was straight up not these.  And to not even have the jackets?  Another reviewer said this as well so how does the same mistake keep happening when it says right on the baggy these were shipped in that they have jackets?
1.0	The Charm is perfect but the chain really sucked
1.0	The gem fell off after first day of wear.  They are very pretty stones but not durable at all. Beware.
1.0	This is not a sterling silver ring.  I have had it for 7months & the &#34;sterling&#34; has worn completely off.
1.0	I loved this ring when it came. Unfortunately, after two days, the stone fell out! I always take my jewelry off at home, so the ring got 10 hours of usage, for two days, in an office environment. All I do is sit at a computer all day. I put it on the third day, and as I was getting dressed, it fell right out. It popped back into the setting easy enough, and..... then fell right out again. :( Very disappointing!
1.0	I am very disappointed with my purchase. The earring Broke in half at the tail when putting it on. Refund Please.
1.0	They were broken when they arrived and they were two different colors. One was a bright light pink and the other was a foggy pink. I got a refund.
1.0	I opened the package and was admiring how cute it was and the heart was broken and dosent snap bake together.  I am not sure i will buy from here for the prince I guess you get what you pay for.
1.0	How come a $250 router doesn't have drivers for Windows 8 or MAC ???<br />Well, I don't know why,  but this device doesn't work as a router on Windos 8 and Mac...<br />Refund requested...
1.0	The photo of these earrings is very misleading as the actual item is much smaller than shown. If it were possible I would want to return/exchange them.
1.0	Junk!! After an hour wearing this piece, three gems had already fallen out, and after three days, the ring connecting cross to slide broke off. Very disappointed even considering the low price point of the item. It didn't even last a full week.
1.0	The underside of ring had dried glue showing. The size runs smaller than regular. The ring itself is very plastic.
1.0	The bracelet itself is cute.....but, it arrived with the clasp broken.  I decided not to return it because it came from China it would have cost too much to send back... :'(
1.0	I got what I paid for.  I spent a $.01 and received a $.01 worth of product.  The little beads fell off almost instantly.
1.0	I ordered two sets of the tiny 925 4 mm ball studs. When the package arrived, I received two gift boxes - one with a pair of earrings and the other box was empty! Called Amazon customer service - she was NOT able to replace the missing pair but could only offer a refund :(  The other pair was as described, but I am none too pleased with this seller since they are unable to correct errors. Would think twice about ordering from them again.
1.0	When the ring arrived, I was very disappointed.  The stone is a very light blue - more like regular topaz than London blue topaz.  This was my first purchase of a rhodium ring and it will be my last - it looks and feels cheap.  And to top it off, the ring was missing one of the side stones (and the seller doesn't provide a return shipping label so returning it is an inconvenience, not to mention I have to pay to return a damaged product). I've purchased other sterling silver gemstone rings on Amazon for around this same price and they were much better quality, so I don't think my expectations were unrealistic.  I am VERY unhappy with this purchase and will not be purchasing more Peora products in the future.
1.0	Worst purchase I have ever made in my life. So this was a saying I used to say all the time to my Girl Friend who I cared very much about. The necklace was going to be a little thing to remind her how much she means to me. Well the week after I gave her the necklace she decides to dump me...on my birthday. It was very random and out of nowhere and honestly destroyed me.<br /><br />Tl;DR Girl Friend dumped me on my birthday after giving her this necklace.
1.0	These are not 18 gauge. They are closer to 16 gauge or in between the two sizes. The threads are rough. This may not be an issue for some, but it is for my sensitive piercing.
1.0	This was huge. I think it's made for giants.
1.0	I ordered ths for my belly button, which is 14 gauge, and this is the same gauge as an earring post. And it is black, not silver. And it comes with two. So, essentially it is not at all like the description. ) :
1.0	diamonds do not shine or sparkle not a good by , i most defiantly  would not order this product again
1.0	poor quality diamond not like the picture been shown here!
1.0	I should've known better than to buy this online. If you are looking for a dainty necklace, its a little larger than expected but not huge/chunky.
1.0	The necklace was not in the box. There was an unopened bubble wrap wrapper...but nothing inside.<br />This was a birthday gift for my daughter-in-law.....<br />Could you please ask wherever it was shipped from to resend the necklace?<br />I live in Washington State and this was sent to Texas.<br /> I have done a lot of ordering from Amazon and this is the first time that this has happened..<br />Please reply to let me know the outcome.<br />Alice J. Relaford<br />jrsgone@yahoo.com
1.0	It was nice , they just shipped the wrong ring sizs.
1.0	these earrings are ok if you're going salsa dancing on a wild night out in the town but they are huge and i say thing owning a wide face I don't know where i will ever wear them but i kept them b/c i was too lazy to return them, also received wrong item due to miscommunication with seller
1.0	In my opinion, this item is not a good value ad is not of good quality.  After opening the package and inspecting the item, it was decided that it needed to be returned at once.
1.0	Bought three other Bracelets from K Mega, two of which I loved! This one was definitely the worst. Too flimsy and light on first inspection, it broke the second time I wore it. Stay away from this one...
1.0	These are much bigger than I expected and so heavy that they hang down a bit instead of laying flat on the ear. I left one in for only a few minutes and my ear started to tingle so I am not sure this is actually titanium (perhaps I am just more sensitive than some).<br /><br />Also,  while I am sure they are nice people,  I received a letter that discussed their commitment to excellence and included a plea for a five star review because they are experiencing a bankruptcy.  It went on to say things are very tough right now and he or she can only sleep for five hours each night because the worry. This is very unprofessional.<br /><br />I will be returning these and requesting a refund.
1.0	Was very poorly constructed.  Pic is just a piece of paper epoxied onto the necklace.  I returned it because it looked so cheap
1.0	This is at best a child's trinket. The metal is very thin aluminum, the thickness of a soda pop can. The front has a lacquered-on photo of sunflower. The back of the aluminum was partially discolored with some corrosion. There is no silver plating  I asked for a refund and the vendor did refund the purchase price but not the $8.00 shipping and handling.
1.0	Within the first day of receiving this ring, the stones started falling out! I bought 3 different colors and each one had stones falling out!  HIGHLY DISAPPOINTED!!!!! If I could give a zero star rating I would.
1.0	"To a least have no milky cast to the gemstone,,, but found it to be dull with a glue-like affect on the stone surface.  The \\""diamonds\\"" were dull and cloudy.  The size I ordered was too small (a half size, special order)  RETURNED."
1.0	I ordered this bead assuming (bad idea) that it would be the tradition red and black combination that are &#34;ladybugs&#34;<br />Wrong!!! It's orange! and not just a little on the orange side, it's bright orange!<br />Not what I was hoping for a all!<br />In fact I didn't even give it to the person I intended it for it's still sitting in the deep dark depths of my unclaimed gift draw.<br />I am just waiting to find someone who likes orange and it all theirs!
1.0	the end of the bullets come off they are to easy to loose
1.0	I didn't receive the correct earrings they weren't &#34;BOSS&#34; they said &#34;DOPE&#34;
1.0	It was the ugliest stone that I have even seen. Would not recommend this stone to anyone that is looking for a nice pendent to ware.
1.0	By looking at this ring, you would think it would be of better quality than it was.  It was thin and the stones on the top were rough.  It looked like it was something you would get out of a bubble gum machine.  I was going to return it, but instead gave it to my 12 year old granddaughter who liked it.  So if you are an adult and intend on buying it for yourself.......don't.
1.0	Gross, turned my belly button blue and broke in the first month of owning it :p
1.0	arrived with 5 missing crystals - not well made
1.0	poor quality. it snapped in half almost immediately
1.0	Bead is not durable. Parts of crystal falling off. Other two crystal beads I have have not done that. Would like a refund or new bead.
1.0	They look gorgeous in the pics. Arrived after some weeks from China. They are big, poorly made. One of the earrings miss a bead, and the metal has some big dark spots. The beads are made of cheap plastic...a piece of garbage. Very dissapointed.
1.0	I did buy this ring few months ago and few days after the stone  fell out. two weeks after that, it turned black.  I took it to a jewelry and they told me that it was   not real silver. that is fantasy.    so dont buy this ring. or maybe you want it to give it   to your 5 years daughter to play with dolls.
1.0	I think this mala smells very bad and is exactly like the one I bought from a US manufacturer for half the price and was delivered in 1/8th the time (though they both smell horrible).
1.0	looks cheap do not buy
1.0	Pros: Was delivered far ahead of the expected date (about 2-3 weeks ahead of schedule)<br /><br />Cons: VERY cheaply made (most of the springs don't even work, some of the springs don't move all the way, the flat piece at the end of the prong snapped off after being handled for ~30 seconds<br />Duplicate colors<br /><br />These are basically unusable. The springs have so much friction that they either won't open or they won't stay closed if you manage to open them. On a few of them, the piece with the spring came out of the entire ring (so basically it broke in two). It's not even worth putting them back in. Some of them are bent oddly, not even in the shape of circles.
1.0	I can not get the clip open easily.
1.0	As a previous reviewer stated, they must have changed suppliers.   The stones were basically colorless.  Great size, but pretty much clear with a hint of purple.   They had a tag that said that they were made in China.
1.0	did not like this necklace at all. The chain made it look incredibly cheap and tacky. I bought it for new years eve and did not wear it.
1.0	Got these for my boyfriend and I, opened the package and went to put his on for him and the half heart broke right off of the chain. Well I should say it broke off of the hook that attached it to the chain. They are really cheap (well the black one at least) and not worth the money.
1.0	I want my money back.
1.0	These are really just hard plastic and too expensive for the quality. NOT LEATHER OR EVEN LEATHER IMITATION!!!!<br />Not what you expect!!
1.0	It is too hard and too stiff to roll over the wrist. I wonder what they though while using such hard material to make a wrist band.<br />Totally unsatisfied, very bad quality.
1.0	This ring was damaged on receipt. The stones started falling out after 2 months. After several months of wear, a cheap base metal is showing through. Beyond disappointed; this item is not what it was advertised as.
1.0	The earrings in the picture was not what I received<br />Was very disappointed.
1.0	Bracelet does not stay closed. I can' t wear it.
1.0	Didn't like it at all. But after all it was cheap !!!!
1.0	I hate the feeling of putting money down to the drain. I even doubt it made of sterling silver, because it is rather light.
1.0	The bracelet is nice, I gave it to my wife for Christmas. She opens the box, and the bracelet was broken, not cool! Thank goodness for the easy Amazon return policy.
1.0	"It came in standard amazon book box, plastic wrapping.  It is shiney gold plated with stone implanted and, on the inside, a couple of bolts and it is brushed.  It is plenty large for a womens bracelet.  It isn't too bad.  I think that it is extremely overpriced.  I give it a \\""C~\\"" and do not recommend it."
1.0	Not happy they arrived broken!!!
1.0	SOOOOOO SMALL!! These are the tiniest little pendants ever. They look like the size of a pencil eraser. Maybe the size of your pinkie nail!
1.0	I didn't have the bracelet 24 hours before the band fell apart. Was impressed when I opened the package but as the cords fell out of their fitting I was instantly struck with buyers remorse especially since I cannot repair it.
1.0	Small and not worth the money
1.0	I ended up sending this ring back it wasn't as shiny as I thought it would be I was disappointed!
1.0	"I purchased this necklace for my niece based on the reviews listed on Amazon.  Don't know what these people received, but the product I received was ALL PLASTIC and discolored.  If I received this as a bridesmaids gift, I would be insulted and hurt.  If I saw this item in a store, I would have passed it over. It was NOT prettier than the picture on Amazon.  This product belongs in the Dollar store.  I feel cheated.<br /><br />Also, the Product description lists Metal as the material and Austrian Crystal.  Doe's not tell you that the body and beaded chain are plastic and the only \\""Metal\\"" is the backing for the so called \\""Austrian\\"" crystal.  I rate this as \\""POS\\"".<br /><br />There are over 18  4 star plus reviews for this necklace and only 3 bad reviews. Trust the people who rated this product as Bad.  I think maybe most of the good reviews came from Creative Ventures?"
1.0	Wish it had been a little larger.
1.0	this thing is HUGE, way too big
1.0	I will never shop with this company again!  I never received my order, but was charged for the purchase.  When I made several complaints, I was never given a credit either.  I made about 5 online complaints, and never received a response from any of them.  I am thoroughly disgusted at the lack of customer service from this company and would advise anyone to buy their products somewhere else before purchasing from this store.  RIP OFF!
1.0	Bracelet is awesome. However, just a few days after I ordered this item my credit card number was stolen and used. Not a trustworthy manufactuer .
1.0	I was not pleased with this product. It was difficult to tie together to keep<br />It on and the charms fell off of it. Not worth purchasing
1.0	The chain broke within 3 days!
1.0	I should of been suspicious of the quality when I looked at the price. I didn't even get it on good and the peacock came off the very first time I tried to wear it. Please Please don't be a victim.Not worth sending it back the postage cost more than the bangle. What a waste.....
1.0	Guys that's not silver or gold!!!! The price is pretty good for just a piece of metal, and the golden stuff wears out litwrally the first rime you wear it!
1.0	I bought an identical &#34;looking&#34; ring from QVC several years ago.  I bought this as a back-up.  The setting is terrible it catches on clothing; something my QVC ring never did.  Unfortunately ring no longer available at QVC.  Pass this one up, its not for every day wear.
1.0	pretty, but doesn't feel like quality
1.0	The anklet broke the week I received it. The wire came out first then the beads fell off. Waste of money
1.0	cheap cheap cheap flimsy garbage.  The picture looks a little on the cheap side, but when I got them in the mail...WHOAH.. they look even worse in person...  plus half of mine arrived bent.  they were not well packaged at all.  When I notified the seller, rather than immediately offer a refund, or exchange (like mist sellers on amazon) I got a response that had overtones of distrust, and they asked for photos etc.  I am not about to bother with all that for some stupid flimsy rings, so I guess they win this round.  But hopefully my review here and on their page will dissuade others from making the mistake I did.  ALso, just so you know, I decided to put on one of the rings that wasn't smashed, and by the end of the day it had tarnished and turned my toe completely green.  Better spend your money on something higher quality.
1.0	pissed off, i hate ordering from these far off places like sodial, nothing ever comes fast enough, bad quality metal, dont buy, falls apart. gems off kilter.
1.0	The ABSOLUTE WORST EVER!!! I received one earring blue in color and the other earring red in color. And you're calling this a matching pair? Lord God, give me a break! Never again!!!
1.0	It stinks and was too loose!
1.0	the writing is so small that there is no way you can read it, which makes this necklace useless
1.0	It came three days late and it was bent and broken when it got here, one of the stones had fallen out in the package, not happy
1.0	Nice piece, but never stops &#34;bleeding.&#34; Have it already couple of years
1.0	alright at first i thought they where faking about the money but when i got it  i know now that it is fake gold and a fake Crystal i don't want to buy this item never again also i do not recommend it .
1.0	Very very wide ring. Won't be even able to bend your finger.
1.0	i had this less than a week and the color came off. on the second week the heart sticker came completley off and that left ruff edges so i had to take it out.
1.0	Broke just trying to put it on.Poorly made.Stay away!!
1.0	I received this bracelet on Monday July 29th as I had to have it sent to a friend in New York who sent it on to me since this supplier does not ship to Canada. After much expectation I wore it on Tuesday July 30th 2013 and on the Wednesday the 31st my wrist had gone green and the plating was already off the bracelet. Needless to say the bracelet is now in the garbage as it will have cost more for my friend in New York to send it to me and for me to send it back to be bothered trying to recoup my loss. I am soooooooo disappointed as I had an Anne Klein lions face watch years ago and miss it a lot. So I thought this would be the next best thing since I cannot find one of the watches.do not waste your money
1.0	broke the first day I wore them! extremely thin. the bead fell off immediately!
1.0	Order this maybe 2 months ago and never gotten it. I just ordered it due to the dollar price - seemed like it was just a decent quick cheap buy. Oh well. No money really lost anyway
1.0	This was a very cheap piece of so-called jewelry. I was very disappointed !! It is plastic stones & chain also feels like plastic ! I was ripped off... I could have gotten this at wall-, probably better too.
1.0	The little ball that keeps the backing on the loop of the heart had snapped off in transit, they look nice though so I reordered, I'll update my review then
1.0	The item was already broken when I received it.  The knob was cracked and unusable .  The overall quality is not as advertized....HEAVY DUTY...NOT!  Cheaply made.  I waited fairly long for the delivery and didn't want the hassle of returning it so I super glued the knob and was able to use it for one watch.  I doubt it will last much longer.  My advice is to look for a jewler's quality unit.  Thats what I am doing now.  I'm sure it will cost more but it won't be as frustrating
1.0	Does NOT fit official Pandora charm bracelets as advertised.<br /><br />See picture for as far as the charm will go.
1.0	I received it broken and wasn't what I expected.
1.0	I bought these earring back to replace original ones now lost. Unfortunately, they tend to slip right off after a couple of uses and so are not at all reliable.
1.0	i dont even remember receiving this smh. what a waste i was better off keeping my money in my pocket
1.0	Other then the unexspected quanity, product was as exspected. I had ordered in what i thought was bulk ordering when i ordered four orders of the bio flex. I was unaware that i would receive only one piece of jewelry per order. For a total of four pieces of jewlery.  From what i understood by the image shown i would receive more then one per package. Otherwise I wouldnt have ordered them on line, at that price, for just one piece of jewelry. I could have saved the time and money by going to the local tattoo place and got more for the same price. I feel I was frauded well over charged for what I received.
1.0	save your money. looks super cheap and has horrible shape, totally ruined Christmas. so bummed. wish I had never seen this.
1.0	Irregularly shaped.  Poor quality.  Do not waste your money.
1.0	started turning my finger colors
1.0	The paint job was poor, the necklace chain fell apart within a week, and it's overall unpleasant to wear.  I think they could have done better.
1.0	Pretty earrings, but were a graduation gift for my daughter and they broke the first time she tried putting them on. The back post snapped off w/o no pressure placed on it at all. Poor quality. Glad they were Amazon so I can return them easily, but will look for another pair for her.
1.0	Not worth the product it was made on...It's nothing like this picture very cheap cheap cheap...I had to get my money back plus it broke...
1.0	not good at all with in a week the chain was a next color  i will ask people dont buy it ...
1.0	Disappointed with the necklace! Had to return it...
1.0	I purchased the entire offer of the 3 types of length in both silver and gold. I wore the longest silver chain for 4 days and it turned dark gray then it turned green. Same for the longest gold chain. Will not buy from this company again. Don't make the same mistake.
1.0	looks and feels super cheap
1.0	I thought they were very cheap looking and obviously of not too good a quality, because one broke within a week of wearing them and I lost it.!!! Not a very good item for you to be selling at all
1.0	I relied on other reviews and that was my mistake. One of the reviews here mentioned &#34;the diamonds sparkle as if they were water on the body of the dolphins as they leap from the ocean&#34;.<br /><br />Nothing could be further from the truth!! I also strongly suspect that it was a paid review. You see more and more of those on various sites, so you can't simply rely on reviews anymore.<br /><br />I knew the diamonds would be small, and that's what my fiancé wanted. But these are so small you can't even see them with a jeweler's loupe. Let alone that they &#34;sparkle&#34;. Add that the fact that the gold and silver looked rough.  Altogether, pretty disappointing and my worsts Amazon purchase ever. (I've been an Amazon customer for about 12 years now)<br /><br />I did propose (and she did say yes!) but we returned this ring in a hurry. Got another ring (also here on Amazon), with a dolphin as well. All white gold, beautiful little diamonds in dolphin's eye, tail and partway around the band. About the same price, but a world of difference.(that was Amazon item number B008Y8H3LE)
1.0	This product did come early that is why it got one star but it broke the minute i tried to adjust as well as it was hard to adjust i doubt i will be buying anything from this supplier again
1.0	Not much to say about these beads. Simply not pleased! Funny chemical smell and turned after 1 day of wearing. I'm a nurse so I constantly wash my hands so my jewelery tends to get wet. After working one shift the beads began to turn in color! Ugh dont buy!!!!
1.0	These are terribly small.  They may be large enough for a young child but not an adult.  The photo is highly deceptive.
1.0	The beads are not purple as shown, but a pale greyish-lavender--nothing I would in my remotest dreams call &#34;Purple.&#34;  Also the beads are scratched as if they have been used before, or run over by a car!  Very poor product. I do like freshwater pearls and have ordered lots of them, but these are a disappointment.  I wonder if they are painted rather than dyed, which would explain why the scratches show so much.<br />I bought these to wear with a purple-print blouse but the color doesn't go with it.
1.0	The earrings were two different sizes! Will be returning.
1.0	I sent them back because they weren't worth the money to me or my girl friend.
1.0	Not sure what other metal is mixed in these earrings but I get severe irritation every time I wore them.
1.0	I bought this to wear with my necklace but it doesn't fit through the clasp.  The magnify glass was no use
1.0	They are nothing like I expected ...They look cheap and home made
1.0	I was so disappointed, I guess you get what you pay for though. The rings are extremely thin, mine came with missing stones...requested a new one said they would email the return shopping labels never got them...complete waste of money
1.0	The item I received was not only damaged but it was the wrong item I ordered a Turquoise peacock necklace and I received a red peacock necklace and upon opening the package inside the package with the necklace and two of the jewels have already fallen out before I received it And laying in the bag
1.0	not attractive at all. poor quality in manufacturing both safety catches are not working. this whole situation is saddening.
1.0	In only two weeks the color came off.  Cute for a while
1.0	My product came broken. Gems had fallen off in the baggy before I even got it.
1.0	first time I tried it on already broken.
1.0	couldn't get it in my nose =(
1.0	This was a 10 month anniversary present for my girlfriend. She loved it so I loved it. but not for long but she wouldn't tell me. It was a bit on the small side, also after wearing it for about 2 months the coloring wore off. So basically she had a copper ring it was a nice present for her but if you wanna get your girl something cheap and nice dont get her this..
1.0	Quality wasnt very good. Price was a liitle to high for what was given.
1.0	I got this and it looks like it's not new at all, the rubberband looks like its been stretched out before, and when taking it off your head, it pinch or pull your hair. Ouch!
1.0	Bought these in August. It's now September and THEY STILL HAVENT SHOWN UP. I've had enough time to develope slack in my ears to size up so by the time these actually do make it to my house I'd be able to move up to my next size. WASTE OF MONEY
1.0	Bigger than expected; looks fake; & stone a very dark green. Not real jade color.
1.0	The necklace took weeks to arrive and when it did, it was broken. It looks like something I could have made in elementary school.
1.0	These earrings are very pretty, but the chain part is glued onto the earring's base.  The chain part fell off the second time I wore them.
1.0	THE EARRINGS DONT LOOK LIKE THEY ARE NOT WORTH IT.  THEY DON'T LAY CORRECTLY ON THE EAR AND ARE WAY TO HEAVEY AT THEIR SIZE.<br /><br />I MIGHT BE ABLE TO GIVE THEM AWAY BUT I DOUBT IT
1.0	Cannot buy without size of owl included in description.
1.0	Ordered a garnet & a tanzanite for nieces for Christmas, as these were their birthstones.... Unfortunately, I got 2 garnets instead and did not realize until right before Christmas.  They were not nearly as nice as the picture seems to show.  I thought I was getting a good deal, but there is no way these are the regular price listed.  This discounted price of $20 I paid is probably about right given the quality.  Also, they came in very tiny boxes.  I was expecting a hinged necklace box.  Probably should not have assumed this, but the description said jewelry box included.  So, I was expected something better than I receive, especially since this was a gift item.
1.0	would not fit my fingers
1.0	Its beautiful, however as soon as I put it on, the whole thing broke...its not latched on tight so it wont close. ..dont waste your money
1.0	Didn't fit my dermal.<br />Threads were off and lopsided.
1.0	I'm sending these back. The stone is thinner than pictured and they came broken. Don't waste your money or time.
1.0	It came with a bubble in one of the stones and within a week it fell out!! I am very disappointed and will never buy from jewelsdirect again.
1.0	this thing has no clasp..none . .so once it is fitted to your arm (using pins - a virtually impossible task) it CANNOT be removed.  This has to be the most dangerous piece of jewelry ever devised for anyone whose wrists come into contact with moving objects
1.0	This is the second time I ordered these....save your money, buy the better ones and spend a few extra bucks.  These disintegrated after a couple months.  Poor quality.
1.0	This chain is crap! The links are not linked straight therefore some overlap. The worst part of all the chain is un even. Ruined the whole idea of a classy chain.
1.0	IT TURNED BLACK IN A MATTER OF 2 MONTHS.  I DID TAKE A SHOWER WITH IT BECAUSE I JUST COULD NOT KEEP TAKING IT OFF.  BUT I WOULD NOT PURCHASE
1.0	I ordered this, loved the style and genuine look but the first time I wore it out to dinner, I lost a stone.....sent it back...
1.0	These are really cheap. They broke almost immediately. They are advertised for Earrings for cartilage, Nose and lips. I would not recommend them for anything.
1.0	Beware of buying jewelry from Chandni they do not honor their return policy if you spend thousands of dollars on an item such as this you would hope that they would try and make you happy and help you with returns.  Not the case, they lie to you until you get the item and then won't let you return it.  They steal your money.
1.0	The Earrings do not look at all like the picture. The rhinestones are so small you are unable to even see them.They were late on delivery time I was first promised. I had purchased them for my eight year old granddaughter but decided against it. Would return but came in envelope from Japan or China.
1.0	it is very very very small like for kids .. it was not same the sites<br />i hope return this item
1.0	The ring is in such bad quality that it wouldn't squeeze flat, got caught on my sweater and disappeared. I had it for about a day. The company would not issue a refund because I didn't have the ring, I feel like they should've taken the hit but now I won't shop from them.
1.0	Big different than photo  It's look very nice in photo  But in real very small!!!  You need microscope to see it
1.0	I was excited because immediately to the eye this necklace is beautiful. However i went to tie it on my neck for my first use and it completely fell apart from the straps. I wont lie this is a pretty necklace but its not secure enough to stay together
1.0	Horrible clasp, fell off and that was the end of that. Just have one now and I don't go for the pirate look. Not worth it, for the price get something that had a decent clasp where they put some thought into it.
1.0	Don't buy this item. The key brakes up.
1.0	Returning this, it's not worth the price. The &#34;pearls&#34; are smaller than pictured and not like real freshwater black pearls at all, plus one rhinestone is missing. I could get better at &#34;Cl**re's teen jewelry store.  Very disappointing. Also, there was no &#34;free gift box&#34; with the order, just a small plastic bag.
1.0	I really wanted to write a positive review about the &#34;Diamond Cross Pendant-Necklace&#34;.  Well the necklace was delivered on time and was packaged very well.  The pendant is very pretty and the chain was nice as well.  After a week of wearing the necklace it began to tarnish and turn a dark grey.  I removed the necklace I before I showered so, i'm surprised the shiny necklace turned a dark grey so soon.  I am no longer able to wear it.  Again, the pendant is very nice, i just need to replace the necklace.
1.0	I LOVED this desgin and was so excited to put it on- but the first time I placed it on my finger it broke!... it is made very cheaply.
1.0	These were broke when I opened them. Was not very happy with the way this purchase turned out.
1.0	This ring is NOT white gold plated, it turned my finger green!
1.0	I got this for my daughter and she didn't even get to wear it. She went to put it on, and it immediately broke. such a horrible thing. the design was beautiful and she was excited aboit it. never got to weat it. qont buy anything else from this company.
1.0	I was specting a better quality. It is really thin and looks cheap. It is very different than how it looks on the page. I am returning it.
1.0	I order a 9 size ring and I recieve a 6, I won't pay something that I didn't order. I am not satisfied with the product!
1.0	It was a gift. We both really liked it until it broke the first week we got it. My fiancee wasn't doing anything out of the ordinary or strenuous. It just did not seem to be very well made. Wish it lasted a little bit longer....
1.0	one of the diamonds fell out ....very disappointed with this product,  gonna return it
1.0	Its 1  earring not a pair of earringS!!!!!! Just beware before you buy! Very disappointed!. Tittle is misleading and should be changed immediately
1.0	I don't know how anyone gets the small piece back into the rest of the hoop when you put it into you ear!!! Nice try but NO CIGAR!
1.0	I love the boho look of this watch, but they are cheaply made.  I ordered two different colors.  One came broken, which I was refunded for, but the second one didn't ship with the first (even though I ordered them at the same time), and was not sent until I inquired about it.  And I only got to wear it one time before the snap broke off.  You get what you pay for, I guess.
1.0	The ring does not look like the one I wanted.  I'M DONE HURT AND DISAPOINTED
1.0	It went from &#34;gold&#34; to mix with silver. It turned my neck black and the chain went black. Mad I lost my money with this item when I could've went to a local jeweler and come out with something better.
1.0	way too big when I received it, the product looks so much smaller online.. wish I could get my money back
1.0	The metal part that goes into the hole in your ear is very very sharp, so it hurt to put in, and really hurt it you missed the hole a bit.  Not sure why it isn't like normal earrings!
1.0	I've had this necklace since July and it has already started to peel & tarnish. Should a $50 so called &#34;sterling&#34; silver piece of jewelry already be tarnishing? After contacting the seller, they refused to let me return the item since their 30 refund policy has passed. Very unhappy with the manufacturer & definitely would NOT recommend purchasing anything from them. If the pendant had started tarnishing within their &#34;30 return time&#34; I would have returned it then but it just started to be defective after 90 days. I only wore this necklace about 8 times & never wore it in the shower or to bed. Very unhappy!!! The pendant is cute though.
1.0	Cheap, in more ways than one, I did not pay much for them and they are worth even less, save your money
1.0	Cheap very cheap looking don't but them
1.0	Terrible earrings. Backs wouldn't release, so the earring broke when attempting to take it out of my daughters ear. They also hurt her ears because of the cheap quality metal.
1.0	This item is not what I expected.<br />The edges are jagged and discolored! The plastic is sharp you can probably cut yourself.
1.0	Very cheaply made. You get what you pay for :/
1.0	As I was opening the package, beads began to fall out because they broke off of the bracelet.. I didn't even get the chance to look at it before it started to self destruct.
1.0	It's probably my piercing but I couldnt even get this in my piercing it was very small. If your nose piercing is closer to the edge of your nose and more away from the area your nose meets the face this works but if its in the middle of the nostril, dont bother
1.0	This was a total waste of money. The pendant started losing its color in a week's time.
1.0	Tarnished ,poorly fit unable to use,very unsatisfied
1.0	The necklace sucked. Doesnt give you an option for the leangh and it was way to small. Looks alot better in the picture. Dont be fooled.
1.0	Even when you turn it around, it retains its ugliness.  The color is grating.  It looks like something from a quarter gumball machine -- the kind they have on the way out of the grocery store.  I can see it now -- a 3 year old little girl turning the handle and then having this come out of it --? She would run screaming.  Poor little girl.
1.0	It broke after I wore it a few times. It snapped about in the middle (this is after the back fell off one day and I had to use a regular back from then on out) then I put it aside to fix. It managed to snap several more times. The head fell off, and the fins too. And it literally split in half. Not too happy with it.
1.0	Nice color but everyday wear will cause the color to chip.
1.0	Turned yellowish within a few months..... Silver you can always shine up. It does seem to me that my wifes white gold stays white. Must be just this ring.
1.0	the item was broke when i got it.. the metal was broke and the tail could not stay in the body.
1.0	I bought this necklace along with the matching bracelet.  Both arrived with some turtles missing their shells.  They are just glued on.  I have no idea if the shells popped off during shipping or if they were shipped that way.  They were packed ok, so who knows.
1.0	The look of the ring is exactly as it appear here on amazon. The stones and the band are very pretty and my wife loved it. The reason i say to stay away is that even before it came out of the box one of the stones had fallen out. I realize that for the price i am not buying quality which wasn't the point anyhow, but a candy necklace can at least last an afternoon. There are many rings on amazon with in $5 of this that are much better and with the same visual appeal
1.0	horrible product!!!!! it broke as soon as I put it on my neck!!!!!
1.0	Broke the first time I wore it. Bummed!!! Very thin. :(
1.0	This barrette actually looks like a $4 barrette from Walmart. I paid $14 for it.  It is shiny and looks cheap.<br />The name 1928 Jewelry indicates it will have an antique finish. It does not. The first day I used it I noticed the clasp was weak and I don't expect this to last long. I ordered two barrettes from this company as gifts and have never seen them but am now wondering if they look as cheap as this one. If so, I am embarrassed and unhappy that I was led to believe that they are quality products. They must photograph them in the best possible way to make them look better than they are. If I could give no stars, I would so I will give one so at least other people will see this review.
1.0	Didn't wrap around the Ear,  the post did not have a stoper, it would not stay on.  Not happy at all
1.0	I didn't like this necklace. It was difficult to discern that it was a tree of any kind. It was a gift for my daughter and she said she &#34;liked it&#34;. Not a glowing review.
1.0	Hollow back that's not pictured.<br />Seems cheap when you see the back.<br />Chain came with knots in it. I still need to get one out.<br />Box it came in was broken.<br />Go to a local jewelry store and you will be better off from it.<br />I thought I was grabbing a bargain here and that's just not the case.
1.0	Pretty, but mine fell apart the day after I got it!!  :(
1.0	"Bracelet has a nice weight. I would have given this 4 or 5 stars had it not been for the fact that online, the crystals look emerald green and translucent. The bracelet I received has \\""crystals\\"" (I swear it looks like plastic) that look like the color of a yellowish/greenish highlighter marker and are opaque. I am def sending this back. It would have been nice if it had the emerald crystals, as depicted in the picture. The bracelet I have looks plain cheap. I wish I knew how to post a picture on here of the bracelet that I received!"
1.0	broke immediately. looked nothing like picture. what a disappointment I was looking forward to this purchase then it broke right away
1.0	Very disappointed they were like run over by a truck and smashed they were ordered for Christmas last year threw them away.Not happy
1.0	Cheap and broke within a week. Cute though!
1.0	As far as how the producted looked on me I give it a 5 star rating but when I wore it for a certain amount of time my chest began to change color. I'm taking a strong guess and say the quality of the metal wasn't too good and I have to honestly give this a low rate. Any body jewelry product should not change the color of your skin
1.0	Absolutely horrendous.  Bulky and fell out of my ear when I tried to wear them due to their hortible proportion.
1.0	I receive the ring and two of the small diamonds were missing. Waste of money when you can buy in store for same price and comes with warranty.
5.0	Totally worth it for the 4 knights, especially at the current $8 price.  We bought a second one, so now we have armies.  It would be nice if it wasn't all boys... girls can be knights too.
5.0	This plane is really neat.  The coloring is great and the size is great to really enjoy it.  The nose blade moves and our kids love it.
5.0	We have quite a setup in the garage and this adds a great feature to the river and pond, mountain and forest that is part of the play area for the kids.  Well built and gets plenty of attention from the kids so was worth the money.  Playmobil did a good job with their products.
5.0	My 4 year old loves this!
5.0	My five year old LOVES his bug necklace.  Good quality, yet inexpensive.  I'm very happy with the purchase and would buy more.
5.0	Very cute and my 17-month old grandson loved it. The tools fall out of the belt easily, though they throw them around anyways so it really doesn't matter. And I'm sure he'll play with them the next time he visits.
5.0	I was very pleased with the high quality of the pieces and the box it came in.  Most of the newer games are made on the cheap, this one definitely isn't.  My granddaughters are new to Cootie and they had a great time with lots of laugh.  I was happy with the short time I had to wait for delivery.  Thank you Amazon.  Darlene
5.0	My 1 1/2 yr old niece loved them so did I
5.0	Purchased for 4 year old boy.  He was delighted and can't wait to go on a scavenger hunt.  Light and magnifier work nicely.  Good grade plastic.
5.0	Super fun once you get the hang of it. Might be hard for Boomer generation and young kids. Gotta be hip to social media.
5.0	Mini towel arrived earlier than expected and in perfect condition. Purchased from BuyJapan this is an authentic quality towel just as in the pictures.<br />Has the official Approved by Studio Ghibli sticker as well.<br />Overall a beautiful towel, definitely recommended to get whole collection of 1-12!
5.0	Really goes up to 75 feet in rage! But you have to pull the thingy intill you see a green thing and then let go!
5.0	My 5 year old loves it.  I got it because of all the great reviews, but didn't expect him to be as interested as he is.  Its been 2 weeks since Christmas and he still plays with it at least once a day.  Well built, solid construction, should last a long time.  I fully expect to get the upgrade sets for birthday/Easter gifts.
5.0	This will go along with the bug vacuum that goes along with the safari jacket.  I think that this will complement the whole outfit and other instruments.
5.0	Its a beautiful ornament.
5.0	I bought a Badger Air Brush no knowing that the fitting for the brush was to small to fit the 1/8 hose from my &#34;Model TC-20T, High Performance Airbrush Compressor with Tank&#34;. I bought this and an &#34; Grex AD19 Universal Quick Connect Plug for Badger Airbrush &#34; also found on Amazon Prime, for my compressor. They both fit together with no air leaks even though this is made from IWATA and the Plug is made from GREX. Which means that this Iwata Disconnect is truly UNIVERAL!!! I love this little thing the disconnect allows me to switch between my badger and my iwata brush flawlessly. If your on the fence about this product, dont be, it works and does the trick.
5.0	my grandson( 10 years old) loved it!
5.0	Gift, did not see it.
5.0	Hmm let's see these are yellow and there balloons not much to say about them. The delivery was fast and product was just like the picture.
5.0	The usual high quality Littlest Pet Shop with which both daughters have grown-up. Always imaginative and detailed toys and always hours of fun.
5.0	"Ravensburger is a company that makes wonderful puzzles and \\""thinking\\"" toys. This mandala project plays on the idea of creating art in an outside setting from natural materials. My professional artist daughter-in-law creates beautiful projects with flower petals/leaves. This item provides a stencil/template where the young child can trace patterns then color them in with the colored chalks (included). It's a wonderful way to get the young child involved in positive outdoor art that the whole neighborhood can enjoy."
5.0	The blocks made by Melissa & Doug are of high qulity and are what I expected in size. They are a joy to play with and my grand kids like them also.
5.0	This cap is made very well !! My son thinks it's cool and likes wearing it. Nice &#34;Italian Style&#34; looking cap !!
5.0	My Floridian Grandson was going up north to see snow for the first time and I thought it would be cute for him to take the snowman maker, although you can use things from home of course.  I think it was a great fun idea and gave him more excitement on the upcoming trip.
5.0	"I bought these trucks to help decorate a food table for a construction themed first birthday party for my son.  He loves trucks, so this was a great theme because I could buy decorations that would become great toys later.  These trucks are not huge, but for the price they are a good size.  They are adorable and attractive.  They are not super heavy, which may mean that they aren't super-durable, but I like that they are light-weight so my little guy can throw them around and not smoosh his little \\""piggies\\"" (toes). The excavator is a little hard to maneuver, especially for my little guy, but at this point he just pushes it along the ground.  He doesn't try to move the dirt-picky-up part yet.  I'm hoping that it will loosen up a bit as it gets used.<br /><br />For the party, I cut up some cake and served it to him in the back of the dump truck and I made the excavator look like it was digging in some pudding cups on the food table.  Overall, a great toy.  We will be having a lot of fun with these in the dirt this summer. I just hope he doesn't try to eat the dirt from the back of the dump truck now!"
5.0	Loved the Play-Doh. Colors were playful and fun
5.0	[[VIDEOID:fab1567b5e369d65617af2019e0777d9]] My son loves this tank.  It was packaged nicely and it is easy to put together.  It comes in 2 pieces, the tank itself and the gun.  You just slide the gun into its slot and it is ready to go.  It is very durable, my son threw it all around our kitchen and it is still in great shape, no worse for the wear. This is a great toy for a young boy, he will love to play Army or War with this at his side.<br />I was provided a sample for free to review and and share my unbiased opinion, I am not affiliated with this company or compensated in any way. I am just a regular Amazon customer who shops a lot on Amazon and enjoys sharing my experiences with others so that they can make an informative buying decision.
5.0	I am very impressed with this bookshelf and it is even cuter than I thought it would be.  It is very well made and the colors are rich. It was very easy to put together.  Definitely a nice piece of furniture and it looks adorable in my son's room.<br />As far as a paint smell that some people have mentioned...I have a very sensitive nose and I only noticed the slightest of smells. My husband didn't notice anything.  Just to be safe, we let it air out for a day before putting it in our son's room. You will not be disappointed with this bookshelf! And by the way, my little boy (2 years) loves it as well.
5.0	Great item. Finish and construction are top notch.
5.0	Great way to announce you're a Browncoat at work, and a good way to introduce other future Browncoats to the 'Verse.  Everyone loves Legos, but non-fans won't recognize the model (some even thought it flew with the engine as the front.)  Nicely detailed, cleverly designed.  Long ago I wanted to be a Lego Master Builder, but I see now that I lacked the imagination and resourcefulness that went into this kit.
5.0	Happy! Sango and Kirara look amazing!
5.0	Is was just as I thought!! What you see is what you get!!!
5.0	This was my first experience with the Jellycat company and it most certainly won't be my last.  This is a wonderful rabbit.  I plan to give a Jellycat friend as a gift at every Baby Shower from henceforth to the end of time.  Suitable for All Ages.  He is a real darling and the pictures on amazon do not give this guy justice.<br /><br />I have had both small children, teenagers, and even adults inquire about where I found such a wonderful toy. He captures whimsy and fun in every age.
5.0	Bought this for my 9 month old girl, she absolutely loves it. The button is easy for baby to tough, the remote is the right weight to hold, lots of button, music, sounds. It is also very durable. One of the best buy for $9.99
5.0	Purchased this product for an elderly friend, who cannot have pets in the home.  He loved it!
5.0	The only odd thing about this item is that it comes with an E11 blaster rifle, and not a Gaffi Stick.  Odd choice of weapon for a Tusken Raider, but my daughter loves it none the less.  :)
5.0	Kids enjoy playing with it.
5.0	He was so happy and loves pushing it around with all the people in it and I really like that I can upgrade it to remote control when he is ready
5.0	Nephew absolutely loves this costume... it was the highlight of Christmas!  I think he plans to wear it for Halloween, if it lasts that long - he wears it nearly every day.  :)
5.0	My son absolutely loved the Llama Llama plush & it was just the right size for him. I wasn't to sure when I purchased if it would be big enough but it was.
5.0	Pretty tough, finally got it by trial & error.
5.0	I wear them all the time.  I wear a men's size 9 or a woman's size 11 and the for perfect.  Warm too.
5.0	my two boys love this toy.
5.0	This is much cheaper than the one from walmart and works perfectly. We've been using it daily for about a month with no problems.
5.0	How do they do it? The package arrived so quickly I couldn't believe it.  I emailed about a problem with one of the wands, and received a personal response within minutes. Problem solved. The wands are adorable and so reasonably priced that they make wonderful party favors. My  3 year old grandson loves them and we both give FlashingBlinkyLights 10 stars.
5.0	This toy is bigger than you'd think, and quite durable in my experience. It was by far my son's favorite Christmas present this last year. He was only 18 months or so at the time, and he just loved it. He chainsawed furniture, family members, and everything else as if he were training for a zombie apocalypse. It's great!
5.0	This was a birthday gift and she loved it. Totally different from anything I have seen in the store which is good when the child you are buying it for already has everything Monster High.
5.0	This set is from Star Wars the Clone Wars. But the R2-D2 is the same from the movie sets. I find that weird. This set comes with Anakin, R2-D2, blue lightsaber, and the ship. It launches missiles too. This is a must have for people that collect the Clone Wars legos.
5.0	As a mom of a very creative little girl I had to find her something that didn't ruin her clothes or my carpet ;) Moon Dough is awesome! We have so much of it and it provides hours of fun. My daughter and I are constantly molding mixing and creating stuff with it. It never dries out and if it gets into my carpet I just wait a bit then scrub it with a this cleaning brush and it vacuums right up. No staining.
5.0	Huge amount of cars for the price!! My grandson loved them & had plenty to share!!Bought with a city mat that folds to a box that held all these cars!!
5.0	She is beautiful.  I love everything about her.
5.0	So cute! I bought this for my son who loves to build things. He loved punching these out of the wooden sheets and putting it all together. He has now taken it apart and redone many time changing it up each time. I hope to see more of these sets.
5.0	So much fun - well constructed.
5.0	Exactly the same toy from the San Diego Seaworld my wife regretted not getting when we were there. The whale is big (belies the 38 inches it claims to be) but very cute. Great service from Seaworld and Amazon in having the same price as at the park and excellent packaging/delivery.
5.0	Wow, this one is my first drift car, and is very powerful, you can do long drifts and have a lot of fun, it seen like a real car, and you can feel the power of the car.
5.0	My friends and I have a weekly game night and were looking for new ones after someone brought in &#34;Ticket To Ride&#34; (another great game). I bought this based only on the fact that there are pirates and stealing booty involved. I set it up and went through it at home and wasn't sure how much they would get into it. I didn't realize how much &#34;screw-over&#34; potential there was in this game! Everyone loved it and it goes surprisingly fast. Part of our regular game rotation now. Highly recommended!
5.0	My children love the Melissa and Doug products! All of them help my kids learn and they have such fun with the products!
5.0	This was ordered for my daughter, a collector of a lot of statues & anime and she absolutely LOVES it!<br />I definitely recommend it for any collector!!
5.0	Box shows some age but item is still in the box and in good condition. Looks more like Qui-Gon Jinn from the side than face on but was good quality for price.
5.0	Stompeez are the cutest house slippers!<br />My 5 year old was so excited and he loves them he wears them more than I thought he would!  Great price! Amazon ROCKS!!
5.0	They arrived really early and I will be ordering again soon.
5.0	Sleep with it every nite. I am 11 yrs. old.
5.0	Love the toy, but the package was completely open when I received it.  It was bad for a warehouse deal much less brand new. I had to search for pieces in the bottom of the shipping box and the packaging box wasn't even taped together.  I also ordered the Ultra Red Ranger Zord Vehicle as a Warehouse Deal and the package was at least taped together and much better than this one. Definitely NOT &#34;New&#34;.  Luckily this is for a child and he doesn't care about the box anyway.  If it was for a collector, it would not be acceptable.  I see Amazon has flagged this item to research it's condition and it's not available right now through them.  Evidently other people have complained about the condition it was received in as well.  I give it 5 stars anyway because it will be fine for my needs.  Just wanted to give others a heads up.
5.0	My 2-year old loves it and so do we! Great toy.
5.0	I have to be honest and say that I wasn't expecting much when I ordered these as a Christmas gift for my wife. They turned out to be very delicate things of surprisingly good quality. My wife put them on and wore them all morning with no problems at all, and they looked great. Was very pleased.
5.0	I really like that sheet of Lucy. Looks very nice. Now with the album.
5.0	This game has a very simple mechanic to it that neverhteless lends itself to having to take risks with your strategy in order to come out of top. Being in the back of the line helps often, and playing to your character's traits as early as possible so that you can move on to other plans works very well in up to 3 player matches. Above 3 players diversity seems to be forced upon players but by strategically aiming for specific themes one can come out on top since 4-5 player matches provide fewer points for all involved. I would recommend this game as optimum with 3-4 players. Once you learn the mechanics gameplay can go as quickly as 15 minutes but on average you'll probably spend about 25 per round once everyone is up to scratch.
5.0	Grandson loves it so if he is happy then so am I.
5.0	Bought these stickers to use as rewards for my daughter and as party favors for her last birthday. The kids love them!
5.0	My daughter loved it!  Specially for the price.
5.0	this is a good rc car and exactly what i was looking for. Drives very well on smooth surfaces and asphalt. The turning ratio is also good and the remote is very responsive.
5.0	Very cute.  My gran daughter loved them.  Perfect with her dollhouse family.
5.0	Don't abuse the handle and it will last forever.  It's only plastic but it works well.  We use it for the double deck that comes with sequence.
5.0	My kids and I all loved it!  It was very interesting to actually watch the change from caterpillar to butterfly.  The butterflies even let us handle them and my kids, aged 1, 3, 5, and 6, thought it was very neat.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone!
5.0	The product is fantastic the deliver was a nightmare
5.0	I got this as a birthday present from the young man's wish list.  He liked it very much, and already has others in the collection.
5.0	I gave it to our Son and he loved it
5.0	Bought as a Valentines Day gift and she loved it.
5.0	I purchased this backpack for my daughter to tote all her lalaloopsy minis in along with their little pieces. It was better then I expected when it arrived. I love how its a thick material and the outer edge is pretty solid. It is perfect for what I purchased it for. It arrived very fast and my daughter is going to love this with her new mini playsets for christmas.
5.0	I ordered this for my 2 granddaughters, and the two FROZEN sister dolls to go with it. The girls LOVE it! Mission accomplished! Lol!
5.0	I strongly recommend this product. My daughter loved it!!! Plus not only looks big, it IS big!!<br />I loved it
5.0	Came quick fixed prblem
5.0	This is a complete set of magic tricks with neat props.  It is a great kit to jump start the interests of a young magician.
5.0	Exactly what my 8 yr old grandson wanted
5.0	These were a huge success with our Vacation Bible School students as we acted out the plagues of Moses. They sounded very realistic.
5.0	We bought this for our 24 month old son as an Easter gift. I absolutely love it.  Comes with everything I need.  Paints are VERY washable.  The smock it super cute.  I am very pleased with it, as is my son.
5.0	Love this! My son's favorite pillow.
5.0	I have NEVER been so surprised by a set of cards in my life. Every game is fresh. Every hand is fun and the best part is you can add your own rules!
5.0	This is the 3rd one i've purchased. this latest one was a gift, the other 2 were for me.<br />Very durable i must have crashed it a hundred times racing around the yard.<br />i eventually destroyed the frame on first one and bought another (saving the first one for spare parts)<br /><br />PROS<br />-durable<br />-good battery life (15 min doing tricks)<br />-extra props in the box<br />-can change the sensitivity of the controls to fly slower (in the house)<br /><br />CONS<br />-needs to sometimes be reset (re bound to the controller) unplug turn controller off back on and replug the battery in.<br />-one sheet flyer manual in the box (if you go online there is a full manual) full manual has instructions on re-bind to controller and the various flying / gyro modes that you can put it in<br />http://www.dromida.com/air/dide01xx-ominus/manuals.html<br />-USB charger (if your computer goes to sleep it probably wont charge) i charge mine off a hub plugged into a wall outlet
5.0	My son loves this thing... Awesome buy!
5.0	This is so adorable and you almost think it is real.  I bought this for my grandaughter and she really liked it.
5.0	My 6 year old received this toy as a gift and loved it.  The best surprise, though, was that her 13 month old sister loves to play along too.  There aren't too many toys that allow for this type of interaction between kids of differing ages. So much fun to watch them listen to the prompts and move around the house together!
5.0	A little expensive. Bought it for my daughter because she wanted it so bad! She never plays with it!
5.0	We LOVE this game! My 2yr old especially loves to play &#34;Hoot Owl Hoot Owl&#34; and always requests it. Able to play with kids 2-7 and keep them entertained. Becomes even more challenging with the 2yr old ONLY wants to go to purple. :) Fun little cooperative game that doesn't take too long to play.
5.0	I bought this backpack for my 5 year old grand-daughter and she loves it. It is sparkly and very cute.
5.0	I bought this item for my son, from &#34;The Easter Bunny&#34; this year. He is obsessed with this new show and he is going to LOVE this. I think it is pretty reasonable as well!
5.0	Much better charger than expected - BIG BANG FOR THE BUCK!! Field charging all my RC planes with this and it's quick and strong.
5.0	Discs are the best Nerf projectile yet.  Why did it take them 30 years to think of it?  I always loves the foam ball shooters when I was little.  The foam arrows were okay, but too fragile.  I've always hated the Nerf darts.  This gun holds a ton of discs and shoots them pretty far.  Nerf seems to be backing away from the discs though, and releasing nothing but dart shooters this year, which makes me sad.  I hope they don't phase them out completely.
5.0	This is a great toy for all ages.  My 10 year old and my 2 year old are on these everyday!!!  Very durable and loads of fun!
5.0	Pretty easy to put together and sturdy.  I was impressed with the quality especially for the price.  My son loves it!
5.0	I purchased this for my husband for christmas and he loved it!  Its probably from about 1998 and he thought it was a nice little stocking stuffer.
5.0	Kids love it! Easy to hang in our tree. Over all, good buy!
5.0	I gave this as a Christmas gift to some friends who &#34;have everything&#34;.  Well, they didn't have Martini The Game, and they loved it!  I played it with them and we had SO much fun!
5.0	The cards arrived on time and date. I already have one so I order 2 more for my wind deck. I recommend this card to anyone using a wind deck like Dragunity, Harpies, Mist Valley and others. What I like about this card is it give all wind monster 500 Atk boost.
5.0	I ordered many of these little Hot Wheels and I have liked them all. The only thing is if you are looking for the larger scale hot wheel monster trucks these are the size of a kiwi with wheels :) They worked great for stocking stuffers! Thank you!
5.0	That's it.  She loved it.  Good quality, great size and plush tot he feel.  Great Christmas gift.  Will buy again.
5.0	arrived quickly satisfied customer
5.0	I use these sticks for my DJ'ing.  I have a video I play that is like a simon says game and kids love it.  The sticks are amazingly bright.  They also last forever.  My kids like to light them up and put the, in the shower with the lights out like the Toy Story short video of the glow stick party in the tub.  Three days later they still glow in the shower.  You can't go wrong with these sticks.
5.0	Cute mat for a girl. I like it because although the heart shapes come out like the number mats do, its less annoying to put back in, and if your child takes out the pieces very easy to put back in. I actually connected this mat with the pink/ brown number mat for a play area for my daughter.
5.0	A hit with my niece's children. Better than straight block sets. Consider buying a couple, so the kids have more to build with.
5.0	This puzzle was fun to do.  The large format pieces made it easy to handle.  A beautiful puzzle.  Thank you.
5.0	My kids love it. Their friends love them. And because they are so cheap, we can buy several for when friends come over and it still costs the same as one name brand one.  Found out that our local Goodwill sells these as well for $5.  This is a great loom set and deal.  My daughter connects several of them together to make all sorts of stuff. Really nice product.
5.0	My little one loves to watch the lights and hear the music before bedtime when the lights are out. Great buy!
5.0	It was very nice quality and not heavy.  My grandson loves it for his little city.  I am going to purchase 2 more for the other cities.
5.0	Easy to build. My son loved it.
5.0	He puts his cheek on the doll's cheek, then slobbers him a kiss.  And then flings him across the room.  But it's a start on bringing out his nurturing side.  (His 2-yr-old cousin would run to get his dolly to rock when Daddy rocked the new baby brother.)
5.0	It was a Christmas gift and they really enjoyed it. They have played with it a lot and are loving the challenge.
5.0	My husband bought this item for our 2 year old whom loves to play in our 15 x 36 Intex swimming pool. Our daughter wasn't sure about letting go of the side of pool or letting go of my neck for that matter whenever we were in the pool, that is until we bought the Swim School Deluxe Tot Trainer.  After a few swims in the pool she now really enjoys being in the pool, she even floats herself around the pool holding her feet up!  Spectacular product.  Do keep in mind that you must supervisor your children when in any kind of pool, but this is a wonderful item and I highly recommend it to anyone looking to get your little gal or guy to feel comfortable in the pool!
5.0	My grandchildren loved the art kits I got them for Christmas. It kept them busy for hours and they were so proud of there artwork when finished.
5.0	Love my tiny Tardis!!! It's sits proudly on my desk at work and is coveted daily!
5.0	4 year old grandson LOVES playing in his VW camper tent!  His uncle restores old buses and this just adds to grandson's fun.<br />Prompt delivery and perfect condition.  Cool item.
5.0	I'm looking for a new hobbie to do, so i thought lego's would be a good thing for me. I CAME A CROSS THIS ROBOT, AND THOUGHT IT MIGHT JUST BE A GOOD THING FOR MYSELF, I AM an adult women, but i get bored very easily and thought this toy might just keep me entertained.
5.0	Perfectly classic board game!
5.0	Bought this for my minecraft mad sons 7th Birthday. He thinks it is epic. It arrived very quickly, is very well made and made a little boy very happy
5.0	All my daughter wanted for her 4th birthday was a &#34;stuffed little piggy&#34;. This one does NOT disappoint. She has loved it from day one. Its small enough for her hold and carry around and it is not obnoxious. Its a good size for her cuddle with at night. Super soft and totally worth the price.
5.0	This was such a fun puzzle to do! I highly recommend this puzzle for anyone who loves to do puzzles.
5.0	"I am a big fan of all Settlers and the expansion, Cities and Knights, so I was very excited to play this game.  But just as a warning it is very difficult to learn at first.  They have a website, however, that will teach you how to play the game step-by-step.   <br />  <br />It is a great twist on the Settlers games (for those of you who play often - like us). You gain resources and ingredients by moving toward a \\""goal\\"" spot you have chosen or by acheiving adventures.  Your player has specific abilities such as charisma and agility giving you the ability to fight off bears or save fellow knights.     <br />  <br />Another big bonus is that, unlike the other Settlers games, you can play this one with just two players.  It really is a fantastic game."
5.0	"In the past I have attempted to play with various RC planes, helicopters etc. A pattern quickly emerged. Buy some stuff, spent time assembling it only to crash if after few minutes flight and then having pieces in a drawer for months after.<br /><br />The Ladybird is really a superstable great little quad and my first model in one piece after several days of learning to fly it<br /><br />It is not hard to fly as long as you learn that in case of emergency emminent DO NOT try to steer, instead release all sticks and throttle slightly up. It will stay stable<br /><br />If you fly it on grass with plenty room around it does not easily break. I have flown it indoor a couple of times but much more risky until I get better<br /><br />Flight time is only ~7 minutes so I recommend an additional battery (supplied charger can handle two batteries simultaniously)<br /><br />This is not just a toy but a fully featured quadrocoper with 6DOF Gyro, and it can fly really fast if you want to. There is supposedly a \\""crazy mode\\"" on the remote that will allow it to do rolls around its axis, turn upside down etc. but that requires more guts/practice than I have currently :-)<br /><br />Given its very small size you need to keep it pretty close though to see what is up & down/forward & backward<br /><br />Overall this is great fun and super cool"
5.0	i love this card. is an excelllent item and i use it in my deck to b powerfull and heavy.
5.0	the only thing i was a little discouraged by was that in being a grandma buying for my grandson, i thought by the way the description read that there was more than one inthe bag.  he did like the figurine
5.0	Bought it for my students Stellar Achievers Party and it was well received!
5.0	My girls 6 & 8 love these. Too bad they stopped making them. Wish we had bought more, they are great toys for the car.
5.0	This is a great little copter as long as there is no wind because it is very light.  Seems almost indestructible.  It is easier to do flips than with the Hubsan X4 and it is more stable with hovering.  It also vibrates less than the x4 when descending from high altitude so it's a shame it doesn't come with an HD camera. The controls are slightly slower - it doesn't react instantly like the X4 and continues on its path a second longer than the X4 so you have to be careful when flying around trees.  Very quick.  I am going to mount an 808 keychain HD camera on it next week to see if the video quality is better than the x4.<br /><br />UPDATE:  $27 for the 816A, $7 for a keychain camera.  Taped the camera to the quad and for $34 I have an almost indestructible quad taking videos.  The video quality is poor and I won't post it to facebook or youtube.  But it's a lot of fun.  Check out my review of the 808 keychain camera to show you how you can get it to work. Buy the x4 with HD camera if you are serious about getting some good video.
5.0	Love this Beast Hunters Riplacw.  Makes a cool drone figure builder set
5.0	I gave this journal to my grand daughter, and she absolutely loves it. The voice recogmition software is impressive in this age of iPhones and iPads.
5.0	We had so much fun with these noses!! they fit very well from ages 2 to 62. Even my lil dog kept it on long enough for a picture.
5.0	Great set!  My daughter loved this!  She was especially excited about the glow in the dark bands that were included in this set.  I still can't believe I was able to get all of this for as little as they cost!
5.0	We bought this for my son's 4th birthday and both of my boys (ages 4 and 7) enjoyed playing this game.  They like the gross out factor of the items in the head. It's a great game for young kids as it doesn't take long to play.  With my boys, I have a problem with sore losers so this game is perfect as you don't have to have a winner or a loser.  You can all just take turns finding the objects and if you do, you're all winners.
5.0	Gonzo looked adorable. He was one of my favorite Muppets. I was originally gonna get him along with Fozzie and Kermit 'cause I thought much about Muppets Wizard of Oz and thought I would have one of them in my hands. I didn't know what he was dressed in till I saw a picture. He was in his Superhero outfit. I mostly liked Gonzo from Muppet Christmas Carol. I now have 4 pook a looz. I also have Mickey, Minnie, & Buzz. (I was considered of getting another one for my sister for christmas. She has Donald and Pluto) It was Flutterific that got me into buying some on this website. I also have the Grumpy keychain Pook a looz.
5.0	would recommend, very detailed, good quality,hours of fun<br />my son loves it and anything Thomas and friends related.<br />Thank You
5.0	Love this outfit alot. It is great to because it has everything you need.  It reminds me of Summer so much. Like the style alot.
5.0	very good microscope set for the price, did all I needed to do,
5.0	My son, age 9, rates this as 5 stars because it is awesome.  He loves the 3 choices of sounds. These are basically cardboard cards 8f varying thicknesses which make different sounds as they flip against the wheel spokes.  (Old fashioned baseball cards)
5.0	Awesome product. Provides many hours of joy!
5.0	I was a bit skeptical about this purchase.  I didn't find it worth it with other nerf purchases but after researching it and physically seeing I bought it.  I doubt it could go 75 ft unless u modify the nerf 'arrows'. However, to pull back properly u do have to use a proper bow hold and shoot.  This product proves to be durable And fun which is definitely an upgrade from my previous dealings with nerf.  What's better is that the same quality extended to the whole rebelle line.  I bought our littlest the mini rebelle nerf shooters and the middle one the crossbow which is great. Bravo nerf on this line.
5.0	"...though I will not use it to cut pizza. It's too showey. I do agree with another reviewer that the design is such that there may be a safety risk as there is no finger guard like on typical cutters. Love it for the \\""WOW, that's cool!\\"" factor."
5.0	If you have a dinosaur lover on hand this by far is one of the best toys to get! My 21 Month old chases us around the house with it
5.0	My Grandsons love this toy they go out and play with it all the time. It helps with eye hand cordination. My grandsons the 2years old and 4 years old both play with it.
5.0	"We play the game a different way than the instructions state and doubled the fun! Instead of playing till someone wins by getting 3 sets of properties, we play till the stack of 'draw cards' runs out. Then everything is added up just like in regular monopoly.... money + property = grand total. The person with the most grand total is the winner. I don't understand why this isn't the actual way to play/win the game. The instructions, as stated in the game, for winning was kind of strange. When played that way, we all felt \\""short changed\\""... even the person who won felt they really didn't \\""win\\"". Try playing this other way i discribed. It's more like the original monopoly and more realistic as to who the winner of the game really is.  My 19 yr old loves this game as well as my 8 yr old. This is a great family game. My kids ask to play it every evening. When played according to the way I described, the game lasts about 30-40 minutes, at least twice as long as if played according to the instructions. The extra time is worth it though.... very fun."
5.0	I was going to unpack it, then thought it might be a collectors item eventually. Good quality and would recommend
5.0	My daughter loved this dress for halloween,she dressed as Rapunzel.  Loved that the dress wasnt a cheaply made generic 'disney princess' dress, it was unique and beautiful.  She wears it as a dress up dress now. Very pretty.
5.0	I bought the Fionna doll for my friend, and we both think she is precious. her hair is super soft, and my friend and I both love her clothes. Her backpack sits a little funny, but it isn't a big deal. overall she is a very sweet doll.
5.0	The owl is very beautiful. Very cute. I love it.<br />Except that the packaging was smacking the owl down. and after taking it out of the package, the feathers were a lil run down and the eyes part were not able to see.<br />The item was great, but if the packaging was better, the owl would have looked better.
5.0	She was adorable and just exactly the right size for my 2 year old grandchild.  Little dolls that are only little dolls are hard to find.
5.0	My daughters are into making these charm bracelets and they come out very cute to say the least.  Anything to keep them happy I say!
5.0	I hope that I get it I love it I make Shows So this will make it better boom hay
5.0	I bought these for two little girls who went absolutely bonkers for them. The &#34;First Builders&#34; series of Mega Blocks are actually much more light weight and pliable in comparison to Mega Blocks for older children. It's not a design flaw; it's intended to just be safer for a younger audience. The pieces interlock really nicely, and pull apart without any frustration for little hands.
5.0	Great set of shocks.....look so good on my truck and let me tell you after you run with these you will kick yourself for not buying them sooner I know I did.  fit great on my honcho
5.0	Fluffy and cute my girlfriend loved it
5.0	A perfect addition to my son's &#34;thank you for coming&#34; gift bags.  The sticks were bigger than I thought, but the kids loved them...I do feel bad for their parents though! :)
5.0	My 5 yr daughter loves this doctor set!
5.0	"DC Direct has done some amazing things over the years, and they are known for their innovation in the making of their statues. The new Ultimate Showdown line is another certain hit for the company, and it brings a few old ideas together in a new way. For starters the new sexagonal bases allow the other statues in the same series to interact together in numerous ways, whether it be with the paired enemies of the set, or with different pieces from other of the sets in the series. Secondly, the heads swivel, allowing for further customization of the posing. Lastly, using the same processes that they used in the DC Dynamics pieces, there are plastic pieces which mimic the powers, like Sinestro's yellow fear fire, or Green Lantern's emerald blasts. Really, you're getting two statues for one price here, since there are actually two pieces in each set. They both stand over 7\\"" tall, and the sculpts are fantastic with vibrant paint jobs. Other sets include Superman and Bizarro and Batman and the Joker, with more sure to come as these limited edition pieces sell out. They look amazing on my display, and the picture on this site or the box just does not do them 'justice'. Though a bit pricey, they are worth every penny, and I don't think you'll be disappointed if you add these to your collection.<br /><br />  Thanks so much for your time folks.<br />  Sincerely, R.A. McDowell"
5.0	My son loves this. The sounds are pretty good quality. I love that it comes with two figures. If your kid is a fan of the movie, this would make a great Christmas gift.
5.0	this is for my  daughters baby shower  here in Sydney, it has a wizard of oz theme and these are so perfect<br /> thanks<br /><br />kim-gai wright<br /><br />[...]
5.0	My grandson really likes it and plays with it a lot. I enjoy playing with him with it I am so glad I chose this one.
5.0	My wife and I purchased a Ziggle for our grandson (who will turn three in May) and gave it to him at Christmas...he rides it in the basement of his home and has become very proficient at operating it...his look of accomplishment is precious.  We then bought one for our (tiny) grand niece, who turned seven in March...she too loves riding it.  I wish you made one for adults...I'm so envious of the two &#34;little ones&#34; having so much fun and getting good exercise as well.  Whomever came up with the idea needs to get a raise.
5.0	looks so much like Alice , perfect buy
5.0	Perfect for my son just keeping up with all the different Thomas products in HO scale...fast shipping
5.0	As I indicated previously, White Mountain Puzzles are great fun to work on.  They come well-packaged and they make you smile as you work to put them together.
5.0	Thank nice will buy again later
5.0	Fine, I'll do it myself.
5.0	I was very pleased with this product. It a very accurate representation of the color displayed on the site. Also, it is very difficult to find similar item in a retail store Finally, cam when it was estimated
5.0	These are new in box as advertised. I like the realistic faces and the descriptions of each president on the back. It's always good to have a reminder of our nation's founders. I pull these out for decoration on July Fourth week now. I bought the first two sets of the series. Both high quality.
5.0	Just got my ghostbuster 2 holiday pack, WOW! This is an awesome set with great detail and slimer!! If you are a true GB fan you NEED this set. Mattel does great work, well worth the price!
5.0	Balloons  worked well making shapes and animals. The lead time on delivery was significant. Fortunately we did not need right away.
5.0	My daughter LOVES her shopping cart. One of her favorite toys.
5.0	I swear, my 1 year old can recognize this book by the binding, among 50+ other books on the shelf. I am so tired of reading it, so I do try to read him other books. But really, this is the ONE. He gets so mad if I try to read anything else. He points up to the shelf and yells for his monster book! It is an absolutely adorable book, really. My son is too cute when we are reading it together. =) He loves turning the page and feeling all the different textures. The pages open differently than most books, and it's really like the monsters are playing peek-a-boo with him. He is absolutely crazy over this book! I am off now to search for something similar, but that will add just a little more variety to our bedtime routine. Really though, I am so glad that he is excited about reading at night. I definitely recommend!
5.0	These balloons were perfect for the baby shower decorations where I used them! Colorful and bright, not a single one leaked or exploded as they were blown up with helium. Excellent quality! I found the price to be really low for what I received. Thanks!
5.0	A wonderful Christmas gift idea for friends and family, these Story cubes will provide hours of entertainment. My Mom was able to put them to good use the very next day with friends and they loved it!
5.0	I am a big fan of the zombie genre, and I also enjoy a good game, and this combines the two for hours of fun!
5.0	Grandson's favorite Christmas toy.  He thinks it goes with book
5.0	These DC Unlimited Warcraft action figures have amazing detail to them. The paint is applied perfectly and the small details really can not be appreciated until you get this thing in your hands. This is one of my favorite interpretations of Sylvanas. I have purchased other action figures from this franchise and all of them came with the same level of quality.
5.0	I absolutely love this game. The gavel it comes with must be one of the coolest feature I have ever seen in any game. It really would be a great game for a family and/or friends you don't have to be a political nerd in order to enjoy it. It is a great way to switch things up at game night.
5.0	great little box and arrived very fast.  perfect gift for my niece! she will love the music and putting her jewelry in it!<br />\
5.0	Great item, packaged and shipped on time<br />Good Value
5.0	this made a great gift.  lots of fun for children and adults.  great for releasing tension, try it if you haven't
5.0	I have let my baby play with this just yet but i am loving how early this item came to me. I will definitely be ordering from this company again
5.0	I love this little puzzle in a portable tin! It's great to have on hand in a purse or overnight bag for my 4-yr-old. Not too many pieces, just enough. Also good to bring to a restaurant or on the plane.
5.0	It was a gift for my 10 year old Grandson and he loved it.  Easily put together and it's a part of history.
5.0	Excellent sturdy material and the design is just too cute! The hat has a little band that tucks under the chin to hold the hat on and basically disappears, so you can tip it sideways, forward, or back, which ever way you want it. I'll definitely be buying a lot more from here.
5.0	i am a collector of Yu-Gi-Oh cards and these were great. it has helped to build my collection and i intend to buy more
5.0	Great wagon instruction is no help at all there only storage under one seat the seats are wide i love that
5.0	Great price ! & fast shipping ! My daughter loves it
5.0	These have to be the best quality stickers I have ever come across.  I never thought I would write about the feel or the quality of the sticker.  This comes with tons of stickers.  Little sticker people, and fashions to go along with each little person.  My kid loves making sticker dress up.  I typically tear off all the filler that surrounds each sticker to make peeling easier for my kids little fingers.  This is especially helpful on car trips.  I have purchased many stickers from many sources, but whenever possible, I will purchase Melissa & Doug branded stickers.  Hope this helps.
5.0	My granddaughter loved this when she opened it Christmas morning.  A great deal to make a little girl so happy.
5.0	"My 4 year old daughter has dress clothes that were literally taking over her room.  We got this originally for her winter coats, but I have found it's perfect for the dress up clothes.  It can hold everything from Princess dresses to fairy wings and everything in between.  WE now have a simple small trunk for the shoes and tiaras and wands.  Everything is \\""neatly\\"" organized on the coat rack and as a bonus my daughter can put it all away easily!<br /><br />I highly recommend this product for your princess' room!"
5.0	Took a while to blow up, but the kids love it! Only the first hour, but so far so good!
5.0	I love this toy for my child because it has different scenes in the storybook that she can play with her briar beauty doll so she will not be bored with just one scenario. She plays with it with all of her dolls as well as the briar beauty doll, she is amazed at so many phases of the different scenes. As a mom, I love that everything fits in the book as she puts it up for the night which is an A+ in my book for sure, She started telling her friends when she saw it come in the mail the next school morning and I was so excited for her to share her newest toy. She loves this set so much, she was going through all the other dolls that she wanted so she can continue to play with her toy, she started to describe to me all the characters and who they were and her face was lit up when she was discussing them to me. I would absolutely buy more of these dolls for my child because she loves everything about these characters.
5.0	Thank you for this great price on the 3 pack. Too bad you didn't have more.
5.0	Love this ...The prices are very cheap and it's a nice product.  Wish all lego figures were this cheap.<br />thanks
5.0	I bought this for my nephew, and I am his hero
5.0	This is a great product the diagram are great you should try it if you would like to do models I would buy more Thank You
5.0	T O T A L L Y - L O V E D the toy. The feature details were perfect!! Worth the pay :)
5.0	I couldn't belive that no store had it so I just ordered it and got it fast and in great shape.
5.0	This product works great!  Do you remember when Pluto used to be a planet in our solar system?  That was ME!!!
5.0	Purchased for my 7 year old.... and well lets just say my 18 year old and my husband also join in on being the World Champ at random moments lol...  good quality..
5.0	We build circuits and bring light, sound, speech. Still learning. first project got it wired! We were Shocked at how cool the other protect was.<br />We incountered little resistance is understanding the instructions. We had nothing negative about the DC introduction. The positives are many regarding the power to be gain by these projects
5.0	As described, well pleased
5.0	He's perfect. The detail in the figure is super, the height and weight was just as described and the box was a little damaged, but they said as much on the page. Very well shipped however! He's simply perfect! I couldn't be happier.
5.0	mix with more defenders and you have an abundance of forest
5.0	Got this for my 6 year old.  Yes the material is a little thin and I'm adding extra velcro to keep the hood in place but for $10 I'm not going to complain.  Love finding good deals. =)
5.0	I purchased this set to use when I wanted to start playing chess with a local club. I was pleasantly surprised with this set when it arrived. The board itself is very large and made out of a durable vinyl material. The board was free of blemishes and lays nice and flat. (As for the reviewer who complained of the smell, it's not bad at all and goes away soon after you leave it in open air for a little while.) The pieces are awesome and are the thing I love most about the set! They are large and very heavy for their size. They feel nice and are nice-looking as well. They're very sturdy and should hold up for a long, long, time under normal use. The set I ordered also came with a nice little canvas-like zipper bag that's holds all of the pieces. You can plop them in the bag, roll the board up, and you're ready to travel wherever you like. I couldn't be happier with this set, and for the money...I think it's a steal. I had no issues with missing or damaged pieces. The set even came with an extra queen of both colors for pawn promotion. If you're looking for a good set, buy this one. You won't be disappointed.
5.0	This was a gift for my 6 year old grandson. He's got good dexterity. He's loving doing tricks with his yo-yo. His older sister says he's got skills.
5.0	The pillow is really soft and comfy and very well made. It's even better in real. I absolutely adore it.
5.0	More zombies, More ways of killing them.This expansions is a bit harder than the original board game since in addition to regular (?) zombies you now have berserkers who can only be killed in hard to hand combat.  So forget about the dual sawed off shotguns, you will need something a bit more up close and personal.  Anyone have a spare concrete saw handy?
5.0	My 3 year old daughter received this for a christmas gift.  I was really amazed at how it works.  It is very kid friendly and she loves it.  We had no problem programming it to our Dvd player.  I think its great that you can use it on up to 3 tvs. <br />For the money I highly recommend this item.
5.0	My grandson is 7 and I buy him hex bugs all the time. But this year he want a robot hexbug and these were perfect.
5.0	Everything fits perfect. Just the shirt was a bit too tight at the collar. But i managed it to get another, bigger one. Just make sure you email the right measurements, that they can make you a perfect suit. I can recommend this suit to everyone who likes the Dark Knight or is a Fan of the Joker, Heath Ledger or the whole DC Universe/Batman Fiction.<br />You get a whole suit, for a prize that is appropriate. I searched for a long time and this is the best what i ever saw.
5.0	This is an awesome collectible. It arrived in great condition, as promised.
5.0	Great toy product! This was a gift for my sun. He loves it and is playing a lot. I recommend.
5.0	very detailed figures, the comic book was in perfect condition . perfect packaging. the armor of commander keller and  the marine trooper are awesome
5.0	I purchased this for my grandson.  He loved it ... this car is perfect for small hands to grip around the handle and make the car move everywhere.  I even bought a color appropriate for his sister to play cars with him!
5.0	Like the title says, I had been searching for a 1/6 scale FLAK Jacket for quite some time. I've been a 1/6 scale collector/customizer for years, focusing mainly on the Second World War.I only recently developed an interest for the Vietnam War, and finding parts to make your basic 'Nam Grunt has been tough. Most 1/6 scale Vietnam figures an accessories (Dragon, Toy Soldier, etc.) were produced years ago and have been almost impossible to find. So I was ecstatic to see these M55 FLAK Jackets, and for only $3!! Now all I have to do is find some M1 Helmets with Leaf Pattern helmet covers and I'll be all set.
5.0	The dress is beautiful, fits my daughter's AG and MA dolls perfectly, and seems to be great quality for the price.  Hopefully it will hold up well, but it looks like it will.
5.0	My 3 year old niece loved it!! It was very colorful and soft so she can sleep with it at night!
5.0	Lots of fun for our 4 year old to make pictures and practice tracing and drawing.<br />Bright colours and tough.
5.0	Just received this car.  Let me say one thing first.... Any Batmobile is a cool thing.  But I have to say I was disappointed in this one because as 4th in a series, they switched gears: 1. There is no switch in the logo on the base... the on switch/batteries are on the bottom of the car. the activation button is the middle exhaust tube. 2. There is no art board for behind the car as in the first 3 cars. 3. There are no blueprints. 4. The car faces right and the the first 3 cars face the left.  Other than these disappointments....Hey! It's a Batmobile!!!!!!!  Batmobilly
5.0	My sons loves this toy- the amount of things he can build and create is amazing. He is 4 and loves it. I have bought some extra accessories, because although 175 pcs IS ALOT, if he wants to build a big thing, or with a friend, they could use some more...<br />Great price, great value
5.0	My 18 month old grandson loves his new Teddy.  It's well made and he has so much fun hugging it and rolling around with him on the floor.  Gund always does nice work.
5.0	My 5 yr. old niece LOOOOVED it.
5.0	I bought this for my 7 year old granddaughter for Christmas. She had seen it in one of my catalogs and fell in love with it. She was not disappointed. Lovey is a beautiful little lamb and she smells wonderful. She is relaxing and wonderful to cuddle. My granddaughter sleeps with her every night and loves her dearly. She has become her constant companion. I think I would even like a Lovey! :) Great purchase and very satisfied!
5.0	everything was perfect, just perfect. I wish to buy more items such as this. I really liked the style. many thanks, again!
5.0	I really liked the fact that the plushie was in perfect condition when I got it, the details were precise, and it was really soft. The only problem was that it took a long time to ship. Overall it was perfect!
5.0	my son is nearly 5 and loves this ship. it is great for in the tub or anywhere else. It was one of his favorite toys for Christmas. You can do a lot of things with this ship, i even caught my husband playing with it.
5.0	I love everything cupcake, so its ideal for me. I love Kidrobot yummy. It arrived so fast, great service, I would definitely order from this company again, Thank you so much.<br /><br />God Bless<br />-Rae
5.0	My granddaughter loves to dance with these scarves and they have held up well.
5.0	Pretty children's wig! I got this with my oldest daughter in mind. She loves a wide variety of characters and among them are Ariel, Black Widow and Batwoman.. This wig is perfect for any of those characters!<br /><br />We do a bit of cosplaying in my household, and even attend events.. It's difficult to find a wig for a child with true versatility though. Although this one is themed for Ariel obviously, it isn't so obvious that it can't be used for other characters with red hair.<br /><br />It's very nicely made and came packaged as though we just picked it up at the costume shop. It even came with a net to keep the wig neat while stored. Very convenient. It fits my 9 year old daughter perfectly, and stays put even while she runs about. It's a very bright, vibrant red and she is extremely pleased with it. I would definitely buy again. (I received this product for free in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.)
5.0	THis toy is lots of fun for both chioldren and grow-ups...I gave it to my 3 and 5 year olds and they had no problem making it work...but the balls get lost easily!  And they can be a major choking hazard so supervized play only for toddlers.  Super cute and loads of silly fun!!
5.0	Grandson loves this Lego set. He's into Ninja's and Legos so this set is perfect for him.
5.0	I've  given this vacuum as a gift several times and it never fails to become a favorite. It's just the right size for children. The light and the simulated vacuum noise are a plus.
5.0	i love this necklace! my new favorite. although the ring around the bottle easly falls off so i glued it on so it wont fall off
5.0	My kitties love these poof balls. They are a great bargain for a lot which is great because the cats lose them just as quick as they get them.
5.0	This was just what I needed as I am very new to Magic the Gathering.  The only downside is that the life counters don't go all the way down to zero, but other than that it's perfect, especially if you're travelling and don't wanna lug all of your dice around. Thanks
5.0	Super whimsical way of making erasers.....bought for my friends daughter's (5) & (7). They loved it.
5.0	This set of bands are a true value. You receive all the vibrant colors shown and in a plastic divided case. Once you get and use them, you'll be ordering more.
5.0	I have only used the battery a few times but so far it has been great.  one strange thing about this battery is that it will not accept a trickle charge so if the only charger that you have is one that came with the Traxxas Stampede it will not charge this battery, you need to have a hot charger.
5.0	My niece has a similar Merida doll and loves having a Sophia one to go with it. Nice and soft so they make good toys to snuggle up to in bed.
5.0	Works great. My little girl loves it. Actually looks like the character.
5.0	It was as described and the boy we got it for loved it!
5.0	Great cube moyu is a great company want more of there cubes
5.0	very nice product great shipping
5.0	This was for my 6 year old grandson for his birthday ,he is deep into minecraft and legos.  So, to get a combination of both, he was in heaven!
5.0	I gave one of these tickets to my son who had suddenly picked up an unhealthy habit of spending too much on the real tickets.  He jumped for joy when he thought that he won $10,000 and said that everyone in the room would be getting a cut of the prize.  The mild depression that came over him after he learned that it was a prank gift made the moment bitter-sweet for those of us who were in on it.  It was hilarious yet cruel.  He has not had the urge to scratch another lottery ticket since then.
5.0	It was as described and it arrived in perfect conditions. Great item, I recommend it, it will improve your game
5.0	It was exactly what I expected and it was a gift and they love it
5.0	Same thing as the tractor
5.0	My grandson was sad when he realized that there wasn't really yogurt in the yogurt container. He will have hours of play with this very realistic looking set in his new kitchen.
5.0	The kids and I love watching this plane wip around. The trick to get it going was to give it a very gentle push. It is then able to orient itself and picks up speed quickly.
5.0	this made an awesome birthday gift for my son thanks so much
5.0	My son wanted a big stuffed cheetah for Christmas, so i got him this one.  It is almost as big as he is, but he loves it. He uses it as a pillow at night and he drags it around the house with him.  He got upset when I wouldn't let him take it to school on pajama day (it is huge).  If you have a kid obsessed with cheetahs (like mine is), this is perfect.
5.0	Fits our 5 year old nicely and still able to wear a pair of sweatpants underneath it so he stays warm. She still wants to wear it eventhough halloween is over.
5.0	How can you go wrong with this for your son!  He loved it.  Swords, shoots or shields.  He loves them all. Great product and quality.
5.0	My son and his friends loved these.
5.0	buy this product to give a special touch to my Christmas gift and turned out to be excellent thanks recommend
5.0	This toy is very cute and the little girl I bought it for absolutely loved it! She plays nicely with Littlest Pet shop toys also :)
5.0	I love my MY Scene Doll Chelsea she is just great! I rrrreaaaally want the Nolee and am actually going to get her soon I love the My scene dolls beacuse they are fun and really cute! I love the fact that they dont have the weird pegs instead of feet like the bratz do I find the fact that the bratz have those pegs annoying beacuse you have to go out and BUY! another bunch of shoes for them with the my scenes you can use the barbie shoes that you already have! I hope this review helps those who are looking for a good doll the my scenes are really fun and.... I love them!
5.0	I bought these for my daughters baby shower to decorate, they were cute, bright, colorful, well made and didn't fall apart.<br />Very happy with the product.
5.0	Bruder toys are tough enough to handle our three year old grandson, simple enough for him to handle and complex enough to keep him interested.
5.0	This is a great buy for your own build of a swingset. They are easy assembled and great weather wearable. They swing so easily
5.0	My daughter got this as a gift for her 2nd birthday (5 months ago).  It was her favorite gift.  She played with it every day multiple times for at least the first month.  It's a great simple tea set.. with out a million pieces.  It's just right for her.  Also, it teaches about shapes, numbers, and also manners.  I can't say a bad thing about it!
5.0	Just what we needed for our domino set!
5.0	The little one has the whole family in great health. she has us all bandaged up, and she tells us how important to be in good health. she loves it.
5.0	"We purchased this game for our 7 and 9 year olds.  We could not be happier!  The product shipped quickly and arrived well packaged.  The board and \\""marbles\\"" are made of wood, which is a nice change to all the plastic toys out there.  This has been hours of entertainment for my daughter, son, husband and I.  The visiting grandparents were equally amused!  I like the ease of set up and the leveled playing cards. storage box is sturdy and has a molded plastic sheet to place over balls and board to prevent roll-away pieces.  Well worth the money!"
5.0	My daughter collects Barbie Dolls of the World.  This makes a wonderful addition to her collection.  It's nice that the Kelly dolls allow her collection to take a new direction.
5.0	BOUGHT THESE FOR A FRIEND'S WEDDING BECAUSE HER SOON TO BE HUSBAND HAD A VINTAGE MUSTANG HE DID NOT WANT ANYTHING WRITTEN ON OR TIED TO.  THESE WERE WONDERFUL AND STOOD OUT BETTER THAN ANYTHING, AND HE DIDN'T GET MAD AT US!
5.0	"When I first saw elephander on \\""ZOIDS\\"", I thought it was gonna be one of the special Ultimute X zoids, and this zoid really shows it too!  There are three different types of elephander that come with it.  One of them is the fighter type (this was used during the first battle with the Blitz Team).  The other is the commander type(It was used when it fought the Blitz Team the second time).  The last, is radar type.  This zoid comes with multiple beam cannons; about seven.  It has a large claw at the end of it's trunk, and two other trunk pieces. It has a whole lot of other stuff that would take to much time to explain.<br />ATTENTION!!! Many of you have problems with Elephender's walking mechinism.  Does it walk in circles?  One of the reasons is that one of the \\""back\\"" feet may be to slippery (most often the left back foot).  I just put a little sticky tape on it and it walks perfectly strait!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5.0	Beautiful Arshes Nei figure! amazing detail from her expression to her clothes and her sword and scabbard. I really enjoy looking at this piece. The colors on her look great! It was well worth the money I spent! her pose and cape flowing behind her look awesome as well. I would totally recommend this piece to any collector plus she looks great w/ Kai Harn next to her!
5.0	this toy is my daughters favorite thing in the whole wide world and im the best daddy for getting it
5.0	She's a vampire queen so...
5.0	I bought these to include in Easter baskets earlier this month. I love them because they are mess-free, the colors won't show up on my grandkids' clothes or hands & they only mark on the special Color Wonder paper. The kids love them because they love to paint & color & draw. These kept my little artists busy without making a mess!
5.0	Great boardgame, love the show. Had great laughs accusing friends of being evil toasters. Game is harder for humans if the human players are new. Prepare to dedicated a few hours to complete a game though but well worth it especially if winning or losing comes down to the last few minutes/turns.
5.0	This is a quality toy.  Fun for imaginative play for any Super Sleuth fans!
5.0	Wonderfully detailed, a miniature version of the real thing. Important note: This animal is an ORYX - the word &#34;Onyx&#34; refers to a gemstone...
5.0	This sturdy plastic elephant has a lovely design to it and is a pleasure to look at . It is made in the US from recycled plastic. There is nothing here that can be removed and swallowed; no choking hazards. I think this is a perfect toy for a 6 month to one year old child.  It rolls easily on its purple wheels. The integral handle is child sized. The toy is about 6.5&#34; long, 4&#34; wide and 4&#34; high.<br /><br />I today had guests with 2 children aged 6 months and 1 year. They both loved this toy and played with it for 2 hours. I have tile floors; this toy rolls effortlessly along a smooth floor. It is likely too simple for older children but just right for infants and toddlers. It is very easy to clean. There is nothing here that can be harmed by disinfectant.<br /><br />This wonderful elephant joins my toy box for visiting children. I wish more toys were made this well.
5.0	Très bien fait et un heureux!!!!
5.0	Be surprised, this dollhouse was worth every penny. My child plays with this daily. It's big, so make sure you have the space. I am not a master carpenter, but still able to put things together confidently. That said, this took me hours to complete. It will take some time to build. Go slow, check and recheck the instructions, and take pride in the completed product. Worth doing. I built it at night so my little one would wake up to it. Her face made the late night followed by early morning a joy.
5.0	This game is amazing!! My 2yo & 4yo love it!!! So many ways to play & learn with it!
5.0	My son loves this toy. It is easy to transform for him as he is 3 and he makes up multiple play schemes with it. HE is very rough with it and it has held up great.
5.0	Anyone buying a Leapster should also consider getting this case. It will protect from scratches and also helps carry the Leapster plus game cartridges when traveling. Holds three cartridges plus one more if you attach a cartridge to the Leapster.
5.0	Great purchase. Great price!!I bought 15 of these inflatable light sabers for my 5 year old star wars bday party.My biggest concern was, how Am I going to relax with 15 kids hitting each other with light sabers? The kids had so much fun because they could actually use them without getting hurt. And also took them home as their little party favors. They don't last really long. They were perfect for the occasion!!!
5.0	Terrific tool, works great.
5.0	awesome--laughed like crazy-Daughter refused to take them back to Yale with her. Hilarious!  Absolutely of no use to anyone for any thing, but a  laugh.
5.0	They looked soooo awesome hanging from the ceiling our moustache party was a hit! They really set the mood for the party.
5.0	Our grandson is a Harry Potter fanatic ....going as far as sleeping with the books!  Discovered this game on vacation with him and sent as a surprise gift.  My son reported that &#34;he is obsessed&#34; with the game.
5.0	Very cute product.  Exactly as anticipated and received without issue.  Made the perfect Valentine's Day present.
5.0	First copy was a gift from a family member. My daughter went insane;  played it about 12 times on the first night. Simple but fun game for kids and grown-ups.
5.0	What can I say. Its a plastic table for little kids. Solid, sturdy and does the job very well for the kids. The chairs are well built too.
5.0	My 10 year old son saw these on vacation and ordered them as soon as we got back with his own money.  I am ordering a second set for him today and two as gifts for his cousins.  You will not be disappointed.
5.0	My 3 year old just loves this. Infact it has teached him so much that today while out shopping he started counting in spanish up to 10. It keeps him busy. I would recommend this product to everyone. It really does teach your kids. As far as the other people that mentioned troubles with programming it, i never had an issue. if you read the instructions you shouldn't have any problems. it's just like programming a remote control, cause that is what it is. Infact it has 3 settings on the back, so if you travel they can bring it with them. like to grandma's house and program each setting. like 1 for home, 2 for grandma's, etc....
5.0	My 3 year old nephew loves his new puzzle. Sturdy, good size pieces, vivid graphics -- very pleased with this purchase.
5.0	This toy as well known as it is; is still built sturdy and has some interchangeable parts such as a tongue and glasses. He does have the compartment in the back to help keep track of his parts! My son loves putting the parts in the right parts and then using his imagination to make Mr. Potato head into a new and entertaining display.
5.0	Great Play Doh Fun!!!<br /><br />My 8 year olds AND my eldest who just happens to be a big kid at 20 all sat down to check this out.  They couldn’t WAIT to crack open the box & try family game night together!  It’s hard finding something everyone can play together given my kids sensory disorder issues, not to mention how one has Autism, but this game seemed to fit the bill perfectly:  Everyone can play together!<br /><br />I THOUGHT my 20yr old would be responsible for assembly, but as it turns out, the 8yr olds were easily able to attach the arms easily even with their motor deficits which is a HUGE plus (something they can play & do by themselves, hooray!)  The unit DOES require a C battery, so make sure and have a pack on hand before showing the game to the kids!<br /><br />First, be prepared for molding game pieces, which is part of the fun!  There are little molds for shaping pieces at each station & you get a variety of types to choose from!  Part of the fun is seeing which shape works best with target practice!<br />The object of the game is to launch the little molded bits of play doh into the rotating cup which also bounces a bit.  Be careful not to hit under the cup so that it doesn’t get stuck & make clicky noises!  My eldest had to do a bit of troubleshooting at first, but quickly discovered a stray piece of doh as the culprit & fixed it easily enough.<br /><br />Game play does take a bit of practice and can get frustrating IF your kids are perfectionists.  If you go into it explaining ahead of time that it DOES take practice & that part of the fun is “missing” the target, they may have more fun & avoid frustration!  You can also give them a little notepad to keep tabs on which shapes work the best which will give them more of a “science project” style game play, but perhaps keep the perfectionists problems from surfacing!  This worked for us!<br /><br />All in all, this is a cute FUN little game that everyone can play/join in on in the family.  We ALL had a blast playing together and the best part is that all of my kids were on a level playing field together for once which is so hard to do with our special needs traits much of the time.  This game allowed everyone to have fun without anyone feeling as if they were playing a “baby game” or not being able to tolerate the obvious “losing” problems that often come up.<br /><br />This game does encourage team work and it’s really funny and engaging (what other game allows you to actually throw play doh at each other basically?)  This would make a GREAT sibling or group gift for families with more than one child that perhaps doesn’t always get to play games together!<br /><br />I am a BzzAgent and received this game for free from Hasbro to review and try out as part of a campaign. #GotItFree #HasbroGamingGift

5.0	Excellent directions for how to make balloon animals.  I've always wanted to know how to do this, and now I do.
5.0	Cool little frisbees.
5.0	This is a very nice and sturdy truck.  Our grandson loves it.  Only draw-back is that is doesn't make any electronic garbage truck sounds.  But to me, it can be a plus since it stimulates the imagination.
5.0	Really fun game if you like dominoes. All of our friends and family love it.
5.0	LOVE all the bruder trucks. So much fun for the little ones.
5.0	Purchased these so that my daughter would have a large amount of colors in a variety of colors.  The colors were great and bright.  I ordered from the New Jersey company and arrived before the Amazon estimated date of arrival.

5.0	Very fun game for the whole family!! I love this game have been playing it since I was a kid and now my kids love it!
5.0	Definetely looks better in hand than in the picture.  My oldest son is into Game of Thrones, Kingdom Hearts, etc. and he really loved it.
5.0	Thank you! My daughter loves her figurines and sticker :)
5.0	The lights and sounds it makes are amazing!  It makes sounds as you wave it and just hums the rest of the time.  The light/sounds lasted quite a while too...I think a month or so!  Although we didn't allow much &#34;combat fighting&#34; or hitting anything with it.  It's a deal for lasting that long and for the amount of amusement it provided.
5.0	Grand daughters: ages  6, and 4, loved them and stayed engaged. They want to receive more dragons and or action figures
5.0	Perfect for 2 year-olds. They use these every day and bring them in the car and in their bed... Great buy.

5.0	Excellent puzzles, very well made of nice heavy cardboard.
5.0	These straws were perfect for my daughter's baby shower. The polka dots and stripes fit in with the decor as well as the blue--she's having a boy! We served blue punch in mason jars with the blue straws. Perfect!
5.0	I used these for my daughters birthday party (a humane society donation party). I made a cake from scratch and since I am not an expert cake decorator, I put these on the cake (after washing with soap) along with the Safari LTd dogs toob set also on amazon with some &#34;gumball&#34; doggie balls and the kids LOVED IT ! !<br />And then my daughter had little doggies to play with. I love it when I can use things more than once. Perfect scale for a cake decoration.
5.0	My granddaughter has had a mobigo for some time, but needed to update to games for her age, this did it and she loved it.
5.0	This is hard to find. I had bought one four years ago which was red and my grandchild loved it. So when my second grandchild came along I thought I would get another. I had to hunt for this one and found it here at Amazon.  Pooh talks and his head wiggles and plays lullabies in a separate mode. Belly Lights up. Is a great bedtime toy.
5.0	"This is a fantastic game. The rules can be changed to accommodate young or new players or made to be advanced. Combines a lot of classic card games into one. I highly recommend this as a stocking stuffer!!! Also, I don't think Amazon will let me post the link, but if you google the name of the game and our newspaper \\""Mlive\\"" you can read all about how it was created by some biology professors from Kalamazoo college  on a camping trip!"
5.0	my brother always wanted this mini fig but its in a HUGE set and he doesnt have any room left in the inn. so if u dont wanna buy the HUGE set buy this mini fig today!
5.0	This is a delightful toy with a great storage box.  The problem is the flimsy box cover that comes with it.  Be careful getting it off to get to the blocks as it is very easy to damage.
5.0	Works great but I don't think it will last long.  Covers completely.  I would buy again because it covers so much.
5.0	These are great tubes.  The shape is awesome, so they wont roll off the table while you are trying to organize your stuff.<br />Ordered 2, they came as described and in a timely manner.  Highly recommend for your prized Magic playmat.
5.0	I actually bought this to give to little kid I teach. It's smaller than my palm but it the most adorable piggy bank. The bottom part has a rubber-made opening which you can open and close multiple times. It's a cute gift, already gift boxed with cute ribbon.
5.0	How can you not fall in love with Calico Critters?  The child who received this loves and collects Calico Critters.  The horse is one of her favorite toys that she plays with almost daily.
5.0	My daughter loved these toys. I say loved because my dog chewed them all up.  I'm still giving them 5 stars because they held up to my daughter's teeth.  They complement her pirate ship and other Jake toys nicely.
5.0	I bought these for my 4 year old who has been begging me for a bead kit to make her own jewelry.  I liked these because the pieces are larger and she doesn't seem to lose them all over the house.  The kit comes with enough materials to make approx 3 necklaces/bracelets.
5.0	This little toy iron is perfect for any child who likes to &#34;help mommy&#34;.  The features and realistic look are what pushed me to purchase this particular toy.
5.0	My Special Education students adore this sand table! It is a great place for them to play and interact. Great price!!! I plan to buy another one for my son.
5.0	Great buy! My 2yo twin boys love it and keeps them busy and calm in the pool!
5.0	good card, fair price, arrived on time. thank you.
5.0	I love that it doesn't use stickers and feels sturdy.
5.0	I absolutely love my Tamagotchi; they have improved them a lot since I last played with one when I was younger.  You can play a lot of fun games with them; you can even played with other players who have a tamagotchi too.  Even if the Tamagotchi falls down, that it has happened in several occasions, it freezes but when you restart it, it safeguards the data so you won't lose what you have done with it already, how it has grown, etc.
5.0	My 1yr old great niece loves this purse she never puts it down. very light and easy to carry. I order the webkinz pink poodle and its fits into purse perfect you can see the poodle face on the side of purse. Perfect purse for any toddler.
5.0	My daughter loved these stompeez. I would recommend them.
5.0	"I have been racing HO slot cars since Christmas 1966 and the new LifeLike (Walther's) cars are very well made and extremely FAST. They feature magnetic downforce that allows them to really stick to the track and are easy for younger racers to \\""drive\\"" them. I am a member of the Central Ohio HO Racing Association and we race almost every Saturday night of the year - about 45 races a year! We have a LifeLike NASCAR class and race only these LifeLike cars, because of their highly detailed body and their speed.     You can find more info on our group by doing a search for \\""Central Ohio HO Racing\\"" ay Yahoo groups and also at YouTube.     Thanks, Charlie"
5.0	The perfect replacement battery for my little cousin's toy car. His dad was desperately looking for this battery for weeks and finally ! Thank you.
5.0	Got as a gift - well liked
5.0	Beautiful~<br />Thanks :)
5.0	Purchased this furniture  set for my daughter's kidkraft supermodel dollhouse. I am so pleased with this set. Real solid wood. So glad, I got this before the price went up. At Amazon prices changes from day to day.
5.0	Easy assembly, grandson loves it! Pieces are large enough for small hands. Ample storage at the base of the unit.
5.0	My 5-year loved this umbrella. She loves using an umbrella and this was the perfect mix of &#34;do-it-yourself&#34; and function. I like the fact that the craft is now something that she can use. The umbrella is cute and very well made.
5.0	My son was so excited Christmas morning! The pieces are very good quaility and it was not hard to put together.
5.0	They were perfect for my needs!
5.0	my babies have loved these for months.  they are just about to celebrate their first birthday, and i don't see the love affair with the hide n squeak eggs ending any time soon!
5.0	This is a great gift for any child that loves to write. Bought this for my 1 year old daughter and she loves it. Even though it is a little advance for her.
5.0	It was perfect, my grandson loves it.
5.0	This was a gift for my nephew. He loves it.
5.0	My daughter loves it, super easy to put together for 10mins of fun :-p
5.0	I ordered this item as a gift for my girlfriend because she hinted at me that she's always wanted a giant teddy bear. As soon as she walked into my room she saw a big box on floor, when i went to open it and pulled out the big blue bear, her jaw dropped and stayed dropped for a while out of pure awe and excitement. she absolutely loves it, its great to sleep with and to cuddle and is extremely cute. I will be purchasing from the seller again in the near future, great product, well worth the money spent.
5.0	Fit good my daughter loved it
5.0	This product is great.  Simple, durable, does what it is supposed to do and lots of fun.  All of my kids love playing with it and watching the colors spin.  If you are looking for a top this is a good one.
5.0	My two granddaughters ride horses.  Love playing with Breyer horses and accessories.  This truck and trailer will provide hours of pleasure!
5.0	I purchased 2 of these scooters for my 4 1/2 year old grandaughters.  They were easy to assemble. The kids hopped right on and scooted away!  My husband make the remark while putting them together that they were very well made.
5.0	My daughter just turned three and got a few Barbie dolls as gifts.  This was a new venture for me into the world of Barbie, and I had no idea what clothes to get, etc. <BR>I bought this set as her first clothing for the doll and it is great!  There are plenty of outfits to choose from, and the styles are easy for a little to put on the dolls.  There are two pair of shoes in the pack as well as a hat and a few purses/bags.  This is a great gift to get someone when they are just starting out.
5.0	Got this for a Lego enthusiast on his birthday.  He loves to build with his imagination and this set has tons of Lego size options to do just that.  Dedicated Lego sets are great too, but with this you aren't led into just building what's on the box. I also loved the storage container, even though it was hard to wrap in birthday paper.
5.0	My children love Blabla toys!  They take them with them everywhere they go and they sleep with them at night!  They are soft and you can wash them in the washing machine!
5.0	Purchased for 2 yr old grandson...he loved it!!
5.0	Bought this as a Christmas present for my 11 year old daughter. She loves it!!  It's pretty fast in the snow 😀😀
5.0	This game is fun with a group of people who enjoy and all the differences it has to offer. Tip: probably not best when played around young ears. It is much more fun to allow the censorship to go out the window and let one's hair down!
5.0	"I purchased this for my four year old nephew who loves spaces toys and trucks and who is noticing and asking questions about the moon. This item proved to be a big hit with him because it contains space toys and a truck, all in one exciting package! LOL The toys were small enough for him to play with well with little hands, and the topics were big enough for him to ask as many questions as he liked about the space shuttle, the moon, and rockets. The set came with a cool rocket comparison poster that will be of benefit to him when he gets a bit older to read and understand. He was fascinated by the backpack style carrying bag which makes travel to and from his house to grandmother's much easier. The playset does inspire creative play while also sparking an interest in science and space studies. I found him fashioning moon craters out of Play Doh so that his new, tiny astronauts could climb into them and make \\""footprints\\"" on the moon.<br /><br />For the price, the quality, and the hours of enjoyment he has received, this was well worth it. Note: the pieces of this set are small so I would caution any parent who has a child who tends to put things in his / her mouth. This playset would not be appropriate in that situation."
5.0	This has been, by far, my one-year-old daughter's favorite toy since she was about eight months old. She pores through each book, and they are the perfect size for her little fingers. The variety of photos and illustrations (as well as the sheer number of them!) keeps her busy for minutes on end. Each slim little book contains three board pages, each with a picture and corresponding word associated with that letter. Contrary to other reviews, I think the pictures are quite well chosen, and the mixture of cartoons, photos, and fine art make for a nice introduction to the different types of image. I can see this set holding her interest for many more months to come, as she becomes more aware of the names for things and the world around her. As the box suggests, the books can also be used as flash cards, and my five-year-old can use them to spell out simple words. Though the books are recommended for 18 months and up, they are quite sturdy, and hold up well to my one-year-old's constant interest. Finally, we received these as a gift for my daughter's birth, and I would buy them for friends without hesitation.    Please ignore the ridiculous (typo?) age recommendation on this page of ten years and up!
5.0	This is a great addition to the Nativity Set.  This set has been d/c - I hope that they are produced again.  Shepherds are an important part of the Christmas Story.  They were the 1st visitors to visit the Christ Child.
5.0	Ricochet Robots is more of a competitive puzzle game than a true board game. Each person can compete to find the lowest number of moves to get the robot to the target. As a competition it can be a bit strife-inducing but it is a quality game. Endless fun and never runs out of new puzzles.
5.0	Our 12 year old was fascinated with this LED board & all her friends are in awe when they visit.
5.0	Exactly what I needed for my woodworking.  Great for chisel work
5.0	My two year old loves nursing nana. She sleeps with it every night. The baby puppies are so adorable and well made.
5.0	So happy my purchase! Any Harry Potter fan should love this!<br /><br />It's structured just live a typical Trivial Pursuit with 6 color-coded categories of questions. From what I can gather, they seem to be primarily movie-based. (I haven't checked to see if there are any where book and movie answers would differ.) I was worried that 100 cards/600 questions wouldn't really be enough questions, but this isn't a problem at all.<br /><br />Just be aware that this is sort of a travel or compact version of &#34;Trivial Pursuit.&#34; That is, there no board or pie/game pieces. It comes with the cards and a color-coded die inside a small pie-shaped box. In the end, I kind of like this aspect because it is portable and takes up so little space. To make it easier to play, I added the pie/game pieces from an old trivial pursuit; I had an extra board, too, but realized it was not really necessary. Best part is that the game pieces I added fit into the pie-shaped box, keeping it compact and organized.
5.0	As another reviewer mentioned, the numbers and letters are printed, and don't have the depression into the wood like the original tiles do. That actully works better for crafting, though. I am gluing paper to them to make necklaces. If you intended the printing to be visible, it is well done. The letters/numbers are clear and dark. The wood is smooth and the edges are uniform.
5.0	Great service, competitive price and good delivery. I advise everybody to use it.  I plan to use it again and recommend to my friends
5.0	It was just what I expected!
5.0	Beautiful!  The box alone is lovely.  Roses everywhere but inside the cup!  Perfect size for a cup of instant hot chocolate.  It is packaged well, so don't worry about it breaking.
5.0	This Lalaloopsy doll was one my Granddaughter really wanted for her collection and I was glad to find it. The price was good, shipping was fast & I always have reliable service when dealing with Amazon & the Sellers on Amazon. I am never disappointed.
5.0	Granddaughters loves these little people.
5.0	The stove looks great in the lalaloopsy doll house. My daughter enjoys playing with it and all the accessories it came with.
5.0	My 3 year old plays with it daily and loves it.
5.0	Imaginex collection for my son, dinosaurs are pretty good quality.
5.0	What a great gift for the child who loves Dora!<br />It is a simple game, but lots of fun! Thank you!
5.0	My two nieces loves this! It is a gentle glow and the girls went crazy when they saw it. They have it on all the time and has held up well so far.
5.0	A very nice entry set with a generous amount of paints and supplies. The basing material unfortunately is very poorly packed and is contained in very flimsy cups, so do not be surprised if one has blown open in transit.<br /><br />The set itself retails at $125 from Army Painter direct.
5.0	I used to have these type of books when I was a kid, then 25 years later I COULD NOT find them in Any store in my city!! I'm so glad Amazon had them.  They had a few different ones, so I was able to get them for my kids, and of course... Myself!! They are full of tons of fun games and activities.  And if the question section was too hard, the entire car got to get involved to answer the questions!  I will always make sure I have a Yes & Know book with me on all long trips!!!
5.0	The slime comes in 3 different metallic colors, the first was pink with purple and had a silver shine to it, the second was a greenish brown with gold shine, and the third was an orange metallic brown golden color. My kids who I gave these to, are 5, 9, and 12. All three of them despite of their age difference loved the slime!!!!! My 5 and 9 year old took it outside and they loved the color of the slime and thought the  consistency was really cool, it came of their hands easily and was water based. Did notice that after playing with it for some time it shrinks in volume, but his was not a problem, since adding a bit of water makes it come right back to life. My 12 year old loved the way it looked and felt. Very easy to put back into the test tube shaped containers that it came in. This product is great for keeping kids entertained.
5.0	"I am long past my teenage years. I have had a couple of the early Nintendo consoles  and have multiple computers. I once enjoyed video games but just lost the taste for them...  I bought myself a present...at only $28.00 bucks and shipping the guilt would pass. I put the batteries in, a 5 minute job,  hooked it to an older 25\\"" TV and found the tennis game. I began to play. I have not played serious tennis  in 16 years nor held a racket in 10 but I suddenly FELT like I was playing. Bad backhand and all!  Yeah, you do have to use buttons a bit but it becomes second nature fast.  I have just toyed with the other games...looks like days of exploration but my impressions  are mostly all positive. There are quite a few games which you will never play here but about  12-18 seem pretty solid. The controllers do the job...feel a bit cheap but then again, they are !  This is a great buy and a great gift for any kid who does not have a video console. You can buy this and another $20.00   gift for half the price the price of the Nintendo with no games. They may grumble when they see the box. They will feel better after using it.  FOR THE MONEY this can't be beat."
5.0	I Received my Anatomically African American Boy Doll on 2-7-2012, way ahead of the due date. It is more than handsome, Beautiful and sturdy with his beautiful light brown eyes. His body is fat and fine just like a real baby. I already have his newborn outfit ready to put on him. I also ordered 2 Hispanic Girl Anatomically Correct Dolls from UnbeatableSale.inc. They came on 2-9-2012. How big and wonderful and Gorgeous they are. This Doll is not only for children but for those of us who want children. I adore my babies so much. I love the very affordable price. Amazing, super cool and I am very happy. A must have for children, schools, and adults.
5.0	Fun Fun Fun ........ great fun at Christmas time.
5.0	We have replaced our old, mis-matched dishes with this set and WE LOVE IT. The kids love setting our table and it looks adorable
5.0	This was a big hit with my daughter. She has friends that come over and want to get out &#34;the school set&#34; as soon as they get here.  It is a great design and has thoughtful details.  It is well made, but I won't feel bad throwing it out when it gets worn out, since it is mostly cardboard.  This is a great toy.
5.0	The boy LOVES this Batman...and I loved the fact that I didn't have to order a full set of Legos just to get it! Win-Win!
5.0	This piggy bank my grand kids love. It has show them how to save and see wat they have save
5.0	I got this for my husband for his birthday, He loves this game! We play it when go over some friends house. I knew it would be a great gift! Very happy with this set for the game.
5.0	My 4 year old son LOVES this toy. It has been 2 months since he received it for Christmas and he still plays with it every day. Balls are soft and don't harm people or furniture. Had to find him a Zurg costume for dress up he loves it so much.
5.0	Well what can I say? It's a cup with a cool design on it. If you're a Final Fantasy fan, this is something for you or a gift for someone else who's also a FF fan.
5.0	I asked my daughter how she would rate this and she said 5 out of 5, as she is the one wearing it, she is the one who gets to rate it.
5.0	Exactly what I needed!
5.0	I loved this horse  trailer.  I was too late though.  Someone bought my grandson one before me:(
5.0	super small but a cute stuffer or gift bag item for boys party
5.0	This keychain is very well made and it absolutely adorable...if you find hockey mask wearing slashers adorable like I do.  This is a perfect size for a keychain and won't weigh your keys down.  Perfect!
5.0	I ordered these sets for my grandsons.  I ordered a large one and a smaller one.  I gave the large one to one of the grandsons for his birthday and kept the other one at my home for all the kids to play with.  They all love it.
5.0	Two year old grandson loved it.  Easy for him to manipulate and he loved the different pieces that he could play with.
5.0	These fit a full $10 roll of Half Dollar coins.  Lid goes on tightly and container is durable.  I am always price conscious and these were the best price at the time.  From a construction standpoint I would certainly purchase again.
5.0	Excelente producto, 100% recomendado
5.0	Great condition very pleased :)
5.0	This is so cute!  My son turned 7 so he's on the older side for this toy but he had fun with it. I needed it for a party decoration  I'd recommend it for a younger child overall.
5.0	My Grandpa cracked up when I gave him this as a gift. The toy winds up and waddles like a penguin across a surface and lights up flames inside the nun's mouth. Too funny.
5.0	I love Mrs. Meyer's Clean Day hand soap & the lemon smells soo fresh & clean.  I just love it & it smells like a real fresh lemon on my hands.  Wonderfu product!!!!!
5.0	I have had a lot of trouble getting my items but this item came on time. The quality of the plush toy is excellent and my kids love it. thank you so much for a great item.
5.0	Its a gift so we havent tried it yet
5.0	Love it for the price. It keeps my hair in place when wearing a wig. Its not as thick as others put for the price will buy again.
5.0	Yes they arrived just before Christmas.
5.0	great Item and well packed
5.0	I bought 2 of these for my 2 grandchildren & they just love them!  Lots of good play time catching bad guys.  For the price on Amazon, they were WELL worth it as I saw them in stores for almost double the price (which I never would have paid for them).  Due to the lower price on here, my grandchildren are able to enjoy this fun gift.<br /><br />You do have to caution the kids on hitting each other though (or the parents who are in reach) - the stick can pack a wallop if they are not careful - but this can be a good lesson to teach them in being careful & playing nicely (no one got hurt I might add, we cautioned as soon as we assembled them!).
5.0	"Ok, I won't lie, I didn't know what to expect from this game.  I have been a Magic: The Gathering player since 1993.  Having played that game I saw any strategy card game being at a distinct disadvantage.  Magic has so many cards, and so much variation, it makes any game seem simple and boring by comparison.  Therein lies the problem though.  Playing Magic on equal footing is nearly impossible.    Enter Dominion.  A non collectable card game with 500 cards in the box.  Seems like that might be too many... or maybe even not enough if you are comparing it to a game that has been growing for 20 years.  The instructions were easy to follow, and well written.  The advised set up for your first game is advisable, and gives you good insight to the game, and the function of the cards immediately.  The game mechanic is FAST PACED, and never boring.  Unlike other card games where you empty your hand and lose your ability to do things, Dominion has you emptying your hand every turn, only to start your turn with a full hand all over again.  Brilliant.  Inspired even.    You will quickly learn which card you feel are worth collecting, and which cards you don't want to play with.  The best part though... not everyone will agree.  That part I like very much.  You could say, \\""Well, the other person is just wrong, and I am a better player than them.\\""  That isn't always going to be the case though.  After playing nine games with my Fiancé, in three sets of three (the first two with the advised set up, and the second two with the \\""Big Money\\"" set up) we found the score... 4-4 with the very last game being a tie.  If that doesn't scream balanced game....    We are both good strategic thinkers, but while I am a 20 year tournament competitive Magic player, she only learned magic a few months ago.  What we both had in common is the belief that Dominion was faster paced, and just as much fun to play.  We loved it, and can't wait to play again.    My warning would be that to a new gamer this will all seem like way too much to handle.  My advise would be to not show them all the cards, but just set up the recommended first game for them, and once they get comfortable with the game mechanics introduce a set or two of new kingdom cards for them to look at, perhaps without even playing with them."
5.0	I love the new look on this Lagoona!  The curly hair is to die for! The ruffles in her dress as well as the pattern itself is so darling.  The accessories with her are great, the little aqua hair piece is a little pick that you can push into her hair, I think that is a great idea! Usually any plastic accessories that go in their hair are attached with a plastic tab that does not allow for restyling unless you cut it and then the accessory does not want to stay where placed. My only complaint is the green around her eyes is larger than in the promo picture and is not very flattering.
5.0	I'm very satisfied with my purchase. These shoes are comfortable, stylish and reasonably priced.
5.0	We had a great time playing this game. Their are also different suggestions for how to play. You have to think fast.
5.0	We are having a blast with it!  It said on the box that it was ready to run and it was. The battery was already charged and we were able to take it out of the box and play with it right away! I was a little worried that it wouldn't make it by Christmas so I sent and e-mail and they were quick with a response to let me know how my order was progressing.  Thanks so much for getting it to me by Christmas!
5.0	This 7x7 is amazing! It blew me away with its smooth turning and speed. Out of the box, this cube was really greasy and over lubricated. It came with an extra set of stickers as well. Like most shengshou cubes, the 7x7 is super smooth on all layers. The outer layer is a little bigger than the inner layer cubies, but that is fine and actually makes the puzzle easier to handle. The sticker quality is good, but I find the shades to be dull, and I will probably replace the stickers with cubesmith half brights. As for pops and lockups, this cube has only popped on me once, and every once in a while will get a nasty lockup, but they're easy to fix. Overall, a great cube with a great price!
5.0	I think this toy will be good for little girls of all ages! With sparkaly fur and soft fabric this toy is the best for cuddling and sleeping with!
5.0	Table set very soft but comfortable and sturdy.  Very pleased with the  purchase and my children love them.  Delivery was fast and packaging was simple and light.  It was a bonus the set came assembled but packaging was simple and easy to unpack.
5.0	My daughter loved it.  We took our time and worked very carefully so it was a nice project - especially with all our snow days.
5.0	I got this as a gift for a friends 3 year old boy. He absolutely loved it! It does a countdown to blastoff and comes with little guys and a car. Very well built not cheap at all!
5.0	This can be altered in so many different ways to stimulate your childs imagination. My kids keep building, taking apart, and redecorating. So worth it and highly recommended! We got it free from Hasbro!
5.0	The plush dolls seem to be better made than the regular dolls. This is a quality product. I would recommend this item to a friend! They are really cute!
5.0	"Got this for halloween and it is perfect!! For the price its a MUST have!! My son had a great time helping me set up the spider as a test run! He thought it was \\""HUGE & COOL\\"" Love that the eyes light up and that there is no noise like most products like this."
5.0	I bought this game solely because of the ten minute time limit.  I run a monthly board game group, and it's nice to have a game that can be played quickly in between other games, or a game to have when people are eliminated from other games.<br /><br />Escape The Curse of the Temple is a fun cooperative game that requires players to navigate a Mayan temple by flipping over room tiles while activating magical beacons that will allow them to escape before the 10 minute time limit expires.  The game is relatively simple to play, and easy to pick up.  It comes with the rules on an audio track, which I play every time we have a new player.<br /><br />This version of the game comes with an expansion that increases the difficulty of the game, but I have yet to use it with a group.  My gaming group claims the game is difficult enough as it is.<br /><br />I believe the game is super fun, but it is NOT for everyone.  Many of my group refuse to play it because they find the ten minute time limit too stressful.  I personally believe that ten minutes is exactly enough time to play the game, but some just can not handle the pressure.  This game is also not good if you're not a fan of dice rolling because that's all this game really is: rolling dice to get the right combinations at the right time.<br /><br />Overall, it's a very fun game, but I am saying that as someone who doesn't mind the pressure and can handle all the dice.
5.0	We bought this toy for my 5 year old son for Christmas.  He plays with it almost everyday.  His 7 and 3 year old brothers play with it as well.  I think it is a great toy for the money.  It is very durable and promotes imagination.  In fact I just ordered the Joker's Fun House I hope it is as good as this.
5.0	One of the reasons why I bought this Lego set was because I thought that I could use the jeep for Lego city with a few adjustments. The cobra snake was a little hard to build but cool. I highly recommend this Lego product for anyone that likes Legos or Egyptian adventures. Have fun building!
5.0	My little ballerina has gone through many tutus but this is one of the best. Not only is it made of a softer tulle, but the tulle is durable.  The colors are adorable and match any of her solid colored ballet leotards. I also like the ribbon around the bottom.
5.0	This actually works, and yes get more of their solution, loads of bubbles compared to blowing through a wand.  My cats love it LOL!
5.0	I purchased this for a friend's severely autistic boy.  He loves it and plays with it all the time!  This is the second toy I have gotten from Safari Ltd. for him and both appear to be among his favorite toys.
5.0	My son loves this turnout gear! I must say it is the most realistic looking gear that I have found. 5 star
5.0	Came in two card protectors, very secure, quick shipping, will be buying from Wizards of the Coast again for sure!
5.0	So pleased with this item and it shipped to me very quickly
5.0	These are so much fun!  I got these for my 5 and 8 year old grandsons, neither had a problem figuring out exactly how to use them.  Not sure who enjoyed them more - the kids or their dad.
5.0	She loves lps and really loves this pink poodle. It's mouth works and she came with accessories too, also she has furry ears.
5.0	My daughter flipped out for this, it was a lot of happiness for a little money!
5.0	I am a doll collector.  I bought these American Girl doll sized shoes for a Franklin Mint porcelain doll that did not come with shoes.  They are white patent leather with a satin rose trim. The shoes are slightly big on my doll, but look lovely with her dress.  The shoes are very well made.  I am pleased with my purchase.
5.0	I purchased this card when I pulled the other half out of a booster pack. The card came well protected with no scratches or bent sides. I gotta say, I was pretty excited when It arrived a day before the date it said it would xD and for those of you who think it's fake, it's not =D great card, and it looks that much better with the other half xD
5.0	Perfect for my niece to tote around!
5.0	Amazing quality for a child toy. Too big for a 5 year old though. This will most likely fit a big 8 year old up to about 12 years. My son is going to love it though! The helmet it came with is sturdy, but came with broken clips on the inside so I have to replace it. Amazon is not able to do a replacement because of the type of seller Kids Army Store is, but they did an advance refund and I was able to reorder the helmet.
5.0	My daughter loves it!!!
5.0	10 year old niece love this Barbie. Dress and shoes are cute! Purchased for around $ 6 and think it was a steal!
5.0	My 9 year old daughter loved it.  I wish they offered more of just the close for the monster high dolls.
5.0	My daughter (age 5) is in LOVE with horses. She even has that freakish Butterscotch pony that I had to BEG someone to buy her for Christmas because there is no way in heck I could have afforded it. She loves this small impish version just as much, even though it just walks around like one of those cheap dogs that flip in front of Kay Bee toy store at the mall. I mean, I am not disappointed or anything, it's exactly what it looked like in the commercial that I have seen approximately 75 times in the past 2 weeks. My only wth with this product is that you Furreal folks didn't sell it BEFORE Christmas, so mothers like me wouldn't be losing sleep over not being able to afford the Butterscotch creep. This would have been a nice alternative, know what I am saying? All in all, it's a great toy and she loves it and will hopefully not cry every time the commercial comes on. Horses make her emotional and I am pretty sure you have a life long customer with her.
5.0	Played and bought at a game fair.  It was fun and challenging for the 3-5 year old that we bought it for.  It is easy to change some of the rules around to make it easier for the young one and then re-introduce some of the rules to create a harder game.  Kids love the duck that they can move around the board with.  All in all a very nice game.
5.0	I got this gift for a little girl of a family friend. This is the best price for any my little pony. You will double at toys r us and target. She loved the gift.
5.0	This battery powered pistol is just right for the 4 yr old to play against the older kids with. He doesn't get tired out pumping to shoot.
5.0	This is a really beautiful Barbie Doll.  Her hair and costume are stunning and it is nicely boxed.  The knees are bendable, which is a plus.  Very nice.
5.0	Can't wait to see both my daughters expression when the open these outfits for their dolls! LOVE LOVE LOVE these dresses!
5.0	Was exactly like it was pictured. Arrived in great shape. Very satisfied.
5.0	My kids love to take this out in the backyard on &#34;adventures&#34; or dug hunts.  Even in the winter they pay dress up with it so it is used year round!
5.0	This thing is great! It's an easy-to-build model and displays magnificently. Mine is hung from a ceiling and just looks great. I did paint the interior a bit, but you really can't see much in there. The light is a pretty good effect but the landing wheel (which acts as the switch) suffers a bit from underdetailing probably to let it be used as a switch. Still, that's a minor complaint.<br /><br />Great model. I really love it.
5.0	My son looks forward to a Lego advent calender every year.  It's become a tradition.  Make sure you order early, they go fast.
5.0	good for hobby purposes
5.0	If you love Minecraft, you'll love these stickers, I didn't think they were small.  They aren't huge, but, Very cool stickers, happy happy happy!
5.0	Many hours of creative play!  We've had it for a couple of years & it's still in great condition.
5.0	This is a great game for kids or for family game night.  You put it together then play the game.  As you play or between games you can change the board around.  With these Lego games you can also change the die you're playing with as well to keep it interesting.  This game is pretty self explanatory- it's a race.  The only catch is that the course can change, as mentioned before.
5.0	Light but very durable my 2 y/o loves it more than my collection lol.
5.0	Love this game! Great for first graders and up.
5.0	I used it with my wagon that I bought and it came in very handy for hauling stuff, goes through snow real good also
5.0	My son just loved it!!!
5.0	These are super fun and my toddler and elementary age kids love playing with them. Super easy to use for little fingers.
5.0	It's great, comfortable and it delivered on time!!
5.0	This bag is a good enough quality for the price, very happy with it. Ended up buying another one for a friend.
5.0	Super cute, very well made. Toast pops up if you press the lever hard enough. Big hit in our play kitchen.
5.0	This figure, even though it doesn't have alot of articulation is the best Starfire figure out at the moment. I'm a fan of the Mattel action figure line put I can say without a doubt this Dc Direct version of Starfire put the Mattel version to shame. I will say that if you want more articulation so that you can pose it in different stances get the Mattel version, because it has more articulation. Starfire comes with a base that connects to her hair to give off a impression that she is leaving a fire trail similar to the Firestorm figure. Another plus is that her eyes and hair lights up with the base when you press the botton on her belt,which is cool.
5.0	My son is three and a half and loves Lego duplos. This set is a great addition. The first week he had this set he played with it non-stop and now goes to it at least once a day.<br />Pros:<br />1. Educational<br />2. Works with other duplos<br />3. Set includes a lot of legos/ Lego people/ tubes and balls<br />4. Includes diagrams for building structures that, for my son, were pretty easy to duplicate just by looking at.<br />5. Includes a bin with lid for easy storage.<br />Cons:<br />1. My son struggled slightly to connect the tubes to legos without crumbling the structure. This frustrated him initially, but he has learned to more gentle. I realize this isn't really a con for my son, but could be for frustrating for a younger child.<br />2. Price. This set is expensive, but I felt the educational aspect justified it.
5.0	If you like the furby but are afraid your little ones will break it, this is great for them. It talks and sings and rocks back and forth.
5.0	Great product, it is built very well and sturdy for the kiddos. I love the way this was built, so much better than the old flimsy shields you but at a Halloween store or something. The boys loved it but they were all around 3 or 4 years old..
5.0	The Ghoulia Yelps Doll is very cute and was shipped to a little girl in Thailand.  She loved this doll.
5.0	Exactly what I need to add a little Christmas to my cards!
5.0	Great selection, very nice selection.  I lost only one and it was my fault most likely.  The one with a bloom had three within the first week.
5.0	Very good quality work.
5.0	Super easy to set up.  Kids loved it (so did the Great Dane).
5.0	Granddaughter loves it!!
5.0	Cheap and all worked!
5.0	my 4 year old loves Tinker Bell and loves the game. She has to work a little harder on some games, but with time and patience she will get it.
5.0	A friend of mine bought this guy as a gift for half off at a good sale. I liked how his material is corduroy, but my son was not super interested. As time went by, he played with him a little more, but he still didn't get that much attention. It all changed one day when we picked up an old book at a garage sale called Dinosaur's Binket. Not long after, my son would go get Dinosaur (whose given name is Tristan, according to Gund) when we read him the book or bring over the dinosaur puppet and the book together. That led to him wanting to have dinosaur spit out small plastic balls across the room that he would retrieve and then hand back. Now our little guy, who is currently 18 months, wants dinosaur to do all sorts of things. He gives him toys to play with and requests for him to pick up things. He always wants us to put on that puppet and bring him to life. Dinosaur, as we call him simply, has certainly become one of my little man's favorite toys and very endearing to the whole family.
5.0	Much more than expected.  Parts fit like a glove with only sprue trimming to deal with. As they say...expensive but worth the money because of the time invested.
5.0	I purchased this set to go on top of a Mickey Mouse Clubhouse birthday cake.  They are the perfect size, and my grandson will be able to have them to play with after the party.
5.0	My dad has always loved the Uno game.  So last year for his birthday I got him Uno Attack.  The whole family was there and we had a ball playing this game.  The cards are a little different from the original Uno game so that added a little excitement.  My 6 year old daughter even played with us and she got the hang of it quickly.  We ended up buying our own Uno Attack so we could have it here to play with as much as we want.
5.0	amazing figure. I am glad I bought it last year on amazon for a bit over 30 bucks considering it shot up to 160+ dollars in a year!
5.0	So I was skeptical about buying this, simply because I was reminding myself that I really did not need another stuffed toy. I'm a young adult, but it looked so cute. I went ahead and got it after some pushes and it is so worth the money! It is soft, huggable, and has the sweetest expression! It fits right in my arms ... a really good gift for a girlfriend, daughter, granddaughter, any child that has a fondness for cute plushies or animals! :)
5.0	This is perfect and has worked for the past year, recharging our Leapfrog Explorers time and time again. I highly recommend getting this to save yourself the constant need to change batteries!
5.0	My 18 month old loves this and because it keeps her occupied while I prep dinner, I love it. :) It is tall and steep but my daughter is tall, so it hasn't been a problem. It's perfect for winter play indoors.
5.0	Awesome for younger ones. No little pieces to break off very hardy and a simple controler. And u really can run them through water!!!!!!!! I'm gonna get each one. Well 2 of each one. I have two grandsons.
5.0	My son loved the excavator. He loves to pretend he is digging for gold. It is well made and I would recommend this to anyone.
5.0	all o.k. great product. function normally and i like your goods. manufactures is o.k. i will buy in the future other products.
5.0	So cute and perfect for my daughter's AG doll!
5.0	I wanted a stuffed animal plush key chain and who can go wrong here. It is even cuter than in the picture. I am very pleased with this purchase. It is just about the size of a fist. =D
5.0	This puzzle is not too difficult to complete. It has nice colors and the pieces are not flimsy. We are enjoying this jigsaw puzzle.
5.0	Sized well for a child. Fits under arm but not in purse. Cute details and life like. Soft well made product.
5.0	The figures sold by Tin Toy soldiers are exceptional---I bought 5 so far.  If you are into toy soldiers they are a great value,
5.0	I got this &#34;vintage&#34; set for two grandsons ages 2 and 4, sinc my own children loved it in the 1980s.  They don't totally know how to play, but we make up other games about the faces.  In time, they will play it by the rules.  I looked at &#34;modern&#34; sets of this gam, but they involve animal faces and not people.  It may be fun, but I was trying to re-create the game we had at home.
5.0	My kids had this on their Christmas list, so Santa brought it for them.  Perfect pillow for napping in the car.
5.0	Super cute stroller and was VERY easy to put together it took me like 5 minutes. Also the cute little bag looks just like the picture :)
5.0	My baby loves this toy especially the milk carton - she uses it to teethe on while looking at the little mirror inside the flaps and it keeps her occupied for a good long time.   She also likes shaking the little jingly tomato for the sound it makes and unvelcroing the peel from the crinkly banana. All in all, lots of nice little shapes, colors, textures and sounds for babies between six and nine months.
5.0	My little sister loves it!! She plays with it for hours.
5.0	Kids love this one. Rolls around easily, the handle design is cool and works well.
5.0	Love this helicopter! My 5 year old son was begging for one for his birthday and even though I read the reviews saying that this was for older than 5, I decided to give it a shot. It's fantastic. My husband is obsessed with it and my son LOVES it. He, even at 5, is getting the hang of flying it without too many crashes :)
5.0	My daughter had told me my granddaughter wanted this for her 3 yr. birthday. She had reccommended Target, but of course Amazon is my place to shop of choice. I looked and found it cheaper & I was thrilled. My granddaughter absolutely loves it & is slowly learning the art of taking pictures.
5.0	Yes, it is just a smaller plush toy. For a kid who likes the Monsters Inc. movies, it is priceless! :)
5.0	Now it is possible to spread a 1000 piece jigsaw puzzle out on the kitchen table and roll it up for meals.
5.0	Got this as a gift.  Hope it is a good one.
5.0	My daughter feel in love and has been her must have toy since she started crawling! Now 2 and half and ordering another hoping for an easy swap or refresh for the first one. Make more we need several to make it thru her childhood lol
5.0	Great for the kids party and no spills
5.0	These axles are great, very durable and easy to install.  The kit has everything you need.  Time and money saver.
5.0	When you put the tablets into the water they fizz and create a vibrant color. My 20 month old daughter loves picking what color her bath water will be and watching them fizz.
5.0	I haven't had the best of luck with Funko's arriving in one piece, both boxes and items damaged - however Amazon has 100% been a seller worth returning too, they get on top of issues ASAP and have those issues sorted out very quickly. They seem very interested in making sure us as customer's get the best of what we receive and the fact they are so assertive with their replies, makes me return.
5.0	"My 7 year old son got this set for Christmas last year, and with all the toys we have for our 5 kids, this K'nex set gets the most use.  He built with it every day for months, and still builds something new about every week with it.  He has built about every model in the book and he is getting better at building his own ideas.  We've gotten a lot of the models on video tape, and he loves to show his grandparents the new ones.  I loved the sea turtle that \\""walked\\"" across the floor, and he builds amusement park rides and puts little people in them.  This thing keeps him busy for hours at a time, and he's getting another tub of them for his birthday.  His little brother wants one for his birthday this year.  The motor is very cool, and he figures out how to use it with the models that don't call for it.  Since Christmas, he has only broken 2 pieces, so I thought that was pretty good.  Highly recommended!"
5.0	Our daughter loves it! Great sounds, music, not totally TV themed in the musical selections, volume button on remote turns up and down the volume of the sounds/music. It stands up to abuse. Our daughter likes to throw things out of the car when we open the door to get her out and it has hit the pavement quite a bit but still works like a charm. Our daughter is currently 14-months old and still enjoys it.
5.0	"I'm a fan of the Scene It games and if you're a Twilight fan, this game is for you. I've seen the movies numerous times and read each of the books a few times too, so this game didn't really stump me but it is alot of fun to play. I recently played it with a bunch of women at a party - the people who had only seen the movies once or twice had kind of a hard time and the few of us who were major fans knew all the answers, so you definatly have to play with people who are at the same knowledge level with the series. So, definatly a very well done game but I'd say the ONLY down fall is getting the right group of people together to play. I also played it with a few family members who had seen the movies but were only moderate fans (hadn't seen them many times like I have), we played the 4 of them on one team against me and it was a close game, lol. I really like how (with all the scene it games) there are numerous different types of questions and puzzles such as \\""what object is missing from the scene\\"", name the characters who's voices you hear, name the character who's \\""power\\"" this is, what's the next line in this scene, etc. Overall I'm very happy with it and it's lots of fun for Twilight fans."
5.0	This doll is my absolute favorite! Even though she doesn't quite look like ppl of Indonesia she still has beautiful exotic features.  If you're into collecting she's a must have!
5.0	My daughter received this toy from Santa. She absolutely loves it. It was easy to assemble and it is very durable. My only complaint is that the blue side rail does not stay in place. I will probably end up glueing it in place.    I have a very rough little 2 year old, and this toy has held up to her perfectly. I do believe she pulled one of the doors off at one point, but my husband just popped it back into place without any trouble. This is a great toy for any little girl, and I would highly recommend it.
5.0	Item came in perfect condition, even still had the clear bag over it. I love how it's a unique collectible. Definitely was worth the little extra $, cause i'll keep it forever:)
5.0	These plates are absolutely adorable!  My kids love Backyardigans and already want to use these plates! They are heavier duty plates so you won't have to worry about them buckling in the center when carrying.
5.0	"This \\""creature\\"" has taken over my granddaughter's heart.    Clarice was bought with the intention of her being \\""Rudolph's\\"" companion.  He was lonely don't you know!!  Well now Rudolph is on the shelf and Clarice sleeps with her.  Why???  Rudolph's \\""on vacation.\\""  So far, there have been no complaints with it.  She loves it and carries it around and sleeps with it.  What else can I say?"
5.0	Bought this for my new baby, and it's a very charming and soft bunny. Can also sit up on its own, cross its legs, etc.; the paws and feet are slightly weighted with plastic beads inside. I like that it doesn't have plastic eyes or nose. The baby loves it.
5.0	awesome game, try it.
5.0	this was such a wonderful stuffed toy, i can't believe it came so fast. My daughter just loves it
5.0	All I can say is my granddaughter loves it. Things like these in wooden chests thrill children not to mention the goodies inside.
5.0	great buy for your children!
5.0	These Cutie Pop Dolls are a great series. I have purchased many sets for my 6 year old grnd daughter and neither she nor I have been disappointed.
5.0	My grandson loves these baseball guys.  He learns a lot about the positions and loves to pretend which teams they are.  I don't know why, but you can't find these in toy stores. And I love that the container is strong and he can handle it.
5.0	My little princess is so happy with the sound and very soft and color so beauty.....she love to play with her pink little elefant......:-)
5.0	This set will provide the young (or young at heart) Thomas fan with hours of entertainment.  The set comes well packages and it extremely well constructed.  You will notice as soon as you handle the pieces of wood, they snap right together, and while not heavy, they do have some weight suggesting they will hold up over time.<br /><br />The set assembles easily.  My two and a half year old can put the pieces together himself, with obviously some overall guidance as to what goes next.  He immediately began pushing the trains around on the track and making whistle noises.<br /><br />My only quibble, I wish I could give 4.5 stars, is that for a retail price of almost $100, I would think the set would include a thomas train.  I realize most buyers will already have one (or many) but if this is your first foray into Thomas toys, your child will be a bit disappointed.  Again, just a quibble, the set is well made and will hold up over time while providing hours and hours of imaginative play for your child.
5.0	Used this makeup for my Day of the Dead and Harley Quinn costumes. The color payout is super white and it stays in place really well. I reccomend using the Mehron Colorset Powder with it since it is still a grease paint. The small 2oz container will last you forever.
5.0	So cute and sweet. If you are collecting Grumpy Cat you should get one!
5.0	These were the big hit at my two year old grandson's birthday. Lots of opportunity to be creative.
5.0	Shipped so fast son on top of the world!
5.0	My daughter loves Beanie boos and this has become one of her favorites.  It would be a good gift for a Harry Potter fan.
5.0	This is a very good set especially if you're a ringwraith fan like me.  It comes with Twilight Witchking, Witchking, and a Ringwraith with soft clothes.<br />  The Twilight Witchking is cool but the only problem i had with it is the sword jabbing action.  If you put the Dagger in his right hand and squeeze his legs together(there are no buttons sticking out from his back for once), he turns and gets caught on his long sword handle which can make it bend.<br />  The Witchking is very cool.  He comes with a Morgul sword and a dagger with a retractable blade.  The only problem with me is that the dagger is very big and the retractabe part of the blade is silver while the rest of it is black.  This just for me looks very really weird and different from the Dagger in the movie.  But the cool thing is you can stab Frodo using the sword-lunging action.<br />  What is there to say about the Ringwraith except for it has soft clothes intead of hard and has a very cool sword.  The only Problem is that it is hard to get the sword in and out of his hand which can cause it to bend the handle.  The other thing is that his legs are rubber (because he is meant to ride a horse) and this causes him to fall over a lot when you try to stand him up.
5.0	Sun hits it, it spins why else can you say.
5.0	Just what I expected.  Good transaction.
5.0	Great product for the price. It served its purpose and was very easy to decorate on. I would not purchase this for long term wear.
5.0	I bought this for my granddaughter for Christmas, and she was taking the dog's blood pressure as soon as she opened it!
5.0	If you play a lot of Pokémon and take it with you traveling... spend the money on this product, it's worth it.
5.0	Excellent item, thanks.
5.0	I got this for my 3yr old grandson to sleep in when visiting Gramma.  He takes this over a bed everytime.
5.0	My 3 and 5 year olds love this game. It's by far their favorite game ever. The goal and rules are simple and they completely understand how to play. It teaches color matching, taking turns, winning/losing, and perseverance. It's cute, sturdy, and a lot of fun for our family to play together.
5.0	"Omg! Omg! Omg! I purchased this to prank my 21 and 16 year old. I opened it to see if it really is as disgusting as everyone says... Yup, it smells like rancid fresh cat s***! It's bad! I can't wait to mess with my kids! They tease me all the time about being old, so I plan to \\""crap\\"" my pants on April Fools!"
5.0	great sturdy worth it
5.0	Everything was exactly what was expected!
5.0	Very accurate, and great distance when used with fresh darts.
5.0	I read a lot of reviews before buying this copter.  i am a beginner at this whole flying thing and this little guy is awesome!!!  I have crashed it so many times in my house it should have been totally torn up by now.  I flew it outside once and it did pretty well.  It was a bit windy but i could still control it.<br />Overall, this was a great buy and i am thinking of buying another for my brother too.
5.0	The perfect touch. Matched the football-themed cake we had, as well as all the other football party things.
5.0	This is by far my sons favorite toy!  We stick it to his highchair and he is amazed.  He is 6+ months now and has enjoyed it every day for the last 2 months. I highly recommend this item.  It is a perfect size for the diaper bag, you can bring it with you and keep baby entertained quietly.
5.0	best damn line I've purchased all year
5.0	My daughter is going to be very happy on her birthday!
5.0	Katie is 4 years old and although she loves her zoo, she won't use the cages.  &#34;Animals should always be free!&#34;
5.0	This set came in a good time period. It is a very good amount of bands and they are great colors. It just happened to be delivered on a day she was home sick from school. Made her day a little better.
5.0	It's a timeless classic: i was hooked on it as a kid and now my daughter has fun with it!
5.0	I bought this lamp for my 35yo sister and she loved it. It was entertaining but not annoying which is a hard trick to pull with products like this. I was actually hoping it was more annoying for her sake. But she put it out for a new years eve party on the mantle and it reacted to all the people different moods throughout the night. Good times!
5.0	Very well done, Everyone comments on the quality and look. Hard to make stand without falling. With that said I would still buy.
5.0	This is perfect size for my 18 Month old. The buttons and pedal are easy to push for him. Assembled easily also.
5.0	I have to say, the photos online didn't prepare me for this toy, The box is HUGE compared to my expectations!<br /><br />Anyway, this will look awesome on my shelf! Awesome Awesome Awesome... You have to love the work that the Four Horsemen put into things!
5.0	Just what my son was looking for as our dog ate his!
5.0	perfect addition to the original deck!
5.0	I bought this for my 10 year old daughter for her birthday hoping to interest her in a new hobby ‎that would encourage her creativity and build her self esteem. It definitely served its purpose, ‎as soon as she got, immediately she started working on it and was able to do it all by herself, the ‎instructions are very clear and the fabric comes with finished edges all around so you don't ‎need to hem it. My Daughter loves the nightgown, and is extremely proud that she did it by ‎herself.‎
5.0	Pleasantly surprised.
5.0	I bought another one for my daughter because she is almost done with the first one.  She used it a lot, and I think the paint lasted awhile.  I love the variety of colors.
5.0	Easy to put together.  Seems well made,and most importantly, my daughter loves it.  Love that box is also for storage.
5.0	Our 8 year old wore this for a theme day at summer camp and will be wearing it for halloween.  She loves dressing up and has even got the pirate lingo down.  Seems to be holding up well, which is good, since she wears it often simply for fun
5.0	This was beyond words. The expression on my Grandson's face when he opened the box and saw this swing was worth every penny !  Thank you so much for years of enjoyment to come I am sure !
5.0	My item got lost in the mail, and  rave-nation responded right away and resended me a new pair right away!  I love my new sunglasses!! Thank you!
5.0	If you are trying to decide between Resistance (Standard) or Avalon, they are both great games and I recommend them both.  Most of the core rules are the same, with a few differences.  Overall I think it comes down to the theme.  Do you prefer a more futuristic mission style game or taking up quest with your fellow Knights in hopes to help Arthur.
5.0	This costume was awesome!  My son wears a 10-12 and we ordered the XL.  It fit great and was so cute!!  It is a very nice quality and just a very cute costume!
5.0	My little girl didn't want anything to do with this at first so when she went to sleep i put it in her crib without any other toys to try and get her to give it a shot. later i hear lots of giggling and what do i find. she loves this thing. she is dragging this things everywhere and its holding up so far. 5 stars very well made thank you
5.0	Disturbing beautiful! We love this game!!
5.0	"My 5 yr old son chose \\""Angry Birds\\"" as the theme for his birthday party this year.  I was unable to find a lot of small, inexpensive things in our local party stores to include in goodie-bags for the kids, but stumbled on these stickers on Amazon.  They were bright, colorful and a BIG HIT with the kids.  The fact that there were 75 included for the price, allowed me to give each kid several to take home in their treat bags.  They were a BIG HIT!"
5.0	He loved it. What can you say its a Lego. They have good quality products. Would like to see more ships. The price was great. I looked other places and more expensive
5.0	I got these for my husband's Batman themed birthday party. He loved them!! They are thick and quite nice.
5.0	my neice loves monopoly and Frozen its a win win
5.0	I loved this as much as my kids!  First off, it was very easy to assemble.  It took a little patience to get it to float or hover at the height I wanted it to, but I was impressed.  Second, the kids really love how the Shark swims through the air and follows them around the house, and it is still floating after over a week of abuse!  Third, having this in our home was a very fun experience for adults and kids.  Have thoroughly enjoyed  having it &#34;swim around the house&#34;, definitely worth the money.
5.0	Grandson likes to have more roads for city Legos.
5.0	Lovely Doll, enjoyed by children and adults as well.
5.0	My daughter loves it, she even sleeps with it. when you push its back it makes pony sounds, the horn lights up and it walks.
5.0	My five year old son really enjoys this. He received his set at age 4 and, with the help of an adult, can make all the combinations. By himself he is now experimenting w changing elements in the setup and questioning why it does or doesn't work. We purchased this set or a gift (child turning 7) and it was a hit.
5.0	fun little bobble head. Holding together so far. No complaints
5.0	wow ...great for brushing
5.0	Will take some mild abuse. But have the super glue ready.
5.0	Just the right size for my 15-month-old grandson!  It's easy to hold and pour.
5.0	Just a I prefer Ravensburger puzzles, I also prefer the Puzzle Conserver manufactured by Ravensburger.  White as it leaves the bottle, it dries clear.  I always protect my tabletop from the adhesive from staining by lining it with either plastic or sheets of paper.  The plastic tablecloths from a dollar store work great for this purpose and most often can be reused.  They are large enough to either cut to size or simply fold to the correct size with care.  I also find it beneficial to use a great light so that I can see the thin coat which I apply as opposed to a thicker coat that some generate.  It's also helpful to rinse the sponge applicator in running water and I also seal the bottle in a plastic bag for security.  I highly recommend this conserver to those who enjoy saving their assembled puzzles.
5.0	My great-niece LOVES the turntable--she is going to paint it to match her dollhouse, & was thrilled to receive such a nice surprise.
5.0	It was a gift. My grandson had a great time putting it together
5.0	I got this for my 8-year-old grandson for Christmas and he loves it!  Of course a little birdie had told me that he wanted more Lego City Arctic sets.  He had no difficulty putting it together by himself.
5.0	Projects after projects...  Awesome.  And much more economy than Technics sets.  Let engineering starts young!
5.0	Standard GW model. Needs some redesign in certain parts but even the most inexperienced modeler can fix it with some green/grey stuff
5.0	fantastic item the kids loves it
5.0	This is one item my grandaughter really wanted for two years.  No one really thought she would play with it like she does.  Worth the money, happy with the purchase and delivery.
5.0	My dad has been a paramedic for 30 years so naturally I grew up with THIS exact toy. I couldn't belive my eyes when I saw it I have alot of memories with this. I 100% recommend this product. I'm 20 years old and am a working EMT about to go through paramedic class and I an considering buying it again.
5.0	The penguin is soft, great looking, and absolutely adorable, my little sister loved it and it makes for an excellent present to anyone who likes penguins, or cute plush.
5.0	My grandson loves it, it's a great addition to his collection!
5.0	"I really don't consider these beads \\""toys\\"".  I wouldn't recommend them for any children under the age of 7 or 8.  I bought them for my son to bring to a party.  A good deal for 72 bead necklaces.  His friends loved them."
5.0	I learned to fly with a WL Toys V911, then got a V913 for my second heli. I love the V913, but I love the V912 even more. Same motor as the V913, but much lighter, quicker and faster. It's small enough to fly in my two-car garage, and large enough to handle some wind outdoors. Radio allows flights as far away from you as you want to fly it. I highly recommend this great RC heli.
5.0	My daughter is 6 but my son, 4, and I love them too. We all sit around making fun stuff instead of watching TV.
5.0	The bus is great and the Swim-sational school is awesome.  Hours and hours of entertainment.  Some have complained about it being loud but it doesn't bother me.  I am a retired teacher and I guess I am used to a little noise.
5.0	Randomly shipped it to my friend's doorstep and he loved it
5.0	Absolutely loves the stroller and carrier!  She takes turns taking her Calliou doll and her stuffed froggy for walks in it.
5.0	I love Kangaroo products. I have got a lot of their products and I can tell you that they are made of high quality and they are fun.I decided to get these for my grandson's birthday party. He loves a guitar and since he is only going to be two years old, I think that these will be fun for him. We will have some to go in the goody bags that we are going to make for the other kids can take them home with them.<br /><br />My came in a bag with twelve in it. There are 4 pink, 4 red, 4 purple and 4 blue.<br />Each guitar measures 22-24 inches fully inflated.<br />I am so glad that I received these for free for testing and my honest and unbiased opinion. This is my opinion and mine only. These are awesome. I am so excited to see how the kids will play them and hopefully sing. Kangaroo is a great company.
5.0	My 9 year old son just started watching Dr. Who. He loves this sonic screwdriver. It was one of his favorite Christmas gifts!
5.0	My 3 year old LOVES to take the pieces out and match them up. I sometimes put it in the wrong spot on purpose and he fixes it. It's very brightly colored and I got all three puzzles.. The only down side is when unwrapping the plastic wrap, the puzzle pieces would get stuck onto the plastic wrap and a little annoying to take off. Other than that they are great puzzles!
5.0	We got the red tea pot. I bought it for my son for Christmas. It's so nice to have a tea set that isn't &#34;girly.&#34; Highly recommend.
5.0	My son used this on his sea turtle diorama for school..Very real looking and detailed.  It helps to show the stages of a sea turtles life!
5.0	perfect for a peter pan fan
5.0	My 6 year old daughter and 9 year old son loved this advent calendar. They took turns opening the windows each day and building the lego inside.  We will definitely get next years.  It is worth the money!
5.0	This guys a little stiff &#34;kingly&#34; looking.  Able to come off the horse, but cape keeps the shape.  Fun pieces.
5.0	My 4 year old daughter loves it. It's cute.
5.0	have fun everywhere !!! simple, small and so funny !!!
5.0	I purchased this game 'just because' for my family.  We were instantly hooked!  My children are all under 10, so it was a bit challenging to learn how to play at first, but that's what made them love it.  All of them felt like they were so grown up.  The game and box are very high quality and the instructions were beautifully illustrated and easy to understand.<br /><br />My only regret is that I think the Europe edition is more complicated for younger children due to the use of the old names for the cities.  Maybe I should have gone with the US version instead, but this version has extra elements to the game that the US version doesn't.  So, for that reason I'm happy with the selection.<br /><br />We ended up purchasing the expansion pack and I'm glad that we did.  After playing it without the extra cards for a while, the expansion pack breathed new life into this game.  Our 5 year old can't play the game, but enjoyed being the dealer and helping us put our trains on the track.  This is a great game.  Coupled with the expansion pack, it will be a family favorite for years.
5.0	Bought these to put into goody bags for my 2 year old's birthday party - great value and all the kids loved them.
5.0	Did an Alice and wonderland Halloween Costume Theme for my kids the worked Wonderfully!
5.0	This model is one of the most amazing ones on the market. It looks very realistic and is quite big. Although I am a big fan of the LEGO brand, the price of this Mega Bloks model is unbeatable. <br />Great for people of all ages, not just kids.
5.0	My son loves it!<br />It is small, but perfect size for little ones.<br />Only complaint is the the colors are so similar...Maybe I don't need 64ct, 18 ct version is enough.
5.0	Everyone should have one, but it is not mechanical and a bit top heavy.
5.0	This is a fun book.  I introduced my 6 year old granddaughter to cootie catchers with this book.  She now knows how to make them from paper and she really enjoys the entire concept.
5.0	What more can you say. I actually enjoyed helping her, and I don't usually care for puzzles. I would recommend it.
5.0	Awesome game. It is a safe and fun way to have a dunk tank. The kids will have a great time! I recommend this product for school and church events.
5.0	Bought it as a surprise for my daughter who likes to do crafts.  She picked it up right away and started using it and hasn't stopped.  Great purchase.
5.0	This was a good bargain for the money and is really cute!  It is very good for a little girl who loves Pocahantas
5.0	This was an awesome set. Very sturdy, to me, and had a good assortment of characters (Peter Quill &#60;a.k.a. Star- Lord&#62;, Gamora, Ronan, Drax, and the Sakaaran. I paid the original $74.99, which is, to me, a perfect price. Getting it for $66 is an even better steal. The ship is pretty screen accurate and has many interactive parts (opening roof, moveable pilot seat, adjusting wings) and design parts (stickers, tape machine). The Sakaaran ship is pretty cool, though I feel the cannons on that should have been used on the Milano, and vice versa. But, if you are going to buy this, I would recommend also purchasing the Toys R Us Rocket Raccoon special polybag, which no only contains the lego Raccoon with his Gaurdians suit (instead of his orange jumpsuit), and a mini Groot (like in the movie) It also has more stickers to put on the Milano to make it look more screen right, like a &#34;I Love the 80s&#34; bumper sticker and blast marks and wear and tear. Overall, a good set, and a steal at $66
5.0	Got here from China in just a few days!  Works great
5.0	OK, I'm a bit of a stinker so when I saw this toy, I knew my nephew's kid would love it. I also knew it would drive him crazy as she blasted her voice around the house. Sure enough, the kid had a ball but my nephew quickly made her take it outside.
5.0	This is a really good cube and I would highly recommend getting one if you like changing the cubes tensions. Overall this cube is a great corner cutter which I personally think comes in handy.
5.0	This is a terrific expansion for the Railways of the World series of train games.  Already in 2008 a map for Europe had been published as an expansion for Railroad Tycoon, under the name Rails of Europe. After the initial publication of Railways of the World, the Railways of Europe expansion underwent a few further minor tweaks into its current form.<br /><br />Several new rules appeared in this expansion for the first time, such as permanent major lines, more choice for Railroad Baron cards, new Railroad Operation cards, clearer hex classification and costs, and improved component quality. Most of these changes and improvements were taken over when Railroad Tycoon was reimplemented as Railways of the World, and became the new base game for the series.<br /><br />The Europe map is particularly ideal for 3-4 players, although it can be played just fine with only 2 players as well. It is an excellent alternative to the Eastern U.S. map, and if you are looking for a change of pace, adding this expansion to the base game will give more variety, balance, scalability, and challenge. The layout of the cities and terrain is more symmetrical, and because the cities are more sparse and building track is more costly, it offers a tighter and tougher game that proves very rewarding and fun to play.  Highly recommended! - EndersGame @ BGG
5.0	Grand babies loved this gift.
5.0	although one side has no pressing it's still really sweet. i love the feel and design of it
5.0	Neopets is fun, when TNT is not being a pain. It is terribly addicting, and NeoCash is the worst... and yet here I am, week after week, buying this NeoCash card.<br /><br />You get a fun Neocash item, 5 boxes, and 2,650 NeoCash. And then you come back and buy another. And another. And another.<br /><br />I wish that the shipping were free with Prime.<br /><br />Anyway, I've never had a problem with this card. It works as needed, and I get to avoid the embarrassment of buying it at my local CVS. Everyone's happy... except for my bank.
5.0	"I bought this table for my 2 year old son.  He loves it!  The first week we got it he cried everyday when he had to leave the table to go to daycare!    It was very easy to put together.  Putting the stickers on without getting any bubbles was the most difficult part and it wasn't bad.  I love that there aren't any loose pieces to worry about!  And that any \\""matchbox\\"" size car or train will fit.  At the end of the day I can just toss all of his cars inside and put the cover on and we're ready to go the next day.    It's very sturdy.  My son is 32 lbs and he climbs on the table quite often.  I highly suggest this table for any car/train crazy kid!  And for any parent who is sick of trying to find all the missing pieces of race track/train tracks!"
5.0	I like this item on the picture and saw.  I am happy with the item I received because the color is the same. I like aurora stuff animal and I believe that their products are reliable.
5.0	I M SURE THAT MU GRANDSON WILL LOVE THIS.
5.0	Love, love, love this dress. It's absolutely adorable. I got this as well as the Disguise brand Elsa costume, and this one was better by a long shot. I look forward to seeing how it holds up tonight.
5.0	This board came today, it is very nice and has the best and most elegant solution to the issue of placeholders for number possibilities. The gold spikes are a great idea. Just stick one more in on a tiny grid and you know what numbers you are considering at a glance --- no scribbling on paper on the side.. no searching for tiny tiles.<br /><br />  What a great idea! it sold me and now that I have the board, I think my instincts were right on! Get this. You will not be disappointed.<br /><br />  The board itself is very nice. Heavy and attractive.<br /><br />  I am very glad I called Everston and added an order of elastic bands for the pieces!. The company was completely responsive and just added the elastics on to my Amazon order. The board shipped so fast, I had this board as quickly as if it had been sent via Prime. Great product, fabulous customer service.<br /><br />  I find that with elastic bands on, the pieces are very tough to jostle. I have 2 young sons and so that matters! Indeed I may call the company and ask them for an extra set of pieces altogether so I don't have to sweat the fact that my kids find them facinating :)<br /><br />  Great board! Great company! I really feel like I got my money's worth.
5.0	GREAT TOY. FUNCO IS THE BEST. ALL THE HEROES LOOK GREAT, ALL OF THEM. WELLL,,, EXCEPT FOR THE HUMAN NIGK FURY, IT'S THE WRONG C0L0R. I HOPE THEY MAKE PERRY WHITE, WHITE AGAIN. I ALSO MISS THE ORIGINAL NICK FURY. TRY *AMAZON PRIME* IT'S FAST AND AWESOME. SUPER-FAST JUST LIKE SUPERMAN.THANKS
5.0	This is the 2nd bunny !  The first bunny is so worn !!  It is my granddaughter's security bunny !  If & when it falls apart & can't be sewn, we have the 2nd as backup !  This bunny is so soft & light weight.  She snuggles with it in her crib.  It is the only item in her crib besides a pacifier.
5.0	I use these in my kids classes and with my grandkids. They never tire of playing with these.
5.0	Popular gift to give for  7 to 10 year olds.  Purchased at least 3 times because kids love it.  Any little artist will really like this  set.
5.0	Fits my red S107 excellent!
5.0	My daughter loves them!!
5.0	Got what i wanted and asked for
5.0	This is Jungle Disguise Dutch from Predator. This is how Dutch is for most of the third act of the film, covered in mud to block the Predator's heat vision and armed with weapons made from the jungle. The mud on Dutch's face has a translucent covers his flesh tones but not his features, and the bloody lip he has sustained from being punched in the face by the Predator looks great against the brown mud. The detail of the leaves stuck to his chest and varying thickness of debris and mud layered on his chest, arms and face look incredibly realistic. The sculpt by Kyle Windrix and Trevor Zammit is spot on, ultra realistic. Not to mention the stellar paint job by Jon Wardell and Geoffrey Trapp, the layers of detail on this paint job are really impressive.<br /><br />The figure comes with a torch (which they did a pretty good job on the flame portion of), a bow and 3 arrows (all three of which are slightly different rather than the typical same cast and molding for all three like every other action figure, so major points for that. As well as a working string for the bow, awesome) and a spear. All of these accessories are movie accurate, the paint detail on the bow, arrows, spear and torch is just awesome. The camo pants are muddied with just a bit of the actual camouflage still seen through the translucent muddy paint wash. The boots look great, his hair looks great. My only real one true complaint is the card the figure is blistered to. I realize it's keeping in line with all of the other 7 series that have been done so far, but to me the card is a bit plain. A somewhat generic side profile of a Predator and some jungle vegetation. I personally would prefer a more 1980's looking design, or a more movie poster type look to the card. Then again, I think I am only one of a few who actually cares about the design of cards that figures are blistered to. An aesthetic that I think has been grossly overlooked in the last 15 years of action figure production.<br /><br />The articulation is also brilliant, granted I never take my figures out of the package, you can tell the figure has great articulation. Ball jointed head, wrists, ankles. A socket waist just like old G.I. Joe figures for max flexibility for the torso, ball jointed hips and hinged knees and shoulders. Other cool details are facial stubble, and wrist watch. This figure is just brilliant, I really can't praise it enough. Any fan or collector of action figures really needs to get one of these for his collection, any fan of Predator needs this figure. This is a must have figure from this series, and iconic image of Arnold from the end of Predator, just an impeccable job on this figure and series 8 and 9 in general. I am curious to see if and what series 10 will be. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.culation is also brilliant, granted I never take my figures out of the package, you can tell the figure has great articulation.

5.0	This model from Code 3 is very hard to find and when you do you will pay a lot for it.  Amercom has come as close as possible to the replicas from Code 3 as far as quality and detailing and the prices are very reasonable.
5.0	"There gets to a point where if you have nothing nice to say, keep your opinions to yourself. That being said, theres nothing \\""wrong\\"" with this little character and no, its not breaking any laws where it was created that I could find. Moreover, with the amount of Lego knock-offs sold at places like Walgreens and subsequent licensing, I am doubtful if Lego would care if there were licensing issues with Nintendo on the lines of creative license--this was made by a young person for fun and he evidently put the high price just to see if it would sell. The only thing preferably that needs to change is the PRICE--but if you think you have talent--then why not?<br /><br />Personally my son plays with these Legos and the like non-stop, they are the most creative of toys I find and also they lend to the imagination, which is in short supply with too many kids these days, so for whomever created this little Wario--more power to  you and lets see MORE creations--but at a reasonable price so we fans can purchase a few of them!"
5.0	khans ship is a great addition
5.0	Typical Breyer quality.
5.0	"Very soft and cuddly. Says a couple of things: \\""Bon appétit!\\"" (with the correct French pronounciation!!), \\""Hey, Emile!\\"", \\""Yum!\\"", \\""I've got to teach you about food!\\"", \\""That, oh no, I bet Emile would eat it!\\"".    I thought it was bit expensive and nearly did not buy it because of that. But I do not regret it! It's a favorite toy at home!"
5.0	Who doesn't love Crayola?....
5.0	This was my daughter's favorite toy for Christmas (she's 3).  I love that even when she locks the key in the jewelry box that I can still open it and retrieve the key.
5.0	Easy to transform and my son likes that it has a weapon
5.0	I purchased this in Dec. of 2012 for my husband.  Not only has he has had so much fun with it but so have friends who visit.  Naturally their kids fly it better than any of us.  It's taken a few bumps and crashes and is still flying.  It doesn't take long to recharge.  Although a several hour charge is best.
5.0	My granddaughter loves the skylanders game and this is just what she needed to make the game even more fun for her.
5.0	Great batteries. These work exactly as stated. I bought them for my V911 pro. They are a little bit bigger than the stock batteries, but also had a little bit more life to them. I didn't time it, but it was definitely noticeable. They seem to charge in about the sam amount of time. Being a little bigger though, they did alter the flight of the helicopter slightly. Not a big deal, had to add a little forward trim is all. I would definitely recommend these to anyone who has a V911 and is looking for some extra batteries.
5.0	They served their function well
5.0	Sent quickly. Packed well. This is a gorgeous doll, from her purple eyes, strong eye make-up, wonderful long red wig, to all of the many aspects that make up her fantastic stock. Wonderful pullip!! (I appreciate the idea of the wings, though they don't quite work. They aren't really needed though.)
5.0	My daughter loves My Little Pony asked me what Christmas gift when I saw him I loved just hope the day will be no Christmas for your gift and see her happy face ..
5.0	My daughter's in love!
5.0	I have two sons one is 5 and the other is 3. I've purchased the Horses Breeds floor puzzle [[ASIN:B002TKLMRY Shure Horse Breeds Floor Puzzle]] for the youngest one and got this one for the eldest. It's a great product. The illustrations are gorgeous and the quality is very good. I like the fact that it comes on a wooden box for easy storage and has an inside division for each puzzle. My son can assemble the puzzle on the box cover.  Is great!
5.0	"I personally have no neck and when I saw this game I was overjoyed.\\""Finally\\"" I thought, \\""a game system made for me.\\"" While I am usually unable to enjoy the things in life that others take for granted (turtlenecks, neckties, etc.) this plug and play game system brought a tear to eye. For me, to be able to play games like others. Best game system ever! 10 out of 10."
5.0	Product was as listed NIB. My son loved that there were three different lego sets to build in one box.
5.0	works great for such a small light
5.0	My two year old grandson loves construction equipment. This set is sturdy with moving pieces. He loves learning and using the names of everything as well as having them work together on a job!
5.0	It was just what I wanted!
5.0	WOW!  This WAS the hit of the party!  Everyone in AWE of the AWESOME CAKE!  It was pretty spectacular and impressed all my daughter high school friends. (It's hard when you're 50, to impress high school girls........)  SUPER FAST DELIVERY, VERY DEPENDABLE SELLER, VERY NICE HIGH QUALITY product........everything as expected!  Works great on a plain flat sheet cake!
5.0	Just as advertised -- and a huge hit with my granddaughter.
5.0	"Since this is a base set for the game Dominion, and includes all the cards you need to play, I'll include some of my comments from my review on the other base set:<br /><br />\\""I play this game with friends on Saturday afternoons. It's quick and full of strategy. There is a randomization element for the cards used that ensures that you get a different game almost every time, even if you don't buy any of the expansions.<br /><br />The game has a set of mechanics that will come naturally to people who are good at math and computer science. I was introduced to it by friends who work at Google, where apparently it is a huge hit, and with good reason. It helps you practice how to execute sets of steps in an order that comes out advantageous for you. There's also a lot of different ways to combine the cards for unexpected effects. This takes well to sharpening--as well as instilling--a keen sense of the kind of thinking one needs to make software or understand mathematics.<br /><br />Just as it appeals to people who think in this way, I'm sure the game is excellent at encouraging children to develop these thought patterns, as it is fun and full of attractive-looking cards. The basic idea is that you are a medieval landholder and you are working to expand your \\""dominion\\""; the lands, townsfolk, and other things over which you rule. This means that as you play the game, you acquire more cards, and these cards help you acquire yet further cards until you certain card piles are exhausted. When that is over, you tally up the victory point cards within your assembled deck and whichever player has the most points wins.<br /><br />Some examples of what play is like: There are many interesting mechanics, but a lot of the game comes down to card counting. Being able to remember how many points you and other players have purchased is a big advantage. Since point cards do not do anything until the end of the game, one has to moderate the rate at which points are acquired to make sure that your deck doesn't slow down. There's a lot to think about. If you enjoy a game that makes you think, you will love this.\\""<br /><br />The only thing, really, that sets Dominion: Intrigue apart from the regular Dominion base set is that more of the cards focus on interacting with other players cleverly rather than trying to compete via an independent strategy. Whether or not you enjoy this is entirely a matter of personal preference, but since \\""interaction\\"" in Dominion often focuses on attack cards, some players may find this set more mean-spirited and \\""nasty\\"" than the regular Dominion base set. If you want something a little more edgy and interactive, start here. If you're looking for cerebral and more \\""personal\\"" of a game, start with the original base set."
5.0	Best Quadcopter to date for the money! The picture attached shows the SYMA quadcopter up about 200 feet or more. The house on the left with the orange roof is on a hill about 75 feet above me and my transmitter and as you can see I am way above that roof.  I have 2 helicopters, 2 hubsan quadcopters, 1 with a 2mp camera and one without. I purchased the SYMA x5c from an Ebay seller who was in Calif. Didn't want to wait the 30-45days from China. The Syma came with the landing gear attached, I didn't need to install the blade guards because I am a veteran RC pilot. I used one of the already charged batteries from my hubsan. Yes they fit fairly well but flight time is less because they are only 380ma. The SYMA X5 flies great, better than the hubsan x4 and it is twice the size so you can see it better in the sky. Camera works great, the directions say to use the top right button but that is incorrect, the SYMA X5c is the newer model and there is a slide button on the front panel, slide it up to take a photo, slide it down to turn on the video. Video is 1280x 720 avi files. Same as the hubsan in HD. Here are my Pro's and Cons:<br /><br />Pros:<br />Copter handles beautiful, love the feel, fun to fly<br />More stable than any $60 quad I have flown.<br />Like the ability to turn on the camera remotely<br />Can also take pictures remotely<br />Size is perfect, about 12&#34;, white and easy to find<br />Well built frame and camera videos are very good 2mp HD<br />Battery easy to swap<br />I have had some crashes without the guards and the copter handles it<br />I don't think there is another quadcopter this good with these features for $60 anywhere<br /><br />Cons:<br />Flight time is about 5-7 minutes<br />Copter blades shutoff when battery is low<br />(on the Hubsan you lose altitude and the lights flash to warn you)<br /><br />Still loving this machine. There is a easy range modification that will change your controls from 30-50 meters to 80-85 meters.<br />Just google it.<br />Also before flying this machine you should sit it on a level ground. Turn on the SYMA quadcopter, then turn on the transmitter. Next move the left control forward and backward. This will connect your transmitter to the quadcopter. Next hold both controls in the 5 o'clock position and wait till the light change from flashing to steady on the quadcopter. This procedure resets the quadcopter. It works great but you must be on level ground. I did this on my driveway which is on an angle and the copter flew to one side. I did it again on level ground and it hovered perfectly! Loving this Quadcopter! More updates to come.<br /><br />UPDATES:<br />I've made the easy tramsmitter modification and my control distance is way over 300 feet. I have flown this Quadcopter higher than I have ever flown any UDI copters or Hubsan Quadcopters. This is truly the best Quadcopter I have flown to date. Night flying is fun also, led's at the bottom of the unit help you keep the quad aligned in the right direction. The quadcopter is a fantastic deal! The motors are powerful, the 500ma battery gives you 7 minutes of flight time. I have ordered two 600ma batteries. What else can I say I haven't flown any of my other copters and really non of them are as much fun as this one!<br /><br />UPDATE:<br />Some experienced flyer I am. A gust of wind caught the quadcopter, I miss judged and it got caught in a tree branch. I put it in expert mode and it broke free, fell to the ground without a scratch! Lucky me.
5.0	Colorful. Challenging. And Zelda.
5.0	Bought this for my niece, who is going through a cheetah phase (last year it was parrots) and she loves it.  It shipped speedily.
5.0	I will be writing this review based on a set of criteria and scores. Keep in mind that not all products bought are from the same store/company and the experience may be different for you.<br /><br />Scores are out of 5.<br /><br />Delivery: 5/5 (Super satisfied!)<br />In fact for my delivery in particular, it arrived BEFORE the estimated arrival time. Of course, this depends on who you are buying from and where you live. Make sure to test buy items from various sellers to see which ones have better delivery times. In addition, make sure their main ship carrier is from USPS or UPS.<br /><br />Packaging: 5/5<br />Items were in a big yellow envelope secured/protected with a generous amount of bubble rap which kept the cards in tact.<br /><br />General Notes:<br />Diverse set of cards. I received two booster packs with the same Pokémon on the cover (not too picky about that). Received some dazzling Holographic and EX Cards. Satisfied. Service overall made a collector very happy.
5.0	We spend hours at a time several nights a week playing this game! Some games go quick otherw can take a while because you never know how many cards will get spit out!
5.0	My grandson loved it.
5.0	My son loves this and plays with it allll the time!
5.0	Your Army is ready to attack,but you have to be ready to move fast and get the artillery into position over ruff terrain..Your soldiers are on the ready,but even they can't move those big guns..What do you do??<br />Call up Tim Mee head quarters and tell them send  down those new jeeps you've been hearing so much about.That's the ticket....<br />Now back to reality..<br /><br />These are well made ,smooth rolling ,with the cool ol' stickers we remember from our childhood.Great addition to your fun childhood memories.They look great along side your tanks..
5.0	Extraordinary game. The fact that you never know where the fire will begin at each round makes the game very exciting because you have to take care of the potential victims and control the fire as well. The many levels of difficulty from familiar rules to hard mode on experienced rules garantee everyone can play this game. Lots of expansions and the unpredictable elements put this game among the best of all cooperative games, side by side with Pandemic, for instance.
5.0	These little toys are so cute and our children love playing with them. They love how the toys each change from the pups &#34;gear&#34; being popped open, to closed again.
5.0	My son loves Matt Hardy, and so does a lot of folks.  The stores did not have what I wanted, but Amazon.com had exactly what I needed.  Thanks again.
5.0	Got them today. Awesome.
5.0	"We gave my daughter Baby Tad for Christmas when she was 13 months old.  I bought it based on all the good reviews, but was  a little skeptical.  At that age, she was only slightly interested, but at about 16 or 17 months she started really enjoying pressing the different buttons and giving him lots of kisses.  My daughter always went to sleep on her own without a problem since she was 2 months old, so I hadn't used him in the crib.  Lately though (at 20 months) she hates to go to sleep when we are still awake even if she is tired.  So I had the idea of putting him in the crib and turning on the nightime music and it works great.  She actually tells me \\""Bye-bye\\"" when I turn him on and she goes to sleep without a fuss."
5.0	was a gift and he loved it.
5.0	My daughter, nephew & I really like all the Lee Publication magnetic sets. Great for the car, restaurants, waiting rooms, etc.
5.0	i bought this set since it seemed like a good set to start with. I got it quick and fast and it is a lot bigger than it appears i think for the price its a good cost 5 mini figs and a 365 piece castle. the only castle structure for the dragon knights a must have in my opinion. it comes with almost the same number of mini figs as the Lego kings castle just three less for 50 us dollars cheaper
5.0	This Batman Tonner Doll was delivered on time and in excellent condition. The box was placed in a bigger box to protect this collectible doll.  The product is very well made and will give my family years of enjoyment. Thank you.
5.0	Daughter spins around the house singing the songs to teen beach movie.  Per her &#34; the best movie ever made&#34;.
5.0	This item was purchase as a gift but had purchased the clown fish for my child, neat toy, lasted about 2 weeks on one fill up with regular helium, the remote control was very receptive,
5.0	I love this clock and so does my three year old.  It can help teach colors, shapes as well as time.  Very durable.  It's a favorite in our house.
5.0	Cat was as described and on time.
5.0	Bought this puzzle with another one as a great activity to challenge my son. It was an added bonus that it had animals since he loves them a lot. It him less that two hours to complete at 5 years old.
5.0	Got this & 72 piece small set for grandson & he loves them!
5.0	The most awesome card game I have ever played and owned.
5.0	Much like the others, I bought 2 bats and both came in pink. My students didn't mind, as they are still just bats and balls and are perfect for what they are used for! Great quality and more sturdy than I had imagined for the price. Love!
5.0	I ordered this from Amazon, but never received the item, it disappeared in the mail, I brought this again for my granddaughter for her first birthday,  she loved it, and was fascinated by the lights and danced to the music, I read the negative comments and did see anything close to it.
5.0	I've bought many rc helicopters and they were nothing but a wast of money- they were too hard for my 9 yr old to learn to control. As a matter of fact none of the Air Hogs products that I've bought haver ever worked or held up to normal use. I was skeptical when buying this one, but it was $10 at Rite Aid, so I gave it a try. It took a little getting use to, but within 20 minutes my son was navigating it through the entire house. He's crashed it into the wall and entertainment center a few times, but it's still going strong. I even went back and bought more for the Christmas Angels!
5.0	This was a gift and they LOVED it!
5.0	Code worked perfectly, love the pet, card delivered promptly.  I don't play the card game, but I loooove the pet ;)
5.0	great size and good colors
5.0	There is nothing like watching your 4 year old truly believe he is Woody in the flesh. The only flaw was it ran a bit small but it might be because my son is above average in height.
5.0	So much bigger than I thought, and SO well stuffed. The only downside is that the 4th-dimensional pocket feels kind of flimsy. I'm probably going to avoid putting anything in it.
5.0	made a larger order between several places and this came in a day after i got the first cards. pritty good i'd say. its the only white shock land i don't have in it, until now :)
5.0	My Granddaughter is 3 years old and has autism and that is what she wanted and thanks to you all,she got it!!
5.0	this is another fun accessory for the Fly game pen. My kids love this little extra for their pens. They range in ages from 8-14. You can't go wrong with this game pad. It just adds to the fun of the FLY
5.0	These helicopters are fun.  They are lighweight and a litte dainty.  Definitely for older kids that won't squash them!  As with most toys, the new wears off pretty quickly but overall they were fun.
5.0	Had so much fun using this at a bachelorette party! I love that the guns can be reused with new cartridges. The shipping was quick and everything worked as promised.
5.0	Lily is so cute and simple.  My daughter has had her since she was born and started enjoying her when she was about 6 months old.  She is now 11 months and loves the fact that she can now make Lily sing (I don't think she knows how she does it as she appears surprised everytime).  She loves to hear Lily laugh at the end of the song and always laughs with her.  Lily only sings one song, and although it can be annoying to me, my daughter loves knowing what to expect from her.
5.0	Gund's snuffle species of bear are IMO the cutest and best shape.  A combination of lazy, fluffy looking bear shape modeled after the crescent moon.  The 30th anniversary XL brown one is amazing!
5.0	Totally fun and hilarious.  Played it with teenagers, parents, and grandparents.  All had fun.... if you don't mind risqué material.
5.0	Arived on time and was properly packed and protected. Like new,  very happy with the service from this provider. thanks
5.0	Perfect for our toddler that loves to play with magnets on our fridge! Lowercase letters are too small for her, but we'll save them as a new toy when she's not putting things in her mouth!     Good quality and cute!
5.0	My 2.5 year old grandson loves this--puts it together in minutes but keeps his attention for long long spans
5.0	This item is awesome it was easy to put together the figures are adorable.grandma abd grandson have been playing pirates this week,I had to call their customer  srvice department about the poles and they explained that the ship is made to break away if a child trips,the base is solid wood,it is so well made,we found a site that has doll size items and we made a treasure map.I truly reccommend this and I love Melissa and Doug items because you no that they are concerned with chld aftey,their customer service is wonderful..I give this item 10 stars
5.0	This is a great set! The camo pattern is very nice and vibrant, darker then what the picture shows. This is basically two large window curtains with loops all the way around so it is very versatile. It comes with plastic clothes pins, rope and large suction cups with hooks. It is all decent quality. We used our set on my sons new bunk bed to make the lower bunk like a tent. Looks great, and he loves it. It is slightly see through from the inside.
5.0	Great card. Pokemon's still a worldwide sensation all these years later. Gotta catch em all!
5.0	I do not know how to 'grade' these LEGO items.  Therefore I cant say it got 5 stars for the product itself.  But, our grandson is deep into the LEGO things...  and especially the Star Wars ones.  He was VERY PLEASED with this gift! Seemed to have no problem putting it together - - - he looked at the instructions with it... and put it together right away!  He is 8.  The 5 star is because he thought it was wonderful... and as many as he has . .  he would be the one to KNOW if they are great or not!
5.0	Hello...I received today, I am glad it all came good and complete (in a different package) but came everything and well ... Thanks
5.0	We really love this chair. I bought this chair for my 18 month old and the butterfly version for my three year old daughter. They are very sturdy and don't tip over.  I love that they fold so compactly. I was able to put two chairs in the basket beneath my stroller and roll them around the fairgrounds and a 4th of July parade. My only complaint is that the drink holder in not large enough to hold their kleen canteen water bottles. Only cups and bottles with a smaller diameter will fit in the holder.
5.0	I've been involved in theatre for over 30 years and have made and remade hundreds of theatre costumes. I bought this one for a school production and was shocked at the quality. It is very well-made and true to size, and looked wonderful on stage. It also looks good if your character will be seen up close as a &#34;real-life&#34; elf.  I thankfully had to do very little altering and the costume was made so that what I did have to do was extremely easy. I heartily recommend this product.
5.0	These decorations are very pretty.  I love how they swirl around.  perfect match with the 1st communion banner I bought to go along with these.
5.0	this was a gift and I have  positive feedback on it
5.0	It's small but very cute boot.. The 8 inch is measured from his tip of tail to the head
5.0	Bought this for my dad for Christmas.  He usually beats my mom, my sister and I at most games, but this one gives us all a fair advantage :)<br /><br />Arrived on time and just as expected.
5.0	My son loves these things!  And he's going to be so happy and surprised on July 26th when he gets a ton of these for his 11th Birthday!  :)
5.0	Great quality. Very cute!
5.0	I love seeing the picture come together...I am addicted to these puzzles, this is my 4th one by this company<br /><br />A real treat....fun and addicting
5.0	Well made and really cute. Quite big, too.
5.0	My son loves spinning all the toys on the front and is using it to learn how to walk. I would use it supervised at all times for safety.
5.0	best game ever invented it have 3 steps to challange you and you have to find the answer it have tno answer with it
5.0	Purchased these for my son's birthday and they were the life of the party. These and gummy worm cake! Oh Yeah!
5.0	An Easter present for our Grandson - he loves Diesel and will now be able to play and talk with him
5.0	"Even better than Scrabble, you build words on the board AND build words \\""up\\"" by adding letters over existing words.  So \\""tree\\"" becomes \\""free\\"" and \\""braces\\"" becomes \\""blades\\"".  The scoring might be a little too easy, but if you're hard core, you can use the point values from Scrabble to raise the score difficulty.  The board is small so you have to start thinking up instead of out fairly soon into the game, and the game doesn't drag on for too long.  It is addictive and you will not look at words the same way again."
5.0	I've worn the stickers down on this cube. It was tensioned perfectly when I received it and it rarely pops. I just have to clean and lube it every couple hundred solves!
5.0	This is a very nice set and makes playing Dominos a whole lot more fun!  The quality of these is very good.  I would recommend this set to anyone who plays dominos.  Thank you.
5.0	My grandson absolutely adored it. He kissed her and would not let go of her while trick or treating!
5.0	I got this for a kid's Pirate themed pool party and they were very impressed.
5.0	My four year old girl loves it very much! It's in good quality, and help her create many stuff. After she mastering it, 108 pieces seem not to be enough!
5.0	If want something small fast and durable, then buy this car and get the lipo batteries for it too. I had trouble trying avoid trampling the stray neighborhood chiwawa dogs with this little car, because it is so fast!
5.0	Perfect fit very fast shipping
5.0	Only problem I am having with the game is I cant find booster packs in my home town.
5.0	We have several of the single ones of these floats. The kids love this double float..actually young adults and they love the cooler. The floats made by this company are very durable and have held up for many years. Highly recommend.
5.0	First of all this was a puzzle NOT a toy.  It is very well constructed , realistic and gorgeous once done.  It was a lot of fun to do.  My husband and I enjoyed doing it together.
5.0	This was a Christmas gift for my six year old granddaughter.  She loves books and loves to read and she loved this bookmark the minute she saw it!
5.0	Thematic and stunningly large and perfect for a party!! They taste good!! We love them for our sons first birthday party! They expire within a year so be sure to order close to time!
5.0	I got this for my son's first birthday. i had seen a friend get it for their daughter 4 years ago and it was a hit. My son loved it as well. the seat is nice and low so they can get on adn off with ease. It is very cute and very light! Easy to move from room to room. My 5 year old even enjoys rocking on it every once in awhile.
5.0	This locker is a must for kids that have a collection of Beyblades. Keeps them organized and safe from breakage or loss. Includes Torch Aries making this a good value.
5.0	My daughter had great fun with them, and these are her first glider princesses. Good purchase and satisfied.
5.0	I got this in the mail pretty quick, all 60 card sleeves were in mint condition also. I like them a lot, The colors on all of the sleeves are very good and all of the sleeves have 3 pretty and cute Anime girls on them too.  They all fit in playing cards or trading cards like Pokémon and, Cardfight Vanguard, Yu-Gi-Oh, Magic cards, these are excellent to have if your a Anime fan or if you want great cards sleeves for you cards.  : )
5.0	Great value with lots of room inside.
5.0	Ball is for my granddaughter for Christmas. She will love it. Ball does everything it was advertised to do. Came in perfect condition. Thank you.
5.0	We bought this private jet, the 5811, and the larger model 4310 commercial jet for our twin 4-year-old sons, as well as the airline terminal, tower, and some accessory pieces. They absolutely LOVE the whole set, but they especially love the planes. They are so realistic and spark our boys' imaginations! The private jet is about 2/3 the size of the commercial jet and is a bit easier for the boys to hold for pretend flying; however, they do sometimes fight over the larger one simply because it is larger.<br /><br />Note that the plane does take a good 30 minutes or more to put together, so I recommend assembling it BEFORE your child sees it. (We wrapped empty boxes for them to open and then surprised them with the assembled toys).<br /><br />The only flaw, which most other customers have also noted, is that the wheels and the tail wing tend to pop off too easily. It's easy to put back on, but I wish Playmobil had given this more thought. The boys don't care though and I simply pop them back on whenever this happens, which is at least daily. Fortunately, the private jet seems to have less of this problem than the commercial jet, which has more pieces to pop off. All in all, I am very glad to have purchased this and our boys are getting lots of great pretend play out of them. PS...These products are considerably cheaper on Playmobil's website. Hopefully, Amazon starts selling this instead of 3rd party stores, so we customers can get free shipping AND good prices!
5.0	came quickly, exactly as ordered.  I ordered the grizzly and the timber wolf to complete a second collection for my daughter, and I was very satisfied with the speed.  The coins were perfect to, what more can I say, they're coins, bu condition.
5.0	The picture is even cuter up close. I really like Tom Wood's art. He captures real animal expressions and looks, and manages to make them cute while still looking like real animals.<br />I've been very pleased with Sunsout puzzles, especially the quality of the pieces. I've glued and framed several.<br />I bought this as a gift, so I cannot comment on the specific difficulty. Sunsout 500-550 piece puzzles are generally enjoyable and not overly difficult. Judging by the picture, this is likely in that category.
5.0	Back when Batman Returns was first released in 1992, the only Penguin figure that was available was a repaint of a previously existing figure Kenner had released years before. Consequently, neither Danny DeVito's likeness nor costume was featured in the action figure that was billed as the official 'Batman Returns' Penguin'.  It was a low, cheap move by Kenner who developed a bad reputation for recycling old figures & playsets like the 1983 Ewok Village playset they infamously sold as the Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves Sherwood Forest playset in 1991 with only the addition of green plastic leaves to differentiate between the two.<br /><br />Fast forward 22 years and we are finally treated to an actual Danny DeVito Batman Returns Penguin action figure that looks fantastic! The likeness to Danny DeVito's appearance and costume in the film are uncanny.  Bravo to the DC Multiverse toy line for bringing this iconic film character to life in action figure form.
5.0	Proudly displayed in my office!
5.0	My 4-yr-old daughter has a number of the 4 inch princess dolls with the clip on dresses.  This fit in perfectly with the rest of our &#34;kingdom&#34;.  It was very easy to assemble and since it's not very bit, it's easy to store.
5.0	My kids are two GSDs. They love chasing bubbles so I purchased these bubbles and the battery powered bubble machine and we have a blast. I am sure they are great for kids as well. These are the most hearty bubbles I have ever purchased.
5.0	Tickle me Elmo waa gift for my daughter who just loves him.  Everyone she shows him off too can't help but laugh and love him as well and they are all in their late teens.  She is 19 and wanted him so very much.  He is a must for bringing up the joy factor and making people feel good.  His laugh is infectious.
5.0	A great game for horrible people and is a great addition to the other expansion packs and the game itself. It also comes with a decent amount of blank cards to make your game play a more personal experience of how you are in your way a horrible person
5.0	The best!! Very durable. Washes beautifully. I'd buy it again!
5.0	The kids like playing with them.  Same size as lego minifigures. Can fit almost 6 figures inside (really is bigger on the inside!)
5.0	it is a good height and very realistic.  The rack and hangers are adorable! My granddaughter loves it, and so do I.
5.0	Got this for my 50th sock hop birthday party. It good quality and works great with the theme we have going on. Will use it again.
5.0	My 5 yr old loved it and we loved seeing him running around being silly.
5.0	Pros:  Really shoots arrows  Cool sword  Great detail and material    Cons:  A little tough to loosen joints at first  Has some trouble holding weapons    Hope this is helpful, thanks.
5.0	I really enjoy coloring. just about anything really. the mandalas I received from stuff to color were awesome. I have had a relaxing time using my imagination to make different color schemes & have started using 3-D & other specialty pens for an even more interesting results.
5.0	she is a beautiful doll and I love the dress as it reminds me very much of a special dress I got when in high school as it was that color of blue and was as full and floaty looking. I loved that dress
5.0	My 2 year old LOVES this game.  He can play it over and over again.  My only complaint is that I get sick of setting it up.  :)  But he loves it so I set it up over and over again.
5.0	Both of my grand children have this product and play with it for hours every day. They lvoe it and it is easy for any toddler to play with on thier own. They are entertained by it and never seem to get tired of it and love to interchange the animals also. Great learning toys and well constructed and thought out.
5.0	it works great. like how the board holds the tiles in place.
5.0	I got this amazingly quick, it was so wrapped up with bubble wrap with such love and care, I thought I had wrapped it myself. The box and the toy were like brand spanking new. The ship itself is just beautiful. It is one of the prides of my collection. Diamond Select really is top of the line. I highly recommend them.
5.0	I bought this for her 4th birthday and everyone loved it, all the girls wanted pictures with Dora and my daughter had so much fun during and after her party.
5.0	Great Snake Plissken Figure, not very easy to find. Great gift for my son.
5.0	very nice sturdy wood case.
5.0	The kids always laugh when The mouTh snaps closed. The maker improved qualiTy; ours is durable and  works every Time.<br />Highly recommended for all ages.
5.0	I bought this as a Christmas gift and the child started playing with it in the box as soon as the paper was off.  They loved it and play with it all the time.
5.0	my son ordered for my husband he loved it. description was exactly as it said. very pleased with this product.
5.0	Exactly what my son wanted, and got here in great time.
5.0	Looked better than expected! Very cool(:
5.0	I have ordered 3 sets of zoomorphs from Amazon.  They love them and play with them almost everday!  They are fun for adults too, they make you feel like a kid again!!
5.0	Bought for my 2nd Grader to help visualize math problems.  It really has helped out.  I'd recommend these products for sure.
5.0	I think I may have more fun with these than my sons do at this point. I'm really into toys without batteries that can be played with in multiple ways, and these sturdy, simple little robots fit the bill!
5.0	First off, this thing is very creepy. As an avid fan of the Alien films, novels, and comics, I can honestly say that this is the most accurate and impressive version of the Alien from the first Ridley Scott film. His dome is clear, revealing a human-like skull structure below, with empty eye sockets and nasal crest. As another reviewer pointed out, his gums are white, like in the first movie. I love every alien variation I've seen, this one, the ones from the second film, Aliens, and the dog-based Alien3 design. The aliens in the fourth film are like the second film, though more black with silver teeth (pretty slick looking I'll admit) I haven't taken this figure out of the packaging, and probably never will, but if I ever buy another one to collect permanantly, this one will come out immediately. So no advice on assembling the legs, hoses, or tail from me. Warm water seems like the best idea, a hairdryer sounds too harsh on the plastic/paint. And only warm the female ends (leg stumps on figure) not the male ends on the legs themselves, should squeak on in and cool for a good fit! Can't believe I only paid $40 for this at the mall...Great buy, for fans and collectors alike.
5.0	grandson now has plenty of dart refills!!
5.0	Lately I have been branching out into the board game world of zombie survival horror. I haven't played them all but I was really taken away with this game. Almost every board game is competitive in nature with the exception of Arkham Horror and Hero Quest, to name a few. It is always hard to create a game that breeds true cooperation. When I say cooperative I mean your team wins not any individual players. In order to survive, and if the zombie plays is anyway descent, you will need to work together. Almost all cooperative board games still foster some sort of competitiveness with resources. This game is no exception, however you will most likely fail. It is difficult to pass over a weapon or item and jeopardize your own well being for the good of another player and the group but it needs to be done. With this game if you pass away one weapon you almost feel naked against the zombies. If you are selfish you will almost always fail. In defense of the people I played with we were playing a bunch of competitive board games over the weekend and thus we kind of foster this kind of attitude. It was really refreshing playing a true cooperative game.  About the game: The game utilizes cliche scenarios with cliche heroes but the game is anything but a cliche. While reading about the game a lot before I played it I thought I knew what I was in for. My biggest surprise that no one ever seemed to mention but you will realize quickly is that all houses pretty close to zombie spawn points. While it is absolutely necessary to get Hero Cards you are never completely out of danger and only a few turns away from getting cornered in a building. This game really feels like like you are watching a movie.  The only problem I have is with the audio cd they gave me. I happened to be so lucky that I had the Resident Evil 1 and 2 video game sound track and that works a ton better.
5.0	My granddaughter loves it. Disney makes the best toys for children. You can't go wrong here. Strong and durable working alarm clock.
5.0	awesome but i prefer the burning godzilla monsterart, my only tip is to not put it in water or it will fall apart and not be able to put it back to gather.
5.0	Was a gift & was LOVED!
5.0	This is so cute!  I can't wait to gift this to my daughter for her 3rd Birthday!  I am sure it will help keep her out of my make up! ;)
5.0	Very fun and entertaining.  Our friend's son got this as a birthday present and all the kids wanted to play with it.  I'll be getting one of these for my kids, for x-mas.  They'll love it!!
5.0	For anyone who loves words and puzzles, it's always exciting when a product hits the shelves that is completely satisfying!  PATHWORDS is that product!  The puzzler in me is completely happy in this word search!  The colored puzzle pieces are fun to place too!  Love the degree of difficulty in the Challenge Cards!
5.0	My son (3) loves this as does my daughter (9).
5.0	Truly is 100 nerf darts....
5.0	Excellent product. Durable and high quality. Perfect for my preschool classroom as a way for kids to explore more about seasons, weather, and how we dress for the elements.
5.0	A quickplay version of polymerization. Usefull if your opponet is about to destroy one of your weaker monsters, or when you want to go for a one turn kill. 2 copies are recommanded for a shaddoll deck.
5.0	It has all the characters.  My 4 year old loves it.
5.0	This provided hours of fun for a dozen 4 and 5 year olds at my daughter's 5th birthday party! Just like when I was a kid, shrinky dinks never stop entertaining!
5.0	My daughter loves this. It's really neat it shreds notes so no one can read them. These are bigger then what I thought they would be. About 2.5 inches. I also purchased the bat and the dust bunny.
5.0	"My 6 year old loves this \\""fainting couch\\"".  She says it's her favorite of all her doll beds.  It has cute compartments for Apple's accessories.  The laptop and glasses are great little extras. Nice quality and colors too!"
5.0	My son got these for Christmas and he loves them!!  There are plenty of pieces to build quite a bit.  He just likes to build something as high as possible.  I love the container that you can keep them in.
5.0	My daughter love it so much and she use it everyday. It is peace of durable asset . More than expected.<br />Thanks
5.0	These were great for my daughter birthday party. All the little kids enjoyed & perfect as goodie bags stuffers. They were pretty good sized and very nice. Will recommend to anyone looking of awesome looking bubble guppies stickers.
5.0	I recieved this for free from Little Tikes in exchange for a review.My two kids really enjoyed this truck. I have a 3 year old and a one year old. The truck holds a great deal and they love how the dump part moves. My only complaint is I wish the cab had a door to put &#34;people&#34; in easier.
5.0	I loved everything in this set! I would recommend to all Game of Thrones fans!
5.0	Very cute small dog for a child or elderly lady.
5.0	it works for a great game for any child party . everything was great. I got it on time and it was packaged really well. Thank you
5.0	This is my granddaughters favorite, she is a big Harry potter fan, she has it all but she didn't have these pins and she just loves them to write with
5.0	We bought a second battery for our daughters power wheel so she would always have a charged battery.  I didn't realize her old battery was wearing down, until we put this one in her car and saw how much faster she can go.
5.0	Another fun sequel to Family Talk. Talk provoking questions for the family. I also use them as icebreaker questions in office team meetings. We keep this set in the car so my son can grab it and we can talk in the car. The first set stays on the dinner table.
5.0	F***ING SICK CARD! Been waiting a whole week to get it in! Ive wanted this card since i was a kid. Now i get em! Came in protective casing! Received it in MINT condition! And its ultra rare just as i orderd it!
5.0	See my review of the Green Lantern Costume.  This costume also is a light-weight costume designed for limited wear for Halloween or costume parties, but it has the detail my Grandson loves.  the bottom yellow portion designed to look like boots covers the shoes so it appears they have on boots.  It had enough detail that his imagination was able to fill in the rest. The fit was just right for a solid muscular 5 year-old.
5.0	Great fun for my 2 year old.  He mastered taking the whole truck apart and put it back in just a couple of days, although the truck is mostly apart with screws everywhere.  The truck is well made and has been taken on some rough boy plays.  It still holds up well and no big scratch marks. He loves the drill tool and use it on his other toys as well.
5.0	"My son loves Toy Story, so we got him this plush Buzz. He liked it so much that we ended up buying 2 for when we \\""lost\\"" one. Never had any problems like the other reviewer of the head popping off."
5.0	This game is worth EVERY penny!! I enjoy taking it to gatherings. I'm looking forward to purchasing the expansion packs.
5.0	My kids adore these little figures, and though they come with many of the lego kits, they are easily misplaced.  These are a nice addition to any lego kit.
5.0	great gift, love the voice
5.0	We purchased this game for our nephew for Christmas and it looks really neat. Something different then your average board game and there are other spin offs from this game if he loves it.
5.0	I love Crocodile Creek.  Their balls are very sturdy and good quality.  The kids just love playing with these balls.
5.0	Just what I was looking for
5.0	Great Quality! My daughter looked adorable and was the only one in her school with this costume, so she loved that!
5.0	My four and two year old grandson love to dress up and they both got this set at Christmas. The set is quality although a bit big for even the four year old. The hats are definitely to big for them. As with anything Melissa and Doug you do get quality merchandise. They will eventually grow into the set. It is nice they will be able to enjoy this for many years as they do grow.
5.0	It was what i was looking for... ;)
5.0	I purchased two of these for my 4 and 6 year olds and they had a blast with them. The light is very bright and the product itself is very sturdy.
5.0	Separated from my kids right now, they love looking at the book, they talk back to the recordings when the pages get turned
5.0	Love this! The pictures i have taken with the set came out so cute!
5.0	Bought it for my 7 year old grandson.  He is really enjoying it.  Has spent several hours playing with him .
5.0	My 4 year old LOVES this toy!
5.0	... a gift for my grandson.<br />He was so happy to have and wanted to drink both cold and warm drinks using it, and only it.
5.0	Made these up then we send them to my nephew he is in the army
5.0	A very good model good size for desk or shelf. Hope mattel makes more ships from the 09 movie. Service was even better got it in 3 days.
5.0	I got this for my son on his 3rd birthday. I can't tell you how many times he took it apart and put it together. Over and over again. Then, his 8 year old brother and 6 year old sister did it over and over again. Now, a month later, the novelty has worn off of course but when we get the box down, they start doing it again.
5.0	Great balloons and great price
5.0	My grandson loved. It is just like the game!
5.0	I'm always looking for reviews and parent-endorsed toys for my 11 month old grandson. This was going to be a birthday present, but I ended up giving it to him early. So glad I did. He loves it and carries around the little animals, puts them in the tractor bed, and loves to watch it go! It's a winner, in my book.
5.0	We absolutely loved the game, we got it for free from Hasbro Gaming which made it even better! The kids had so much fun, that it was 3 am in the morning and we were still playing!!!!
5.0	Got this for a gift and it's a great flyer. It's quiet for a quad this size because of the geared props and is very stable. On low it's very docile and a beginner could easily handle it. On high it's fairly fast and fun for intermediate or advanced flyers. It's especially great for night flights as it lights up as bright as the times square Christmas tree. Here's my full review- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjNMdAKXg18  and here's it flying at night-. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGtN8gQKh4o
5.0	I wasn't too sure when I pulled this costume out of its bag, but once my daughter put it on it was so cute!!  Very simply cut with elastic to make it hang on the arms just right.  She looks like a little lady liberty and she absolutely loves it!!  It doesn't come with the torch so we had to buy that separately, but it wasn't overly expensive (we bought the plastic light up version and it works great!).  Very nice costume for the price!
5.0	Kids love these. Forget mats, you can make boxes and forts and tunnels out of theses.
5.0	My grandson enjoys this new mega bloks product....hours of playtime and made-up adventures.
5.0	I use them to keep my pool liner up for the winter, blow them up with an air pump and put them in the pool.  You could tie two of them together (on top of each other) with a beach ball on top to make a pyramid type enclosure.  So far so good, should review them when I open the pool next spring just to see how they last.
5.0	It's super awesome and seems pretty well made and sturdy to me. The colors are nice and it smells a little weird but only if you put it right up to your nose, so I think I'll just wait for it to fade and if it doesn't I'll just clean it on gentle in the washing machine. It's like my own subtle way to show how much I love Pokemon! Some people catch it (once in a while I get a high five) but most just think it's an ordinary hat which is still okay with me, since I bought it for myself and not other people. :)
5.0	Very pretty picture.  I had it framed and am displaying it with my fall decor.  It was fun to put together and not terribly difficult.
5.0	we got our baby alive free from Hasbro to try and our daughter loves her a bit messy but she still cant get enough of her . you will need to buy alot of extra diapers and food as your little mommy will go thorough alot!
5.0	I gave this to 3 lovely little girls,  they are enjoying it as well as their mom  It is a nice quiet toy..
5.0	We bought this for our Grandson for his 4th Birthday and he loves it. We put it on the higher speeds setting and he loved the fact that he could go faster. I recommend this Jeep to anyone!!!
5.0	My preschool kids are having a great time with the carrier and toys.
5.0	Ok so i will admit that this and the other two identical items (but in different colors) are going to have the same exact review cause i bought all three of them and they were exactly the same in quality and i'm a little lazy :)<br />  I am greatly pleased with these card sleeves. they fit &#34;American&#34; Yugioh card sleeves perfectly with a little extra room which is what i prefer. the art is awesome with also a nice little &#34;foil&#34; like sheen effect. i got them really cheap and i cannot be any happier. i don't have much else to say other than if you want very nice but inexpensive card sleeves than these are the ones to get.
5.0	As stated. Arrived promptly
5.0	I used this twice and it still doesn't leak.  If it goes on sale again, I'll definitely pick up another.
5.0	Great stuffed toy for kids. My 3 year old Godson is a big fan of Goofy and was very pleased with this stuffed version of him. The material is very soft and good quality. Seam lines are very nice and you can tell it took great attention to detail to make it so plush. I would definitly buy this again for another gift in the future.
5.0	I bought this for my daughter as a Christmas gift and she absolutely loved it!!!
5.0	My Granddaughter loves this  anything monster high  but she enjoyes this
5.0	This pretend play iron is so realistic! Its fairly lightweight and my 2 & 4 yr old think its real ... so real that they want to fill it up with water - just like mommy's. Im totally satisfied with the product and would recommend!
5.0	"I gave this easel [[ASIN:B001F6ONCY Little Partners Natural Art Easel]], along with dry eraser markers, to my granddaugher for Christmas this year.  She LOVES IT!  Now her \\""learning tower\\""  [[ASIN:B000GV40ZO Little Partners LP00401 Learning Tower, Natural]] includes opportunities to draw, write, and create in the kitchen with Mommy.  What a great idea to further the versatility of learning tower! In a very small space, a child can climb, help Mommy, imagine all kinds of things, and now express themselves through drawings and written words."
5.0	Great, kid liked it, but she lost the little poopies and we had to launch a poopy search. Found poopies, taking better care of poopies. Hope she is not inspired to collect other poopies, but at least she now understands how much maintenance pets can be, even plastic ones. Instructive!
5.0	very cute and decorative holiday display for when the kids and grandkids come to visit, always puts a smile on everyones face when the music plays.
5.0	Works great in keeping me on track while I work
5.0	This toy couldn't be much better! Baby quickly learned how to make it sing by pressing on the ears. It's soft coat begs to be hugged and petted. The mouth moves and fascinates my granddaughter.  Couldn't be happier with this product
5.0	Durable, good quality, very spacious; overall satisfied! I would highly recommend to anyone who needs a space saver for their children's items.
5.0	First off I want to say that this is my first Kamen Rider merchandice and I do not regret the purchase. The belt, being designed for kids of course, is small for adults, I definately plan on buyibg a extender to be able to wear this in the future. Other than that, the belt and lockseeds are amazing. They look and sound just as they did in the show and I cant put them down. They have a nice feel to them, opening and closing the lockseeds feel nice and the sounds are crisp. The paint is great on them aswell. I definately would buy again from this seller as this was my second purchase feom them and I got both relatively fast.
5.0	Love these dolls! They are pretty durable, but if you force the dresses as my 3 year old likes to do, the dresses sleeves might break. But she plays with these for hours and they are super cute.
5.0	My grandaughter had an Elsa birthday and this was her costume. Not super well made but good enough to pretend in.
5.0	"My 3yr old is a huge dress up fan and flipped when she got this \\""Belle\\"" style dress in her Easter Basket. She wears it most everyday! I really like that it is like a Disney dress without the princess face button on it!"
5.0	For a video game franchise that's responsible for the loss of millions of dollars in quarters, there are very few action figures that do the series justice. Luckily, Resaurus back in the day got it right in the case of Street Fighter 2's number two badass, Sagat.  I was most pleased to reacquire this figure having not been able to find it for some years.  What it lacks in articulation it makes up for in awesome sculpting and paintjob.  For the hardcore Street Fighter fanatic or the distinguished action figure collector, this is a must have!
5.0	I gave the missile system as a gift for a 6 year old, and I couldn't believe how much fun it was for kids and adults!  It is not waterproof, and the missiles can shoot so high that you need to watch out for rooftops.  It is an awesome toy and tons of safe fun!
5.0	i bought this for my grandson 9 birthday he had it put together and ready to go with in a day. he loves playing with it. i would like to get all the sets for him
5.0	Soft, cute & made very well! Really loved it, this was a gift and it's been over a year and still looks great!
5.0	My 8yr old daughter loves it. First thing every morning she is excited to see where &#34;CAROL THE ELF&#34; is. Great fun for all
5.0	Bought this and the Gary Beanie Baby for a friend's daughter. She instantly loved them and said she had the best birthday ever.
5.0	I bought these to use in terrariums and they are so cute! Perfectly sized and very unique! Glad i purchased!
5.0	Love it! Holds out well and beautiful colors! Watering can (it's Actually high-quality plastic, not can) is a perfect size for my three year old. When I fill it with water it's not too heavy for him. Easy to clean as well.
5.0	These are the funnest toys for my almost 4 year old daughter. She loves using her imagination and playing with these with her magiclip princesses.
5.0	This is a great toy for the older three to four range.  They enjoy that all of the nativity characters are made up of the Veggie Tales characters, which they know and love.  Children at this age level can identify them and identify with them.  They have great fun sharing and playing cooperatively in either teams or groups of three.  It is a classroom favorite.
5.0	This shipped in no time and was exactly what I was hoping for. Will make a great addition to the Barbie's I just bought!
5.0	I have four boys and they love playing Kendama! Love how a wooden toy with a string and ball attached can keep the kids busy for hours in this day in age when electronic devices rule the world. Quality of the toy was great, came with an extra string. The only downfall is that the color from the ball chips and fades fast but what can you expect when it is being used 24 hours a day. Overall, great product for the price you pay!
5.0	It was the best choice of my life to buy this puzzle. Very good condition of the product. Im very happy  [[ASIN:B001CHCE22 JACKSON POLLOCK 1000 PIECE JIGSAW PUZZLE]]
5.0	I can only say that &#34;it does the job I wanted it to do&#34; I bought it as a backup for my quad copter.
5.0	Ravensburger Puzzles are the BEST!!!
5.0	it's exellent doll easy to play. my kid loves it
5.0	My daughter has these and she is very happy with them.
5.0	Very nice kit at half the price from typical Hasegawa/Tamiya offering. And from various online sources -- it's the most accurate in this scale.<br /><br />THIS IS NOT A TOY. Go ahead and buy it for your kid, but they will not enjoy &#34;building&#34; this kit unless they have developed above average among their peers.
5.0	I brought these as a Christmas gift for my niece for her Rainbow loom kit and she loved them.  Great gift item.
5.0	Great picture. fast shipment even around christmas time. shipped in good sturdy tube.
5.0	This *little* playhouse is great, and by little i mean its huge. It barely fits in my living room. I ordered it for my little sister and she LOVES it. She loves to put on the aprons it comes with. It is made of durable material. Its framework is a little flopsy until you put the covering on. Then it is very sturdy. Overall this is the best playhouse I've ever seen. A must buy for preschoolers!
5.0	Love this toy and I love Kreo. Similar to Legos but still awesome. The joints are smooth and could slip making it unstable but they are also a bit sticky so it can be stable. This Starscream looks like G1 Starscream and I like that. Get him and more Kreos!!!!!!!!!
5.0	Great quality baskets!  Seem like they'll last a long time and my 2.5 year old loves using them for playing store.
5.0	This toy is my 11-year-old's favorite.  You can configure the cars differently every time you build them.  They are fun to race and the battery powered motors are so much better than the spring powered ones.  It's a really good value and a great addition to your basic k'nex set.
5.0	Ninjago is the series my son loves.  So needless to say, it exceeded his expectation.  He's 6 years old and loves to build and rebuild the sets.
5.0	This deck is great.  Once Amazon starts stocking these again and sells them for retail price I will change my review to 5 stars.  The $70 + price that some Amazon sellers are attaching to these cards are absurd.  I hope nobody is naive enough to pay that much for this deck of cards.<br /><br />Edit:  As promised I have changed my review once the price went back down.
5.0	My grandson received this for Christmas and it is in use constantly. He has a bunk bed so he shows his video games on the ceiling to play on the upper bed. Also much less at Amazon than anywhere else.
5.0	Bought this as a building project for my 8 year old sons after school french class.....<br /><br />He loved it, detail is phenomenal.<br /><br />Would recommend
5.0	good product super fast shipping
5.0	i really appreciate the time frame and quality of my new cards  so happy i am to give you this great review
5.0	The reason this card isn't in english isn't because it'll be in Arc V, its because the card needs to be censored. She has a cross around her neck and america has freedom of speech, and religion. This card would compromise both of those because a cross is a christian symbol, its stupid, but absolutely true.
5.0	I bought this of my daughter's 2nd birthday circus party and it was perfect! this lion was the perfect touch! he squeaked when you hugged him which I thought was adorable! GREAT BUY!
5.0	The bands are beautiful and a little thicker then normal to make a tighter bracelet. Very happy with this purchase!
5.0	much sturdier t-ball set then the one we previously had.  Definitely good for toddler age, and durable enough to last a while!
5.0	This was a great transaction. The product was exactly as described and was shipped immediately. Could not be more pleased.
5.0	That is all I want to say, but these reviews require me to say more. I don't think more is necessary!
5.0	First of all, I wish all things came as well packed, labeled, and instructed as this item!  It did take me and my 18 month old 3 hours to put it together, because she was helping of course!  It's excellent quality materials, and every last detail is perfect in this kitchen!  I love it and so does she!!!!
5.0	The dolls are beautiful...can't wait for Christmas when the grandkids open them!
5.0	This is so much fun,cant wait to get a little better at it.
5.0	From all the No Face plush this was my favorite, it's super soft and stands well on its own, highly recommend it to any Spirited Away fan !
5.0	Great Value for such a historical item, very easy process from buying the item online to actual receipt of the order.
5.0	was a little big for a someone in a small 10 but costume was great!!!  Received a lot of compliments on it and dd said it was very comfortable!  She was so excited with this costume... note due to costume being sleeveless, dd wore a flash colored bodysuit underneath and was fine on Halloween eveing while trick or treating. I was able to buy a sword on clearance in a party supply store for $5... unfortunately could not use the sword at school functions and since in School Halloween was cancelled was not able to get full effect of the cotume but my daughter loved it!!!
5.0	Got this for my sons first birthday. Was immediately able to use it going around in circles on the track. 2 months later he drives it on track and off(crashing into all sorts of things). One of his favorite toys.<br /><br />Note: battery looks to be annoying to charge.. Have to unscrew the seat and other piece. That being said, 2 months in and we haven't had to charge it yet.
5.0	Worked great for a youth activity and will be used again.
5.0	I like smoking accessories and this is a fun one. Holds about a pack of cigarettes. Works fine and it reminds me of a similar one my aunt had when I was a kid.
5.0	son loved the game but didnt have the mat. It works well
5.0	Gert shipping and price
5.0	really great for what it cost
5.0	this is super, my husband has wanted this game forever...........
5.0	bought this for my granddaughter who is 1 and loves the Mickey Mouse Club House show.  Great quality and we carry them everywhere!
5.0	I bought this cube for my 12 years old son. He absolutely loves it. A very very interesting and fun puzzle  to solve. Thanks.
5.0	I got this kitty for my friend's little girl. She loves it. Thank you for having just the right kitty for her.
5.0	"I discovered Plan City Wooden toys rather by accident, but they are \\""the best.\\""  The quality and detail is amazing--and appear to be toys that will withstand lots of use."
5.0	My boy loved the tool box!
5.0	What an amazing deal. The charging pack and gift card alone would cost about as much as the whole set. We are so pleased with this bundle.
5.0	My 4 year old daughter got this for her birthday and has played it almost every day. The ages 4-6 on the box are pretty acurate with the two different levels of play. However, my 2 year old son also plays the game with assistance. It teaches them recognition, shapes, colors, patterns, and all about sea life too. The alphabet game that the game console came with didn't hold my daughter's attention nearly so well.
5.0	It's small but works wonders my girly loves it!, you just have to put the money under the little pillow!
5.0	GOOD TOY FOR KIDS.  MINE LIKE THIS BRAND A LOT, ALL THEIR PRODUCTS ARE GREAT FOR THIS LITTLES CHILDREN.  GOOD.
5.0	Got this for my 8 year old nephew and he LOVED it. Seriously. I felt like an awesome aunt.
5.0	Cool. Matty ice looks just as cold blooded as when in the game. Ok pose but gets job done totally
5.0	We got this for our son's fifth birthday and he is really enjoying it!  I recommend getting the expansion pack with it b/c the layout options are limited without it.  Our son also has the wooden railway sets, but he likes this one. The trains move very quickly and Harold is so cute buzzing above the station!  Bertie has his own track and moves right along, too.  The track is flexible and fits together much like the wooden track.  It stays together, even on carpet.  Your little Thomas enthusiast will love watching the trains go, and can be more actively involved if you get an extra train. (We got James)  Kids need to be on the ball to keep two trains from crashing...even though it's kinda fun when they do!  This is worth the cost, and we paid more for it than it is being offered for here, so I think it is a good deal, too!  Have fun!  Toot tooot!!!
5.0	My son came home wanting to play Clue... and this game was just perfect... especially for the price! We really had a wonderful time playing this as a family!
5.0	Tippy the Pointer is absolutely adorable - spot on accurate rendition of the real deal, including our own dog, Scout. Thanks for this fabulous addition to the plush toy market.
5.0	This has worked just as described for us.  I have read other reviews that the item did not hold up, but we have not had any problems.  It is also a game that a child can have fun with on their own, trying to hang as many monkey's as possible before the branch falls.
5.0	we love this toy. we bought it to cheer up my son who broke his arm, and it certainly  has worked. for $3.50, we are STILL laughing days later. and it writes! my kids are writing their christmas cards with this pen and even my 3 yr old loves it. a perfect stocking stuffer. for kids of ALL ages. :)
5.0	This was a gift for my daughter. It is adorable!
5.0	My son loves his big Mickey mouse! He brings it with him to bed every night. I would recommend this to anyone who has a kids that likes Mickey
5.0	Grandsons loved them!
5.0	My 5 year old waited very patiently for this toy. She has only had it for a week but in that time she has played with it nonstop. When she isn't playing with it she is talking to it. People say that she is floppy and noisy but my little girl thinks she is perfect and so that makes the money very worth it to her dad and me.
5.0	My 4 yo autistic son is obsessed with giraffe lately so the little kid in me decided this was going to b the present of the year. We had him open the box and his eyes lit up like I have never seen b4 & it made me so happy I cried, then he tried to ride it and I was laughing so hard I was crying lol. He loves this giraffe, he lays it down & cuddles with him on the floor watching tv or playing with other toys and just looks at him amazed. Fantastic toy
5.0	I bought this for a coworker who is a BMW enthusiast as a secret Santa gift. He loved it. It appears to be sturdy and the car moves very smoothly and quietly. The doors open and its metal construction. Amazing value for the price.
5.0	great looks good and worked great since granddaughter taking dance lessons was a real surprise for her she loves it
5.0	I had an original black/red dragon silk as a kid and somewhere it got lost in my travels...here it is again in exactly the same size and weight, thickness etc just gorgeous!
5.0	Exactly how described. Fast shipper. Thank you
5.0	I purchased this for my two grandsons, ages 2 and 6.  They both loved it!  Paint bottles are refillable, which is great.  I had some finger paint on hand and used that as well.  I used one of the included papers as a template to cut out more, using paper I had on hand.  The unit basically wipes clean with paper towel.  I also used the sprayer in the kitchen sink when we had lots to clean.  Since my 2 year old used a LOT of paint - I found that the ends of the paper (my home-cut paper) curled around the edges.  To flatten them, I waited until they were dry, then put them between 2 pieces of cardboard & topped with heavy books.  All in all, the spin art was a real hit!  Inexpensive, quiet, easy to clean - and a whole lot of fun!  (even for Grandma!)
5.0	For the price, this crib is everything we wanted.  I shopped around quite a bit and looked at more expensive cribs before deciding this one would do us just fine.  I love the fact that it's a 3-in-one, so you will get your money's worth for sure!   The crib is very sturdy and it didn't take long to put together at all!   Some of the diagram photos were a little confusing within the instructions, but with a little common sense, it goes together nicely.
5.0	This definitely added to making my cake look like a masterpiece.
5.0	Brings enjoyment to the whole family.
5.0	I got this for my son (3 years) birthday and it's not a bad product actually my 7 year old enjoyed it very much but defiantly not for a 3 year old. These clicks are hard for even me to connect together. I like that it comes in its own box and we did make a cool race car for him but I can't see him playing with these on his own.
5.0	Sock Monkey jonkey is my my daughter  .. engaged.. She was happy with it.. that is all I can say.. I thought n was a lil disappointed their was no veil but that's okI can make one if it's the topping on their wedding cake or center piece<br />..It is a Bride and groom not a kids toy and she Love's , Love's , Love's  collecting sock monkey's..she was thrilled so Yay!! :)
5.0	This salon is really great.  It comes with everything -- waiting room chairs, a table with coffee cups and flowers, a hair dryer, a hair station, a sink (which is actually a working sink you can put water in it), a spa table, a tub, a manicure table and lots of great accessories, bottles, soaps. They thought of everything on this one.  If you order, make sure you have enough room to set it up.  I don't think you'll be disappointed!
5.0	yes  6 year old loves it  perfect
5.0	Arrived quickly and my 3 y/o niece loves it! She rides it on the hardwood floors (no scratches) and when the weather warms up, no doubt she'll take it to the driveway/sidewalks. Very cool toy that will last her years. Well made!
5.0	This puzzle looks great, it's for my husband, he bought one at our local market and when he had finished it he framed it and has it on the wall in his man cave in the garage, neither of us had seen a John Wayne puzzle before so I went onto the net to see if I could find him another one, a good winter project for him, He just loves it
5.0	Was a gift for my brother  and he loves it
5.0	Got these for my boyfriend and I.  Our favorite show and it's our 3 year anniversary.  Simple but nice :)
5.0	I bought this via crunchyroll however they have removed the page so thought id review it here :)<br /><br />First of all it looks stunning, it took ages for these to actually be released due to such high demand as the anime was incredibly popular and therefore this figma was delayed from may to august. The figma itself is hand painted which may have contributed to the delay :(<br />The figma comes with both kiritos swords and their sheaths of which can be mounted on his back, however as the previous reviewest has stated:<br /><br />Its very difficult to get the swords into each hand the light blue one being the hardest due to a wide hilt in which if done by someone heavy handed could may well break it. The swords do feel very flimsy to say the least  which is the only negative about anything
5.0	received as advertised.  looks great om my desk.
5.0	They really look cute on my phone and it makes it easy to hit the home button without looking. My parents also have iPhones and they wanted them on their phones...so I shared :)
5.0	Takes about 10 minutes to assemble properly, and the final product is pretty neat. I will be buying similar models in the near future.
5.0	"My daughter's preschool has one of these so she asked for one for Christmas.  It's very durable, soft and cute.  Would work well for an adult who tells stories to kids or otherwise wants a \\""buffer friend\\"" to relate to kids in just about any setting.  The preschool teacher used \\""Buzzy\\"" to ask the kids their names on the first day of school, and it was amazing how much these shy little kids wanted to talk to him."
5.0	Bright colors! The items arrived on time. It is not worth writing the number of words required to rate this item. They are plastic motivators.
5.0	I bought this tent for my granddaughter's birthday in June and she has it up in her bedroom...still! Its a durable, great place for her to hideaway from everyone. She entertains her dolls inside!
5.0	I was very happy with Taz plush toy I received.  It looks even better in person compared to the picture.  It is very soft and adorable. I received it by mail within 4 days, which was just before Christmas.  I am very pleased with this product and very pleased with the shipping process.
5.0	"I got this for a co-worker who loves things like stressballs and while this little dude is \\""squishy-er\\"" than I though he's be, my coworker LOVES it and plays with it all the time when he's on the phone. Its not uncommon to randomly hear him from his cubical going \\""*squish* *squish* I love this guy!! *squish* *squish*\\"" Lol. Very happy!"
5.0	My son loves his carmaker.  Unfortunately, it seems like the Car Maker machine is only available in stores around the holiday season.  The same is true for the extra molds/chassis, as well as the wax sticks.  We searched everywhere for these after Christmas last year and came up empty.  Since then, every time we're in a store that sells the Car Maker, we look for these mold/chassis sets with no luck.  The only place that seems to have these is Amazon, but you MUST get them before the holidays when the stock is replenished.  After the holidays, the price gets jacked up to unreasonable levels.<br /><br />As for the molds, chassis and stickers that come with this set, my son loves them.  He thought the jet plane mold was really cool, and also likes the jet car mold.  What can I say....it's just super fun to make and decorate your own custom Hot Wheels.
5.0	We got this one for our sons birthday since he got the projector for Christmas! He loves it....and the many other ones he has.  The fact that there is sound is a big deal for him and it is easy enough for him to work it by himself.  He goes into his room turns off the lights and is there for a while!
5.0	I saved myself a dollar buy buying this through [...] (though shipping was $7.75) and I have to say, this is really cute. Each package has a different Hello Kitty, accessory and one brick. I just wish the price would go down so I could collect more.<br /><br />The bricks are from Mega Blocks, but they also work with Legos, making this toy more versatile.<br /><br />Mine came with a lollipop for Kitty, but it's soooooo big on her, looks like she's smacking herself with it. =>u&lt;=
5.0	Quick delivery, great product!
5.0	came nicely packaged and got 25 foil cards like it said so good deal.
5.0	I took This helicopter to his grandson, but this little helicopter so entertaining that I had left it so far they myself and the game, I liked it very much
5.0	My 2 year old son loves this and looks hilarious wearing it..the hat is a nice touch! He barely pays attention to the little dog though, his own stuffed animals are getting more of the 'medical attention'.
5.0	If you love Spongebob you will love this little toy to add to your collection. It's cute and colorful and babies will love it.
5.0	I was afraid it was a little expensive, but now 3 years later it is still a favorite and still looks brand new so I am amazed. My son can break anything, so the fact that this is still going strong says it all!
5.0	Super fun track,walls are great addtion
5.0	My daughter loves it.
5.0	The costume runs a bit small. It's made well and the price was reasonable. Over my daughter loved it.
5.0	Just as described.  Arrived on time.  Very pleased with purchase.
5.0	My 2 yr old granddaughter loves her Bilibo. I can't believe the many uses she has found for it. She sits in it and on it, of course. She collects her toys in it and carries them around. She rocks her babydoll in it. She puts it on her head like a helmet and wants everyone else to try it out. All this imaginative play has been since Christmas.<br />I can't imagine what a previous poster's 2 and 4 yr olds are doing with video and electronic games at those ages. How sad to have a child's imagination stifled so young!
5.0	My niece enjoyed everything I bought for her oven and had a good time baking with her sister. Had to rate how durable it was, really doesn't fit :(
5.0	Great toy. I loved Thundercats growing up, and now my son loves them too. A lot of detail for the price.
5.0	Bought this for my adult niece who still collects Barbie dolls.  l didn't think her face looked like the Barbie I am used to buy I was told it was a Barbie-face.  As my niece is quite pleased with it, I reckon I am, too.  If you are a Barbie collector, you will enjoy this doll.
5.0	I have been buying block sets for my oldest grandson (6) for a couple of years now. He has the plain and colored water filled sets and now the sand ones. He is so creative and has so much fun building. These blocks are durable and teach shapes, and  colors. Open ended and easily transformed into many things they are a great toy.
5.0	My son is a Nerf fanatic, this product adds his collection. Works fine, and is what he wanted. Mechanism works as it should.
5.0	My son was the hit of Halloween trick or treating with this costume and the good thing about it was he can wear it another year! Kids kept stopping him to say &#34; cool costume&#34;  He was 2 when we purchased and he will be able to wear it again at three years old
5.0	Just what to use for the Grandkids coloring projects!
5.0	I was thrilled when my 4year old grandson who already had the castle, received his dragon and learned that it came with a dvd which  enhanced the  total  play experience  between the castle, its occupants and the roaring dragon with audio  enhancement
5.0	THIS IS WHAT MY GRANDDAUGHTER WANTED AND THAT'S WHAT SHE'S GETTING.  IT IS VERY CUTE AND WELL PACKAGED. ALSO, HE CAME QUICK.
5.0	My toddler loves to play with this! It makes a pleasing flapping noise as she goes around our apartment vacuuming up her many messes. For those with pets, be aware that this actually picks up pet fur.
5.0	My oldest son used to make his own books out of loose-leaf paper and I would staple them together. With this kit, he had all the right tools to make a &#34;real&#34; book, complete with his photo and biography, that we can keep forever. So easy to do, looks so fantastic. Now I like to give it as a great birthday present to my kids' friends.
5.0	Super cute, the lighting is nice and bright and can be timed.
5.0	This is extremely easy to put together and my son loves it! It was a great addition to the many things my kiddos do outside!
5.0	This is the toy she grabs when sitting on the potty.  It's perfect. - self-contained and easily tossed to the side.  We purchased it for a road trip and it was entertaining for her.  I think she's used it more in our home than in the car.  Nice quality and interesting.  I actually find that I grab it to move the marbles around.  The magnetic is properly sealed in the tip of the attached wand.
5.0	Ravensburger puzzles are wonderfully crafted.  They are a great quality that will last for years - the pieces are so durable.  This size puzzle is great for my 9 and 11 year old boys - it isn't so large that it is overwhelming, yet gives a fun challenge.  Also, all the different dog pictures keep kids engaged.
5.0	I love it! A fun and challenging puzzle for all cube lovers! Without doubt the best 6x6.
5.0	This is by far my favorite baby float! It is so cute and it inflates very nicely. It feels very strong and durable. My daughter loves the steering wheel on it. It's a little pricey but I think that it's because it's made to last.
5.0	Fun kit for a young horse lover.  She was delighted.
5.0	This a must for all collectors and kids, especially if you plan to make a Lego city.<br /><br />And guys, DO NOT let the Friends line or color scheme deter you from buying this, it's a great build and the more feminine colored pieces can always be replaced with more neutral colors for a more realistic color scheme.
5.0	We enjoyed this puzzle very much. We always like the Dowdle puzzles. I recommend it to anyone who loves puzzles.
5.0	This was a gift for a friend who is breast cancer survivor.  She loves it.  It is a nice little 'feel good' gift.
5.0	Pros: Please see subject line above.<br /><br />Cons: When sharpened on one end and applied to paper, leaves a distinct mark.
5.0	I bought this for my 10 year old son who absolutely loved it! The item was shipped quickly and came in perfect condition.
5.0	"This is one of the most fun games I have ever played.  It successfully marries the paranoia of the television series with a gaming experience.  The game is complicated with a heavy rule book and a constant need to reference that rule book for questions.  However, once your group learns the game it goes by faster.  Players do not need to know Battle Star's story to have fun playing.  Something to be cautious about.  Your group:  I recommend this for a regular group.  The first time you play the game requires about 30-45 minutes of instruction and lessons before you can jump in.  If you constantly have a new player, this can become repetitive and boring.  Also, having a player who does not care, or is just plain bad can really hurt the fun of the game.  For an example, my friend brings his fiance all the time.  She somehow is constantly the cylon and we are always able to figure this out in the first or second turn.  This does not necessarily ruin the fun of the game, but often makes us wish for a play through where the cylons are more crafty.  The few times our more \\""cunning\\"" players have been the cylons have been extremely tense and powerful matches.    Great game, buy it!"
5.0	No real repeats and a bunch of cards for a low price, it took a while to ship - but the wait was worth it - It was a good buy
5.0	Unopened in original package, and delivered on time. Definitely a nice collectors item. Not too pricey for being a product only available in Japan.
5.0	I bought these batteries for a replica mp7 airsoft gun. I had to do little modification to the gun and the battery to make them work together. Mostly soldering connectors. The batteries work very well for what i use them for and are perfect size. As for durability, the batteries are about as durable as any other lithium battery. If you treat them right they can last for a while but if mistreated the damage to property or people can be catastrophic. Overall a very nice buy and for a great price but if these are your first lipo batteries do some research on care before buying.
5.0	My graddaughter has made this life like jack rabbit her best buddy. His name is &#34;Jack&#34; and he is her best buddy. She loves the way she can move his front legs and position them as she likes. The qualtity is 5 star,it will last at least a childhood. Hansa is such a great company. They are well worth the expense.
5.0	couldn't get it any other place ,for a better price ,was very content for this product which recomend worth getting for your thomas collection
5.0	We have more than our share of Thomas products and Conductor Carl fits right into our collection!  The pieces are well made and are compatable with the other sets of track.  The engine, in which Carl sits, doesn't have a magnet up front but it has one in the back.  The cars included in this pack have magnets in front and back and couple nicely with our name brand trains. I wouldn't want only this set but it is a great addition to an already established collection.
5.0	MY GRANDAUGHTER LOVES IT
5.0	A nice globe with a well-detailed map using a color system that makes it easy to identify country borders. The surface has a slight relief that allows observing the topology highs. The map surface layer has some junctions that could be better finished. Perfect for Kids from 5 years old up. Overall, it is a neat globe. We are enjoying it.
5.0	They were right!  The Resistance is a fun game if you have the people to play it.  Made for 5-10 I've found it's best as a 5-8 player game.  Use the included Inquisitor expansion and remember to never trust anyone!
5.0	Bought it as a gift<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Cute, it has great detail for a anime doll<br />-Well built, I can see it as a display toy not a huggy stuff toy<br />-Cheap<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Again not a fluffy toy<br />-Doesn't seem to be durable.  I can see the attachments and detailing be ruined by rough play<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />-Great little collectable for the fans.  Great buy!
5.0	Really fun!! We took turns and had a blast!!! At first we thought set up was confusing, but we figured it out. The cars can run for 30 minutes then need 10 min of charging. If your guys are like mine, I recommend purchasing additional cars.
5.0	This is the most powerful Nerf gun I own, by which I mean it shoots darts the hardest. It shoots one dart at a time with a pull back mechanism, but it shoots them hard. If you're looking for a Nerf gun for your kids, this might not be the best choice. But if you're looking for the gun with the most force, you've found it.
5.0	highly recommended for lego city collectors and for kids as well
5.0	This was fun to show my kids. I have fond memories of my spirograph and they loved it just as much as I did. I would recommend this to anyone with kids who love to be creative.
5.0	Our little guy can play with these all day! He continuously builds them high as he can go and knocks them over. :) Soon, we will be actually using them to build castles.
5.0	My son holds court with his birds mimicking YouTube videos he's seen. These birds make that experience priceless. Just what we ordered.  Thx
5.0	Got this for my sisters birthday who just turned 4 and I must say she is very happy. She takes the dolls everywhere with her. my mom liked it because she didnt have to worry about finding loose pieces of clothing or shoes around the house. But overall its a perfect toy good size and durable.
5.0	Good quality and easy to install. Including the letter stickers is a great, time-saving idea. Finishing is very good. There should be more models to choose from
5.0	This Cabbage patch doll is great. Beautiful. I am giving it away to a 2 year old for Christmas. I think she will be a happy little girl most likely her mother will put her away until her daughter is old enough to enjoy and appreciate her..
5.0	"We just bought this doll house for our 5 year old daughter and it was an instant hit.  For those considering making the purchase, here are my thoughts about this toy.<br />I think this doll house looks quaint, and for my part I think that wooden doll houses are just much nicer than plastic ones (even though there are some really cute plastic ones around). I particularly like the fact that the garage door and front door can open and close--very realistic!<br />The couple that comes with it is very cute and they have moveable legs, so they can sit on the furniture, etc.  The furniture does not look like \\""real life\\"" furniture (may be a problem for some people) but I thought it was nice anyway and also it is really sturdy.  My daughter has a younger brother and we don't have to worry about him breaking anything because the pieces that came with the house are solid and well-made.<br />Some people mentioned the problem with the glued on labels.  Perhaps the manufacturer has been reading these reviews because the labels on the house we bought came off quite easily (my 3 year old son pulled them off with no problem).<br />What disappointed me about this house were three things.  First, although the house folds shut, which makes it portable as advertised, the handles don't fasten together.  If you are carrying it you have to be careful to keep both handles together or the house will slip open and the furniture will fall out.  I think they should have included a simple clasp that would keep both halves together.<br />Second, you can't take the clothes off the dolls.  My daughter wanted to put the figures in the bath, but felt that she had to undress them first.  So that wasn't a plus.<br />Finally, although I love the figures and the furniture, I'd like to be able to add to what I have.  If you buy a more traditional type house it isn't difficult to buy more furniture.  With this set, though, it would be hard to find furniture that matched.<br />All told, my complaints are few.  I am glad we bought the toy, it was well worth the money, and my daughter loves it!e few.  I am glad we bought the toy, it was well worth the money, and my daughter loves it!"
5.0	I recently bought this dog to use as a mannequin for my handmade dog clothing business and it is so life like.  I also bought the chihuahua, and one other one which I can't remember the breed now, all of them are life like and I'm very happy with my purchase.  I am adding a few pictures of &#34;Charlie&#34; modeling my handmade St. Patty's Day Top Hat and matching bow.  He looks adorable!  www.woofsandruffles.etsy.com
5.0	Granddaughter loves this product.  She is learning as she plays.
5.0	This is well made and my daughter loves it. She'll hardly take it off.
5.0	Excellent!!! It is easy to handle.
5.0	My niece just love's love's music, and banging on the walls/furniture /doors so I decided she might want to combine his love of music and pounding on our house into this lovely little drum set. My daugther wanted to give this to her and the good thing is she lives with us lol t's great! Keeps my her occupied, she learns beats and to keep rhythm, and enables her to make his own creations/songs. It's very durable, takes a beating, which is great for little kid's who are still in the young years and dropping stuff everywhere. love the quality of this little Drum set so cute will buy aging, and it does Requires 3 AA Batteries to run this drum set, the set up was less then 5 min, also the top of it come off so if you would take it with you so your little one can play with it in the car :)<br /> I received this product at a discount price for my honest review but all opinions are my own
5.0	Came quickly and they looked even better than I expected
5.0	My little granddaughter will turn two next month, and this was her favorite Christmas present!  She immediately filled the bucket and hauled and drove the truck around.  I didn't figure out how to take the bucket off the truck yet because she keeps it busy.
5.0	My 11 month old got this for Christmas and he just loves it. He is learning how to walk, so he enjoys pulling up on it and walking around it. He will walk around the incedi-block for hours banging on it and putting the blocks in and out of the little compartments. It's very sturdy. There is one side of the block that could have been made more fun or educational, but overall it's a great toy and my son will probably enjoy it for a while.
5.0	Just wish it came with more balls!  The Children are enjoying the fun! Sometimes the boys can be a little rough and will cause the tent to tilt!
5.0	My son loved it it came way before is was scheduled!
5.0	Hands down the Best Carnage figure on the market. The craft, sculpt, paint, tendrils, just everything comes together to make one kick ass figure. Definitely worth the purchase!
5.0	My 7 yr old & 4 yr old like this toy.  Great while exploring outside.  They especially like to play back what they have observed, which can be done right on the BioniCam (doesn't have to be on a computer).  It's not that hard to focus, as some have said.  7 yr old can do it fine.  Would recommend for curious children and/or budding scientists.  Well worth it for Amazon price (a little too pricey in most stores).
5.0	We bought this for my 1.5 year old son. He loves it. It is lightweight, yet durable. It's great for snacking, painting and coloring. I do wish it didn't slide around so much ( we have it on the porch), but other than that; we love it.
5.0	Very prompt and I'm sure my granddaughter  will love it!
5.0	This is much bigger than you expect it to be.  I am 5'7&#34; tall and can sit with my 3 year old with the balls in her ball pit.  This is a slam dunk of a buy!
5.0	I've purchased these types of capsules before and was disappointed to end up with a glob of sponge that didn't really resemble anything.  These animals were great.  A couple of them were difficult to tell exactly what they were (hippo? rhino?) but they all looked very much like animals and my granddaughters loved watching them &#34;grow.&#34;  Good product!
5.0	This is not a toy, but a realistic well made display model.  The Warthog is a very exciting aircraft and this quality display model to set on a desk or shelf, brings a smile to one's face when looking at it. Very pleased.
5.0	Looks great ! We have it in the kids bathroom and they love it
5.0	This is the best knuckles plush of all time . They got all the detail perfectly made . So he is a very cool plush in my collection
5.0	They're adorable and very detailed! Very happy with the purchase.
5.0	See how quickly kids learn to draw cartoon faces and see how easy you pick it up as well. I had lots of fun with my 6 year old grandson Alex playing this game. You can change the rules and the times to suit, and make it as competitive as you want or just have fun drawing the cartoon faces.<br />Recommended
5.0	8 yr old son loves it. Easy to learn to fly. Very responsive. Much better than air hogs we'd purchased previously.
5.0	A great introduction for small children to the violin. Brings out the best of your imagination. Made well and FUN.
5.0	3 month old grabbed for it right away. Would appear to be a favorite.
5.0	I have a8 years old and a 11months old,I got 2 of those for them. Both of them love it.
5.0	high quality toy my son love's it we bought up to 6 toys form the same brand. totally safe for children
5.0	Ok I remeber when the spice girls were everywhere I was around 16 and the first time I saw this spice girl barbie I knew I had to get it my stepdaughter , is now into the spice girls and I gave her my old one and its one of her favorites its a collectors so you must have it if you loved them
5.0	Looks about 95% as good as the demo model shown in the photos. The only difference I can see is the eyes (irises) are not painted in. Also the pants/lower shirt are an off white, whereas there seems to be the slightest Gray/blue in the photos. Regardless, this is a frikking awesome model. Highly detailed and unbeatable for the price! And it's pretty darn big.
5.0	Great purchase for my nephew.
5.0	got this for my niece because she has so many barbies and no place to put them neatly. This product was perfect. she can unzip all of the sides and use it as a play mat for her barbies, and zip it up to keep them all neatly inside.
5.0	The trains for take n play r great my daughter loves them!
5.0	I liked the original one better. But my 1 year old still loves this one.
5.0	I bought this for my 3 year old daughter who is in love with cuddly dinosaurs. For Christmas she had to have a cuddly stegosaurus and triceratops and only they would do. Thank goodness for Aurora! They are the perfect size and feel very plush and well constructed. They have endured trips to the sandbox, bedtime, tea parties, and sitting by the side of the tub waiting for bath time to end.<br /><br />It arrived in a nice sized box in a polybag, Not smooshed in too small packaging to where he would need to fluff up for a few days before every looking normal. I am very happy with this little dino.
5.0	My greatgrandaughter loves it.  Very well made
5.0	we got this plushie on time and i love it..... its the most adorable thing to buy also its size is pretty big haha youll never lose it :D<br />it was also a very good price .....so i recommend this product to any one who loves wailord ^.^
5.0	"My son got this for xmas. VERY easy to put together (instructions are on the side of the box and it consists of 4 screws and the rocker base, not rocket science!). Pony is very soft and his mouth moves when he's singing. Song is obnoxious, so of course my son loves it. Pushing a button on the ears makes it sing. Batteries came with it. Good size for my 10 month old. He seems to really like it. Mommy thinks the batteries might \\""disappear\\"" if she hears that irratating song 1 more time."
5.0	Pretty cool box! Comes with 2 small dinosaurs. Love the versatility and material of box.
5.0	Durable and looks awesome. I gave the second one to a friend so we match!
5.0	Very satisfied with this purchase.  It works really good in complete darkness.  We are all amazed by it.
5.0	I bought four Douglas Cuddle Toys for stocking stuffers, and I couldn't be more delighted.  The quality is great, and each animal is simply precious.  They're unbelievably soft and cuddly and a great size for topping off a Christmas stocking.  I'm glad I made this purchase.
5.0	All of us love this hook, it is metal! We don't have to worry about it breaking in a doubled over band situation.
5.0	Sturdy and portable, this horse stable is perfect for any child who is a horse lover. My 9 year old granddaughter loves it! The construction is so good that I think it will last for a very long time. Open it up for play and close it to take to grandma's. Perfect!
5.0	This is the best game. The replay value is very high. The rule booklets can be daunting, but one person knowing the full rules, and all players applying common sense can play with a 5 minute introduction.<br /><br />If you've never played, and enjoyed the movie &#34;Cabin in the Woods&#34;, this game is the first half of that movie, only with each scenario from the artifact basement activated on a per play basis.
5.0	Now I have the first three Decepticon jets. Just by adding Skywarp to my collection! Since I already have G1 reissues StarScream and Thundercracker. From the previous series. It's a great piece to own! The only downside when I open up the orange plastic cockpit. It partly comes off. When I try to close it I got to apply a little  pressure. Not too much pressure cause the thin plastic connecter that opens and closes might break. Despite that it stays on closed. Which is the important thing. Let me not mess with it just in case. Don't know if other Skywarp reissues have that problem. Other than that it's just a minor defect. Though it doesn't happen to my Starscream's nor Thundercracker's cockpits. The TRU asking price is well worth it. Compared to the price they ask for an E-hobby Takara Version of Skywarp. Get one quick ,before them dirty rotten scalpers sell them for four times as much on ebay. They don't last too long on them TRU shelves. They are usually gone within a month or so. I'd hurry if I were you! They are releasing them as Commerative series. One after the other. When a new collector series comes out, the one before that one is usually sold out. They are very limited and rare! And are only avaliable at Toys'r'us!!!
5.0	These looked and worked great. The Halloween festivities around us here made the kids have to wear knit gloves under these gloves and it worked out perfect! Plus they glowed in the dark which they thought was just so cool.
5.0	I bought this mystery log at Goodwill yesterday. No idea what it was. No gun, no bottles, no batteries, but it had a speaker and some buttons, so I figured it did something neat.<br /><br />Turns out, you don't really need a gun or bottles for the mystery log to be fun. A television remote will trigger the targets and launch whatever you have on hand. We used a little wooden tree and some plastic dinosaurs and used the remote control to launch them into the air, pretending there was a giant earthquake and that's what killed the dinosaurs NOT the Ice Age. Still fun. We're going to try it with cheetos as soon as we go buy some cheetos. Five stars.
5.0	'Twas The Night Before Christmas is one of several seasonal games, one of which is the [[ASIN:B00000JBNB Christmas In A Box]] game, that we enjoy playing with our grandchildren. We always have fun playing this game. The sleigh, reindeer and stocking are their favorite tokens. Based on the poem, this game and the fun we have playing it together, is guaranteed to be fondly remembered whenever they hear the poem recited. It's a nice way to make a memory. This game along with the [[ASIN:0590458469 I Spy Christmas: A Book of Picture Riddles]] would make a great holiday gift. ~ Mrs. B.
5.0	My nephew loooooovesss it! he walks and play around everywhere with the rescue bot
5.0	Kids loved it, came packaged wonderful and secure. It was the perfect gift for the girls and the boys even loved it.
5.0	Was a gift, enjoyed it
5.0	My 9 yr old step brother is a big fan of Legos and loves playing with this. He actually had this thing put together in a little over an hour all by himself!
5.0	It was just what my granddaughter wanted and was thrilled with it<br />I was skeptical at first but it proved to be the perfect toy for her
5.0	Great toy for children two and a half old help with colour and writing also. Education wise great. Thank you.
5.0	perfect, he is adorable!
5.0	I just finished putting this puzzle together! It is a beautiful picture and I've already prepared it for framing and ready to hang it on my wall! If you enjoy a challenge along with beautiful artwork and durability, I recommend this puzzle. Thank you!
5.0	This was my 4 year old grandsons favorite Christmas gift. Very cute
5.0	My daughter just loves this lamb, it is very soft and cute.  Good quality, and very snuggly.  She loves it.
5.0	I got this for her for Christmas, and it's so soft! I have a similar one without the satchel, and it's of equally great material as well. Any Miyazaki and Totoro fan would love this!
5.0	Great gift for my five year old. Very well made.
5.0	This was a gift and I was happy with the quality of it. It turned out to be a nice gift for someone!
5.0	This is a classic prank that has not gotten old. I got these the other day and had the best time pranking coworkers. So if you need to liven things up at work or even at home or a party try these. I'm sure you'll have as much fun as I did pranking your friends and family.
5.0	"These are high quality stamps!  I am a stamper/scrapbooker, and these are a better quality than most of the \\""adult\\"" stamps.  They have nice tall wood mounts.  The images have great detail.  The ink pad & pencils are a nice bonus.  The wooden case is also nice, although I do wish it had a cover, it's still a nice way to store them.  We also have the vehicle set.  These are a great value at a nice price."
5.0	The rhino is very heavy duty, high quality. Kids love it. You can toss it around and it feels nearly indestructible.
5.0	I bought this for my 2 yr old Grandson for Christmas and he loves it. He hasn't started using the pedals yet but he can scoot with his feet. This trike is made similar to a Big Wheel and a regular tricycle. I would call this a crossover. It's easy to assemble and when together is a nice sturdy Trike. I just wish I was small enough to ride on it.
5.0	As soon as I saw it I felt in love with! Every time I am working with my art stuff this crazios funnios cow sits with.  My inspiration flows just by looking at it!
5.0	I had a great time building this train set with my 5 year old.  The step by step instructions were very easy to follow.  Each step showed a full color picture of the next piece or pieces to add.  I think that young children will be amazed by their ability to build a complex toy by following simple steps.  We built it over several days.  I would estimate around 4-6 hours to finish it completely.  The components are high quality and a joy to build and play with.
5.0	Lovely. Really very pretty.
5.0	It looks exactly like the picture, fits my LG g2 phone perfectly along with my cards. Great price and its not even falling apart yet!
5.0	Grandaughter who is 3 loves to sing with this.
5.0	this is exactly what my son wanted. He loves it.
5.0	My nephew is really into pokemon cards and he wanted this one but couldn't find it anywhere in stores.  We ended up finding this and a bunch of other ones online without a problem.  It's a hard to find holo card and it was so much easier to find it here than look in stores or get packs hoping it would be included.  Great for pokemon fans!
5.0	This is what I was looking for. Good product. Not much more to say. It works. Thank you very much.
5.0	Grand daughter loves it
5.0	It's well made, I like it.
5.0	I wear them to play tennis and I love them!!!<br /><br />Perfect fit!!!
5.0	My 2 year old grandson absolutely loved both of these.  He quickly learned how to us the chair, the smart wheels truck he also enjoyed very much.
5.0	They work ok. Great for a young kid. The video quality is what you would expect with something that isn't too expensive.
5.0	Gave these toys to my Grandson for his 4th Birthday becasue he loves to take things apart and put them back together.  He loved the airplane and roadster, played all day with them taking apart/putting together.  I felt very safe because all pieces were large enough for him to handle and he loved drilling in the nuts/bolts.  Great idea to keep him busy for hours.
5.0	It is fun. Good product and fast service.
5.0	It is hard to play for kids .. It is good for olders ages ..
5.0	My grandson loves this. I'd buy it again. It is the right size, very colorful, and is cute, for sure.
5.0	this olivia doll is so cute. and the plastic is super soft. so soft your child can sleep with it.and the ruby red outfit is just as cute. the only thing i don't like is the piglet can not stand by it's self. i think that is why my 3 year old daughter is'nt playing with this toy much. because now she likes to stand her dolls up by them selves. and this toy does'nt stand alone. but i really think it's super cute. just wish my child would show more interest.
5.0	Very happy with these. Used them for backyard movie night and they are a huge hit with my kids! Also not a single one was broke which was amazing to me! Will purchase more in the future. They were bright and lasted all night also.
5.0	Item arrived in great shape and works well....
5.0	It was on time and was very good.
5.0	I have a teenage daughter with multiple needs.  These make excellent sensory toys.  They have a cause and effect.  You push the right place and the toys speak to you.  Excellent for handicapped people of all ages.  They are not hard to get a response from so the child doesn't get tired and give up.
5.0	As described, thanks!
5.0	It was a great way to expand the original game and first expansion and includes so many more hysterical cards that make the game even more fun to play!
5.0	Daughter loved this horse!
5.0	i have had it since jan.28 it is sweet have become such a better yoyo player just make shore you can do a bind
5.0	Use them in my weather vane. Just need to oil them now and then.
5.0	Unique toy. Great gift. Fun and educational. Nice quality.
5.0	We have owned many board games over the years and we found Casinopoly to be the most fun. It's a great game to play with friends and not only that, it teaches you how to play all the individual casino games that are in the  various casinos. We do a lot of traveling in our RV and have invited people  we meet on our travels to a nightly game of CAsinolopy.  Forget poker for a  weekly Friday night gambling game. Casinopoly will liven up your night!
5.0	Perfect pet for my 90-year-old Mom who had just lost her 15-year-old Shih-Tzu.
5.0	I was very impressed with the quality and finish of this bed, its sturdy and does not look cheapy,  and most importantly my daughter Loves it!!
5.0	Liam and I have a hair appointment at the same time today. I feel like we should be having coffee and getting our nails done too.
5.0	Everything was excellent
5.0	i purchased this as a gift. I have not opened it but the packaging looks perfect. my son will love this!~
5.0	I bought this for my grandchildren last year for Christmas - and wow, I sure had a hard time getting it.  If you really want this, make sure to order it early - it sells out OFTEN the closer we get to the Holidays.<br /><br />As for the nativity set itself - we all just love it.  It's also the perfect size for little hands... even for the littlest of hands.<br /><br />Very well-made.  Above all, I like having a toy set that helps to pass down the true meaning of the season.  It just tends to get a little uh, &#34;interesting&#34;, when the granddaughter brings her Barbie Princesses into the story...haha!
5.0	Took time to build; provided hours of fun over holiday weekend. Many cool details.
5.0	A classy-looking and professional class game board.  Met all of my expectations.
5.0	This doll is adorable. It sells for less than twelve dollars at Target. This priced here at nearly thirty is ridiculous.
5.0	What you get is not very similar to what is pictured above, BUT I'm very satisfied with my purchase! I had several of these models as a kid, and they're great for fans who aren't hardcore collectors.<br /><br />This series of models stands about 4.5 inches tall, and snap together from start to finish in roughly an hour (in my case, but I was excited and kind of rushed through it, so mine looks sloppy...) Many of the details are stickers that stay on pretty well. Any other details you want can be painted on.<br /><br />For the price, you're getting a good product, but if you're a hardcore collector, you may want to jump up to the next price level for something a bit fancier.
5.0	Had a problem with one of the four, T Trees gave me a refund one the one.  The controllers work well.
5.0	This may be the older model, but it is still very fun to play with. My little girl and I play on it together. She especially likes the camera feature. She walks around recording everything. She loves it!
5.0	Mix a two-year old, big into trucks, with a new durable fire engine and you get one happy child. I love Green Toy products. I give them as gifts knowing that they are sturdy and fun.
5.0	Lovely, one happy child<br />Thanks
5.0	If you like a challenge, then this is a good puzzle for you.  With all the glittering street lights, window lights, reflections off the wet pavement; not to mention the shadows, drifting clouds ... I could go on.  It's a great puzzle and very satisfying when you finish and look down on the completed picture.
5.0	My baby liked it so much! She always keep it!
5.0	This was our first Haba toy and I'm very impressed with the quality. Baby is still a little young to play with it so I can't speak on how entertaining it is, but we will be purchasing more Haba toys in the future.
5.0	It is lovely my 2 year old grand daughter is still a bit small for it but she loves pushing it around. Think this will be a much loved and played with toy.
5.0	My 10 year old daughter loves this doll! She keeps it right by her bed. It is cute and brought a lot of laughter on Christmas Day.
5.0	My grandson received this toy for his birthday. He loves all types of vehicles and has really enjoyed playing with the airplane and luggage carrier.
5.0	bought these a gift for my friends daughter.  Wow, they are a lot bigger than the picture.  Very fluffy and soft.  she loved them.  I would recommend these slippers, they are a lot of fun!
5.0	Very nice add-on to an awesome game. I purchased this along with the main set and a added some very interesting cards. Along with some blank cards to make your own.
5.0	We bought this toy almost a year ago for our then 3 year old son. He still plays with it everyday. He loves to push it around and pretend play with the characters. The sound effects are great, but he doesn't really use those that often. He rather produce his own *ha*ha Great toy!
5.0	These are a lot of fun, and actually have a crunchy feel like real snowballs.
5.0	I gave this to my grandson for Christmas.  He has a malformed brain so I wasn't sure if he would be able to work all the buttons on it since he has poor hand coordination.  He loves it, and it's so nice to see a smile on his face as he plays with it.
5.0	FUN game!  Covers every aspect of rodeo (even NFR and Cowboy Christmas).. my 12 yr old daughter and I had a blast playing it.  Super fast shipping!
5.0	I purchased this for Christmas gift for my son which is 12. I thought he might be too old for it but boy was I wrong! He hasn't gotten off it since Christmas morning! I also had to purchase another for my niece after Christmas so they would stop fighting over it.  Tons of fun for kids AND ADULTS!!!
5.0	This was another part of my granddaughter's birthday present. She is 10. She liked everything about this stuffy and it's bracelets.
5.0	I SEARCHED HIGH AND LOW FOR THIS DOLL THAT MY GRANDDAUGHTER WANTED FOR HER BIRTHDAY AND WAS SO VERY HAPPY WHEN I FOUND IT ON AMAZON.  I WAS ALSO VERY PLEASED THAT I RECEIVED IT QUITE QUICKLY EVEFN FASTER THAN I EXPECTED.
5.0	One of the most powerful Buzz Bee toys.<br /><br />I own all of them and this is the most powerful. Shoots a good 40ft with power still at the end.<br />In fact this is the best dart shooter I've ever used.
5.0	My granddaughter loves it.
5.0	Fun game something different we own tons of board games...Deluxe Pit...is a great edition to our closet full of family fun games...I recommend this game!~
5.0	Very realistic looking! I really like it alot!
5.0	My kids love the Playmobil products. They build these products with a child in mind. Meaning it takes real abuse, it falls (or gets thrown down the stairs) and it stays intact - it's built tough.   Basically, the toy gets a lot of mileage.
5.0	i loved it i was the same everything is amazing figures locking nice the only bad thing is the fists are very small and can't hold the weapons other than that it was really nice i purchased it when it was 23$ now its 32$ it was nice deal<br /><br />[[ASIN:B008R392TC McFarlane Toys Halo Legends - The Package (3-Pack)]]
5.0	Being a Pacific Islander myself, I am ecstatic that they came out with this doll!  I bought it when it came out and I agree with a previous poster and am glad that she doesn't have a cheesy, touristy-looking flowered dress on or (like the Polynesian Barbie that had previously been released) have one of those grass skirts on.  The flowers she is wearing are also very well-done, and the doll herself is gorgeous.  Overall I am very happy with it.
5.0	Amazing game! If you like Settler's or games like it, I highly recommend Dominion.  The original is the best.
5.0	Great quality. Even if it's cold this year our little guy will be warm and styling this Halloween.  ****he has worn this costume many times and it is holding up well. This mask is a little hard to see out of he tells me but still wears it often.
5.0	These are adorable.  I have 4 neices, who had so much fun on Christmas day decorating their tiaras!  I have a baby girl on the way- and can't wait till she is old enough to decorate her own!  Melissa and Doug always have great products!  They are an go to with all gifts!
5.0	I can not wait for my infant to get her little sweet hands on this! The quality is great and is a wonderful sensory toy (says the teacher in me).... :)
5.0	You just really have to play with it for a while, then you would realize all the games and options with this little laptop. I love that the volume, brightness, and background music can all be adjusted. Love it.
5.0	Works as intended. No Problems
5.0	Steve Jackson Games is known these days for games you can break out and play to completion in less than an hour; perhaps even a half hour. Zombie Dice is a game where two or more players can finish a game in TEN MINUTES, and still have a pretty good time doing it. Extremely portable, as well.<br /><br />For your money, you get a heavy cardboard dice cup with lid that doubles as storage, the dice themselves, and the instructions. Dice are printed with three symbols: brains, blasts, and feet. Players are zombies; each round consists of a player rolling to see how his victims fare. Brains count as points for the player, whereas feet means the victim escaped, and a blast symbol indicates that the victim not only escaped, but let you have it with a shotgun! A player may keep rolling more dice and more rounds, but if he accumulates three shotgun blasts, he loses ALL his points for the round, and must hand off to the next player... so part of the fun is knowing when to stop!<br /><br />It's fast. It's funny. It's fun. Recommended for all fans of zombies and dice games.
5.0	I have a very water obsessed 1 year old. The dog water, her juice, any liquid and she was in there playing with it. There was just not enough time in the day for more then 2 baths in a day. This solved my problems with her problematic dirty water touching. She could play in this all day and I'm fine with it. It even came with good toys. True the sail boats are better being replaced by the real toys, but everything else works great. Very easy to put together you dont even need the instructions. And it's durable too. Doesn't tip over if she sits in it/climbs on it. Even caught our household dog sitting in it, so it can withstand alot of weight. Not a tiny dog. Very happy over all.
5.0	Just as described in the description and it arrived at my house in two days! I would recommend this to anyone who likes the Jordan products and doesn't like to wait!
5.0	I have always loved jolteon from the very start of the game. I'm glad that they finally made some new cards to continue with the series
5.0	Beautiful addition to granddaughter's Elsa outfit.
5.0	These animals are very cute and look just like the real characters!  Very durable and fun to play with!
5.0	Our grandson loves it, rides it all the time. Would recommend for all. He really likes the bed for storage.
5.0	We received this very fast and was in great condition. Even the box was in great condition. My daughter loves it and this one was much cheaper than in stores. Very happy and would buy again or recommend to others.
5.0	this toy is great.. lets face it.. we leave toys on in the cribs and my son has woken himself up with this by rolling  ontop of it.. he loves this toy it's the first thing i hear in the morning before he talks.. he steps on it... loves to play it in any mode... only thing is that the top moves off of the base.. but it's definetly a keeper... one of three toys that are kept in the crib...
5.0	I was super excited to get to try the Friendly Bands Sunshine Loom Rainbow Craft Kit.  I had seen these bracelets on people of all ages and wondered how they made such intricate designs.  After opening the box, reading the directions and checking out how to videos and additional information, I knew, just how they did it!  At first I was a bit confused but after watching a 7 yr olds how to video, I understood how to make these bracelets.  With some practice, I was mastering the basic bracelet and ready to try more difficult patterns.  This kit is a lot of fun and I think all ages of kids and teens would enjoy this craft kit.  I really like that it has the pegs numbered, it makes it really easy to follow more difficult looking patterns.  I also like that it has a sizing on the loom.  I really like that if you want a larger bracelet or necklace you don't have to add on, this loom is big enough to accommodate bigger sizes.  The selection of friendly bands is really nice, they are very colorful and I can see endless color combination possibilities! The bands are of good quality, they stretch very far and keep their shape afterward. The loom is of a good quality as well, and I like that you can replace the pegs if one somehow gets broken. The case is very nice, I like how you can store bands underneath and work on your loom with your bands safely organized in the clear cover.  The place for the hook is very nice, it fits securely in the center of the loom and will be there the next time you get crafty.  It is nice that it comes with the 3 charms for creating special bracelets.  I like that you can go online and get what seems to be endless ideas of bracelet patterns, necklace, rings and other creative items made with these friendly bands.  I love that the loom is big enough that our 2 girls can work from each end at the same time. It has been a fun project that the little girls and I have been working on together. I recommend this craft kit. I received this product in exchange for a review. I was not compensated for my review and all my opinions are my own, based on my personal experience with the product.

5.0	"I have 5 grandchildren whose ages range from 2 to 7 (2 boys and 3 girls) and I'm always looking for fun things to do with them when I visit.  This product was a gold mind.  They all LOVED playing with this toy.  It's creative, fun and exciting.  My one grandson (age 4) was so excited, he kept jumping up and down the entire time we played with it.  He kept saying \\""I love this game - it's so much fun!!!\\""  I highly recommend this for children who love to use paints and are looking to tap into their creative minds.  Very easy for the children to use and assembly is quick and easy.  I plan on buying this product so we can play with it again very soon."
5.0	i wonder how much this french coin is worth in American usually 50 cents 10 cents.  a keep sake to have mine is  good condition.
5.0	I haven't seen this doll in the store at all I am so happy!
5.0	Hi ! You Slot car racers , Out there This is the set to have . The Tomy International race set , The cars are really fast . With the magnents that makes the cars stay on the track !

5.0	"I actually bought the pieces to make into necklaces.  My best friend and i will be attending the Garbage show in Chicago.  \\""Death for Poppies\\"" from Not Your Kind of People inspired me!"
5.0	This was the perfect gift for my daughters 6th birthday. Working on this book is a great quality time for my daughter and me. This actually is a project that needs time to finish. Perfect!
5.0	My 4-yr-old nephew wears it all the time. He loves it!  It's very thin, so I don't expect it to be passed down to his grandkids or anything. (;  But anytime he's home he's wearing it, so we're happy.
5.0	What a pleasant surprise this costume turned out to be!  I was expecting to receive a costume robe made out of a typically cheap, light-weight fabric, and was so happy to receive a heavy, warm, soft robe with real embroidery.  Paired with his own dress shirt and tie, he looked like a true Gryffindor.  Halloween night was freezing in our neighborhood and he stayed warm and comfortable.  He still loves it and uses it not only for play and dress-up, but also as a bathrobe.
5.0	Great toy!  My grand child loved it!
5.0	"First off, I must confess that I only ordered this to add a little extra \\""clutter\\"" to my collection of props and prop replicas...But I was surprised by how good it looked when it arrived.  As with another reviewer, I was taken back to my youth, when the cheap ink on the pages of \\""Famous Monsters of Fimland\\"" would turn my fingers black, and I got those glimpses of the inside of the AckerMansion (a place more appealing to young men with a certain bent than the Playboy Mansion.)  Take it from a guy with a replica of Barnabas Collins cane, this is a very cool little thing to have!"
5.0	This is a great gift for any budding hair stylist between 5 and 12 years of age.  The kit contains all the young girl could wish for to stylize, color, and glitter Barbie's hair.  This should provide hours of fun  I can't recommend this highly enough.  It will delight any young girl in that age group, and most importantly it will stimulate creativity.  I'm sure any daughter, granddaughter, niece, or whatever will thank you for this delightful gift.
5.0	My son loves his Emmet figurine that he takes him everywhere he goes.
5.0	I didn't know this product came straight from Germany ! That made it even better, just seemed cool. I have to say it is beautiful, and the perfect scale size.<br />Of all the tea sets I have seen, this one is my favorite. I used Elmer's<br />glue to steady the cups to the saucers. Only thing that could make it better is a tray! Good buy, and value.
5.0	My son loves putting this together! A great buy!
5.0	My daughter loves this owl.  It is very life-like and so soft!  It was delivered on time and in good condition.  It was shipped in a mailing envelope though, and was a bit squashed-up, but it has eventually straightened itself out.  A beautiful stuffed animal, just the right size for a little girl to cuddle!
5.0	Bought for a friend that use to collect slap bracelets as a kid and is also terrified of snakes. Great
5.0	Giving this five stars based on my 4 yr old's reaction. She got it for Christmas and still sleeps with her pig and sheep. I personally find them a bit overpriced, but she loves em', so what do I know?
5.0	I loved it so very much it was in very good condition awsome toy it was truly amazing indeed love it
5.0	it was funny great and now when someone says &#34;here's a $300 for the trouble&#34; i can say &#34;boy, i can wipe my but with $300&#34;
5.0	This Hulk was amazing and a lot bigger than I expected.  The recipient of this was thrilled.
5.0	This game is a great time. Just make sure you read all the rules. The overlapping functions of the cards means plot twists at every turn. Just as fun for a small group as a big one.
5.0	Very stable, camera is good for what it is! And you cant beat the price!
5.0	I absolutely love my Rocket Raccoon statue. He stands a little over 3 feet tall and he is by far my favorite piece in my man cave. If you are a Rocket Raccoon fan this is a must own.
5.0	Extremely light, so they can be used in micro light aircraft. These are essentially the innards of the Venom battery checker. Remove the red plastic case, and this is what you would see. They work exactly the same way, so I'm using these instead of my Venom to monitor my LiPo batteries inflight. Also, if you order them, don't let the long estimated shipping time fool you. I received mine two to four weeks EARLY.
5.0	So adorable and looked just like we wanted.
5.0	All you do is take out the battery and stick in the one from this station. Only thing is it's not exactly like rechargeable batteries. Thins charge station comes with it's on battery with a back cover on it. Make sure you don't loose your original battery cover when you use this in case it breaks or you decide you like changing the batteries all the time. It's pretty simple. Just change the back and put it on the mat and walk away.
5.0	I got this for my husband for Christmas, and he was in awe of its beauty.  He was almost speechless!  It really touched his soul.  I didn't realize it was so large.  It will look great in our office or bedroom!  I can't recommend this enough.  It is very authentic, with nice details.
5.0	It is the exact one my daughter lost, so she was happy to get it replaced.
5.0	Babies and children will love this fantastic drum. If purchasing for a baby just set aside the drumstick for when they are older. There is a handy holder for the drumstick attached to the drum.
5.0	We LOVE these guys! I'm a big fan of the elephant and piggy books. My mother-in-law got these for my daughter. At first I was like &#34;oh great! Just what we need-more stuffed animals!!&#34;  But my daughter and I have the best time reading these books while using the stuffed animals to act out the story as we read it. We even make up our own elephant and piggy situations. Highly recommend!!
5.0	We all need to sleeve our cards, and Dragon Shields are about the best you can buy right now.  They do not stick as much, take a beating better, but because they are made of plastic, are stressed by shuffling and playing they are not indestructible, but last longer than other brands I have tried.
5.0	Big hit with the grand kids!
5.0	I bought this as a Christmas gift for my 21 month old nephew. He absolutely loves it! According to his mom, he drags this puppy with him wherever he goes and won't let go of it. He loves the songs and the fact that he moves! It's easily become his favorite toy.
5.0	Being a person with little inspiration, this is a savior. And its helpful knowing there's a bunch of magnetic kits out there. I think it is good for writing poetry, but due to limit of words available (in this kit) I have trouble writing poetry to the fullest. Not only that, the board scratches easily and its sort of annoying to have to root for the right words. Beside that, I think this is a great deal for 20 bucks. Good for budding poets.
5.0	Wonderful calendar for homeschool.
5.0	We always have bought little tyke products for our kids and now too for our grandson! There are many other choices for grocery carts but I knew that thus was the one for us!  My little guy and I put it together and he has been playing with it ever since!
5.0	Purchased as a gift for 10 year old Grandson.  Exactly what he wanted.  Now, just assembly required.
5.0	fitment was great and works like a champ. put this on my ofna buggy. better then the one that came with the buggy.
5.0	This is a great table. I bought it for my daycare and the kiddos use it all the time. We have kept it outside in rain, sun, etc...and no damage or sun wear and tear. The umbrella is very hardy and has gone through some windy storms and stayed put. Overall I am glad I spent the little bit of extra money and bought this. It is easy to store, is pretty lightweight, easy set-up and can fit through almost all doorways so it can be transferred easily from inside to outside.
5.0	These are awesome. The price is a bit steep in some places, but a must for any Star Wars fan! Oh and Drummin' Jedi is wrong about Windu's lightsaber. Mace Windu had constructed a newer and better one.
5.0	It was smaller than expected, but just adorable.
5.0	"This is a really nice coin in \\""good\\"" condition for a reasonable price.  A rare denomination only issued by the US Mint for a few years.  Compliments to the seller who also sent a little bonus along with this coin!"
5.0	I've always been a huge fan of Ms. Marvel, so I had this on pre-order the second I saw it was available. It takes a little getting used to because the style is not normally what we're used to seeing here in America, but believe me, it doesn't take away from the beauty of this sculpt at all. The sculpt captures Ms. Marvel in all of her power and grace and beauty, almost adding real emotion to the piece. And the statue is much larger than expected, but it looks AMAZING on my Diva's of Marvel display shelf. Most statues are made with cold cast porcelain and are MUCH more expensive. Well, the fact that this isn't porcelain, again, doesn't detract from the beauty of the statue at all. It's absolutely a great bargain at this price, which won't last since this is a limited edition sculpt, as they all are. If you're a fan of Ms. Marvel, then this is a MUST have for your collection, and you won't be sorry.<br /><br />  Thanks so much for your time folks.<br />  Sincerely, R.A. McDowell
5.0	I bought this to customize a set of golf clubs. Matched the Nike Vapor clubs perfectly.
5.0	Plane excellant replica, shipped quickly,excellant display piece. Made of solid wood, great craftsman ship. History is niece to physically see
5.0	Roll-O-Puzz lived up to its expectations. I recommend it for everyone who likes to put together puzzles.
5.0	I was a little skeptical buying this set, but am glad I bought it. It is great for travel - takes up no space at all. Not too small to play at home. Very well made.
5.0	The hut is great quality and large in size. Tunnel could be bit longer but we have others so not big deal. Recommend to everyone, well worth money!
5.0	It is just what I was looking for because my son has a birthday coming up and this is just perfect for the theme and what he really wanted.
5.0	I bought this bank for my &#34;football-loving&#34; grandson's third birthday in September '13 and he absolutely LOVES it!  It works perfectly as described ~ very clear sound and solid, attractive structure!  I would highly recommend it for anyone ~ male or female who loves the game, no matter what the age!  What a joy to hear &#34;Touchdown&#34; and the roaring crowd!  Makes saving so much fun!  I love seeing my grandson smile and clap each time he gets to put money in his bank!!!
5.0	This was truely the best deal around! I am very happy with how quick it came and the quality of it.
5.0	I'm in love with the LDD. I have several and I just want more. My sister fell in love with my collection, so when I saw this set I bout it so I could keep one and give her the other one. We both love it. I wish the LDD were taller and cheaper lol, but they're still awesome.
5.0	Team Associated makes great stuff period! I got this barely used and not running but complete. I got a great deal on it as well as everthing I needed to make it the awesome speed monster that it is today. Open box merchandise is a great way to save on Amazon if you have the ability to fix or upgrade yourself. Get an RC18MT any way you can.....it's awesomeness!!
5.0	Planechase is a great way to &#34;spice up&#34; any magic game, and this card is pretty great to play with! Card came in a bubble envelope (with others, I purchased multiple) in excellent condition.
5.0	Great collectors item
5.0	It was a huge hit with my 4 year-old granddaughter. The carry bag it comes with can double as a backpack to carry her dolls and all their clothes, etc. Very nice product.
5.0	My grandaughter loves webkinz and wanted this for Christmas. He was thrilled when he got it. Material smooth, but durable.
5.0	My daughter loved this! It was a stocking stuffer and she constantly wants to push its horn to make it talk :) she's almost 2.
5.0	The kit is beautiful packaged and delivery was prompt.  We gave this kit to our 6 year old grandson.  We also premixed the dry ingredients for the conductor and insulator play dough.  We gave the two premixes to Mom.
5.0	I want to teach my five-year-old granddaughter about sewing and found these cards to meet all my expectations. The materials used are sturdy and will be able to withstand anything my girl has to hand out. The artwork is colorful and appealing to all ages. It is a quality &#34;toy&#34; and I would highly recommend it, and its companions to anyone interested in this type of activity.
5.0	Quick shipping, nice set of bobbleheads
5.0	This is fantastic.  it is so colorful and works great.  My 2 year old grandson loves Thomas and this train.
5.0	First birthday present for our granddaughter.  She took to it immediately.  Only sad thing is it looks like she won't need it much longer.  She was really motivating.
5.0	Im telling you this has power!!!!  It makes my rustler scream. Hard case, great price! A really great product! 1/2 hour at least run time, my motor gets hot before the battery is close to dead. 3 cell remember you will be buying slot of parts cause the power that is unleashed! Buy and race on
5.0	My husband is a cube whiz/collector. We've started to learn that some of the unknown companies that make speed cubes actually make really nice cubes. This is no exception. It turns smoothly and is lovely to hold.
5.0	My grandson will love it.  Thanks for a great product
5.0	Every thing was great.
5.0	Great product. Cute pictures.  Very fast shipping , it got to me 3 days before they said it would.. packaged well.  Thank you
5.0	These toys are all so well made and totally fun for kids to play with.  The packaging is awesome, so easy to unwrap with no wires or tape or plastic ties, very clever boxes.  My grandsons loved this for gifts from the Easter Bunny and they played with them in the pool.  These toys do not seem to get water trapped in any part and are very easy to rinse off and store after playing with in the tub or swimming pool.
5.0	My Niece gave her Christmas list and this was on it of course I had to google it and found it on Amazon she loves it and has made me some very pretty earrings and they don't look cheap or homemade.
5.0	Puzzles for my Aunt.  Love the colors.
5.0	Great transmitter works great. Have used it with all my boats.
5.0	I just bought cuz i collect unicorns and it was pretty. It is true to color. It comes with all the horns you see. The blindfold is cardboard. But I love it.
5.0	Very nice just what I expected
5.0	The metallic colors and unusual shapes had students label these as rare, which made them an excellent prize for top performers in a school club.
5.0	This was the dream of our 10 year old grandson who's been saving his allowance for weeks to buy the hotel. He has already built the hotel and is having a grand time playing with it.
5.0	Grndkids love this, to go with playmobil western fort--it's getting a lot of playtime, is well made, no problems.
5.0	Cannot get enough of these. My job can be really stressful at times and these really help break up my stress.  I have been buying them for all of my coworkers.  Wished we could select the colors.
5.0	Adorable and well made. My granddaughter will love it !😄
5.0	Love it! Pig poppers are the best! Your 2 year old, 10 year old, and 30 year old will love this! I have lost count how many of these I have bought for friends and family. They make a fun popping sound when you shoot the ball out of the pig's snout. Simple yet really fun!
5.0	+great colors, nice, carved patterns on most sides, solid wagon.  would buy this again for my son.  Would recommend to a friend, for sure.  Plus, made in the USA!
5.0	I thought that was a little pricey, but it was a gift for my two nephews, and they told me that they were excited to get some more legos added to their collection, and because they were happy, and give 5 starts.
5.0	My daughter plays with this all the time! Very fun game and entertaining! Not easily breakable. Creative and cute, I enjoy playing w/ her. Fast moving as well.
5.0	Birthday gift and child loved it.
5.0	Just what I wanted for my grandson!  I am looking forward to giving him this at Thanksgiving for being such a great little boy!
5.0	This is a fun new twist on an age old game play. Great value for money, it easy to assembly and provides hours of entertainment as kids learn  (quickly!) how to balance their fun looking pirate penguins on the Pirate ship. I have seen kinds pratice for hours to get all 16 penguins on board but the fun is when they fall off! Nice quality and great value.
5.0	Got this for an almost 3 year old boy that I baby sit.  He loves to watch Curious George.  He takes this bucket with him almost every where he goes.
5.0	my 5 year old loved her cape!
5.0	The girls have had so much fun with these (and mom gets hers back!).  They cook a lot.  lol
5.0	Very pleased with the quality of the nightgown.
5.0	I bought this for my 6 year old grandson.  He loves it and can fly it very well.  The setup was easy, we had purchased him other helicopter types from other manufacturers, but he could not fly them.<br /><br />Also, he broke a propeller and the company helped us get a new very quickly!  Thanks!
5.0	It was challenging but not impossibly difficult. I really enjoyed doing it, even though it took me quite a while.
5.0	"My son received this for X-mas when he was 1 1/2 years old.  We have had it for two years and now have two boys playing with it. It isn't as sturdy as we would have liked but two years later it is still going strong with minor issues with the accessory door and the upright isn't \\""upright\\"" most of the time. I get help with housecleaning and they've learned that cleaning is everybody's responsibility."
5.0	I bought it for my three-year-old nephew and he absolutely loves it. it's a great product that he can play with and that will also teach him.
5.0	My daughter loves animals so these were perfect for her to setup an Animal Kingdom and Shelter with Lego Friends.
5.0	I bought this as a gift for my nice who loves everything Twilight.  She was thrilled when she opened it!  The Alice doll has a beautiful delicate face and very cute clothing!  It was a good price, and shipped very quickly!
5.0	Great product, arrived fast.  I would definitely buy again.
5.0	Great flyer lots of fun takes a little gettting use to but worth the effort. Makes me want to get a bigger one
5.0	The Ladybird's props are pretty stiff but also a little flexible. So far they just seem to pop off in hard crashes. Still though, judging by the scratches all over this canopy it would appear I made a good decision getting it I haven't become brave enough yet to fly it without this canopy but when I do I'll come back & comment about how the weight effects battery life. So far though this thing has done a pretty decent job protecting my quad from my own inexperience. It also looks pretty cool too.
5.0	this is the best,,my grand daughters love it , it was for the 3 yr old , but on Christmas day all of the kids ate on it even the boys whom r older and taller but the 3 yr old is very tall and had no problem sitting at it , will be buying another one r 2 .I read the reviews and was worried about ht. but I have one that is smaller and much older and cheaper and they all still use it , but time to replace it and upate but with 11 grandchildren I need multiples , do ur self a favor by this table very sturdy , well built , don,t waste time looking around ,because I spent hrs looking and for the money and quality this is it , just wish I was a kid again so i'd fit in the chairs for tea party's, don't forget extra chairs
5.0	Best quality puzzles.
5.0	My wife and I purchased a small piano for my 3 year old daughter and thought this would be good for our 10 month old son.  It is great for keeping him interested while he plays with the various music, shape and color options.  It can be turned on by simply hitting it. This is great for little kids but adults can set it off easily (It is also easy to turn off).
5.0	I was told my my granddaughter's parents that she would be receiving a Leap Frog 2 for Christmas and that she loved the games with animals.  The game held her attention immediately.  However; had to wait for battery charger to charge batteries before she could get much more use out of it!!  Glad I got the charger too!
5.0	Softest things I have touched in ages. Really easy to put on, going to look amazing with my Halloween costume!
5.0	Very cute!!! I had read where someone said their cups were smashed so I was really worried but everything was in great shape and how it's suppose to be!
5.0	All of Max steel action figures were great nice size and grandchild love them had a bunch of fun and action figures were very duable
5.0	We bought this doll and another Sonic doll for the grandkids and they loved them! As an old guy, I don't understand the attraction to the Sonic series, but it's real and strong among kids of a certain age, and these dolls play into that attraction very well. They're quality items at a good price, and the delivery was on time (early, actually).
5.0	Perfect for your little princess, if she loves the BArbie series and loves all the songs!
5.0	I travel pretty frequently with my kids (ages 1.5 and 4.5) and I am always on the lookout for good, portable distractions. In advance of a transatlantic plane flight, I got this for my toddler, who had just learned to say the word &#34;buckle.&#34; It was the BEST THING EVER. Her eyes lit up when she saw it. Over the course of a 1-week trip, she went from being able to fasten only one of the three styles of buckle to being able to do all three, and clearly that increase in mastery was delightful to her. She definitely did not tire of it after playing with it every day on the trip, in restaurants as well as on planes, trains, and buses. Also, I hid a Fisher Price Little People figure in the whale's zipper mouth and she loved that too. I chose the whale out of all the Buckle Toy models because I thought it was cutest, but a side benefit is that it functioned as a travel pillow for my older child at one point--it was just the right size to wedge between her head and the plane window. Overall, a fantastic toy and a great value.
5.0	Excellent puppet. Very life- like in looks and movement. Soft plush and much bigger than I thought, which makes it an even better value for the price I paid. The kids love it!
5.0	My 8month old LOVE this toy.  He loves the spinning propeller and all the fun noises it makes. It brings his lots of joy and happy cheers.
5.0	Loveeeee sooo excited when I received it
5.0	The kids love it and it is a good price so I don't have to keep it for years..I can buy a new one next year.  I will check BJ's before I purchase next year because it was $5 cheaper there.
5.0	nice model.delivery on time
5.0	If you love Adventure Time, but you especially love the Earl of Lemongrab and can't find jack for stuff with him featured, this is your keychain. But do make sure the links holding the characters on are connected correctly. The Lemongrab on my previous chain fell off (the only one I bought this for) and so I got this as a replacement. It's super cute and not a cumbersome keychain. If you're looking at this keychain already, you probably want it. So buy it!
5.0	Awesome figure, great buy.
5.0	The best gift of my daughters. The Furby is sensational!
5.0	This was a lot smaller than I expected but absolutely adorable. My son loves it. It lights up when the steam blows and talks.
5.0	Sturdy and lots of fun.
5.0	Every one I sent these to has enjoyed them immensely  One of them was a college student and the other to 55 year old.  Both are ecstatic over the performance of the helicopter.
5.0	Excellent addition to the Princess Elsa halloween costume for my granddaughter...She loves the accessories! she will enjoy them for her trick or treating and for dress up. Item arrived much quicker than anticipated.
5.0	I'll start it off by saying that this is currently my favorite board game that I own (which of course is subject to change as time goes on). I primarily do 90% of my gaming with my g/f so 2player balance in a game is crucial. This is a 2-4p game but it shines in 2p based on my experience with it and rating on Boardgamegeek.com. This game is made by Stefan Feld, one of the best game designers working today.. other great ones from him available through Amazon are Bora Bora  (amazing game) and Trajan (haven't played) which many people consider to be his finest work. Anyways.. he's awesome and makes incredibly rich mechanically-driven games with little theme (arguably)... but that's a good thing for me because I prefer gameplay over asthetic anytime of the day. My g/f cannot end her day without playing this game which works out great for me because neither can I, it's a blast to play every single time. There's so many things to do and think about but it's not a complex game to understand, everything is laid out for you on the main board and the player mats (each person gets one).. and those organize your estate, your currency, goods that you can ship or sell, etc. The objective of the game is to get the highest amount of points and it's a blast because there's a lot of things to do and that's where the mechanics shine. You get to do 2 actions per turn by rolling your dice and depending on what your dice counts are (each die represents one action), you get to do whatever is associated to that number. You can pick up a tile (you place it on your storage inmediately where you have 3 spaces), you can lay one tile down on your estate that's located in your personal mat (whichever one you want from your three that you have on your storage that i mentioned before but it has to be adjacent to a tile that's already laid out, you can never place a tile that's unconnected to another tile), you can ship goods (each good type has a number as well, like everything else) which give you 1 currency regardless of amount that you ship out and 2 points per good.. so if you let's say send 6 goods, you get 1 currency and 12 points..pretty simple or you can pick up goods from the main board, when you do that you need to place em on your good storage (you have 3) and you can stack up goods of same color on top of each other.. but you cannot place a good if you already have your 3 storage spaces occupied by three different colored goods) The game plays out in 5 phase and each phase has 5 rounds.. so 25 rounds in total. If you're on the fence about this one or you're just reading about it now and you'd like to try a great game that's fun (which is the most important thing).. get it ASAP.u 1 currency regardless of amount that you ship out and 2 points per good.. so if you let's say send 6 goods, you get 1 currency and 12 points..pretty simple or you can pick up goods from the main board, when you do that you need to place em on your good storage (you have 3) and you can stack up goods of same color on top of each other.. but you cannot place a good if you already have your 3 storage spaces occupied by three different colored goods) The game plays out in 5 phase and each phase has 5 rounds.. so 25 rounds in total.

5.0	Arrived quickly and as described.
5.0	just what I needed so I could place my receiver where needed.
5.0	A great addition to her house!  My grand daughter loves all things Lundby.  She has the 'remains' of my daughter's Lundby house, furnishings, and people.<br />She loves it as much as my daughter did many years ago.  Most of it held up pretty well.
5.0	I bought this doll for my granddaughters after researching the best baby doll 11 years ago.  Now I have a great great niece.  Still the best.
5.0	this was a gift for a friend at Christmas she was very pleased with it and the price was good.
5.0	This was a gift for my grand daughter and it was  W O N D E R F U L !!!  Arrived early and as described!
5.0	In today's day and age, when everything we do is electronic it is a WELCOME BREAK to play a game, a real game, like we did when I was a kid!!  I was given the chance to review the UnHinged game and I must say I highly enjoyed it!!!  My entire family did, we took it over to family night at the in laws and everyone had a chance to play with it!  Even the littlest had a great time giving it a great test of functionality as she flung it around.<br /><br />Love how the game challenges the brain and makes you think all the while you are having fun!!! :)<br /><br />Highly recommend!!!!
5.0	We ordered this as a ball pit for our son's 1st Birthday party and wow it was such a hit!! At one point there were 3 toddlers, an 8 year old and a 10 year old in there & it held up great! My son loves crawling through the tunnel and it's been a great lesson on 'cleaning up' having him put the balls back inside as they fly out. It's super easy to fold up and stores away very compactly. We've only put it away a handful of times in the past 3 months though because my son always asks for it so we end up putting it back out for him. It's so great for when his toddler friends come over. I've seen all ages enjoy it, from 6-month olds to 10 year olds, so I'm looking forward to it getting a lot of use!
5.0	This was a gift purchase for grandson and he was thrilled.
5.0	This was just perfect for our 18 mo. old daughter. She got this for Christmas, and loves it (3 yr. old brother enjoys putting her dolls in there, too!). She rocks her baby to sleep every night before she goes to bed. It's not too big, not too small, and is just right for her little hands and little dolls! Great sturdy product.
5.0	I searched for a doll stroller/carriage for my 3 year old and finally found this one. It is sturdy and long enough for her cabbage patch doll. The basket area even comes out so she can carry her doll without the carriage. The wheels are white so they don't leave black marks on our floor or walls, and it came almost completely assembled and was so simple to put together. Now she pushes all her animals and dolls in this. She puts the little ones in the basket underneath. This is a fabulous doll carriage; it has all the extras we were looking for. We highly recommend it.
5.0	My 4 year old just got this for Christmas, he is having a blast with it. Only thing is daddy wishes there were more tools so he can dig too.
5.0	It was  a good item and I liked it
5.0	Much more fun than the original Floppy Cube.  The only flaw with this puzzle is that when you turn a side (in this case, a single edge with two corners connected), there are more stickers on the inside face of other pieces.  Although it adds more color to the puzzle, sometimes the stickers get snagged on each other when I try moving pieces around.  Regardless of aligning pieces, this is always a problem every time I solve it.  It's really not that big a deal; this puzzle is very fun to mess around with.
5.0	Great tent for kids - easy enough to construct and take down and looks cool in person. Sure my son is going to love on Xmas.
5.0	The soccer piggy bank is great quality and price! Perfect fit for the shelf, looks great, easy to open, and a great conversation piece.
5.0	The hat fits an adult head very well, and it is made of high quality velvet. Very comfortable to wear and looks exactly like it does in the movie. I might have to buy another one for my sister!
5.0	The shark warrior is so cool!  The Amazon picture is terrible - the best view of the keychain is definitely to the side.  What you can't see in the picture is that he has his intricate tribal markings at the top of the head and also on the front of the chest and legs.  Due to the nature of his physique, his head doesn't rotate like the other Lego figures/keychains. But the head is a separate element and he has a separate grey belt at the waist.  Because the arms and legs are movable, you can have fun posing him (the legs move independently, which is nice!). Even the wrists move so you can move around the hands.<br /><br />The really nice thing about the Lego keychains is that they actually stay on the ring and don't fall off easily. I've had some on my key chain for over a year now with no problem.<br /><br />It's a great little keychain and a fun toy to boot!
5.0	"This is a cute set of characters as described. They came factory sealed in original McDonald's plastic packaging. My daughter loves the smaller size. They are about 4 inches tall and similar to the \\""Kelly\\"" doll size. They were very nice and I was happy with the purchase."
5.0	I bought this doll for my seven year old daughter for a christmas gift. She absolutely loves this doll. I even Barbie was pushed out the way for this doll.
5.0	I ordered these because my oldest has expressed interest in learning how to play this game. I have absolutely no clue how to play but am wanting to learn along with her. My deck came with everything promised. There are some duplicates but not too many. From what I understand, you cannot play a game with this deck alone. This is a great start for us to build our decks though. I received these in exchange for our honest opinion.
5.0	Beautiful construction and looks like a mountain lion.  A friend bought it and is using it in a Preschool presentation.  This kids love it, too.
5.0	I got this for my 4 year old niece and she loves it.  Quick shipment and product as described.  Great price.
5.0	Right out of Disney's Dinosaur, really fantastic.
5.0	We are very satisfied with this pool light and the colors worked well with our room  The light seems to be well made.. The only difficulty I had during installation was trying to ge the electric cords through the openings in hooks of the ceiling fixture.  Had to cut 1 wire off for about 2 inches, pull the remainng wire through the opening, then tug as needed.
5.0	We bought 2 camera for our 5 & 6 year old grandsons. They are durable and have been dropped many times. The pictur quality isn't always that great but the boys don't care. They love adding funny eyes and noses. They learned to use the video option on their own. The games built in kept them busy in the back seat on a long trip. I am thinking of buying 2 more for my twin 4 year old grand daughters!
5.0	Great teaching tool.  I purchased it for a 3 and 4 year old...I feel like it should be more for 5 and 6 year old.
5.0	Love scout just FYI always check the batteries I didn't the batteries leaked and scout was no longer available to work so I ordered another one
5.0	the baby face lit up when he herd rattle playing think this will be one his favorites toys seems well constructed
5.0	Kids love this game. Sets their imagination going. I have both the orange and the blue sets. Mix them up :)
5.0	I like playing chess because it is an old game that was famous for helping pass the time and I want to bring that back.<br />It is very sturdy and I like it because it is made of wood.
5.0	Received as requested with no problems.
5.0	Super cute set for my 8-year-old's poker party.  (What 8-year-old girl wants to have a poker party for her birthday?)
5.0	It's a great story and Christmas tradition.  My grandaughter will enjoy watching the dvd as well as looking for her elf each morning.
5.0	This is a wonderful bouncer, the sounds and sites are great. It really catches the eyes of any babies that use this.  The colors  of the lights is wonderful.
5.0	Perfect for American Girl clothes, and it fits in her doll armoire.  The little cutouts allow for hanging tanks and strapped dresses.  We bought some regular sized hanger clips (Mainstays Multi-purpose Hanger Clips) in order to hang skirts and tights.  They're a little bulky on these small hangers, but it works!  I'm happy to have the doll clothes clean and organized.
5.0	PURCHASED AS REPLACEMENT FOR EXISTING SWING-SET .  ONE OF ORIGINAL SWINGS WAS STOLEN . THIS NEW ITEM IS AN IDENTICAL MATCH WITH SURVIVING SWING . DELIVERED AS ADVERTISED .. GOOD PRODUCT FOR YOUNGER CHILDREN - SEAT CONFORMS TO CHILD'S BUTT CREATING A COMFORTABLE , TIGHT FIT .
5.0	These are a lot of fun, but they are very big!  I was surprised but it made them all the more fun.  The blinky lights are perfect for lighting up the crowd1
5.0	This product is of high quality for my son. He love it.<br />I recommend this toy to everyone for their excellent design
5.0	It was a special request for a birthday and it filled the bill. Seven more words sounds like a nag.
5.0	Well-made, soft dragon is the highlight of her Easter gift.  She says that the Easter bunny is a good sewer!
5.0	My 4 year old daughter loves this game!
5.0	the strings are very good quality and are a good price. i reccomend this to someone that uses yoyos very often
5.0	Time well spent, the parts are intricate yet sturdy enough. I used smaller cuticle scissors to cut out the parts and it worked wonderfully. Will buy more from the series. Looking forward to their bigger models.
5.0	A must buy. I absolutely love this figure & it's detail. It's huge compared to all of my other play arts figures, since it's part of the KAI series. I will definitely purchase more play arts kai figures! Just because of how awesome this figure is.
5.0	All I can say is AWESOME! !!
5.0	If you like living life in the fast lane, this is the figure for you.  Weather it's all-night coke binges or using and tossing away scores of barely-legal chicks, this is the lifestyle accessory you must have.  Great figure, just like the model I poured Hennessey on at the club.
5.0	My son was so happy with getting this for his birthday.  A very unique piece and well made.
5.0	I am a 65 year old man who enjoys adventure, challenges, and fun. This maze ball has got to be one of the most incredible fun type challenges that I have ever come across. Rolling the small bearing inside the bigger clear ball through 100 stations on suspended tracks is much more difficult than it looks. It involves total 3D hands on action that beats out any other computer or electronic game. You have to tilt the thing in every direction, holding it over your heard or at your beltline; keeping an extremely steady hand. One slight over-reaction will cause the bearing to fall off the track whence you have to start over at station one or at two other mid points along the way. I have been playing with this gizmo for over 10 years and never made it all the way to the end. I did finally make it up to station 99 and it fell off there.....argggggggggggggh! I heard that the inventor has only completed all 100 stations 5 times, but not sure if this is correct.    I do think there is some kind of miracle involved in mass producing Superplexus with each one being exactly the same. I personally turn off the sound since I find it too frantic, but I do like to keep the timer running which records the present and high scores.    I think you can still get Superplexus for around $20 at Ebay. Keep checking for it and you'll find one at a reasonable price.
5.0	Daughter loves Grumpy Cat.
5.0	This toy is great! My 4-year-old got this for his birthday. He played with it for a whole straight hour after it got out of the box. Amazing how a simple toy encourages the use of his imagination. We got this along with the safari jeep. Both toys are fantastic.
5.0	One of the funniest things I have ever purchased.  If you like to laugh, this is the toy for you!
5.0	First off let me say this may be one of the most poseable 6'' spiderman figures you will ever see.Every finger moves.This figure has nice colors (sleek red and black).It has underarm webbing,better to remove it, that is not very cool.This figure has nice tight joints and can hold a pose really well.Highly recommeneded!!!!!!!
5.0	adorable,lovely,so cute even for adults..but above all the size is perfect for 3-4 old kid to hold comfortably most of the time that's why i give 5 stars &#34;at least &#34;
5.0	This game provides considerable entertainment and is great for young and old alike.  I especially like playing it with my 7year old to help her learn how to spell words and to see patterns.  This is a great game if you like the idea of scrabble, but are looking for something with a little more action.  The object is for each player to arrange their 12 letters into a crossword-like grid using all of the letters before their opponent does.  Score one point for each hand some - first to 10 points wins the game.
5.0	This was a gift and the little girl was screaming happy!!!<br />Carolyn
5.0	"So I got these here protector sleeves to protect my MTG cards. It is hard to have strong feelings about the protector sleeves, but I Never considered their \\""fun level\\"" or \\""educational value.\\"" Obviously, the protector sleeves didn't teach me any thing, and they arent particularly fun in their own rite,just so much as they protect my valuable cards collectors value while I can put them in a deck and play them."
5.0	Cannot go wrong with Little Tikes.  This is so cute and it teaches little hands to put shapes in the right hole plus the colors are so cute.  I cannot wait to give it to my grandson for Christmas!
5.0	GREAT GRANDDAUGHTER LOVED, CAN'T GET HER TO SLEEP IN HER BED
5.0	Just played this last weekend for the first time as one of my friends just got it.  It is a great game, with very well thought out and balanced mechanics, but is easy to learn (which means i can get my wife to play with me).  It is definitely more fun (ie challenging) when there are 3 or 4 people as there is a lot more conflict for resources & positioning.  This game is definitely going on my list to buy.
5.0	I usually feel nervous whenever I order cards (or other fragile items) online. I feel as if they would bend or show creases whenever they arrive. However, when the package arrived sooner than expected and in really tight packaging, all my worries were gone.
5.0	We purchased this dress for my 2 1/2 year old's Halloween costume. It fits her well - she has plenty of room to grow but it won't be too long for her to walk in and it looks super adorable on her.  She is not tall for her age, in fact, she may be a little small so I was worried it would be big. I'm delighted that it is not.  It is also better quality than any of the other Halloween costumes we'd seen, and I'd say better than most of the Disney or other brands available year round in the store for dress up. The crown and wand are cute, and I also love that they are not actual choking hazard gemstones.  High quality and perfectly pretty- she'll surely get lots of play out of it long after Oct 31st.
5.0	According to Wikipedia, the multi-award winning Juno series is now defunct. It's a pretty crowded marketplace and even the best products can get lost in the shuffle.<br /><br />This should not have been one of them. Fortunately, the music and DVDs are generally available and they're wonderfully produced with full orchestrations and excellent performances.<br /><br />This particular album contains a variety of songs from the videos performed by a fine cast. This album contains all original songs created for the series.<br /><br />Great music should be passed along to kids, and this is a way to introduce little ones to the elements of music.
5.0	This is a great product - quick service - kids loved it and I would definitely purchase this item again
5.0	This product was provided at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review. Controlling this little copter takes some getting used to, but I took it to my office and the girls had a great time figuring it out. Lots of fun and a uniques way to reduce workplace stress and team build. Definitely worth the price!
5.0	Worked great for our zombie themed halloween party!
5.0	It is a compact little bounce house with a water slide. Perfect for active toddlers and up to 85 or so lbs. There is a point at which the kids are just too big to use it. but they all seem to love it. packs down easy and actually fits in the bag!!!!
5.0	OMG!  This dog it great!  It was a gift for my 16 month old.  He loves dogs and was absolutely thrilled when he got this and saw that he walks, wags his tail AND barks!!!
5.0	Excelant quality. hope to get others made this well. will look for mank. compeny agine. Thanks Glenn
5.0	Last year on July 31, 2012, my little grandaughter Tatiana Marie, who lived in the NICU for 8 long suffering and fighting for her life months was finally put to rest and cremated and her ashes were placed in one of these beautiful Urns. I painted it in a glossy pink with arcylic paints, it looks beatiful. It is now in my mothers home (Tatiana Marie's great grandma) This was the most heartfelt times of my family's life. We remember and miss her every single day... But, she has gone to heaven and is in the care of God, she is an angel, and is in peace without pain!
5.0	I am so happy with my purchase of this train!  I wanted a train for the Holiday window display for my skincare salon, and shopped at one of my local merchants.  I like to shop local whenever possible, but I couldn't afford their prices this time.  The train I wanted was twice the price at the store, and was so happy to find one I could afford as a new business owner. My clients loved the display, and it added a fun touch to my salon reception!
5.0	i love these puzzles and usually figure them out within minutes or hours... but i've been working at this christmas gift for 10+ hours... and still haven't figured out how to get it apart, yet!  very puzzling, indeed.
5.0	The plastic board is literally a game changer. It saves tons of time setting the game up and prevents in game board disruptions. A must have for any Catan fan.
5.0	The kids loves it.  They had a great time putting it together they asked for more halo mega bloks.  Thanks
5.0	Great product very pleased
5.0	Awesome penguin! Put it in a homemade snow globe! :)
5.0	This is a great item. It came just as described, and even surpassed my expectations as far as material, comfort, and picture quality, it also arrived days before the earliest delivery estimate.
5.0	Fun for all ages! we had 5 yrs old thru 72 yrs..  Everyone just really enjoyed the game!
5.0	I got this becasue it is very hard to find waterpainting type books in traditional children's stores.  I was looking for something that would keep my 3.5 year old daughter interested and occupied and this did it.  She loves the water pen and even though there are only 4 pages in this book; that is more than enough since when the pages dry the color fades and she has the chance to reveal the colors and pictures all over again. And best of all no mess on my furniture or walls.
5.0	My husband is thoroughly entertained by this, and the fact that you can make them sing faster or slower depending on when your push on the tummy. :)
5.0	Love it's power and abilitys with low coast mana
5.0	GOT A VERY GOOD PRICE AND THE KIDS LOVE IT.  WE SAVED OVER 40 DOLLARS . HERE ARE FOUR MORE WORDS FOR YOU.
5.0	This is the second one we've purchased, my sons loved it so much that it is now to go to gift for other curious bug catchers!
5.0	Great case.  Will hold many figures.  Priced well.
5.0	soft and perfect condition.
5.0	Batteries more than met expectations, I bought 2,  doubled flight time, same charge time as lesser battery. Good move.
5.0	So cute!  I love these Schleich figures.  The detail is wonderful, and my daughter plays with them for hours.
5.0	This game is super cool I loved it for its uniqueness but it is also great quality.<br />Basic Monopoly rule and pieces with a John Wayneishness about all of it!<br />So fun!
5.0	Perfect for all my old pokemon cards. great price too
5.0	I got this puzzle for my youngest son. He loves it!  The knobs are big enough for him to grab it without being oversize like the ones in other brands that are almost the size of the puzzle piece. The illustrations are beautiful and the quality very good. I'm very satisfy with this purchased.
5.0	I am so impressed with this dollhouse, and I really feel like I got a bang for my buck. My 7 year old had wanted a house to fit her Barbies for her birthday, initially I was going to get her the Barbie Dream House, but after looking at pictures, she wasn't impressed with the size of it, two barbies in one room looked crowded. This dollhouse is open and spacious, it feels sooooo solid. The furniture it came with is great, the lamp that lights up, the toilet that flushes and the piano that plays were all nice touches. The bed even has a padded mattress. The shutters open and close also. I don't think my daughter has given the thing a rest since she got it. I am so super happy with this purchase, and I feel like it will probably last for quite a bit of time. My husband said it was a hassle to put together, and it took two people to carry it in the house, but it's such a great item I can't even fault it for this. I would completely recommend.
5.0	ITS PERFECT FOR MY GRANDDAUGHTER WHO IS A LITTLE PRINCESS. SHE WILL ENJOY THE SOUND OF THE WORKABLE HAIR DRYER.
5.0	Cool barnyard is looking good with this addition
5.0	I introduced this to my friend who is good at chess. The board is elegant, and I love the font of those pieces!!
5.0	What is great about these is they are left out, they don't dry out.  Long-lasting and my daughter really enjoys them.
5.0	This train is not only beautiful to look at but so well made that I can see it lasting through generations.  My son plays with it constantly and although it is a bit pricey, I think that it is worth it.  Also, it is made in the USA  which is always a plus.
5.0	I got this for my nieces first birthday and she loves it.  She always wants to get on it and when she does she has a great time.
5.0	This game arrived before it was expected to. Even though I purchased the game on a Saturday, I got an email the same day saying that it was ready to be shipped.<br />This game is truly great, Loved it!!!
5.0	My son loves his Super Mario Plush toys! Bowser Jr is so cute! He loved it!
5.0	Great for using in k classroom.
5.0	Very cute!  Exactly as pictured!  I used these tutus for my daughter's 2nd birthday party and the girls loved them.
5.0	Well made, beatiful colors. Should be years of fun for my nephew
5.0	Purchased this item to replace the gear box that had stripped out in my son's John Deere Gator battery operated toy. It is a little different than the one that was in there before but fit in the same slot and works great! The kid is happy and so am I!
5.0	This is exactly what we needed.  Easy to put out when the kids are playing.  Very easily visible by drivers.
5.0	I got this for my two year old grandson for his birthday.  He loves it! His older cousins joined in the fun an d it kept 5 kids happy for hours!
5.0	Cards arrived exactly as described. Definitely happy with this purchase.
5.0	My 3 year old son LOVES the Max and Ruby show.  When I found these dolls I thought it would be the perfect Christmas gift.  The dolls stand up without falling over and are not too big or too small.
5.0	I bought this bundle for an 18 month old boy, and two 2 yr old boys.  One of the 2 yr old boys is my son and he loves it.  I think it's the magnets that really attracts play to these games.  He loves it when the magnet on the string clicks with the magnet on the board.  He smiles, laughs and says &#34;I did it!!&#34;
5.0	My son, 3 1/2, and I picked out this Dino a few months ago when they first came out. He had seen the commercials and was really eager to get it and start playing and changing it from the race car to the dino, especially because these are his two favorite things and with more than 50 sounds it was fun to change those too. He really loved the vibrant look and feel of it, no matter if it is a dino or the race car, but the problematic area is that it is actually kind of confusing for him to interchange them quickly and efficiently without some assistant from me or his older sister. He would get really upset and frustrated that he couldn't do it himself and then didn't want to play with it again for awhile (toddlers are all about independence and doing it all by themselves at this age). I have to admit that even I had some issues in converting them back and forth at times too. Other than that frustration, he really liked it and the numerous car and dino sounds. At $15-$20 each, it is a bit pricey though to buy at his age and he is pretty advanced for his age.
5.0	This is the cutest costume ever!!!
5.0	cute! was a gift, and the little girl loved it
5.0	Better than in the photo!
5.0	I reviewed the regular Maggie, and she is great. I also included the details on this version, which is even better.  Her pop seems to be a bit under the radar, but my advice would be not to ignore her for too long, she is super popular, not just because the character is so well liked on walking dead despite criticisms of her and Glenn's romance being a little over the top, but the actress who plays her is stunningly beautiful! if you have not caught on talking dead, look her up, you won't be able to take your eyes off her.<br /><br />This pop is very very well made, as good as prison yard rick, and this exclusive will not last long. the details are wonderful, and her blood splatter is almost as good as prison yard rick. Pair her with Bloody Glenn and you are good to go.<br /><br />She is worth the price!!!
5.0	Love this puppet! Looks realistic, not comical, and fits even an adult hand easily. Great for tickling people with the slurpy tongue, or for teasing the dogs who don't know what to make of this creature! A nice gift for an anteater collector or a child, but just as fun for anyone you know.
5.0	I picked this up for my Ellaloopsy and her loopsy minis at Walmart for $29.99.  I wouldn't have paid more than that for sure.  It is super cute though and includes a mini-loopsy with pet, some little accesories and picnic table.  All the little furniture sets that are sold for lalaloopsy minis coordinate and match perfectly with this house set.  There is a cute little elevator that works pretty easily and Ella had no trouble operating (she is 6), doors and windows throughout, and it is very colorfully decorated; circa Lalaloopsy style.  There is the pet attic, with plenty of room for the loopsy pets to circulate and snuggle.  And rooms for all of the furniture sets to be set up in should you choose to buy them for your child.  Should you choose not to, that is fine too as everything is colorful and fun even without the added furniture.  Ella already had the bedroom set from Christmas, before getting this for her Birthday, so she put that inside and played away.  There is plenty of room for lots of mini-lalaloopsy friends.  Ella has about 10 now and they all congregate throughout the house and even have room to invite a few Polly Pockets and Little Einsteins over for tea!  Highly Recommended :)
5.0	I am a huge fan of &#34;The Walking Dead&#34;, and this figure is the first time I ever discovered some TWD figures. With Shane being pretty much my favorite character from the franchise, I thought he'd be perfect as my first figure. The only issues I had were that the back of the figure's packaging had tape on it, though I'm not sure if this was because of a previous opening or just to fix the package...
5.0	Great price to get an extension loom and additional bands.  No instructions included for first time buyers though.
5.0	excellent price, good dolls, my granddaughter loved them.
5.0	It has been two weeks since we left Navlia, and I grow wary of the rations Waine bought while we were in town. The Canned Unicorn Meat from Radiant Farms is delicious, as promised on the tin. I appreciate the manufacturer's use of magically neutral metal. The side effects are what concern me.<br />Normally a jovial fellow, Waine has begun constantly playing practical jokes, and laughing in even the direst of circumstances. I myself have found that my anger and my focus have dulled noticeably. This is not acceptable, for our very lives depend on our abilities to stay sharp and keep our wits about us as we near the Tower.<br />Should we survive the days ahead, I plan on visiting this farm, and investigating their business practices. I worry about the scale of their operation, what the consequences might be- if the harvesting of these majestic creatures might have unintended results in the future.<br />[[ASIN:B009IKIKZK Apprentice Swordceror (The Blademage Saga)]]
5.0	Perfect to take with you in the car. Scaled for little hands.  Sturdy like their bigger counterparts .
5.0	Well made. Arrived in good condition. Gave as gift, they loved it!
5.0	SOOO SOFT AND SOOOO CUTE!!!!
5.0	Used as the topper for a wedding cake and it worked perfectly.  Finding the red head girl was tough though.
5.0	I saw these at a presentation & everyone loved them. They expand & retract and make great talking sticks, etc. Loved them as presents for my teacher friends. I couldn't find them anywhere locally & they came very promptly. Impressed!
5.0	This shark pirate helps keep my on track while writing software. Not sure why he doesn't have an eye patch. I guess that would be a bit much?<br /><br />Note: The only things that move on the figure are the swords which are removable.
5.0	Keep in mind, this is a travel set - I saw a review that I think forgot that detail.  No complaints.  Beautiful pieces, normal size height and width, the depth is thinner as this is a travel set.  Long trays, enough for 17 tiles.
5.0	This comic book box is the strongest comic box I've ever owned.  The cardboard is super strong and can hold a lot of weight.  The design is very cool too.  I just love the colors and the slogan on it.  &#34;Born to Avenge&#34;.  I highly recommend using these boxes.
5.0	Always a welcome gift.
5.0	It is one of my favorites because you don't see them often so I like it. Plus it gets a good laff
5.0	I love it! It's awsome!
5.0	Great price. My grandson will love this Christmas gift
5.0	Birthday gift for a grandson. He loves it!
5.0	This hat is great for persons who work in the sun. The flap provides your neck and the side of your face with protection from the sun.
5.0	Perfect for little people, 2 year old now vacuums her playroom daily!  Height & weight are perfect for little hands.
5.0	This has turned out to be a very happy family past-time. I've used this game every day since it arrived in the mail.
5.0	Awesome product.luv it.
5.0	Our baby loved this at three months. His cousin that is 3 weeks younger liked it so much we bought him one too. Now my son is 5 months and both babies still love this toy
5.0	I have had it for a while and it still works. It is very bright as I wanted it to be. I like it!
5.0	Small but cute colors. easy to find outdoors.
5.0	My grandson carries it everywhere with him. For now at least it is his favorite toy. Grandma's rock when they indulge their grandchildren (within limits of course)
5.0	A Christmas gift for my grandsons who loved it and have spent a lot of time building different structures with it.
5.0	Very durable.  I bought this for my 17month old, but right now, my 3 year old likes it more.  It' works well in helping him release his toddler frustrations ;o)
5.0	I won this in a white elephant exchange at work and brought it home to my son to play with.  It was a HUGE hit.  He even wanted to sleep with it in bed that night.  I ended up buy 10 more to give out as gifts to kids at a holiday party...again, a hit!  So simple, yet it entertains kids.
5.0	Perfect,great product
5.0	Bought this as a family Christmas gift for game nights - played it once so far, seems pretty fun, probably more fun with 3 or 4 players though.
5.0	I've had way too much fun with this so far...dressed up as Sarah Jessica Parker for halloween so this completed the set! :)
5.0	My 2 year old granddaughter has had a ball playing with this toy! It is much sturdier than I thought it would be and a great toy for the price.
5.0	"We have the \\""Original\\"" Big Wheel (not really the same as the original by the way) and it is holding up fine but the kids don't really like it much because the wheel doesn't grip so it doesn't go fast.  We bought this Radio Flyer for my four year old and he loves it.  He figured out how to twist it from a trike to a chopper and back on the first day.   He rides it everywhere.  It will last for a long, long time.   It is well built and well balanced. And it goes fast!"
5.0	I so appreciated the speedy processing and shipment of my order. I placed the sand in a plastic bin for my grandbaby to play with, and she liked it very much. I will but from Sandtastik again in summertime.
5.0	Not for play, this is my toy, I keep it in the box because I don't want any damage or fading to occur.  My collection and keepsake, I have the Billy Jean one too and will purchase the Beat it doll too.  Love it I will have him with me forever.  My, (will), please place gently in coffin. (LOL).  It is a nice collectors item and should be had for your collection true fans.
5.0	Bought for my grandson to  play with at my house.  He is 2 years old and he loves fire engines. He has so much fun with it.
5.0	I love putting these together! This one is a easier one to start off on.
5.0	buy ordering this card it help me complete my set which still has a few left to go but helps me get one card closer to my goal
5.0	I got this for my 18 month old granddaughter and she loves it!!  She enjoys sitting in it and knows how to convert it to a bed. She will nap there, too!
5.0	My six year old son and I love this puzzle. It's beautiful, sturdy, and fun to build. The puzzle is actually rectangular, but the box is not. The box is also sturdy and will hold up well. Highly recommended!
5.0	This is an awesome device!  It plays music and has arms, colored under the bottom, which will say the name of the color.  My granddaughter is pre-verbal, but loves it.  Should be even better when she starts to learn colors.
5.0	I have been collecting breyers since I was 3 years old. I am now 14 years old, and I love all the Breyer Best in Shows (Thoroughbred, Arabian, and this Stock Horse)This horse is a beautifully detailed, gorgeous  honey-golden buckskin/dun with a realistic black mohair mane and tail. He even has subtle leg bars if you look closely. His banded-braided mane is also hand braided and made of mohair, and his icy blue glass eyes are just stunning! Also, he has an etched bald face and one white sock. I would highly recommend this model as a shelf model only and for older collectors (12yrs and up) If you are looking for a child's toy, this is not your way to go. Even though this toy is very durable (even the hair dosen't fall out! :D), this is labeled as a Model Horse,as all Breyers are labeled as, and is not one of those Barbie Princess horses that you can just throw around and yank their hair out. This model(like all Breyers) is made of molding and part resin, not plastic. This model is beautiful and I would highly recommend him for the older shelf-model horse collector! :D
5.0	I really like these pages. The only thing I think I would change is having them be two-sided. I bought them knowing they were only one-sided so that was not the issue. They are good, sturdy pages and I am glad I bought them!
5.0	our FAVORITE of the transformers! His colors are vibrant and he arrived un damaged!
5.0	Prefect duplicate of the real thing, again my 1 and 1/2 year old grandson loves helping mama with house work
5.0	This ship is amazingly detailed and adds a great deal of variety to the game.  It's size is also perfeoct and a lot bigger than the pictures lead you to believe.
5.0	I am a big fan of Cloe, so I expected myself to purchase the Ooh La La Cloe, but instead, I set my eyes on Kumi. She looked absolutely beautiful wrapped in a box, in her green mini-skirt, pumps, knee-high stockings, 'I Love Paris' shirt, and wonderful purple shrug/jacket. Including her flowery hat. I adore this doll! When I bought it, I wasn't at all unhappy with it. Personally, this photo doesn't do her justice but the doll itself is absolutely outstanding. I wouldn't judge the doll from this picture, I would go out and look at it for yourself. This is the most precious gift to give to you're granddaughter, daughter, niece, cousin, or any young girl relative. She is absolutely beautiful, and I love looking at her. I suggest buying it for a christmas gift to you're loved ones.
5.0	Solid kit fast shipping
5.0	Got this for my baby brother. And he loves it! :)
5.0	All my family enjoyed a lot playing Mexincan Trian from Double 12 to Zero and from Domble 15 to zero.
5.0	I like the game Catan: Seafarers 5 and 6 Player Extension . THough I haven't used it yet, I like the base game.
5.0	My nephew loves this hand gun toy
5.0	Perfect condition and exactly what I wanted as a gift. The  adult I gave it to was impressed with model and control he had.
5.0	I bought this toy in a used lot,luckily it had all the parts ( monsters not included). I share this toy with my brother,and it is AWESOME to play with! Its' drill really turns in two directions, it is VERY durable and comes with a minifigure and dynamite! The only thing about it is, when the drill tip is pressed too hard against something, the gears get jammed. Also the wheels don't turn well on flat,or slippery surfaces, like sand. Overall, it is definitely the BEST of the Lego power miners!I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS SET!
5.0	Love this mold but a little to big
5.0	Fun little set, my son loved it.  Playmobil is the best of the best of toys.  The water adventure sets are so cool!
5.0	This one didn't last as long with my 5 year old, mainly because he was just coming out of his mickey stage but it is a great toy and fun!
5.0	My 3 year old daughter got this for her birthday and loves it! She's playing with it as I type this. I think it is great for not only pretend play, but for learning purposes. She loves to give fake shots, and uses the tools to look in mommy and daddy’s ears. She went to the dr. last week for her well visit and is now imitating what the dr. was doing using her toys. I think it is a great imaginary play toy. You can't expect these things to work like the real ones, 1) because they're toys and 2) because it was less than $20. It's a toy!
5.0	Another item to add to the tea party supplies.  big and bold, inexpensive must have for little girl tea party
5.0	My brother was turning 18 and wanted cash for his birthday. Well I didnt want to just hand him over some money and it call it a day. That would have been boring. I got the bilz box, cut some cash in it and then duct taped the whole thing with lots of duct tape and wrapped it with birthday wrap. I wrapped it in duct tape in case the game was too easy for him. I wanted him to work for that money! The game actually ended up taking him hours. It was blast watching try open it and play the game.
5.0	My friend love this toy. He loved so much that he has not open it yet.
5.0	Good solid football, my son likes it! Happy with my purchase.
5.0	These marbles were consistent in both color and size and they will work great with our homemade Joker board game.
5.0	They withstand a lot, are fun for little ones to have. The cord will release with pressure yet not break, you can just snap it back together, well worth the money - they were inexpensive
5.0	We all love this. It is so funny. Much rather play this one vs regular
5.0	My son LOVES this thing!  The ONE thing that 'gets' him about it (it seems... he's not even two yet) is that when you knock down one of a pair, the other one comes up.  He's an &#34;All down&#34; or &#34;All Up&#34; sort of guy - almost OCD-ish in some ways - and that was tough for him at first, although he figured out how to get them all to stay up, so before he stops playing with it, he leaves them that way.
5.0	figure is realy nice looking! one of the best!
5.0	This wooden puzzle with pegs helps the little ones pick up the puzzle pieces by the pegs and the cut-outs for the animals are high quality.  Came in on time as promised.
5.0	My son did good on this.
5.0	You want a game better than just about every eurogame out there.  It is Princes of Florence.  THis game is incredible.  The only slight drawback is the length of time between turns.  But, even this is mostly filled with you agonizing over your options on your next turn.  Tough choices, great auction mechanic, cool board, cool concept.  I go through games incredibly fast, and this has rmained in my house for 5 years.  WOW.  Buy it now!
5.0	The whole Fisher Price Princess Castle thing is sooooooooooo cute!I love how each princess has their own idenity and a differnet voice!
5.0	great product I highly recommend
5.0	very handy for storage when i hit a puzzle slump.<br />Puzzle stays in place. The bins keep the pieces well separated.
5.0	This is a must have for all homes! My daughter absoultly loves this! shes been in it since she was 4 months old. I don't know what i'd do with out it. Its easy to put together and stores well also. I can't express how much i really love this product.
5.0	"First, I love this helicopter.  I'm not a hardcore heli enthusiast, but I've owned four different low to moderate end RC helicopters (under $[...]), and the Blade mSR is without question the best value of the lot.  My five-star rating doesn't mean that it's perfect in every respect, but that its quality, performance and features offered vastly exceeded my expectations for the price.  The beauty of this helicopter is that with the exception of full collective pitch, it has essentially the same basic capabilities as a regular helicopter or models that cost far more. Most small helis of this size are sold as \\""toys\\"" for children.  Typically they achieve rotational stability by means of counter-rotating main blades rather than with a tail rotor.  This makes them stable, but extremely boring to fly since they have very limited maneuvering capabilities. This isn't the case with the Blade.    It isn't a toy.  Don't buy it for your kid unless the kid has flown before, or is mature enough to take it seriously and devote the hours of practice needed to learn to fly an RC aircraft. The good news for new fliers though is that the mSR is so lightweight and flexibly built that it holds up extremely well to rough landings.  The only thing I've had to do so far is snap the landing skids back into place after slamming it into the wall or floor a few times.  I also had to straighten out a tweaked tail rotor blade (by hand) once.  The main rotor blades are hinged at the hub so that if you hit something, it probably won't cost you a rotor blade (unlike my Helimax Axe/CP).    The mSR is stable - trimmed out you can take your hands off the controls and it will stay pretty much in one place, for several seconds anyway. It's best flown indoors or outside in very still air.  A stiff breeze will put it in the trees before you know it.  The delivered batteries will give you about 6 or 7 minutes of flight, 8 or a little more with the 150mah batts that Amazon sells to go with it.  One other great thing is the charger.  It will charge four batteries at a time in about a half hour.  If you have six batteries, you could probably arrange to fly it almost non-stop.  I find that with the two batteries that come with the Blade and the two extras I bought though, I get my fill in one session.    All in all, if you want a fun, easy to fly but serious RC helicopter, you can't beat the Blade mSR for the money."
5.0	The day after I got them, I found my son cuddled on the couch with these asleep!!  Too cute for words!
5.0	My granddaughter carries Peachy everywhere!
5.0	This does what it is supposed to do which is turn from robot to car and reverse. My toddler hasn't put it down yet. It comes with us to the store and to restaurants. Well we finally found something that gives the ipad a rest. That means time to order more.
5.0	the package came early and it's awesome thank you
5.0	Fun toy for the kids.
5.0	9 month old boy along with his dad continue to have tons of fun with this toy. Good size and portable... Easy to use... and durable... Good product.
5.0	Fun purchase. Bought a bunch of nerf items for my son cause he likes to play rough so I figure this will do just that while keeping him safe. Also got him nunchucks and balls. I like the set so he can play with his friends when they visit.
5.0	Good fine motor activity for toddlers. Great learning toy: colors, sizes, stacking, fitting one into another and water play all activities this toy provides.
5.0	Nice looking product. We have been using it to guide our 6 y.o. and it is quite effective. We do recommend it.
5.0	It is so much pretty, this was a gift for my wife and she loved it soo much, and the delivery was flawless. Thank You
5.0	Jingle Bear Jr. is exactly as described with knit cap, scarf, and mittens. He came through the mail in wonderful condition and now can join the Mama Bear and his big brother, Jingle Bear.<br /><br />These bears were made expressly for the Broadway Department Store in Southern California before it was sold to May Company which then was sold to Macy's. They were sold only at Christmas.<br /><br />My Granddaughter loves each of them and was really excited to find that Jingle Bear Jr. is a puppet!
5.0	Kids love this. I run a day care and they are using them as I type this. Counting - color recognition - grouping - and making stone soup all with one toy. Great toy!
5.0	My boys, 4 and 6, love this game and have for awhile.  The strategy side of it is brilliant and teaches great skills.  It's also easy and fast so it holds kid's attention quite well.  A must have in your toy arsenal.
5.0	This game is funny! Good time for adults! I enjoy it very much. I would recommend buying all the expansion packs when you buy the game
5.0	it is awesomely cute!! it's almost like the real one from the movie!! it talks like one and the eyes blink like a real minion!!
5.0	The Star Trek 6 inch action figure is just awesome! I love the attention to detail! I highly recommend this product for any Star Trek fan!
5.0	I bought four of these action figures for my son (different ones of course). I ordered them for him through amazon.com because he could not find them at Walmart or any other store. These are the same action figues sold at the stores, but there is a lot larger selection at amazon. I also saved a lot of money ordering these through amazon.com vs K-mart online. Like I said, the store do not carry them, or the stores never have them instock.
5.0	Cute tattos I'm trying out to see what I would like when I go for the real thing. Thanks!
5.0	Excellent, received on time and dress was as described. Great quality, my granddaughter was the hit at the Cinderella wedding
5.0	[[ASIN:B000UIWA5U HALO ActionClix Scarab Vehicle Pack]]  I added the photos showing the Grand Scale of this Uber Toy, comparing it to the Xbox 360 box and a Gallon of water.  This Uber Unit is about 2 feet long and a foot and a half tall; the makers nailed the scale...
5.0	My 2yr old Granddaughter loves Hello Kitty, I ordered her 3 different ones (she picked out) and she loves them!
5.0	Smaller than I realized but I love it!
5.0	These were purchased for our four year old grandson and he absolutely loved them!  The noises that they make are very fun and there is quite a variety, you just never know what will come next. :)
5.0	Hours of fun for my grandson .  Just bought another set for my youngest grandson.
5.0	Love how it's a durable gel material and not rock hard plastic casing very nice colt too! Would gladly recommend
5.0	It comes in a very large heavy box.  We placed the little cottage in the living room and my kids just love it, specially my little one.  During the first week, they even ate inside it.  Now, it is their &#34;official&#34; hiding place, which I find funny because I can see them inside. The cottage totally paid for itself!  I recommend this product for ages between 2 to 5; however, I should say that I fit inside it :-)
5.0	Nice looking and durable. I have one on my RC 10 GT and works and looks great.<br />I have another on my Tamyia Super Blackfoot.<br />Good product, good price.
5.0	Powergirl.  She's tough as anything, lots of fun, and pretty easy on the eyes. Kotobukiya has been putting out some excellent statues in their Bishoujo line and Powergirl is another stellar release. These statues are around 9-10 inches tall and are made of a very sturdy PVC plastic. They're just a little stylized,definitely not as stylized as DC Collectibles' Ami-Comi line, but more stylized than your average DC Collectibles statue. Powergirl is in a fun, flirty pose and is permanently attached to her base. She's quite a fun, well done statue. Here's a brief look at Powergirl:<br /><br />The positives:<br /><br />*Her base is really cool. It looks like a metal grating or floor of same kind and displays her name. This is a great display base as it adds just a bit to the look of the statue and keeps her quite secure. While you may fear that Powergirl would have a tendancy to fall forward, the base should safely alleviate those concerns.<br /><br />*Most importantly with any statue is the pose. Powergirl's is fantastic.  She's flipping out a hip while showing off her muscles in a cute flex while her cape flows behind her. It is a great pose that captures so many aspects of Powergirl's personality.  Check out her cool, short hair and the waves on her cape. Notice the way the little hovering belt she wears looks like a seperate piece. Lots of nice detail.<br /><br />*The paint work is also fantastic. Not only is all of the paint really neat and clean but Kotobukiya used a nice variety of paint finished to make Powergirl really stand out.  Her outfit is nice and shiny, looking quite like a stretchy material of somekind, while her skin has a nice matte, almost translucent finish to it.  Really nice paintwork all around.<br /><br />The negatives:<br /><br />*None! She's a solid statue with good paint and sculpting, an excellent pose, and no balance issues.<br /><br />Overall:<br /><br />*This is definitely my favorite Kotobukiya Bishoujo yet. Its colorful, fun, and perfectly captures Powergirl's character. Shop around for it as the prices on these tend to fluctuate. You might find a deal. Just don't worry about the quality of the statue: it's solid.y captures Powergirl's character. Shop around for it as the prices on these tend to fluctuate. You might find a deal. Just don't worry about the quality of the statue: it's solid.
5.0	We have one doll set and 4 additional outfits. So it holds all the pieces and hats nicely. My daughter is only 18mo. old so she loves the fact she can carry everything into the playroom sit down and pull out the fun. I really like the durability of this item. Kids can be so hard on their toys.
5.0	My granddaugther loved it. Came ahead of time. Great service.
5.0	I can't really comment on the actual workings of the toy, but it went over well when she opened it...
5.0	"My grand daughter just turned three  \\""works\\"" with grandpa in his office.  We love her pictures and how she \\""pays her bills\\""."
5.0	My grandchildren (ages 5 and 8 - boy and girl) requested these lightsabers for Christmas.  I gave them to them on Christmas Eve and they have been playing with them ever since.  This is their favorite Christmas toy.  And they are very nice toys - light up, fold down and make sounds.  What I think is funny is that about 30-35 years ago I was giving earlier versions to my children then.  But these are much nicer.
5.0	I give this 5 stars because it was so cute and perfect for setting the theme of my little pony. My 3 year old loved it and wanted to take it home after her party. But it rips pretty easy after sticking taks or tape on it so we could not. But thats to be expected from just a decoration.
5.0	Looks great. Can hardly wait for the warm weather to come so I can try it out.  Know I will get lots of floating time out of it.
5.0	Ordered this as a Christmas present for my Mater obsessed 20 year old sister, and I almost kept it for myself. Fast shipping, and was a great product
5.0	I got this for my kid and she really likes it, she actually goes to sleep with it.  It's fun to play with since it orients itself because of the beans.  The beans would sometimes move to another position which makes the toy seem to look like bowing or tilted to one side.  But hey, it's funny.
5.0	Bought with another item for my fiancee who likes playing magic! He is highly impressed and received them in a timely manner and in perfect condition!
5.0	This train was way better than expected. Lots of detail, ran well, looked great around Xmas tree! Highly recommend it. A great price too.
5.0	"Bought this for my 4 year old and she absolutely loves it! Since the \\""brushes\\"" are in a marker-style, it is very easy for her to use and the best part-no mess for mom to clean up!"
5.0	I burn designs on to wood pieces a lot and this piece works great! The burns look great and clear and the wood looks very good for whatever you would need it for.
5.0	My daughter loves her doll!
5.0	"This is the one toy that my 4 year old consistantly asked Santa for this year...when she saw it under the tree Christmas morning she squealed!  She has plaed with it for the past 3 days now by herself!  Typically from the minute we get up until the minute we go to bed all we hear is \\""who is gonna play with me, can someone play with me\\""?  Not with this toy!!!!  We got the Barbie sisters tandem bike to go with it and she is loving that as well.  I like that the barbie's legs bend and actually move with the pedals!"
5.0	Great price & quick delivery!
5.0	Worked as expected...not much else to say.
5.0	Very cute brought from my 2 1/2 year old, to play with in her Hello Kitty Kitchen Cafe. LOVE IT.
5.0	great costume fits well and he loved it. The mask is a little weak had to replace the string stortly after wearing it.
5.0	Nice quality plastic animal.  I hope to build a collection for my daughter and tuck into stockings, Easter baskets, etc.
5.0	I bought this an Easter present for my grandmother.  When I pulled it out of the package, the fur was clumpy and uneven but a little fluffing from a hair dryer had the bunny looking great.  Beyond looking adorable, it's extremely well-made and definitely &#34;heirloom quality&#34;. My grandma loved it and everyone else comments on how cute it is.
5.0	I have never purchased bama bandz before, so these were a first. I was half-expecting them to be a tough, hard plastic that would not stretch easily without snapping. Boy was I wrong! These things are soft, pliable, and stretch VERY easily. I am 24 and wear these on campus and during my dance classes. They easily come on/off very easily and not one of them have snapped, frayed or broke. Great product!
5.0	Awesome game for pre-schoolers!
5.0	Great action figure thanks
5.0	I have been playing this with my two children (7-10 years old) and they really enjoy it.  It was very quick and easy to learn the game, but because the layout is different every time you play, and because there is a good mix of strategy (easy for beginners, can get a little cutthroat if you want to play that way for more experienced game players) it has wonderful replay value.<br /><br />The first game or two might take closer to the high end of the time estimate (about an hour) but with familiar players a quick and fun half hour game is more typical for us.<br /><br />The pieces are extremely well made and solid - I expect this game will remain in our game closet for many years, and hold up to a lot of play.  There are some very nice touches to the artwork and manual that really show the dedication and skill that the game designers put into this.
5.0	This is a very well made item.  My granddaughter loves it and she's 5 years old.
5.0	These guys are loud, but whomever made them did it right! The size is perfect for a handful of dice. Recently I used two of these with my nephews aged 10 and 6 while playing King of Tokyo. Those dice are a bit to big for there little baby nonman hands. These dice towers were the perfect solution. The fold up and out of the way when stored, and look really awesome. If you've young ones around and are playing dice games, don't hesitate. This is a great product.
5.0	again; this came with 2 other colors and they were on timme.  they were to fill my nephew's easel board &#34;pots&#34;.  worth it.
5.0	Super Sonic plush arrived in excellent shape, well-packaged. Quick shipping. Plush is high quality and my son was very happy to get it. This one should last a very long time. Recommend seller and would buy from again. A+
5.0	This will be a great gift for my grandson. It is so soft and beautifully made. More than I expected.
5.0	Quality item.  Fast shipping.  Very satisfied.  Thank you.
5.0	Cute doll.  Bought this for my friend who is a exercise trainer.  She loved the doll.  She had played with Barbies as a child and it brought back fond memories for her.
5.0	This was bought for a bag for Paint the Park Pink for the young ones in my group.  I haven't given it to them yet.
5.0	My son received this when he was four. Because of the two front wheels, the scooter does not tip easily. Most scooters for younger kids have two back wheels and one front wheel. This causes the child to tip easily and can be frustrating when first learning how to use it. My two year began to use it soon after we received it also. He learned quickly and now uses it. I also like that it folds for easy storage.
5.0	I got this Lego necklace for my 12 yr. old son. He enjoys wearing it. I like the option that he can give 1/2 of it to a friend if he chooses to do so!
5.0	"My 10 year old (small for his age)immediately hopped on and took 3 steps.  Only took 10 minutes for him to walk upright, turn and go up one step. He did fall and hurt his back so be careful of sharpe edges.  He and his friends have had fun with them and can even kick the soccer ball back and forth.  Anyone taller than he (4'9\\"") would probably be too tall.  When he stands up straight he can only just reach the handles without bending over.  I do wish they were adjustable like crutches.  They are extremely well made and durable.  No chance of breaking.  They might be pricy but are worth it!"
5.0	He didn't start out knowing what to do, but when it was sitting there he could explore and decide what he wanted to touch and move any given day. Great.
5.0	can't wait until christmas
5.0	A+ card and condition thanks
5.0	"We bought this toy for my son a few weeks ago for a 3rd birthday present.  He loves it!  We actually gave it to him early because my husband (who is a fireman) couldn't wait.  It was very easy to put together; it only took us about 20 minutes.  Keep in mind that we are not \\""handy\\""!  All the kids in the neighborhood love it as well, including the big kids who are too big to ride it.  They all say that they wish they had had one when they were little.  We took out the screw that controls the speed so that it would move better on our thick grass and it really scoots.  My 8 year old daughter drives her little brother all over the place on it as they both scream with laughter.  The only problem we have is picking it up to bring it in the house...This is a HEAVY toy.  We have to bring it in and out several times a day because my son wants to play with it even in the house.  It has a permanent parking place in my dining room."
5.0	great quality.  low price.  fast shipping.  I'll purchase from this vendor again!
5.0	love this -- fun for my office --
5.0	I love these markers.  You cannot find them in any of the stores around my area any longer.  The value and quality are excellent as always with Crayola!
5.0	We were a little confused about this card because our Leapster said it came with the AppCenter already included, but this was $20 towards online games/books and we got it on sale for only $15! Our 6 year old loved picking out her own books/games, and they were much cheaper (although the games aren't as long and detailed) than the ones in the store. She got 2 games and 2 books for $20 and I think we have a few dollars left over.
5.0	5 yr old and 2.5 yr old play with this peacefully. No mess. Make sure you have 2 pens.
5.0	This book and toy combination is great. A cute stuffed dog makes the story come alive for young children. The book is a good way to introduce chores to younger children and reinforce them with the older ones. My two and six year old boys  found it entertaining and I found a new fun way to introduce more responsibilities into their lives. After reading this book my 6 yr old cleaned up his toys and straighten out his bed with no fuss. I'm really glad I got this book!
5.0	Great set.  My kids are still little so anything breakable was out of the question but I still wanted the nativity out for christmas.  My only problem with the set is that the baby Jesus figure is as big as the manger so he doesn't really fit, just teeters on top.  Its really a minor complaint and the kids have really enjoyed learning about christmas with this set so I would definitely recommend.
5.0	Although I think this dress may be just a tad long for my (almost) 3 year old granddaughter I don't believe I need to hem it. She is average height/size compared to the rest of the kids in her daycare class, if that helps anyone. I really like the quality of this dress and the price was the same as other princess dresses without all of the trappings of just being Cinderella or Sleeping Beauty, etc. My granddaughter can be any princess she chooses. I will certainly buy Little Adventures costumes in the future.
5.0	Excellent presentation and packaging, as well as a collector's item, highly detailed and adequate size. I recommend it for collectors of Transformers Generations Deluxe.
5.0	Baby loves to take these on and off
5.0	I bought this for my son who is aged three.  He is a geography wiz and loves all things map, atlas, globe and map-puzzle related.  This one is a bit too difficult for him to put together but it has countries and flags on it (he also loves flags) and he like to identify each one, its capitol and its flag as I help him put it together. Since he is just beginning to read it is also a great way for him to memorize spellings and prompts that will help him when he really begins to read.  It won't be long until he is able to do the puzzle all by himself.  This would also be a great teaching tool for elementary aged geographers. <br />
5.0	I received the item in timely manner. I remember this song from when my little brother was a child (40 years ago) and my kids also had one of these. Now I get to pass it on to my grand kids!
5.0	Got some of the Mythic rares I wanted. it's a good set overall but definitely short on cards but that's because it's the last of the current block I believe.
5.0	Just what I was looking for. 12 different farm animals, all small enough to fit easily in a 1 pt. container
5.0	Use this for Dr. Seuss Day every year.  My kids love it!  I just put my kids in black shirts, black pants, and these accessories and it looks awesome.
5.0	My son loves it, he is a big smurf fan he proudly displays them on a shelf in his room. He plays with them for hours they are really cute.
5.0	OK, how amazing is it that you can one-click with Amazon Prime a screen-accurate exact replica of the TNG combadge? Maybe we really do live in the future after all.<br /><br />The hand-painted resin-cast Roddenberry.com replicas are made by professional Hollywood prop makers using the same methods and materials as the originals and are the best I've ever seen (and I've been fascinated by Trek prop replicas since I was a kid). Most replicas are made out of metal and have pin-backs, which is fine but totally different from how they were made and used on the show.
5.0	i got this on clearance around valentine's day last year at the mall. i used it as one of my christmas decorations.<br /><br />Garfiel is one of my favorite shows and i have plush garfield i got whe i  was 16.
5.0	This is a very cute book.  I love how Santa Claus interacts with the children.  It is a super book and I recommend it for anyone with children.
5.0	"LEGO hit a home run with the Hogwart game.  They stayed true to the feeling of the Harry Potter franchise and yet the game is challenging enough to be entertaining and fun.    We also own the Minatore LEGO game, but the family enjoys this one far more because of the shifting \\""staircases\\"" aspect this game has to offer.    The educational part of the game is it has to be assembled and LEGO encourages changing or adding rules as the die is changable and LEGO includes additional pieces to make the game more complex or to use however one sees fit.    Alot of fun!  I hope others will enjoy the family time together as much as we do!"
5.0	We absolutely love our plush Elf on the Shelf. We are using her exactly like the original elf was intended. I think it is crazy that the darn tag that came on her hat said that she wasnt a real Elf on the shelf. Yes she is. Elves can come in any size or shape. Tall or short. Fat or skinny. Boy or girl. Red or green. Why should it matter if she is wood, ceramic or plush. If you want to let your kids play with her great, but there is no reason she cant be used exacty like the original elf.<br />My daughter is 7 and this is our first year with the Elf. She has been a hit since the day we got her. She has been having fun and also causing mischief around our house. She flies to the N Pole every night to report to Santa how the kids are. She returns every morning before we wake to play and have fun. The kids are not allowed to touch her for it may cause her to lose her magic.<br />What a blast. I would recommend this Elf. She is just as much fun as the original but half the cost.
5.0	We bought this for our 5 yr old daughter for Christmas.  I was worried after reading the reviews that it would be to difficult for her to enjoy, but she really wanted to try it out.  She loves this toy.  It is definitely something that an adult needs to help her with, but her and all of her friends love to make bugs and smash them.  Our friend has a 7 yr old boy that we recommended this to, and after showing him how this works a few times he was able to it himself.  It make take a few trial and error bugs to perfect the timing, but it is a fun toy and we are very happy with our purchase.
5.0	These shells are AWESOME! Keep them unpainted and they look cool or paint them. Either way, they look AWESOME!<br />I got a can of duratrax blue and painted mine. On this body it looks almost like Traxxas Blue. Love it.
5.0	We got these for my son to help fill in a ball bit that we bought and these balls are the same size and quality of the balls you find at a ball pit that you would at a play center. They are great and have kept up to his beating on them and playing with them and trying to stand on them... They don't break and don't colaps. The only thing is there are a lot of them so be prepared to loose a few around the house but there are still so many that if you loose a few here and there you won't really be able to notice.
5.0	cool piece for the battle royal that is set up in the castle courtyard. there are witches and wizards and a vampire and skeletons on horseback, ninjas and samurai.<br /><br />what a show!!!
5.0	Cool action figure, fast shipping.
5.0	I got this last night for my 2 year old and she loves feeding her baby in it. I am glad I bought it. Only thing is baby is hard to get in and out. I have to help her.
5.0	Super cute and sturdy plates and napkins.
5.0	Awesome puzzle!  Very fun!
5.0	3 dolls for 3 grand-daughters. They were very pleased, which pleased Grandma and Grandpa. I was worried, but they were even delivered the night before the birthday party.
5.0	My 4.5 year old daughter was asking for a rudolph plush to go with a santa she has.  most are unbelievably overpriced for the simple thing they are, so I was happy to find this one.  i thought the eyes might be odd with the x's sewn in but its really a cute little toy and she LOVES it.  she especially loves his translucent nose...it resembles the real glowing nose rudolph technically has.  good in our book:)
5.0	I got them as counters for my class to use during January, when we teach our penguin unit
5.0	This is an awesome set for the price! If you are looking for a hearty travel set that will last get this set! I expected some cheap flimsy board and hollow pieces but this board is made of a very durable plastic and latches shut when not in use. The pieces are solid with strong magnets.
5.0	My baby plays with this toy for long periods of time.  She loves to open and close the mailbox (she'll do it for about five minutes without getting bored).  It teaches concepts such as up and down, hi and goodbye, and open and closed.  My baby seems to find something new on the house every time she plays with it, and she plays with it every day.
5.0	love it  thank you so much
5.0	I bought this for my daughter for my granddaughter and love it! Never even knew they made wipe warmers but living in cold weather that last thing you want is a cold wipe on your baby's bum!! Highly recommend it!!
5.0	Good price looks good so Thanks.
5.0	Our granddaughter collects Calico Critters, she loves all kinds of animals, so along with some new Critters we got this case for Christmas a year ago.  The case is still in excellent condition and she carries it with her to take to our house or friends to play.
5.0	Love it. Big enough for a travel bag, small enough for an everyday makeup bag
5.0	My son is into tractors so when we got this for his 2nd birthday he was ecstatic.  We had also purchased another riding toy that was $75...the Okie Dog.  But I am so glad we got this one because he loves it.  He likes to put things in the trailer and tow them around.  He also likes to ride in the trailer and be towed by his friends (only the small ones can fit, but my little squirt can put both his feet in and sit down.)
5.0	Really nice and worth the price. Our 4 year old loves it and now hunts for change whenever he can. Easy opening lid means we can sneak a peek at what he's putting in there lol<br /><br />Now we're gonna order the Sesame Street one for our 3 year old daughter :)
5.0	I bought this for my grand daughter because she loves the movie Frozen. Once she got it, she would not put it down.  This toy is absolutly perfect. Very soft and cuddly but you can still mold his legs to where he can stand on his own. The colors are beautiful and the toy is well made.  I would recommend this toy to anyone.
5.0	These folders are great would but them again.
5.0	The gloves helped complete my granddaughter's Elsa costume for Halloween perfectly! She was indeed a true queen of the north and other girls in the neighborhood who saw her were jealous! My &#34;Elsa&#34; was very happy with her presentation of the fated girl who in another time could have attended Proffessor Xavier's School for Gifted Children!
5.0	Stands up to lots of play. Nice Birthday gift for a very special girl.  Looks like it will last a long time made very well.
5.0	if you have the delta squad megazord, you need this toy! its main purpose is to combine, thus the giant fists in its chest. when combined with the delta squad megazord it becomes much more durable, and besides, its a childs toy and eas to reassemble if a piece breaks off. A must have!!
5.0	Bought this as a gift for my grandson.  He's really into race cars and trucks.  He had lots of fun.  The only problem we had is the flags are difficult to keep standing but otherwise this play rug is perfect.
5.0	Such a cute toy.  Absolutely loved this.  Bought for a two year old.  She loves it.
5.0	Bought for a friend's son. He had been begging her for a new trike. They were blown away by how sturdy it is. He is almost 3, and can manage to reach he pedals. I do not recommend for short babies
5.0	Mattel has yet to release a Crush and it seems doubtful they ever will. Jakks only made 1 Demolition version of Crush and this is it right here. One of my personal favorite sets ever made. Takes you right back to the days of Hasbro and the WWF WrestleFest arcade game.
5.0	I ordered two of these sets for my 4 and 6 year old boys.  They love them.  They have created so much more than what the instructions show them.  Both boys are wanting additional sets so they can build even more elaborate creations.  Highly recommended.
5.0	Great.  granddaughter LOVED it.  exactly as described. arrived on time.
5.0	"I've wanted this little kitchen for my son for a long time, and finally purchased it for his second birthday. We all love playing with it. The only drawback was putting it together--the hinged doors are somewhat tricky to assemble, and the photo on the box does not exactly match the finished product. There are two different screw sizes, called, confusingly, \\""R\\"" and R1,\\"" and it was hard to determine which one was called for when. (Note to manufacturer--why not call the \\""R1\\"" screws a completely different letter, and Photoshop some hinges onto your cover photo?) In any case, this is one kitchen that actually looks cute in your house instead of tacky. We'll definitely save this one for our grandchildren, too!"
5.0	My daughter loves this item happy to had purchased during the Black Friday sales.
5.0	Received in great shape well packed in a small box. No Packing Slip enclosed.  One would have been appreciated.  Arrived 7 days past the estimated delivery estimate range, but I didn't mind.
5.0	Awesome toys in the eggs very happy kids
5.0	Many fond memories of Spill & Spell marathons night after night during summer vacations.  It keeps your mind sharp.  I still love the game and I will even challenge myself when no else is available.
5.0	Sturdy.  It is easy to break the tabs off of the wire container, so keep that in mind.  The rubber feet keep the breadboard from becoming mobile.  Nobody wants a mobile breadboard.
5.0	This Bobble head is amazing. Very nice detail and its big. I got it on time and in perfect condition
5.0	Everyone loves this game. We play everyday. It shipped very fast too
5.0	This was a gift for 13 year old son from relative and we loved paying so much (mom,dad, son and 9yr old daughter). We gave another copy to nephew who loved it as much.  Game was enjoyable
5.0	got this as a gift for my 4 year olf little brother and he loves it! his new favorite game. keeps him entertained for hours and he is learning
5.0	Thank you. Exactly what the pool needed
5.0	fun and flimsy. they will make great target practice after the party
5.0	Was the hit of the party
5.0	Great quality and the pieces were bigger than I expected! Such a great product. My kids love it and when it's not being played with, it is being displayed in my living room!
5.0	This broom is a great broom. I'd rather use this than my real one in the kitchen
5.0	great for your small dogs ,they love swimming with mom and dad.
5.0	This is a really solid figure, he's just great, and while he may not be the most poseable he looks almost just like Sir Ian McKellen and stands up pretty easily, making him perfect for display which is what I use him for, although he seems quite durable and I would recommend him if you want to get him for a younger child. Also his weapons and hat stay in his hands and on his head respectively, the interior of his hat is even indented specifically to match up with his hair! And if you're wondering where his sheath is it sits behind him sort of and is actually part of his robe, and tucks underneath his cloak. Be aware that this is the hobbit version, so he has the silver scarf as described in the books, which is a major plus if you're a fan like me, other than that his outfit is pretty much the same as the fellowship of the ring version. Anyway this is an awesome figure and I definitely recommend him to collectors and players alike!
5.0	Bought these for my girlfriend's sons and they love it!
5.0	For the price this was absolutely fabulous. My son loved them. They take a little time to put together but great. Awesome for the kids that like to build things and think.
5.0	The vortex discs fly extremely well!they are so much fun to use in the Nerf guns.
5.0	Niece loved them. Delivered on time.
5.0	Toy it's pretty good. I mean  colors, size weight, speed sounds are perfect .. alto we are under the impression out boy isn't to interested in the crawling part ..  we are doing all on our hands to encourage him to do it .. but just seems walking it's more important for him than crawling ..
5.0	Gorgeous make up on a Lara face mold, nice up-do, doll has the model muse body with the larger bust size.
5.0	Everything goes in my little ones mouth and I wanted a safe baby doll for her. This doll is both beautiful and practical. It is so soft and beautiful. Wonderful purchase.
5.0	very good, cheap price.
5.0	he laughed so hard, this 10 year old loves grumpy cat
5.0	It's an angry bird! Kids love it! I can't believe how much they love it. Holy cow three more words
5.0	I collect items related to the Creature from the Black Lagoon so this item fit nicely into my collection.  Plus, I really like this particular vehicle design.  Someone had gotten me other monster vehicles in the series, & I saw on the back of their cards that the Creature car had also been made so I looked for it & found it on Amazon for a very good price.
5.0	"Santa Claus brought the \\""Deluxe-Build-A-Road\\"" toy set to my three kids (6-2 years old) this year. This is a great and wonderful toy! It is very easy to put together and inspires creativity in that it can be built in many different road variations. My kids thoroughly enjoy this toy and play with it for hours. I only wish that the manufacturer included more than two of the battery operated SUV cars which navigate the race track. These little cars are quite durable and can climb the many steep obsticles that the kids build. I recommend this toy for load of fun!"
5.0	My son and i play pay day all the time. Great for teaching finance and game ends when you decide
5.0	I used these jacks as part of a craft project for the kids at our VBS.  They were nice and large, colorful, and good quality (no rough edges etc). Whether you plan to use these to play jacks with younger kids who need the bigger size, or as I did for crafting, I would recommend this set.
5.0	Bought this for my grandson's 2 yr. old birthday.  He loved it from the beginning!  Now he can be just like his &#34;Poppy&#34;, a heavy equipment operator.  He mostly digs pea-size gravel and has become quite skilled!  Has held up well over the past 6 months with much abuse!
5.0	I don't really know what to say for this except that they came fast and as described. My 9 month old enjoys trying to capture them, but right now he is only interested in putting them in his mouth. They do squirt water pretty forcefully. I'm glad I purchased this.
5.0	Fabulous for classroom games and centers
5.0	Really cute wig with a great deal of thick hair and the colored stripes are done for you.
5.0	Definitely adds to the fun.
5.0	product arrived on the agreed date and as advertised.
5.0	"My daughter sleeps with her stuffed dogs.  She kept letting my wife \\""borrow\\"" them so she \\""could sleep better\\"".  Finally my wife suggested she should have her own, I think she was joking.  Well, I bought her this bear for Valentines and she instantly fell in love with it.  I is the perfect size for her and super, super soft.  Now when we go to sleep the bear gets more hugs and kisses than I do...and my daughter now wants her own.  Did I mention is SUPER SOFT!!??"
5.0	Great card great seller
5.0	These were great! Turned out exactly as advertised....the coloured flame was quite fascinating to the kids too! Will need to get some more!
5.0	I'm retired and was given this to fuss with ... maybe to stay mentally active?  It's fun and facinating ... buy the extra decks as I did.  I now give these as gifts to young and old.  And it's good at table, chair, and in bed.  Get it.
5.0	We've had hours of entertainment. The container is very nice and spacious.
5.0	Love it.  I'm a large woman and it comfortably accommodates me and my grandson.
5.0	We bought this for our son's 6th birthday party, and it was perfect! The kids loved the mini figures, and it was shipped fast : ) everyone signed the group card...perfect for his baby book!
5.0	My 9 year old son is borderline ADD.  He NEEDS things to keep his hands busy in class.  It actually helps him to concentrate if he has something to keep his fingers busy.  This toy is great for him (I actually like it too) and it won't be distracting at all to the rest of his class.<br /><br />My only concern is that I hope he doesn't lose it.  It's kind of small (which is good, so it's not distracting), but it's enough money that I won't be able to buy 10 of them if he happens to lose them.
5.0	We got these for our little 3-year-old chef and he loves to use them on his playdough.  The edges are safe for him, and they are easy for me to wash.
5.0	I got this for my cat and he loves it.
5.0	These were purchased for my granddaughter. She loves them, the magnet on the back is flat and imbedded into the back of the letter so it lays flush with whatever surface you put in on, of course she is covering the lower part of the refrig.
5.0	Very cute. My daughter is going to love it for our Disney trip
5.0	Out of box, pop protectors. Let me just say, great idea! These are smaller, than the in box protectors, which is great because while there is room for them to move, there isnt enough room for the to flip around. They stack, over and over, and you can see 360 degrees of your pops at the same time they are protected! Great value, great price, great product! If you are an out of box collector, these are perfect for your pops to stay protected. Expensive or not, each pop fits perfect. As i folded these up, they are just as thick and sturdy as the in box protectors. Thick, feel tough in your hand. Very pleasing to the eye.  I have purchased these at a discounted price, in exchange for my review.
5.0	The coins look real.  Somebody else stated that the nickels look too new, well mine don't.  They don't look old, but they definitely look real to me.
5.0	I bought a bunch of these as an end of year/goodbye gift (I only had 7 students). I was leaving not only my classroom, but the area and moving out-of-state. Our mascot is the bobcat and we often talk about &#34;always being a bobcat.&#34; The kids were absolutely delighted (yes, my class of all boys!) and even the adults wanted one. Great little guy. Super soft.
5.0	This was purchased as a birthday present for one of my kiddos. She adores dinosaurs and requested this kit. This is the only Triceratops I could find. She had so much fun doing this little excavation. The tools were not flimsy and cheap like the last kit we had. The skeleton is also bigger and a much better quality than the last kit (Smithsonian). The detail is decent for what it is and it was easy to put together. It also stays together when you move it, which is super important!<br />If I ever need to buy a dinosaur kit again, it will be this one.
5.0	My grandson gets many hours of enjoyment from this- I only take it out at Christmas!
5.0	We have hit football fever in my household. These are affordable and fun. My son pairs them up and asks who will win. Like I know...
5.0	i bought this on a whim, somewhat celebrating the start of the second season of the anime.<br /><br />the plush is made of a very soft fleece!! the black parts of the uniform seem to be made of a faux leather.<br /><br />the plush is much larger than i thought it would be!! i'm in love with it heheh
5.0	I grew up playing this game with my Grandma and I recently taught my husband. Its a very simple game but it is alot of fun especially if you love card games which we do.
5.0	Great product and fast shipping
5.0	I was really frustrated that it was so hard to find the 'Classic' edition of this great game. I'm glad that it's still around and available!
5.0	"This diecast is 1:24 scale, very nice paint color in blue. Actually this is more of my deco than toy so its not for play. A nice visual centerpiece and a conversational piece. Living in Michigan and working at Detroit this is part of history, here when we look at \\""them old trucks\\"" it signifies how this nation was changed from the horse drawn to the piston driven- built ground up bumper to bumper. Its a REPLICA of Ford F100, doors, hood and tail gate opens, rubber tires. Motormax is a reliable diecast company and have a lot of selections."
5.0	This will be a birthday present for my 6 year old in February. Based on Melissa and Doug sticker by number projects, I think he'll love creating the window mosaic and am sure it will look great in a window. I was surprised by the birdhouse. We have an older son who has built many birdhouses with Dad, but this has to be the best materials and construction I've ever seen. Home run, Melissa and Doug.
5.0	yes, it's low to the ground but makes up for height with all the things it says and does.  And she sure is getting the idea of the game, both basketball and soccer.  Perfect for the 3 year old.
5.0	Our son who is 4 scored this from Santa and loves it!!! The whole family loves watching him use it and its great for hand eye coordination (bonus)!  He plays with it for hours at a time, and the quality of the product is high!!!  Definitely got our moneys worth out of this one!  Biggest problem is keeping track of the arrows!
5.0	Much larger than I expected and very well constructed.
5.0	Works perfect, just what I needed!
5.0	I bought this for my great nephew's birthday.  He is crazy about helicopters and just loved it.  It was perfect for indoors or out.
5.0	quarter fits perfectly fine. even 1 dollar fit....not as nice as quarter great 4 the price. fast delivery....
5.0	I love my eggs. I got them to get my chickens to lay in the nesting boxes like they are supposed to and not all over the yard. Worked like a charm. I put one in each box and they started laying where they were supposed to. They are wooden so there not cold or hot. They are perfect for what I needed. The ducks even started laying in the boxes which I've never seen before they usually just drop wherever they are. Fantastic.
5.0	i bought this months ago and still use it often to play with my friends. it looks very nice and none of the pieces have broken. the lettering is different than how it is shown in the picture, not bad different, just a different font. i would buy it again as a gift
5.0	My wife just loved it
5.0	I bought one of these some time ago and was pleased with the detail although somewhat small. I owned one of these back in the early 50's, black with tortous shell top, roof skylight, road lamps and fender mirrors, beautiful car. It was lacking in mechanical integrity as I was always repairing something on it, parts were non existant.
5.0	My 3 year old son really enjoyed this.  Had it about 7 months now and he still plays with it.  Worth the purchase for sure.
5.0	this placemat is colorful, durable and educational!
5.0	These were the one and two sluggers of the 1960's Yankees. They will always be remembered as the ones that  scared the league in 1961. Who would you pitch to?
5.0	My little girl loves her Baby Stella!  It smells amazing with its comforting lavender and it's extremely well made.  The stitching and fabric are all high quality and the magnet in the accessories (pacifier and bottle) works great.  I do wish they would have magnetized the sheep instead of using a rubber band, but it still works fine.
5.0	This was a Christmas gift for my 9-year old granddaughter. Both she and her parents liked the way it feels and the sounds it makes. Ceratainly easier to take care of that the real one!
5.0	My Granddaughter loved it.
5.0	perfect for little kids who like to have helmets/costumes on.  I bought it for my 4 year old and it fits just fine and also fits the 9 year old neighbor girl.  quality is good and can't beat the price!
5.0	perfect for he kiddos
5.0	My 6-year old loved this.
5.0	My girlfriend loved it.  After making a comment about the toy drinking bird while watching the movie, &#34;When Harry Met Sally&#34; I decided to look for one for her.  This is much nicer than the plastic toy birds and fits in well with other collectible fine glassware.
5.0	He loves it and plays with them all the time. I love that they are part card board so they will last longer.
5.0	Unbelievable! Awesome!
5.0	We are working on spelling things and it is so much easier when you can just use the refrigerator, freezer, dishwasher, and anything else metal in the house.
5.0	Quality made, great price, very roomy, durable and stylish rolled into a great product for the perfect twilight fan. Simply awesome
5.0	I bought this for my 14 month old son, he LOVES cooking in the kitchen with mommy with it! Seems to be very durable.
5.0	I ordered this puzzle for my 16 month old daughter. She absolutely loves it! I ordered this with some of the wooden peg puzzles from Melissa and Doug and she definitely prefers this one! Each piece has something unique (the cat squeaks, dog has a jingle bell in it, the door on the house opens, ect.). The pieces are easy for her hand and I like that they are items that are easy for her to say (dog, cat, bird). I was hesitant to purchase this because other reviews didn't like that the picture on the puzzle board is a sticker, but we have had no problems with any peeling. I would recommend this as a great learning toy and first puzzle!
5.0	My Grandaughter loves the minion and really like this game that she received for Christmas. It was in excellent packaging and is made good to last.
5.0	It arrived earlier than estimated time of arrival. It looks exactly as what's in the picture and qualiy is great!
5.0	I bought this for my niece for Christmas and she loves it! It is quite large and the set-up is quick and easy.
5.0	smelled at first but love that it's all rubber.  No plastic, pvc, batteries, just fun.  Wish it had a dolphin.
5.0	My daughter loves this product. She is 3 and sits and colors everyday.
5.0	It was exactly as described. My grandson is very happy.
5.0	I gave this to my grand daughter and she loves it.  It is beautifully made, was delivered quickly and has held up beautifully.  I would recommend this to others!
5.0	A great educational product....teaches kids to be creative!
5.0	everything was great it was a gift and she was thrilled to recieve it and cant wait to get started
5.0	Our grandson loved it
5.0	This tricycle is just adorable
5.0	i bought this for my nieces 2nd birthday. she absolutely loved it. it was nice quality, and a excellent choice for a bubble guppies fan
5.0	My daughter has lots of play food, but this is by far the best.  It gets her accustomed to associating fruits & vegetables with meals & snacks and making healthy food & drink choices more of a norm.  I especially appreciate the wheat bread.  Everyone pushes cheap, white bread on our kids, and I like that when she puts together a sandwich (made from really well made play food), she gets used to using wheat bread and adding nice green lettuce and bright tomatoes. We now have to have lettuce added to her Happy Meal burgers when we go to McDonalds, and I LOVE that!  She also even has fun with the basket it all comes in when she plays grocery store (selecting fruits and vegetables, of course).  Kids loose interest in their toys so quickly, but this is one she consistently plays with over and over again.  I also highly recommend the breakfast and dinner sets, too.  The quality in these toys far exceeds that of her other play food, making it really stand out from the rest.  Two big thumbs up!
5.0	THIS ALSO WAS A GIFT AND IT WAS NOT AS EASY AS THEY THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BE. SO IT WAS A GOOD PRESENT TO WORK ON A COLD WINTER DAY.
5.0	We got this for our 2 year old for Christmas and she absolutly loves it!  The different pieces that comes with the set are really great.  We also got the barbecue set to go along with the table.  The pizza oven is great that it lights up red with the timer.  All of the extra pieces you can buy to add to the table are alos great.  Our daughter already had the servin surprises high chair set so we attached that to the table as well.  Assembly was easy and directions to the point.
5.0	So, I was incredibly disappointed to learn that the coins in this bag were plastic, not chocolate as I'd expected (because that is what I'd searched for on Amazon and these were at the top of the results).  When the kids found these at the end of their treasure hunt I held my breath.  Turned out that they were more thrilled with these than the chocolate ones that I used the previous year.<br />Seven nieces and nephews, aged 3-10 absolutely loved these.  The 3-7 year olds actually carried them around for weeks!  Mom, where's my treasure? was a popular question for the next few weeks.<br />When I asked them why they preferred these to the chocolate coins they answered, &#34;Because this is real treasure&#34;!  Who knew?
5.0	This is an adorable toy with tons of fun. At Christmas dinner our daughter started playing with Elmo Live and all the adults stood around watching, listening and laughing. They kept telling her to press it again and again and again. It was a hit with our family. My daughter can repeat almost everything Elmo says - and she has only had it since Christmas morning (that's just to show how much she has played with it since). I really don't have a problem with the thin fur since it is super mechanical. So, I got her an Elmo storybook pillow and another Elmo plush toy to cuddle with.
5.0	My daughter love it. She takes it to school, sleeps with it, and takes it everywhere. thank you so much for getting it here fast. She absolutely love it. At one point she left it at school, and I had to drive her all the way back to school to find it..lol She has it back, it's just that I think its awesome that she loves it that much.
5.0	I bought Hail Caesar because it's based off of the Black Powder rules that I love for ACW games.  Hail Caesar is a good adaptation for the period.  The rules are well thought out.  It's written in an easy to read and interesting manner.  The book itself it gorgeous with pictures of period miniatures.  I have 10mm armies in several periods, 15 mm for others, 28 mm for others.  This rule set works for all.<br />  Since I liked Black Powder and Hail Caesar so much I'm going to buy the Pike and Shote rules as well for the ECW.  I've bought both Warhammer ECW and Fields of Glory and neither is very good for that period.<br />  Hats off to the author of this series.  It's very well though out and executed.
5.0	I bought a Tiger costume at the store that had a head that came with it that scared my 2 year old.  This was the perfect substitution and fit her perfectly.
5.0	Great figure! Great articulation, you can pose Ant-Man all over the house in so many poses! He can even hold the teeni tiny bonus figure in the palm of his hand!
5.0	These beach balls turned out to be wonderful party favors for our son's 2nd birthday.  The smiley faces transformed simple beach balls into &#34;characters&#34; and the kids loved them...
5.0	Got very lucky when i found this deal. It is a great and useful toy and very versatile as well. I specialize in teaching children their ABC's and how to read and I am ALWAYS on the lookout for a good toy to use during my sessions. This michrophone is currently my favorite. Its colorful and fun and my kids LOVE screaming out their A-B-C's. I am also able to use it during music therapy sessions and it is always very helpful. This is a great specialty toy and after buying one I bought another five. Gonna use this for years! 5 stars!
5.0	My 20mth old daughter has been playing with these stamps since she was 18mths, and for the past 2 months, she hasn't shown any signs of boredom - which is a good sign! She is consistently happy with these colorful stamps. She stamps them on the paper pad, on her hands, on my hands, on my feet, lol. Hilarious! There are some that she likes more than others but overall, she's enjoying herself with this set. She always exclaims &#34;WOW&#34; whenever I open up the lid to reveal the 50 stamps underneath.<br />Though she has been frequently stamping, the inks are still flowing and doing great. For the price, I was expecting them to dry up pretty fast or to find some that don't work at all. But hey, surprised, surprised. Good buy! Can't go wrong! Will buy another set when this one dries out eventually.
5.0	I bought for a friend and I was surprised by how good the quality of these things are. A great purchase for anyone.
5.0	Sticker book came brand new along with 10 packs of cards just like it said.  Lots of fun opening packs and putting them in the book just like when I was a little guy.  Great quality as well.
5.0	Present for my son for his tenth birthday.  Very cool puzzle that the whole family has enjoyed.  We have yet to beat it.
5.0	only problem is the brown color is a littler lighter than his color on the nintendo games and his feet have a hard material on the bottom.
5.0	We got this to pair with the Bubble Guppies Rock and Roll Stage set.  These are just like the other Guppies figures that we have and the one that comes with the Stage set. They have the roller ball on bottom so they roll over the ramps that come with other Guppies sets.  They are good, fun little figures that my 2 year old loves to play with, so I am very satisfied with them.
5.0	NON STOP LAUGHS.  Just make sure everyone playing has an open mind and few hangups.  LOVE IT.
5.0	Worked well and sped up my stampede 4x4 a little bit to
5.0	It has compartments for all your needs and even if the youngsters get tired of carrying it, you don't feel so bad if you have to carry it yourself.  Stylish!!!
5.0	Great product for the price. Does what its supposed to do and the quality is what you would expect for this.
5.0	This is like any other skeleton card in the MTG card game: low cost and it can regenerate. The only thing about this card is that you NED SNOW COVERED LAND to regenerate it. Unless you can come into an agreement with your opponent and he/she allows you to use regular land to regenerate this card, you better have a deck of Snow covered swamp in play.
5.0	Great,though do not carry this in you purse in Spring Lake michigan it is against the law.  Be careful! Single women are not welcome here.
5.0	This is an amazing, original and NEW Saint Seiya figure from Bandai. I specially love these figures from the Asgard anime chapter, and how well they represent the characters (and they have better articulation than the first line of Myth Cloth figures). Thank you so much JAPAN IMPORT SHOP RISE for the great service, products and excellent prices.
5.0	Cannot recommend this dollhouse enough! Absolutely perfect for a toddler or preschooler. The quality is great and provides lots of open-ended, imaginative play.
5.0	Overall I was very impressed and happy with this key chain! :D It took about two weeks instead of one to get to my house but nonetheless I wasn't disappointed in the least!  This cute little key chain was very detailed in its package and was about twice the size I thought it would be. It was very clean-looking, very smooth, and not damaged at all. In my opinion, the picture didn't give it justice as to how great it (and the character it resembles) really looks!  Now even though I am not much of a Kikyo fan (due to the fact that she is the only thing standing in the way of InuYasha and Kagome being together), I have to say I like her a little bit more because this key chain just makes her look so great! I couldn't be happier! :D  Oh but one thing I do have to mention is that after awhile of course the key chain will probably either wear out or fade or scratch, but everything in the world does so that's not really that big of deal. Looking at it now I would have to say that the key chain would last quite awhile before it started to wear out (as long as you didn't use it for target practice or something XD).  Anyways like I said above I am very impressed and I would recommend it to any InuYasha fanatic who is or isn't a fan of Kikyo. You will not be disappointed!
5.0	My one year old loves this, even though she sits on it more than rides it.  She's not figured out the steering, but that will come!  Easy to assemble and easy to read directions!
5.0	Its fun every time you play. The different combinations that you can make are never ending and fits my humor spot on.
5.0	Perfect for a rambunctious 2yr old. Came quickly
5.0	Every other week or so, I host a game night with family and friends. My best friend always talked about how she really wanted to get Balderdash, but I just so happened to find this gem at a yard sale. If you get together with a bunch of people who have incredible imaginations, you'll be laughing too much to even get to the second turn. This game is a game you can play over and over and still have options that haven't been played before. Plenty of cards to choose from. A good party game!
5.0	Got all twelve for my grandson so he could hang the planets in his bedroom. He enjoyed putting the sets together and then stored them in ziploc containers so we could hang the planets from his bedroom ceiling. You are getting the planet, plus the Lego set.  Great for Star Wars collectors
5.0	"My 2 year old loves this puzzle.  He may be out of the target age range but we play together and the puzzle is a great size for his little toddler fingers.  He can handle the pieces and put them together, it takes a little effort but he enjoys the challenge.  The colors ar ebold and great, the pieces durable.  Of course, you cannot go wrong with Thomas & Friends, the whole time we put it together he chants \\""choo-choo.\\"""
5.0	"This is a fabulous car from my favorite Bond film, \\""You Only Live Twice\\""!  Snazzy Toyota convertible!  Item arrived sooner than projected!!"
5.0	Santa brought this for our 7 year old last year.  It is taller and now she does not have to bend over to play.  It is very sturdy.  My daughter has played for hours with it.  Santa also purchased the other KidKraft accessories.  They make everything more realistic.  She loves it.  She is now 8 and still plays with it.  I had surgery in Feb.  One morning I woke up to a breakfast with toast and cookies.  It was so cute.
5.0	Before I begin my review, I should acknowledge that I was lucky enough to try this toy free thanks to Imaginext®!  My three year old son LOVES this toy. Seriously, he's OBSESSED with it. This is his go-to toy now and he just genuinely loves playing with it. Here's why:<br />PROS: It is well made, durable plastic with LOTS of details in and around the castle. It also comes with two knights, a lion, a bad guy and a disc shooter. So, there are plenty of 'extras' the come with this castle that just make it even more fun. Plus, the figures also come with swords, shields, and armor so you can customize their look as you play. Second, there are so many 'trap doors', secret passageways, openings, etc that it's actually fun to have the figures run around and explore. My son gets the biggest kick by placing one of the men on top of a trap door and see him fall through to the dungeon once the lever is pulled. Third, this castle is also equipped with lights, sound and music. So in addition to all of the neat doors, passageways, etc, you also have sounds that come on when certain buttons are pushed.<br /><br />All in all, this castle was a BIG hit with my son. He has played with it continuously since he got it and doesn't seem the least bit bored with it as he sometimes does with other toys. Again, the best thing about this is that with all of the figures, passageways, etc, the possibilities and creativity is endless. Even my seven year old daughter enjoys playing this with him and they both have fun storming the castle. I would highly recommend this toy to any parent and it would make an excellent Christmas present given the quality, value and fun my child has had with it. Lastly, I would say it's worth the price because not only is it fun, it's very well made and sturdy and is simply a quality toy all around.
5.0	This was a gift for my grandson and he loves it. He wants to be a magician some day when he is older.
5.0	I bought this toy when my son was two.  He's going on six now and still loves it.  This is the oldest toy in his room.  Of course he plays with it in a completely different way now, but it's still just as fun.  My 16 month old plays with it too.  We haven't had any repair issues at all.  Gotta love this toy!
5.0	Good price for shoes.
5.0	My son loves it. He even sleeps in it every night!
5.0	Bought this for my grand daughter for her birthday after she fell in love with the one her cousin had. Made her day.
5.0	Cheap and functional. Great set.
5.0	My daughter is going to pre-k and wanted this. She loves it!! It is perfect! She was very happy to find this one since she is not a huge pink fan
5.0	Great item,  awesome price
5.0	son loves these, has a huge collection.  he likes that he can remove limbs, arms, heads & interchange them.  best thing about mini mates is that they pop right back on.  these are surprisingly detailed and fun.
5.0	Bought this as a gift and the kids absolutely loved it! Hours of smiles, laughs, and enjoyment. I bought the 64oz jug of miracle bubbles as a refill and that worked well.
5.0	These Max Liquid Eliminators are great!  I've mainly seen them sold individually so this listing is fantastic for anyone with multiple kids or just having a bunch around for parties or friends.  They get good distance and are have pool noodle foam on the outside so they wont hurt you.  Excellent for water fights!
5.0	She liked it lulz.  XD i think its a cute cheap novelty gift~  I want to get another :)  Good luck charm~ cute keychain and stuff <3
5.0	Very cute and fun for my grand daughter. Easy to transport since its small enough to play w/in vehicle or away from the house.
5.0	Great colors and a great value.
5.0	I think this is a really neat toy, great for a toddler. It's a pretty long speedway; although I haven't measured it, according to the package it's 4.5 feet long. It's all plastic and it's very colorful. It has a remote control that looks like a steering wheel. It comes with one racing car and its driver's name is Ralph and when you press on it, he talks and sings. The racetrack includes a pit stop, a stunt zone where the U shaped track teeters to drop the car to the other side, a mechanical elevator and even a built-in audience. Additional cars are sold separately, but if you race against someone else, you will also need an additional remote control, and I'm not sure if the additional car is sold together with a remote control (it's not clear on the box).  This toy is designed for either one child to play by himself or two children to race either other. There are nine &#34;smartpoint&#34; locations where the racer responds with different phrases, music and fun sound effects. I got it for my grandson who is 1.5 years old. He likes it but I think he'll have more fun with it and understand it more as he gets a little bit older, as I don't think at his age he actually understands the concept of racing. The remote control uses 2 AAA batteries (not included). The racing car uses 3 AAA batteries (included for demo purposes only).
5.0	Timely.  Received product expected
5.0	I bought this for my one year old nephew and he absolutely loves it!!!!
5.0	The Barbie was exactly what I thought she would be.  My Granddaughters each received one from me for Christmas and they love their new doll.  The directions are clear and it is very easy to design a new dress every time.  I would recommend this Barbie.  Thank you Amazon for making this purchase easy.
5.0	Granddaughter loved it as a Christmas gift. She takes it to bed with her, and he &#34;guards&#34; the door at night.
5.0	Still holding helium almost a month later. Grand niece loves it.
5.0	I bought this loom as a gift for my 7 year old niece, who is all about being crafty right now.  She has woven a few really cute little &#34;scarves&#34; and things for my 2.5 year old daughter.
5.0	My husband wore this at my daughters birthday party to perform as JB!  It was great!  It looked awesome on him and was very reasonably priced!  But I don't think it would fit a child.
5.0	The tiny cat arrived in excellent condition and all of the<br />grandchilluns love to play with it!  They are enjoying<br />grandma's extended Beanie Baby collection that are for<br />them to play with.
5.0	Pretty good, fully satisfied, the product was what I expected, I received exactly what I expected, i highly recommend, the product was received as was described.
5.0	this lil quad is easy to fly, stable and resiliant.<br /><br />it's difficult to locate parts, it takes a long time for them to come from china.<br /><br />I've crashed this lil monster into walls, myself, trees, etc and it survived. I broke it when I tried to attach the prop guards w/o using the proper tool to pull the props off (use super small screw driver, not fingers!) .. now I'm having problems w/control board running 1 prop at max and idling the others... thats OK, I ordered another one! :)
5.0	A nice, soft plushie. Simple as that. Supporting FIFI is a nice bonus.
5.0	I had this game and introduced friends to it.  They loved it so much they wanted their own so I ordered it for them.
5.0	Good product and on-time delivered. Great job!!!
5.0	Love this little product....bought it as a birthday present for my friend.  She loved it!! Cute, little petite creature ....hehehe
5.0	My son loves LEGOs and this set is no exception.  As with any LEGO set, the first couple of days the set actually looks like it on the box, then as the pieces get knocked off it ends up looking like a mutant version.  And then the pieces get lost in the floor vents and get stuck on the bottom of your feet as you walk across your house.
5.0	We will definitely be buying this kit again. I used it for a birthday party and we were all first time tie dyers. It was so easy. It comes with a really great cd that walks you through the steps and shows you how to do several designs. The shirts turned out great. Everyone loved them. Colors are very vibrant and beautiful. Thoroughly enjoyed!
5.0	I was provided a free copy to evaluate. The opinions expressed in this review are mine alone.<br /><br />Robot Turtles is one of those games that comes along and makes not only your child think but you think as well. The game puts your child in charge of a curious robotic turtle as well as you, their parent. Children set out the commands that they want the turtle to perform like go straight, rotate left and right and fire laser. Parents then perform the commands because parents are the turtles and the kids are the turtle masters. Parents are encouraged to move the turtles and also make sounds for the movements.<br /><br />The game starts out fairly simply. The turtle has to make it from their spot to a gem. No obstacles, nothing too complex. Once your child has mastered the basic commands it is time to create a more challenging game board and add in obstacles like ice walls, immovable walls and moveable boxes. Turtles also acquire a laser and can use that to melt ice walls. Eventually kids move up to being able to use function frog which allows them to write small portions of code (functions) and use them repeatedly in the scenario.<br /><br />In very simple ways this game sets down the building blocks of coding for your young child and hopefully allows them some fun and enjoyment with you in the process.
5.0	My kids love these action figures. They were sold out in stores everywhere during Christmas time but I found them on Amazon for a reasonable price and they went great with the Half Shell Sewer Lair playset.
5.0	I am not new to R/C helis and have some hours of flying (and crashing) my 450 size KDS 3D capable collective pitch R/C helicopter. However I needed something that I can fly indoors and be less stressful than my KDS450. I Got this heli on a great sale price here for $22. I wish I had ordered few more of these for that price. This R/C coaxial heli is not your typical 3.5 channel &#34;wow!look at it fly!&#34; toy sold at the mall and everywhere else. Having 4 channels on a coaxial makes all the difference between getting as close to the real deal as possible i.e 4+ channel hobby grade R/C helis. I also think 4 channel helis are easier to control just becasue you have the added &#34;strafe&#34; or &#34;Aileron&#34; maneuverability along with pitch and yaw. I think this is the prerfect little micro heli if you want to get into the hobby of R/C Helis. Beats more expensive 4-channel coaxial micro helis hands down in every department i.e quality and price. The only gripe I have is the short flying time of 5-7 minutes after each charge that takes about half an hour or more for the included lipo battery. However this is understandable for a single cell lipo. Order a spare battery or two when you order this heli to increase your flying time. You might need to trim the controls a bit everytime you fly but once done it's very stable and quite responsive especially if you figure out how to change the dual rates (or control/throw senstivity) to advanced level. The provided manual isn't very clear on this but moving the left stick to left and then turning on the radio doesn't change the dual rates, it only messes up the trim and stick caliberation. Keeping the left stick centered and then pressing it seems to work instead.
5.0	I saw these at a local museum and my grandkids loved them! I bought 2 sets, enough to share!
5.0	We have been playing this game with friends and neighbors so we decided to buy our own version. Very simple, yet addictive dice game.<br /><br />If you really want to have even more fun and ramp of the intensity, have everyone bring dollar bills to use instead of the chips.<br /><br />Winning at LCR will never be as fun (or stressful) as when you are playing with real money!<br /><br />Just don't invite your friends that have gambling addictions.
5.0	This fishing set is really great, and quite durable for 2 little boys who fight over it!  I would highly recommend this for bathtime fun :)
5.0	This was a santa gift and my son loved it. Thanks again santa!
5.0	my daughter has the Janod Girls, and so I bought these for my son--they both love them. would recommend
5.0	Came on time. What we expected.
5.0	This track is so much fun!  It works well and is easy to put together and take apart.  This is our first track so I do not have any experience to compare it with other tracks.<br /><br />You &#34;clamp&#34; the top of the track to a table, chair or other item about 30&#34; high, the height of a dining table  (I found a little lower is better)....the track is then spread out in front. It took me several tries to find the right things to clamp it to. At first I was worried, but once I found what worked it was easy to repeat.<br /><br />I use either a door handle or a small table and both work...there is a swivel on the top of the clamp so you can position it properly.  The clamp is heavy plastic and made well, but won't damage the furniture.  Our floor is slippery tile, but I do not want to permanently tape it to the floor.  I put a small piece of non slip mat, under it so it will not move, but it works without it too.  The track itself is flexible plastic which makes it work very well.<br /><br />All our cars (mainly Hot Wheels) zoom down the track, over the loop and scoot across the floor... FAST...<br /><br />It is so much fun when the plane (very light so it won't damage anything) takes off....the track can be used without the plane as well....<br /><br />We play with it over and over again.  I put a bucket across the floor to see which cars make it to the bucket. and which are the fastest.<br /><br />We store it in the box it came in, since it is so fast to put together, but it is stable enough to leave it set up if you wish.<br /><br />Great purchase!
5.0	The Spare Parts are handy to have with a helicopter. I highly recommend these part for back repairs. for the price you cant go wrong.
5.0	Great for storing all those Lego Pieces in one convenient place, and love that it doubles as a play mat, so much fun!
5.0	Bought this little guy for my fianc&eacute;e.  She loved him!  Then I too became very fond of him, and procured an interest in Koalas.  Next thing you know, I'm watching documentary after documentary about koalas, and wished I lived in Australia so that I could have my own backyard Koala to feed and play with...  Until I found out they are endangered, cannot even be touched, and that there is an outbreak of Chlamydia amongst koalas.  In any event, we love this little beanie baby.
5.0	"Our lil girl absolutely loves this little oven.  She gets such a kick out of the \\""magic\\"" rising food.  It was the hit of her birthday gifts.  Highly recommended for any princess fans!"
5.0	Just started to learn how to felt so I bought this kit to learn. Has fairly clear instructions with pictures on how to make the 2 guinea pigs shown on the outside. I was surprised with how much extra wool there was left after making the 2 guinea pigs listed. I made a couple of smaller ones with the leftover wool. I imagine there is enough wool in the kit to make at least a total of 4 guinea pigs that are the recommended size.<br /><br />Kit does come with 2 needles, but I have already had 1 break on me, but I was learning so it was likely my fault. I did have to buy a foam board separate to place the wool on to needle felt, but it wasn't very expensive.<br /><br />I would recommend this kit to someone who is starting to learn how to needle felt. It's a good way to try out needle felting before investing a lot of money.
5.0	Awesome price and my 6 yr old and 4 yr old love them. Its their favorite toy to play with
5.0	Grand daughter loved it, arrived ahead of schedule too
5.0	This poster is incredible! Extremely fine detail and great sculpting work is shown off in this gorgeous piece of Star Wars memorabilia. For $40 this thing is a steal, because once opened and displayed, it looks like something that would've cost upwards of $150-$200. The item itself is pretty heavy, and I would make sure if you're going to mount it on the wall that you find the studs first, because there's no way drywall mounting will support this things weight. Luckily and ingeniously they also have a stand build into the back of the item like a picture frame so you can prop it up by itself on a table or dresser. Looks amazing, great price, fast shipping, PERFECT for any Star Wars fan! A+ Recommend!
5.0	Our son got one of these for his 5th birthday, but he had it full of trains on the first day.  We quickly decided that he needed another, and now he has two of them full of trains.  He likes to load and unload the totes, and he does flip it open and use the little track that is on the inside of the lid.  Very cleverly, you can actually connect Thomas the Train tracks to the lid to make it a working piece of a train set.  Pretty cool.  I think we'll be getting lots of use out of these totes.
5.0	Perfect smaller size to easily take along, music isn't too loud and shuts off on its own after about 15 minutes.
5.0	"I got this for one of the \\""deal\\"" prices. So glad I made the purchase. The set is absolutely fun, and I can buy more train cars to go with it. There is a lot more detail and sounds than I expected. We all like to play with it!"
5.0	My son absolutely loves this! he wanted a platypus for his birthday and this gives him what he wants plus a sidekick for when hes playing
5.0	excellent product and service....
5.0	Great gift for a 7 year boy. He had lots of fun putting it together.
5.0	FAST SHIPPING! GREAT PRICE! THANKS!!!
5.0	I love Justice League! I am going to join the Justice League someday! I will have pyrokinesis and be able to fly and have other powers!
5.0	The Power Sweeper is the most useful Rokenbok vehicle, even though it is expensive, slow moving and odd looking. When you set up a Rokenbok world it sin't long and you have little balls scattered about that need picked up. The Loader and the Skip Track can pick up balls stray balls but it takes a lot of action to pick them up. Meanwhile the Sweeper, while slow moving just drives over each stray ball and sucks it up into its cavernous cargo area. It can easily receive balls into its back cargo area as well the front end will lift up so you can reverse the roller to dump balls into cargo bins, etc. Yes, it costs more than some Rokenbok vehicles but it is very versatile to the task of moving balls within the world you will create. The only downside is that it is slow to drive and to dump the cargo.
5.0	My grandson picked this out for his preschool graduation.  He absolutely loved it.
5.0	This item was awesome, it was the perfect price, it came 2 weeks EARLY and it has good detail, perfect for yoshi fans, or for your kid's gift.
5.0	My grandson was very happy with his Minecraft gifts....He loves Minecraft....
5.0	Bought this for our 7 year old nephew for Christmas.  It was a hit!!  All of the cousins gathered around the table to watch what would happen as my brother and his son snapped the pieces into place.  My nephew told me it was his favorite present ever!
5.0	These blocks are endless building fun. If they are out on our table, the parents migrate toward them and build. My son used to build with the jenga blocks all the time, so I bought these.  Creative building!  And the blocks are uniformly cut. Both my 3 year old and 8 year old love them. I was surprised to see all 200 blocks being used so quickly..the creativity is flying. Might be buying more....
5.0	My grandbaby loves it
5.0	Bought 2 (one for my neice and one for my god daughter) for Christmas and they are absolutely perfect. Great size for their small hands.
5.0	This chair is great. My son is now 6 months old and we've been using it since he was 4 weeks.  He loves to sit in it while Mom gets ready for work or vaccums or something because he can see what's going on.  When he was younger, he used to fall asleep in it, but not any more.  Haven't use the rocking chair part of it yet.
5.0	Lubed it up as soon as I got it. Great corner cutting and very smooth. Improved my time drastically! Great cube for the best price! Don't hesitate to buy it!
5.0	These works as advertised and both my children, 2 and 7, really enjoy them. My daughter likes to setup a little obstacle course in the pool of these rings and diving toys.
5.0	My grand daughters love these.  It is a great add on to any Lego sets.
5.0	i purchased this for my 2yr old granddaughter. All of my family came out for Mother's day and we had about 10 little one's they really enjoyed themselves needless to say the teenagers were playing with them as well. we had lots of bubbles and the wind was blowing which made it better. You don't have to buy expensive bubbles at all $2 bubbles works just fine.
5.0	My 2 1/2 year old loved this. He had a ninja turtle voice and walked around wearing it non stop. Very cute. Would fit 2-3 and maybe 4 year old well.
5.0	My 8 year old son loves this Lego set it it is a great addition to his ever growing city.
5.0	We ordered hundreds of glow bracelets and necklaces from US Glow Laboratories for our wedding reception favors, and they were a huge hit with guests of all ages. They arrived very well packaged, and none of the sticks were activated when we opened up the tubes they came in - a very big relief. These particular glow sticks were thicker than usual, and they glowed pretty brightly. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone.
5.0	It really came in handy and was the talk of the event!!!!!
5.0	Fun game for kids, 2nd one we have bought.
5.0	Great product, fast shipping!~
5.0	My little boy loves his play food and I wanted to get him a nice set with a peelable banana for a Christmas gift.  I stumbled across this set and it was cheaper than other sets, so I bought it.  Today, it arrived and I was so tickled when I opened the package because I know he will love this.  The quality is good, the assortment is great, and the package looks fun, which is so important at Christmas in our house.    He will also be happy that he can cut his fruit and peel his banana.  So cute!
5.0	These gem stones are beautiful.  They are the perfect size as vase fillers.  Although plastic, they are absolutely gorgeous.
5.0	meadow my granddaughter loved the doll sings with her and love change the hair and dress and puts them both on a stage at once mean keira doll. got both for her loves them. she is 4 going on 5
5.0	Our 4-YO daughter has had this flashlight for about a year and she loves it.  Works well, it's bright enough although not too bright for a kid and it is durable.  The switch and light work reliably 100% of the time.  We have not experienced the problems with loose components or function in other reviews.  I don't think we've even changed the batteries yet.  It gets pulled out by the kids for a few days a couple times a month.
5.0	These were perfect for the gender reveal announcement for our upcoming grandchild.
5.0	Great set for Lord of the Rings fans, great movie detail. My son loves it, looking to purchase the other sets.
5.0	The bank was very cute.  My great grandson will enjoy putting his pennies in the bank.  Thanks for getting it to me quickly.
5.0	I bought this for my daughter for Christmas because she loves to help my husband build/fix things. This is a great toy for her. SHe loves it and will get it out when my husband is doing things around the house and work on her own project. I have found her so many times sitting quietly building some REALLY cool things all by herself and she is only 3.
5.0	Not only did my 3 year old grandson love this but all the adults had to try it.  Great toy!
5.0	Her Grandpa wanted to buy Rosie her First Easter Basket and I was thrilled to find it on-line ,Our Granddaughter loved it and my daughter thought it was Great!
5.0	My 3 year old daughter loves her purple turtle. It is so soft and adorable that my adult sisters were jokingly conspiring to steal it from her at her birthday party. It seems very durable. The picture is accurate of the product. The purple color is very deep and pretty. The sparkly little bow on its head is really cute. If your daughter loves purple and animals, this would be a great gift.
5.0	it came on time the packaging was perfect and I cant wait to do it love it
5.0	Very well made product.  Easy to install and so much fun.  What a great zip line product.  Kids and adults love it.
5.0	I was hesitant because of the missing picture.  But as far as I can tell the card is legit.
5.0	This product was exactly what I was looking for and shipped quicker than I expected.
5.0	I love Twilight.<br />So if you love Twilight you will love this calendar.<br />Especially since it's going to be the last in awhile!
5.0	This was a black Friday online splurge (didn't know if my son (3 yrs) wanted or would like it). He loved it! Still playing with it 3 months later. Stays together well, was easy for he and my hubby to put together.
5.0	If you are looking for water noodles for adults, this is the one you want. I enjoy smoking cigars in the pool and this helps keep my hands from falling in the water. The cheaper ones i had to use two of them and these are constructed better. Pricey, but worth it.
5.0	"If you or your child lack imagination, and depend on movable parts or something that runs on batteries, these are not for you.  However, if you are into collectibles, or your child likes to act out scenes from the show, you will like having these guys around.<br /><br />If you want them to be somewhat size-proportionate to the fraggles, then get the [[ASIN:B000H7EKU2 Fraggle Rock Gobo Fraggle 14\\"" Plush]], and the others the same size.<br /><br />Considering that there wasn't much to the doozers on the show to begin with, I think these guys are very accurate.  I just wish they came with some sample towers from the show, as well.<br /><br />We've had ours since my son was only a year old, and they haven't fallen apart, lost there shape, etc."
5.0	It is So soft and has amazing details! Loved it!
5.0	Just put that lighter casually around a poker table and some sucker will get it. I had fun cheaply!! !!
5.0	This doll is great. It's perfect for my 2 year old granddaughter. She carries it everywhere. I love that the eyes close when she lays down.
5.0	This bike is worth it's weight in gold. Super light, easy to assemble, looks great, easy to adjust. Plus all the safety features! Highly recommend
5.0	He's adorable - I put him on my refrigerator door!  WHAT A FACE - he has to make you laugh!
5.0	Lights up the entire room, just what we needed to help our 4 year old sleep in her bed
5.0	This is literally the best 19&#34; Armadillo ever!  I love armadillos so much that I now have one to sleep with and keep me cozy.
5.0	Nice for the little boys. Great price
5.0	These are favorite toys for my cat and kitten! Very inexpensive way to stay ahead of the constantly disappearing cat toys . . . plus they don't hurt your feet is you step on them!
5.0	Bought as a gag gift for my Dad. Perfect gift for the price since you know it will never be used.
5.0	Terrific first telescope for the little astronomer in the family.
5.0	Good quality. love it. It's small.
5.0	I just bought this tunnel for my two year old daughter. Her nursery school has the neon see-me connecting tunnel, and she just loves it. They didn't have that one at our local [store], so we bought the 6' Find-Me Play Tunnel. I think this tunnel will last a long time. My kids have already jumped on top of it, and the dog even tried to crawl through. It seems to be quite durable and is not made of cheap plastic like some of the less expensive tunnels. It's definitely worth the extra money.
5.0	"This was bought for my great grandson  who love to work with his Dad  he is learning the names of the different tool and really enjoys \\""His tools\\""  name of different screwdrivers and ect as he works along side Daddy"
5.0	This is a wonderful treat. I've never met anyone who doesn't like pandas.  The details and color on the bill are fantastic. The included protector is a blessing. It cuts down on the inevitable wear and tear.  It also helps makes it easy to use as a bookmark.<br /> They also make nice stocking stuffers. Great small gift for fans of wildlife.
5.0	These guys seem to work great in the Parkzone micro planes and the hobbyzone champ. I can't really say they run longer than the stock batteries, but they definitely work at least as well. I've put dozens of flights on them, probably hundreds, and they're still going.
5.0	I bought this towel/bag for my daughter a few years ago and she still uses it when we go to the beach or pool.  It's so handy since she can use it as a towel, while also carrying her own towel and a few other small things when it's a bag.
5.0	I loved playing with these as a kid! These bounce TWICE as high! Came fast! Endless fun! These make great party favors! Great deal overall!
5.0	While I still prefer the G1 look, this is a great compromise in TF design. I was impressed with the sculpt and the quality of the figure.
5.0	My 12 year old son loves it. He lives putting Legos together and this was more difficult because of the instructions. This was definitely a father son project. Better than trying to glue a metal ship together!
5.0	This is one of the better Monopoly products. The minion figure tokens make the deal much better. We had the Cars version when my son was a cars fan, and this outdid that one.
5.0	"As a LeapFrog Teacher Ambassador I was provided with this product to review in my kindergarten classroom, and they loved it!  Since food is one of their all-time favorite topics, they especially liked the \\""Recipes on the Road\\"", which teaches general math concepts along with learning to identify numbers.  My students really related to the food truck activities, since they are so popular in our neighborhood. The game definitely keeps my students engaged and on task!"
5.0	Put this baby on and you becomes the life of the party.  There is no hole in the mouth area which can be a drag but there is some room in the eye slots.
5.0	This is a great toy. There are lots of options for games, the kids love the touch screen, it's great for playing with in the car and it must be unbreakable since mine have been playing with it for 3 years now. I can't find one in stores anymore so I bought this one from seller Ty's Toy Box for a friend's 2 year birthday. A little pricey, but worth it. She loves it.
5.0	I was really happy to know that the packaging was in good condition. It has some shelf wear, but that was expected. Overall I'm happy. The draw string works also! Freddy's voice was loud and clear.
5.0	this is realy good condtion but it does not make things wayy  bigger like I hoped but m daughter is satisfied...only complaint is that I do not understand why amazon cranks there prices so high. I got this at a book store (an they are pretty expensive store) an this wa sonly 5$<br /><br />its great. just do not no why its so expenisve
5.0	So I just got mine in the mail and it's AWESOME!!!! Some of the reviews said it was a fake so I was really worried. Honestly I think those people may have bought from a different vendor because this is the real thing for sure! I compared it to my Miku figma and it's actually better! The joints are really tight and smooth, the paint job and sculpt are spot on, and it poses really well. Actually it's a lot more posable than I thought it was gonna be. I had fun recreating some of the scenes in the show and just messing around with it. this is just a really nice figure! I'm so glad I bought this!!!
5.0	Wish it came with more than one. But it is what it says on the tin
5.0	Good product and price appropriate
5.0	this was a christmas gift for my daughter and it for the price it was perfect.  i would recommend it.
5.0	My son loves it. He got it for his 2nd birthday 6/9. His legs were a little short for it at first, but as he grows he uses it more and more, seeing as he can reach the ground easier now. He calls it his motorcycle and just really enjoys cruising around and is getting plenty of exercise while doing so.
5.0	i like it! the best quality, i'm really satisfied with this product
5.0	Had a great time building this. Recommended for beginners
5.0	This mouse pad is lovely. The materials are good quality and last. The photo doesn't do the colouring justice. Its so much more high quality than the photos let on. If you're a fan of Kurumi Tokisaki, this product is a must for you computer. I will be buying more of these from the seller I purchased it from.
5.0	I waited several weeks so I could give a well tested review. Im lucky that I have a lot of RC experience though as far as flying models go it has been decades.  This is though the easiest flying model I have ever had and the best part is it can go out of the box and a 75 min charge. I was trying to fly it in the house the first evening.  Now you need to know that it is sensitive to wind including ceiling fans on low. We live on the Gulf Coast of Texas and they will fly into a 30 mph wind but trying to fly with such a wind you can easily lose it and or cause damage / injury to others.  The range on these is only about 120 feet which is not enough as far as Im concerned simply because wind can cause an unforgiving situation before you can react in that space. I would suggest Super glueing the colored LED shields because these little aircraft can take a lot of punishment but they can also lose parts. As it turned out trying to fly it indoors showed me this fact before I permanently lost them outside.  There is a modification you can make to the antenna that greatly increases its range to about 600 feet which is plenty far. Most cant really see these past that even in the evenings following their lights. You have to add wire to the antenna so it is 4.92 inches or 127mm long. You can drill a small hole in the end of the fake antenna for the wire to come through. Plenty of Utube videos to show you how.  The camera is not great but what do you expect for $60.    1-3-15 Update; I was flying at our Stadium and trying out the larger capacity battery that came later.  I guess the bleachers blocked my signal and the Drone belly flopped about a hundred feet into a pool of standing water.  It sank to the propellers. I pulled it from the water with the lights still blinking and switched everything off. I pulled the battery and shook the wet out.  It sat overnight and I used a hair dryer on it to be sure. Charged the batteries and went back to fly it in 25 mph wind with higher gust.  Flew like a champ with no issues and in fact I did about 15 rolls which are really easy even at 12 feet. It seemed like the flight was shorter but I don't know if it uses more juice or I was having more fun.  This gizmo has taken real abuse and I have not even had to replace a propeller or one of their guards.
5.0	GREAT FOR COLLECTORS. SUPER DETAIL AND QUALITY. GREAT FOR DISPLAY. NOT FOR LITTLE KIDS IF YOU WANT IT FOR COLLECTOR REASONS.
5.0	"My three and five year old daughters have gotten hours of great, imaginary play from this toy.  The soft \\""wild house\\"" has five little doors for the wild cats and a handle on top that makes it easy for children to carry.  It comes with five cute, unique, good quality beanie-baby-sized wild cats.  I read mixed reviews on the quality of this product but I am glad I ignored the bad ones and purchased it anyway.  We have traveled with this, brought it on car rides, show and tell, and my daughters even cuddle with the beanies at bedtime."
5.0	How can you rate Legos anything less than 5 stars?  I am an adult builder and all sets are great at bringing families together to build and talk.  Weather top is a winner!
5.0	I love this game. It's got characters from many of the episodes and it's fun, easy to play, and you can play it on-the-go!
5.0	"Finally a figure for the Phoenix Coyotes in mass prodcution, that us living out of the Arizon area can receive. Of late all you could get (other than Ebay Auctions) are figures that were give aways at select games (beleive me I have tried and been outbid). You always see other teams figures and go, geez Todd, you live in AZ what about the Coyotes?<br /><br />As much as I would have loved to see a 6 in. JR figure, who better to premier the Coyotes McFarlane Picks than CUJO!!!<br /><br />And he's here in a stunning 6 inch figure.<br /><br />This figure has had a great deal of time and detail spent on it. It comes with a block of ice for CUJO to rest on that has his name on it under the netting. The goal netting fits firmly in place.<br /><br />Cujo is represented in front of the goal \\""balancing\\"" on one leg and kicking the other up for a save which the puck is attached in a 3D fashion on the lower half of the pads. The jersey, pads, helmet, and stick all represent natural curves, and of course natural wear including, scuffs, \\""puck dings\\"", and even worn tape on the stick.<br /><br />The helmet is beautifully painted, you really don't have to have much detail to the face as it is hidden pretty well behind the mask, so I couldn't tell you if it was recognizible.<br /><br />I have been awaiting this item for a long time (hmm... 10 years to be exact) and Todd McFarlane has done it just as much justice has he has all his NHL line, Music line, and Movie and Comic line.<br /><br />If you are a fan of the Coyotes or CUJO, this is a must have. Especially if you live outside the AZ area and can't make it to games for the freebies (btw, I heard there is a Shane Doan figure coming up as a freebie in the next few weeks (March '07). I will continue to search on Ebay for the Jeremy Roenick 3 in. figure, the other CUJO 3 in. figure, and the Shane Doan 3 in. figure when it comes out, but this is a wonderful hold over until I get those too.... and a perfect addition to my Coyotes collection of stuff.Coyotes collection of stuff."
5.0	I gave 5 stars because it is resistant has intense colors, and I got no problems ordering, excellent product .
5.0	We got this for our 4 year old and she absolutely loves it.  She can take it ANYWHERE...car, restaurant, playdate, etc.  This is one of her favorite toys.  It is fairly sturdy and all the pieces are self contained in the magnetized box.  We love this!
5.0	These were a gaft for my 2 year old nephew.  He loves to build and knock down rebuild.  Great gift!
5.0	Please look at the back wheels... they are covered by a plastic shield!!!  Worth the $100 to not have your kid bleeding from the ankles everytime they use their scooter!!!
5.0	Really cute set for children! It works surprisingly well and is the perfect height for kids!
5.0	I've now bought three of these, one for the grandkids here, two as gifts.  The bubbles get clogged but are unnecessary.  One of the kids favorite outdoor toys.  Makes sound with no batteries and they really run it off with this toy.  Both the one and five year old are using it now.  Highly recommend.
5.0	Great game. Arrived in just 2 days. I hope there are more question card expansion packs for this game. If there are I would quickly pick them up.
5.0	Lego robotics is great for learning.  Extra sensors allow for more complex behavior and sophisticated projects.  Great product though takes time to learn.
5.0	My one and a half year old grand-daughter, Joya, fell in love with the tiger. I purchased it since it was also the mascot of my alma mater,<br />Princeton University. It was priced attractively and met our expectations.
5.0	Really fun game for the whole family.
5.0	I just received these yesterday and they are very cute.  My 6 year old Granddaughter has many &#34;stuffies&#34; as she calls them and they are all related<br />as sisters, brothers, aunts, uncles, etc.  She has them arranged in a circle in<br />the middle of her bedroom, where she can be entertained for hours, having<br />birthday parties, meals, naptime, and playtime.  They are all touching the<br />stuffed animals on either side.  I bought these finger puppets for her to use in<br />her doll house as I am sure she will continue her play there on a smaller scale.<br />Mariana, Winter Park, FL.
5.0	Great holiday gift for the grandkids. They love this and learn about the phases of the moon too.  Very happy.
5.0	Arrived quickly and in mint uncirculated condition, no problems or complaints to speak of.
5.0	We open a game every Christmas Eve to play as a family.  The past few years have been slim pickings, but this was really, really fun.  We played in pairs (to reduce pressure on visitors new to our family's competitive nature!) and everyone had fun.  All players can make contributions, regardless of age or vocabulary.  We had so much fun, we decided to start Family Game Night once a month!
5.0	The Grandkids loved them!
5.0	My 8 year Old son absolutely lived it!
5.0	Definitely the real deal professional balls here. Made me and my Tornado foosball table quite happy. I'd certainly buy them again.
5.0	I loved this game as a kid and now I get to play with my kid! I wanted to get the old &#34;classic&#34; one, because it is made with the plastic pegboard, and just seems sturdier than the cheap all-cardboard one they make now. My son (5 yrs old) loves it!
5.0	I remember watching PumpkinHead when I was 7 years old and eating cold pizza in the morning  he's one the most awesome creature in the horror genre since Creature From The Black Lagoon maybe not as iconic but he comes awfully close. So those who aren't familiar to this grotesque movie monster he is a demon base on revenge in the movie Ed Harley is a local gas man living out in the country with his son who he dearly loves but a group of mischievous kids decided to come to the gas station and ride their dirt bikes around on his property. Harley went out to get some supplies for his shop trusting one of the teenagers to look after his son but the child went off intrigued by the dirt bikes and without warning the biker ran him over causing one of them to panic leaving the scene while Harley soon came back and learned his was dead later he made a deal with a witch to uncover a mysterious force that not even man is supposed understand but Ed went out in the woods to unearth this force and finding a decomposing body that look inhuman then the true horror begins he then comes back to witch to finish off the deal and now PumpkinHead is now out for a taste of crisp human blood. So I really hope I didn't bore you to death about that and I appreciate those who stayed I really do. so the figure comes in a blister packaging and two accessories a small movie poster where you see PumpkinHead digging his long finger nail into one of his victims forehead now the picture frame is the most interesting its basically skeletons all stacked up each other and between all of them there's a logo that says movie maniacs now the detail on him is really impressive you can see veins to stretched out bones to his towering shoulder bones and him in snarling smile and don't get me started on the paint job holy smokes haha just absolutely love this figure for any horror fan or a collector needs to add PumpkinHead to your collection cause he deserve to be with Jason and Michael Myers for sure<br /><br />Articulation: bendable tail. swivel waist, turns at the wrist, shoulders ball joint, legs up and down there is NO ! head movement.<br /><br />Height: 7inch<br /><br />Overall score 10/10/>Articulation: bendable tail. swivel waist, turns at the wrist, shoulders ball joint, legs up and down there is NO ! head movement.<br /><br />Height: 7inch<br /><br />Overall score 10/10
5.0	It was a gift and they love it.
5.0	I ordered it on a Friday Morning and it was delivered the next day i am too happy! The Toy looks exactly how the picture looks, super cute and looks like it is really good quality, i am more than satisfied i am stoked about this toy! Receiving this package literally made my day! I highly recommend it!☺
5.0	The beauty of this game is its flexibility. Our gaming group, mostly in their 40s, has this as one of our favorite groups. Our groups _children_, mostly below ten, does also! It's a very simple easy to learn game, but still has a lot of strategy, and every game feels different. The 3 and 4 player versions are actually better than the 2 player version, so again its very flexible. Great game.
5.0	love how close to real they look, and how they feel. My son loves playing with them and learning what they are!
5.0	This doll is absolutely beautiful. Her hair is great. My kids have combed and braided it and stretched all of the curls out but when i wet it it goes right back curly. She's great quality you won't regret this purchase.
5.0	Took so much to fill it up, but was well worth it.  Teachers loved it because it was easy and my friends love it.  Nice quality on the details.
5.0	My 10 month old loves this doll!  We got it for her when she was about 7 months old, and she sleeps with it every night!  She actually likes to suck/chew/teethe on the little tuft of hair on top of the baby's head.
5.0	Great gift for anyone.
5.0	A fun and slightly creepy crew for your Christmas collection.
5.0	My four year old daughter loves her Leap Frog.  She uses it daily.  What I don't particularly care for is the flimsy pages.  They are too easy to bend up.  I would recommend that they put some kind of magnet on the pages to hold them down while being used.  So far she has not torn the pen off so that is good. Overall I really do like the Leap Frog.
5.0	Excellent Item for fun. Thank you.
5.0	My daughter and husband are German Shepperd fans. I really enjoyed playing the game with my daughter and she enjoyed it as well. Just wished the pieces were German Shepperds.
5.0	These bags were perfect for my 2 year old's birthday party.
5.0	Nothing special. Just a mask for canopy.
5.0	We own this wagon and it's predecessor wagon.  The previous version was slightly smaller and did not have the cup holders which are used quite often.  It was however much easier to maneuver.  Our ONLY complaint about this wagon is that you cannot fold the handle in any direction to enable the wagon to easily fit into our vehicle.  It is always at an upward angle.  Luckily, it still fits in our van, but barely.  You can take the sides off, but that is a little time consuming.  The maneuverability is a bit challenging compared to the previous model too, but that is because of the handle design.  The extra space and underneath storage are worth any inconvenience.  I'd recommend.  You can fit at least 2, sometimes 3 (smaller) kids in this wagon.
5.0	The ring is so strong on magnetic items. It took 21 days to come but it was worth the waiting. In the little package was a silver folding wand and the ring. Be very careful with the ring too because If you drop it on concrete you will get tiny scuffs but they are not that visible.
5.0	My son loved his spongebob cake topper for his third birthday. And he's still playing with them! FYI the there is a button on each character that makes the heads pop off the bodies. An unexpected but awesome perk.
5.0	Bought these for my son's birthday to put in the goody bags.  Very cute and work well.  My son is 3 and they are easy for someone that age to operate.
5.0	I use this to haul two kids at a time.  It's a great little wagon, was easy to assemble, and has lovely quiet wheels.
5.0	made a six year old happy, which was the purpose of the order!
5.0	Exactly as advertised & what I was looking for. It added to our collection.
5.0	Watched this game played online by Wil Wheaton. Our 6 yr old kids thought it looked fun. We have had it a few weeks and after the first playing it became an obsession. Given the choice to play on the iPad or Catan the board game wins. We are playing a family game tonight. I did not know but it is really two games. One side of the board is set up for three to four players. The other side is for only two players. The two 6yr Olds had the rules down pat from the first play. We have a boy and a girl and both love it. We have one be the bank and one hand out the parrot cards. We change it up each time. This is a really fun family game. We will get the older version as the kids grow into it
5.0	We bought these for an airplane ride for our 18 month old. They are super cute with the bow on top. They fit her head on the smallest setting, but she is a big 18 month old.  The sound was never too loud, but loud enough for the airplane, she could hear all of her songs. We havent had for long, but they served the purpose for our airplane trip. The only downside of this product was due to the llittle flower on the plug, we did have to take off our thick drop proof ipad case.
5.0	Great for girls (ages 8-12) who are really into LEGO.
5.0	Great price and great set!!!  There are sets for the same price that only contain one of the 6 sections of cards that this set includes.  Unbeatable!  My son likes them too which is strange since he doesn't like math in written formats.
5.0	Hours of entertainment for my 3 year old! It fits any standard Matchbox car, so he has sooooooo much fun testing different cars (among his 100's) to see which one is the fastest. My daughter (5) even enjoys getting in on the races and she's not much of a car fan. It's pretty strong as well, so I anticipate years worth of play. I highly recommend this.
5.0	I bought three of these for my triplet grandchildren on their third birthday.  They are excellent little tool sets, perfect for this age.
5.0	I bought this toy for my nephew for Christmas and he loves it. He is 17 months old and he went crazy for this toy. It makes so many sounds when you touch different parts of it. The DJ sings and moves back and forth and is so cute and entertaining. I loved playing with it before I gave it to him. It also has ABC's, numbers, colors and other educational learning sounds. Great present for a child!
5.0	Wonderful toy and hours of fun for our son.  It is constructed very well.  Our son loves playing with it.
5.0	very quick delivery. Exactly as pictured.
5.0	Absolutely love it.My grandson is doing the Pinocchio story with it!!!
5.0	I needed D4's for a game I was going to play and they arrived much sooner than I thought, it was great! Also a great price!
5.0	Purchased it for our toddler to help with the arrival of the sibling.  It was really nice to see her play with it.  It's durable and it's not obnoxious like many other kids toys either
5.0	We bought the chair for our grandson, the picture does not made justice, it is very pretty and really sturdy. We are all very happy, and he watches his cartoons seated like a grown up, he is fifteen months old.
5.0	Perfect! The tools look good and are detailed.  My 3 year old grandson loves it.
5.0	This little dachshund is so cute. The colors are great and the wood is very smooth. The wide wheel base will make it easy to pull with little worry about it turning  over. It was a great choice for my grandson.
5.0	Bought these because another review said they worked with the water park. But they get stuck. Nothing wrong with the item, but don't buy as replacement for the spiraling seas water park. If you do, you will be disappointed.
5.0	Cause it meets what my son wanted for christmas he ebjoyed it and is just what he wanted as a present
5.0	Super fast and super fun - easy to use for 9 year old.  You have to charge it after about 20 minutes of use though.
5.0	The power wheel battery was good quality, excellent price, the only problem was how it mailed, otherwise, everything would have been great.
5.0	Great game.... loved it!
5.0	Finally what I've been waiting for a Showa Monsterarts Godzilla!! I was terrified to get this figure because of the size issue, but honestly its not that bad. I compared him with my Bandai creations Gigan pretty prefect size there. He's only slightly shorter than the 90s Monsterarts Godzilla, I was thinking he was like Little Godzilla's size. He also fits with Little Godzilla, even if theyre never shown together, and great next to ghidorah! All I can say bad is the little space in between the spikes, not too terrible if you pose him up right the right way. Also he likes to fall apart easy fix pop back in the ball joints but his arm came off and it was very hard to get back in. Oh his joints are a little stiff at first just loosen them up. And Amazon's shipping for this figure from the facility is very fast with tracking :D
5.0	When people asked my 3-yr-old daughter what she wanted for Christmas, she said, &#34;A Tasha pillow.&#34;  So, I knew I had to get one for her.  I couldn't wait until she waded through her mountain of gifts on Christmas  morning until she opened this one.  Now, when anyone asks her, &#34;What was your favorite thing from Santa?&#34;  She quickly says, without hesitation, &#34;My Tasha Pillow.&#34;  It is decent quality and looks lovely.
5.0	My son loves it. First time getting one but I can see it being on the list for a few more years.
5.0	My kids age 8 ,4 and 2 received this gift and love it. Even the cat loves to sit on the draw bridge so the kids have named him king. We took a blanket and tossed it over the top of the area without a top . Also it can be push around to fold a little so you can save space when not being used. Money well spend on this gift!
5.0	I always wanted this!
5.0	It's fun. And morbid.<br /><br />Beautiful design. Love the quality of the materials. Pretty simple rules.<br /><br />And it just opens up imagination time so well.
5.0	Very cute. Will fit a small teenager snug around the arms. There's no way to extend it further unless you cut and redo the straps like a regular backpack. I have a hard back wallet that's roughly six inches long and it's a tight fit.
5.0	This little budgie is so cute! I bought it as a companion to the blue one (which I already owned). It came here more quickly than expected, and had a little packet of tea inside as a gift.
5.0	"picked up the set today for $20NZD. i grabbed it cos it was the cheapest and came with jack. while i dont think kids will have much fun with this, adult enthusiasts will appreciate the detail, from the actual \\""bone legs\\"" that make the table to the \\""ships in bottles\\"" that go on the shelf. theres lots of neat new elements [the sword carrier especially] the poster is a nice addition and it seems each set comes with a different one."
5.0	Such a bargain and really good quality for such an inexpensive price. I bought these for an 80's party to give out as favors and am very pleased with what I received.
5.0	This product is not a toy. It was delivered on time and in good shape. It works properly and I'm very satisfied with it. I listed it as 5 stars because I can not submit this review, without checking the stars in question #2, even though they do not pertain to this product!
5.0	These things are cute for just about anywhere. I bought them for my wife and she has them in the house, her car, and in the garden. Very durable and cheap too! Absolutely would recommend and purchase 10 times over!
5.0	Beautifully made and totally worth the price. Fits American Dolls perfectly.
5.0	I bought these for my nephew and he has LOVED them! My only complaint is they have a hard time climbing the spiral on the habitat I also bought.
5.0	Great product. I used them for party favors. My daughter used the cup to drink out of. She loves this cup.
5.0	it's what you would expect
5.0	Great game now loved by my 5 and 8 year old. I love too that it is &#34;Made in the USA&#34;
5.0	Solid game and easy to learn.  I like the options for modified co-op. The Wizard's Tower expansion makes a really great addition if you want to spice it up some :)
5.0	finally found a lab coat that fit a child still interested in playing appropriate make believe at age 6 but is a larger child.  and by larger I do not mean obese - just tall and normal weight for height.
5.0	This is one of many to my Iron man Figurine collection. I am sure there will be many to come. Merchandise was delivered as stated and in great condition.
5.0	This is an outstanding figure. The detail, accessories and articulation are unbelievable. Excellent work have been put into the Revoltech Iron Man series figures. The War Machine and Mark VI good very well together. I may have to pick up the Red\Silver Mark V in the near future.
5.0	Nice quality and price.  Easy enough to put together.  Got it for my 7 yr old.
5.0	Accidently broke a coworkers and easily replaced it. He is happy again.
5.0	My 5 year old niece loves stuffed animals and wanted a baby cheetah from Santa. So I set out to find one and found this adorable cub. I looked all over the net and this was by far, the most adorable, nicest looking one I could find. In person, the tiny hairs around the head are so life-like, the cub in general is quite realistic looking. My niece absolutely loved it and wouldn't put it down. Quality and workmanship is also impressive.
5.0	Gave this to my nephew and it was awesome and it was easy enough to put together for him at 6 granted he had help from his 12 year old brother.
5.0	The beauty of this little creature is that it opens doors to the imagination, even for a 4 yr. old.
5.0	Kids got as a second one for the guns and use it as a back up.  Holds a lot of bullets and makes for more fun.
5.0	doll arrived exactly as described. i love it and its adorable. i could not find this one any where in stores.
5.0	Good Quality. i like it
5.0	Loved the keychain!! :) super cute :) very fast shipping also!
5.0	"Okay, so I just saw the Squeakquel, being a big fan of the Chipmunks going back to watching them as a small child in the '80's. As expected, it was a great time. Dave literally phoned it in this time, but \\""Uncle\\"" Ian was back to exploit the Chipettes, and it was completely hilarious! Anyway, I had seen these Ty beanies of Alvin, Simon, Theodore, and Britney on Amazon a short time before and already knew I wanted them. I have a nice toy trio already that came with the DVD release of the first film in a Best Buy gift set, but I was always unsatisfied with their small size. These Ty beanies are much closer to the actual size of the Chipmunks in the live-action/CGI films. Still a bit short, but much closer (possibly more accurate to actual chipmunk size? I really don't know though). So, I was thrilled when my package from Amazon arrived and much larger (but not too large) chipmunks than the ones I already have filled the box. These new Ty chipmunks look good, and I am giving them the full five stars because I do love them, but they could still have been better. They're big enough to satisfy me without being too big, like a plush probably would be, and they have nice detail. However, they could have better detail. Most specifically, they could have the darker areas of their fur that form stripes, some of which (in the film) imply eyebrows. This is something I'll miss in the tiny plush toys I have that I will probably get rid of after making this upgrade. Their tails in the film versions are longer than these Ty incarnations too, but that's no biggie. I have yet to acquire Theodore, as I could only buy three when I ordered these with a gift card, and Brittany was a must (I'll get Theo ASAP, for sure), so I can't comment on him, but I can say that I think of the three I own, Simon has the best likeness since the glasses add detail to his overall look (wearing his blue hoodie, of course). Without the eyebrow enhancements, Alvin isn't so striking, despite having that nicely made hoodie with stitched on \\""A\\"", and Brittany is very cute, but she also looks the most like a toy out of the three. Still, I'm thankful that she actually does have a center forehead stripe, and her outfit is very cute, though it does have fraying edges on the jacket's bottom hem. She sports a cute ponytail like in the film, but I had to work with it a bit to make it lay right due to the way they chose to craft it (it's stuffed itself, like her actual tail). Regardless of the nit-picky things, she looks great and all three of these beanies do, and I anticipate Theodore will look great when I get him as well. They just better not stiff us fans and cancel the line before making Jeanette and Eleanor! Oh, and what's the deal with Alvin not wearing his cap? He doesn't wear it in the Squeakquel (if I remember correctly), nor does the Ty beanie wear one! Alvin always wore his hat! I wouldn't be surprised if they come out with a cap-wearing version if/when the other two Chipettes come out though, forcing me to buy Alvin all over again, ha.made hoodie with stitched on \\""A\\"", and Brittany is very cute, but she also looks the most like a toy out of the three.

5.0	Bought this for my grandson, he loves it!
5.0	I first played this game at a work function, and just had to get one for home.  Took it to several family get-togethers, and we are all addicted!!  Especially good for kids (10+) & adults to play together, although some of the words / terminology goes over the kids' heads.  (Have not played the kids version to comment on that.  My teens have and say that it's not as good as the original.)  I know it can be expensive vs. other games, but it's definitely worth it - lots of fun!!
5.0	Perfect for my needs. I am just getting started in mahjong so I wanted an inexpensive starter set and this is perfect. It's actually better than I expected them to be. There are 166 tiles in total which is enough for any version of mahjong that I know about (American, Chinese, Hong Kong, Riichi).<br /><br />The tiles that are included are:<br />  1-9 Bams 4 of each (36 tiles)<br />  1-9 Dots 4 of each (36 tiles)<br />  1-9 Craks 4 each (36 tiles)<br />  4 Green Dragons<br />  4 Red Dragons<br />  4 Soaps<br />  4 East Winds<br />  4 West Winds<br />  4 North Winds<br />  4 South Winds<br />  16 Flower tiles (4 each of bamboo, chrysanthemum, plum blossom, and orchid)<br />  10 Jokers<br />  4 Blanks<br /><br />They are not very large but the are not terribly small either. Dimensions are 1 3/8 in tall x 15/16 in wide x 1/2 in thick.<br /><br />There is a plastic smell when you take them out, so I would advise to leave them out so the smell goes away. It's not too bad, but it is noticeable. I found that the card box that you would get from your local game store used to store magic the gathering cards is a great size to store the tiles in, plus the box costs less than $2.<br /><br />For someone looking for a cheap but quality starter mahjong tile set this is about as good as you are going to get. Highly recommended.
5.0	my kids love it. perfect size for their smaller rooms and if it falls over its not too heavy for them to pick it up.
5.0	Bought these for my soon to be 3 year old son and he loves playing with them. His cousins got jealous that they ended up getting the same ones.<br /><br />The finish and the wood could be better, but that would make them more expensive.
5.0	I bought this for my 5 yr. olds bday and its actually pretty cool, just assumed it was going to break and be tossed out pretty soon, but its super neat and came with cool gadgets and son just loves it!
5.0	Cant wait to finish this puzzle
5.0	My daughters party was Nov. 26. It is Dec 10 and this Guy is still floating around! My 2 year old loves it now though she was a bit apprehensive at first because it was so big. The DG laughed at me when I took the balloon in to be filled,  saying they didn't have enough helium even though I was telling them to charge me. so I took it to a floral shop which gladly helped me. They charged me for 5 Mylar balloons which was about 7.50 . This and cookie monster cost me over fifteen to have blown up but worth it for me. I do want to add that his legs do not fill which made him seem not quite as big as I had thought when I took him out of the package but that allows for the 'air walker' affect.  And if you let him wander freely, watch out! He'll sneak up on you while you are doing dishes or be   waiting at the door as you are coming out of the   bathroom. He's always creeping on you. Lol fine   after you adjust to him being there but pretty   freaky the first couple of times! :)  I'm glad I made this purchase, it really added to my girl's 'terrible 2 sesame street monster bash!'
5.0	Exactly what I wanted thank you
5.0	Grandson loved all the cars , making grandchildren happy is what it is all about , love all of them
5.0	This train is really cute.  My son loves the cargo cars that come with it and he loves that Whiff has glasses, just like him.  :)
5.0	Child loved gift. Good quality & good value.
5.0	After several purchases and failing to find a cute bear for our baby girl, we finally got this one.  He is so soft and cuddly and absolutely adorable!
5.0	My 7 year old daughter wanted a planetarium for Christmas.  This is just what she wanted.  The projection is good and clear.  It has a timer so she can look at it before she goes to bed.
5.0	She takes it with her everywhere, it's a great idea for kids! Love the backpack on her, too. For my niece who loves cuddly things it was perfect. And she loves &#34;Dowa&#34;
5.0	Great product and grand daughter loves it.
5.0	Awesome cute shoes!  Wish they had some for us girls!
5.0	I bought this toy for my nephew and he loves it !! His parents also had a wonderful time playing with this toy !
5.0	My grandson has played and played with this toy.  He has mowed everything in and outside the house.  He even wants to take it to bed with him so he can start mowing in the morning.
5.0	This Beanie Boo is cute, soft and cuddly.  I gave this as part of a birthday gift for a little girl who loves owls.
5.0	This is a really fun and captivating kit for  all ages. As a grandmother I am enjoying it<br />with my 5 year old grandchild.<br />Jennifer Gardner
5.0	You wont find better metallic paints for painting plastic miniatures if you want a very shiny smooth coat. Shake very vigorously or use a mixer until you see no more pigment sitting on the bottom of the pot. If you use a palette keep mixing the paint with your mixing brush between applications. These paints dry extremely fast, almost as soon as they're applied.
5.0	Great  game. Love it. Love the company as to how and where the product is manufactured.
5.0	First of all, I should mention that this board game does the impossible by being almost as fun to play solo as it is to play with friends. You won't believe me right away, but take my word on it.  The game has a tremendous amount of depth, combining tactical decision making and board games' importance of movement and strategic positioning with ccg concepts like tempo and virtual card advantage. That's right, virtual card advantage is integrated into the game's design in a way that adds more depth than frustration.  Gameplay feels tight and satisfying. The rules are complicated, but imminently grokkable thanks to a flavor that ties everything together. I can't say enough nice things about this game. You simply have to check it out.
5.0	I love, love, love anything playmobil products and the prices over the years have gone down.  My daughter loved adding this beautiful horse to her collection.
5.0	Our family has enjoyed this game so much, we were recently introduced to Fill or Bust, and could not wait to buy our own! It is a great game for families, or friends.
5.0	It works like I expected. Little brother was excited about it. That was all that mattered.
5.0	My grandson  loves  it, but  it  really  goes  through  bubbles  fast. !!
5.0	Ordered for a teenage girl birthday party and they stayed up for hours playing.  Girls had a great time. Thanks!
5.0	The figura details and color are vivid, looks real, the size its not the ideal but works ! Must to have it !
5.0	Fair price & prompt shipping.
5.0	Simple. Fun. I gave these to my students on a new pencil as a year end gift and they were a big hit. I'm ordering more for next year.
5.0	"I selected this toy through the Amazon Vine program for our Office Manager's three year old.  It has been a huge success!<br /><br />When he first got it, he played right through his first nap.  He loves the sounds it makes, particularly the \\""vroom vroom\\"" when its pushed.  It comes with four pieces he can take on and off.  Its totally safe.<br /><br />The box says its for ages 3 and up, but because of the total safety of this toy, it could be purchased for a younger child as well.  In fact, My office manager reported that her six month old wants to play with it.  Now, ten days after first receiving the truck, the three year old asks if he can go home and \\""play trucks.\\""<br /><br />Its well constructed, and totally worthy of the Tonka name.  It comes with the batteries already installed.  You just have to turn it on.  I think Tonka is putting some money behind it with an advertising campaign.<br /><br />If you are a grandparent or family friend and you don't know what to get your 2-5 year old?  The \\""Tonka Chuck Get Ready to Race\\"" is a sure thing."
5.0	"This chair is perfect for baby learning to sit in one - the back is tall, the seat is deep and sloped back to help baby get \\""seated\\"" and nice arms - chair short enough for my 9 mo old (23 lb) grandson to navigate himself, too!"
5.0	We had a dinner party and closed with this game. It was a huge success. Everyone loved the simplicity of it, and I learned a few things too!
5.0	My son and I play candyland all the time. It is his favorite game. So for his little cousins birthday we decided to get her the game. I came online trying to find the original version and stumbled upon this. She LOVES princesses! When she opened this at the party she couldnt wait to play! I would recomend to anyone! Lots of fun and wasy enough for even the little ones to enjoy!
5.0	I love playing the game in groups and with my grandkids.  The group game is a blast as long as you limit the time to 30-45 seconds per turn.  Otherwise, it can turn into a long strategy session and people lose interest.  Keep it light, play fast and have fun!<br /><br />Regarding the kids, I've played it with my 9 year old grandson.  It's fun to watch the &#34;lights go on&#34; when he's thinking through the possibilities.<br /><br />We liked it so much that we gave it out to family members for the holidays!
5.0	Good product, very durable!
5.0	my son saw this toy at a friend's house when he was 18 months old and played with it the entire time we were there. I immediately bought one for him and it is still one of his favorite toys one year and a half later. When my 7 month old started sitting up a month ago, I sat him in front of it and he loved it!! He won't play with anything else if this toy is in his view. he loves opening and closing the doors and presses every button to hear the animal sounds. With all the attention this toy gets the dog is quite jealous and runs away with whatever pieces he can--they have been scrubbed clean several times and still look like new!  This toy prompted me to purchase other Little People toys and while my sons like the others, this is their favorite.
5.0	Fun game, small bag that can be taken along in a trip. Every player can play at his/her own level. Great opportunity to learn new words. For those who worry about accents, it is normal that there are none. Capital letters do not carry accents in French, just use the E as an e,é,è or ê as you need (or O for ô,o  etc).
5.0	much loved by my 2 year-old niece
5.0	If you have PowerTrains, you need extra track.  Just go ahead and get it now. The price is right, you won't be sorry.
5.0	My 13 year old son loves this toy, because he can launch 2 beyblades at the same time.  It doesn't launch them as fast as his single launchers, but he likes the fact that he can launch 2 at the exact same time and compare them.  (If you want a really good single launcher, try the string one.)
5.0	I have always been a huge fan of Melissa and Doug, so when I saw this puzzle box I figured...why not?  Well...one of the best purchases I have made in a long time.  My three year old absolutely loves them.  Each puzzle has a different shape stamped on the back of each piece, so there is educational value in the soring and best of all, he enjoys sorting the pieces in to their correct little box, as well.  Definitely a great time consumer that he can do all by himself.  I am in love!!!
5.0	What a great idea for decorating an office studio, such a whimsical piece.
5.0	Adorable plates and just the finishing touch needed.
5.0	I kept this with me during labor. It was perfect and very good quality especially for the price
5.0	I received this game as a gift from my parents when they saw it on my wish list.  They asked me how the game played, so I opened it up and showed them a very brief example, intending to just roll a turn for myself and then having my father roll a quick turn.  I went to put the box away and my mother commented she hadn't had her turn yet.  Just like that, we were off and playing.  We sat around the kitchen counter for quite some time playing this game.  It was so simple and addictive that we found it hard to stop.  In fact, I brought the game to a friend's house the following day, and we quickly knocked out five rounds.  The game is so simple that a player late to the game almost won the first time he played, even though he was three turns behind.<br /><br />This is a very simple, clean, and addictive game for friends and family.  Highly recommended.
5.0	This is just what we wanted ... Great Gift
5.0	My 2 year old son LOVES his little motorcycle. He is around 32 inches tall and it's perfect for him.
5.0	My son LOVES this we bought it a while back but I forgot to write the review
5.0	I bought this for my 6 year old daughter.  It's fun I had it when I was a kid, not a huge learning tool except for counting, but it's fun, and easy to play.
5.0	This's one of the most detailed and beutiful action figure I've seen.  The details in the sword and in her body are unmatched.  It's very cool when you set it and she is reaching back for her sword.<br />My only complain is that the chain that hold her sheath on her back broke the minute a took it out of the case.  But it was only an open link, very easy to fix.
5.0	I bought this for my grandson who has optic nerve hypoplasia. His therapists love it!! I've since bought them for baby gifts. It's an awesome learning tool for newborns and babies with vision impairment.
5.0	Bought this for my granddaughter. Putting it together was easy and took about 30-45 minutes. It looks just like the picture. Also about half the price of the beds on the American Girl site.
5.0	My grand-daughter Loves this doll house especially with the special effects.
5.0	Before you decide to buy this consider the fact that C.A.H. lets you download all these cards as a PDF file on their website for free!!!<br /><br />Love this game!!! I play it every time I have a group of people come over and have still to meet the person that doesn't love the game! Actually, every one that's ever plaid the game at my place went out and bought it the next day! Maybe you're one of those people reading this review right now, if so, I think you accidentally took that stash of 100's I keep on my coffee table (mistakenly of course, probably confusing it with your own stash of 100's).  I'd like that back please!<br /><br />GET THE GAME! IT'S CHEAP, IT'S FUNNY AS HELL, EVERYONE WILL HAVE A BLAST PLAYING IT!<br /><br />***Just please keep in mind who's around when your playing this game!*** I don't think grandma or one of your kids would want to hear you read out loud this card ------&#62; &#34;Firing a rifle in the air while balls deep in a squealing hog&#34;
5.0	Love this toy!  Friends of ours had this swing at their house and my daughter loved it so much we bought one for ours.  I never would have believed you could swing so well in a doorway!  It is incredibly sturdy amd my kids (ages 6-9) never tire from swinging!  It is a lifesaver for cold climates too where it is difficult to go outside sometimes and play...provides a great way to use up extra energy!
5.0	My children really loved this activity and having the board to place their designs is just perfect.  We took it to a restaurant and it kept them busy while we waited for the food.  My husband and I also enjoyed playing with our children.  Wikki Stix stimulates the imagination!!  Parents should give it a try.
5.0	I love love LOVE bouncy balls! When I was given a chance to test out these bouncy balls during a promotion I was EXTATIC! When I received them, I was amazed at how heavy this many bouncy balls are! My cats are soooo happy! We have a set of stairs – I gave them 6 bouncy balls and they keep going to the top of the stairs and dropping them off to watch them bounce. It makes me smile every time I hear one of the balls start bouncing. We will have bouncy balls for a LONG time, even if they tear them up quickly – which they haven’t even torn one up yet. The quality of these bouncy balls are better than a lot that I see out of the “gumball machines” at the different stores. These don’t fall in half like a lot of those do, they really seem put together very well.
5.0	I bought one of these for my daughter. it is a little plastic that looks exactly as pictured. It is not real!! It is a toy that doesn't even have any sort of programmed intelligence to avoid your foot when you are walking through a room in the dark - buyer beware.
5.0	My husband has been asking people to look for this game for him for at least five years.  He had a hand-made set that he thought someone had given him, but it turns out, it was &#34;on loan&#34; for several years.  We didn't even know what it was called when he first started asking for it, so I was thrilled when I found it on Amazon for Father's Day this year.  This product is beautifully crafted, and my husband loves it.  The only thing he has managed to come up with as a negative is that the dice are very light, so he likes to use acrylic dice to play, but he loves having the beautiful wooden dice for the set.
5.0	This is a huge figure. And for the price we are paying previously $100 USD. I would say this is so worth it. This item is high quality build. very nice plastic quality with Die cast feet and legs. The joints are also very tight. Paint job on this is also superb! Because of the antenna though. they seem fragile. It would have been appreciated if Bandai would include a 1/60 Beam Saber.<br /><br />PS:I think it only uses funnels and finger cannons in the Zeta Gundam Anime.<br /><br />I highly recommend this!
5.0	good product, as described
5.0	Really well made beautiful doll! My daughter absolutely loves her! I would purchase over again. Highly recommend if your child loves the Monster High Dolls.
5.0	"I'll be honest.... i bought this kitten for one reason..... i want to use him as reference for a sewing project(dont worry, i wont \\""dissect\\"" him!)<br />Well, my three year old son adores the kitty. he and his 5 yr old brother enjoyed pretending he was real, and made all the kitty type noises and of course made him talk and play games.<br />he's pretty durable too... makes a good \\""toss\\"" toy... as in toss him from one kid to the next and you dont have to worry about beans falling out.<br />Only thing i find wrong with this toy is the lack of whiskers. the picture shows them, but... mine has none. and i really dont mind as whiskers tend to get mangled over the years if they are played with as a toy should be.<br /><br />this would be a great toy for 3 and up kids....or younger if its supervised play(as in you are sitting there holding it and playing WITH the child and promptly put it away once playtime is over)"
5.0	Metal box. Bought for older child. Seems to be working up to standards. He does get a bit of ribbing from his military coworkers, though!
5.0	This was exactly what I was looking for. It came quickly and in perfect condition. What more could you ask for?
5.0	Bought this for my high school daughter. It is beautiful. Very sturdy and well constructed. Just enough pockets for all her stuff. She loves it. Didnt come ss fast as we would have liked. I think its shipped from overseas. Great price for exceptional quality. I have paid this price for junk. We shall see how it holds up but so far great! Definitely reccommend. She gets alot of compliments on it.
5.0	What can I say, if you are a diehard Whovian, you've got to have a sonic screwdriver. This one is not only an awesome prop, but comes with an invisible ink tip for hours of secret message fun. It's a terrific size -- feels good in the hand, and so accurate, even David Tennent couldn't say no.
5.0	Seven years and 2 kids later, still a favorite toy.
5.0	I got this for my bff boy turning 5 years old.  He told me that Bumblebee was his favorite Transformer.  Well, I definitely think that it was the hit of the party.  All the kids wanted to play with it.  The noise that the cannon makes when it transforms and when it shoots is very cool.  Kids can figure out how to use it without much direction.  My three year old knew exactly what to do with it, and he does not even know who the Tranformers are yet really.
5.0	My three year old son loves this TrackMasters Set.
5.0	Holy cow this shipped FAST! A whole week+ before expected date. Item is exactly like the image(color and location of the stripes and whatnot, for the cosplay anal), and size was great! My measurements were closer to a small with a few things close to a medium so I ordered a medium to be on the safe side(with Chinese sizes and all)  and it fits perfectly! The material is nice, it has mesh on the inside as well. And the best part? Pockets! Only iffy part of the experience was that it was a little pricier than my other options. But I needed this specific color so it's all good.
5.0	i bought the grumpy cat for my 22 month old grandson and he truly loves his grumpy cat.
5.0	This is more of a dice-rolling game than a board/card game, but I'd still recommend picking it up if you like board games in general. It may seem confusing and complicated at first ( like most board games), but turns out to be a pretty casual and relaxing game. Minimum of 2 players can play the game, but I'd say the game really shines with more than just 2 people.
5.0	I purchased this game because it was recommended when I was purchasing &#34;love Letter&#34; which is also a period card game. This turned out to be so much fun, we now play it way more then any of our other card games. Even my in-laws in their 70's enjoyed playing this game. The rules are easy to understand and it is slightly competitive. I would highly recommend.
5.0	I spent many a happy hour playing this game as a child - the hotels in this version are slightly different than the one I played, but the pricing and fee structure of each hotel are exactly the same as the older version.  I wanted something to drag my 6 and 9 year old kids away from Netflix, and this game did it.  They like it because it's a 3D board game - they get to place buildings on the board and then think strategically about where the best place is to put entrances.  The only downside that I've come across so far is that, once constructed, the hotels don't quite fit back in the box without having to dismantle a couple again - it's a bit like tetris trying to put the game away again.<br /><br />The game is conceptually similar to Monopoly, only the games are a whole lot quicker and more engaging for kids - which means it's also a whole lot less stressful for the parents.
5.0	Very well made!  It's great that both the seat and handlebars are height adjustable. Many of these balance bikes lack this feature.
5.0	Great quality, work perfectly.
5.0	My wife gave this to me for my birthday and I love it. It's a great way to keep my paints organized while I paint and I'm having a great time getting my army ready for it's first battle!
5.0	Joker has a vehicle to match Batman's! crash boom bang!<br />Great fun!
5.0	If you are a Domo and super heroes lover and love collecting Funko POP figures then I recommend you getting this one to complete your collection. They look amazing on my shelves.
5.0	This toy was given to my granddaughter for Christmas.   It was absolutely the best of all her numerous toys.  It is excellent for teaching eye/hand coordination.  Recommend this toy over and above anything else I have seen on the market.
5.0	My son got this for his third birthday.  He absolutely LOVES this game.  He loves other games as well (Candy Land, Chutes & Ladders), but he REALLY loves this game.  He could play it all day (and he usually has a VERY short attention span).  I like it too as there are less pieces to deal with (no cards to have scattered everywhere) and it's typically not a long game.    No wonder it won a parenting toy award.
5.0	Got one a few days ago,and i love it, very nice handling steady & challanging, i got the red&black one, same copter jus diff, color but all in all the v911,is a great fly, alot better than the dh,9116,.
5.0	Perfect! I bought this to use next to the pool as a much more cost friendly alternative to the &#34;pool basketball&#34; goals.
5.0	Muy bueno, de muy buena calidad<br />Very good, very good quality
5.0	My 2 year old son is obsessed with the Bubble Guppies and Puppy is his favourite character, but no products are available in England yet.<br />Well made, quick & very reasonable priced shipping and good communication. Would 100% recommend to all Bubble Guppies fans.<br />I cannot wait to see my boy's face on Christmas day!
5.0	Great fun and turns great, but as usual I'm stuck on the last layer :(
5.0	This is a great puzzle, and it is very well made.  My daughter started playing with it when she was about 18 months old.  Even though she couldn't always put the pieces in the correct spot, she still loved to play with them.  Now that she is 2 yrs old, and able to complete the puzzle with ease, she likes it even more.  I am trying to buy a puzzle rack to accommodate this and a few other Melissa and Doug chunky puzzles.  I hope they will fit.
5.0	Worked perfectly. Good product .
5.0	These are great for play with all the generic, compatible wooden tracks and train sets we have.  It's a favorite in our box of trains.  I carry them in my purse sometimes to keep little ones occupied when out and about.
5.0	These are just plain fun. Saw them being flown and sold at our local county fair recently. Bought 1 for $10. It was of slightly different construction with a Y shaped slingshot launcher, probably a newer revision. They both work well however i use the rubber band as a single strand rather than doubled as it comes in the package. They are kinda tricky for young ones to master launching, my grandson is about to turn 5, and some adults but they sure fly high when done properly. I went ahead and bought some here to have spares. the construction seems pretty good but like any toy its bound to break sooner or later but so far so good.
5.0	I bought this for my 5 year old niece and she loved it.  She was really excited about all of the pockets.
5.0	it was everything my daughter wanted, she loves it...she has autism and this is one of her favorite toys and if it can out stand her it is 100%
5.0	They were a very welcome gift for our nephews.
5.0	Excellent for the price of less than 5 dollars. It functions. The clip is a bit small for some radios like the Flysky. With radios that have a larger neck strap eye it works better. The adjustment is done by two folded straps that are somewhat difficult to manipulate without unspooling the strap from the adjuster loop. But most neck straps are $11.00 to $17.00, so for less than $5.00 this is perfect.
5.0	This is a Christmas gift and I expected the child to ge thrilled
5.0	I was very happy to see that this fits in with my son's other cars. How cool is this car?!
5.0	so random. easy to understand and perfect after a few drinks. best cards are probably the 'you are not allwoed to say' and 'battle'. write in a few more for added fun!<br /><br />the chaos pack does not feel like it adds much more. as the cards do not officially say 'or you lose' then you dont have to follow the rule. me and my friends love to argue rules so it adds fun for those who want to argue rules, not much for others
5.0	This is a great expansion for an amazing game. Definitely recommended! The instructions and pieces are of solid quality.
5.0	9-year-old grandson loves this and the car. Great for quiet play since it lights up.
5.0	Ordered this kitchen after researching and reading a ton of reviews for durability!  It was purchased for a busy home childcare program.  Five busy little people playing with it daily so it had to be a tough one.  So far the only thing I have had to reinforce was the fridge door hinges, just screwed them all back in tighter!!  It is definitely heavy so no fear of them scooting it all over the room which I LOVE!!  I am very satisfied so far with this purchase, well worth the money spent.
5.0	This is a cute Rudolph pillow pet. It met my standards as far as soft and sweet. It came earlier than promised. I thought the price was fair given it's limited availability and the fact that I really didn't want to brave malls at Christmas time to find one. I wanted something a little different for my tot and that's what I got. Happy with the experience.
5.0	I liked the price, and my child loves the toy. The Serafina Fijit was just what we both were looking for.
5.0	I wish I could give this a 10 out of 5 lol!<br /><br />This lego is one of the coolest legos I have ever seen or built!<br /><br />You can convert it into any of the 3 cars from the 3 movies. The doors can be moved up and down, and the steering wheel is adjustable.<br /><br />It includes 401 pieces; so easy and fun to build. A CLASSIC!.
5.0	It was an experience to get my daughter involved in the online auction world and then to have such a positive experience was great.
5.0	the pieces fit well, there was a little extra challenge to this one that I enjoyed, and the picture made you wish it was summer.
5.0	For the price it works great,video not bad,it flys over 100 yards.
5.0	I ordered this for my daughter and she was so surprised that I got it for her.  She loved it and it is now in her china closet so everyone can see it, but no one can touch it.
5.0	Purchased for the family to put together.  It did take weeks, but we only worked on it here and there.  It is definitely something that takes time as it is very intricate.  Very pleased!
5.0	A great item for a great price.....
5.0	My grandchildren love to play with these toys and it keeps them busy when they come over to visit for the day.
5.0	My grandsons absolutely love the WowWee animals.  I purchased two because I felt that one would be fought over and I was right.  I should have gotten more since I have 5 grandsons and they all love them.  A real hit.
5.0	I have recently purchased this unit for my family. It is loads of fun and hard to get my kids off it, which believe me is actually good. we had a plastic version of this, and was not worth the few dollars we spent on it. This metal unit is actually is heavy and feels just like the ones in the arcades.
5.0	I ordered this item for my great-niece because she loved crafts and doing things.  She liked it a lot.  Thanks
5.0	Our girls love all the different Spot It games, but this one is clearly their favorite.  There's something about animals that make a game even more fun!
5.0	Ordered the table runners for my party, I had them laminated and they worked just great.  Since I did laminate them I can use them over and over.  We got lots of kudos on our table decorations!  Thanks
5.0	These are great, they're the same size as the OEM battery so there's no balancing issues.  The only real downside is that you now have to charge 5 batteries but the added flight time is fantastic.  Instead of going outside and flying around for 5-10 minutes and then finding something else to do for an hour while your battery recharges, you can fly for a half hour or more before you need to recharge.  The only downside is that it takes several hours to charge all the batteries after you're done.
5.0	I used these as cake toppers for my sons birthday. Then he got to keep them as toys. He loved them!
5.0	"[[VIDEOID:5483bfc671c0cca66555045d6a5fff1d]] This bear is so soft as soon as you open the package you cant help but hug it. The fur is made of that super soft and thick material that feels like it's made of silk. It even has a beautiful sheen to it. It's a good size bear too. I thought he might actually be smaller, but he big and cuddly. The big heart he's holding is covered in shiny sequins, with the words I Love Mom embroidered on it. There's even additional embroidering on the bear's feet.<br /><br />The whole bear is done in white, pink and red, and he's stuffed really well. Very thick and pump, and made with plush materials. When you press his hand he plays music. I'm not absolutely certain what the song is. It sounds similar to Auld Lang Syne. However the information on the bear says it's called \\""The Love Song\\"". I've added some video to my review with the song playing so you can hear it yourself. While the music is playing, the cheeks of the bear light up and glow which is really cute.<br /><br />If you're looking for a big cuddly bear for mom for Mother's Day, this is a really cute one. It's not cheap feeling at all. It feels well made and is really cuddly. I had thought it would be a cute gift for my own mother, however my daughter has already ran off with it and said it's way too cuddly for her to part with. She says she thinks grandma (my mother) will understand. ;)<br /><br />Sample provided fore review"
5.0	It is hard for me to decide if I like her or Madeline Hatter best from this EAH line.  The dress is gorgeous, the colors just pop!  Little details are hidden in the print of the dress and are a delightful to discover.  She has the most darling little hat and her hair is so pretty.  The shoes for EAH are also rich in details which makes this line of toys so enjoyable. She has a tea pot and tea cup and is all ready to join her friends for a party.
5.0	My kids love this game. Their friends had it, so they purchased it to have it for themselves now there is a game at each house
5.0	Our daughter wanted a fox stuffed animal for a gift for a friend.  I was hesitant to purchase one online, but didn't have much choice!  This is a wonderful stuffed animal.  Soft & cuddly and seems to be made well.
5.0	Got this for a really great price. Love the game in general. Good to play with friends. Can be addictive and the tides turn really quickly so pay attention!
5.0	The Ticket to Ride games are great family fun.
5.0	Great family game my wife and I have played it with our kids quite a bit since we got it
5.0	It is cute but  I need to get it I will name her.....<br />It it is so cute!! I will love her
5.0	Just like a real butterfly. Attention getting.
5.0	Bought this for my daughter for school. She uses it everyday and loves it.  Bit pricey but worth it if she is happy .
5.0	First thing my husband said when he opened it was how nice the product seemed. Once it was together that statement still held true. Great product. Instructions were easy to understand. My daughter and all her friends love the kitchen. So much nicer than the plastic ones you see.
5.0	MUCH FUN FOR MY FAMILY AND ME. THE CARS NEEDED FRESHENING UP, BUT WELL WORTH THE PRICE I PAID. RECOMMENDED.
5.0	better up close than in the picture
5.0	My granddaughter loved the piano.  She squealed with delight!
5.0	This item is a huge hit with daycare children, they love building different structures and I will be adding more to this set. I like playing with it myself.
5.0	Awesome kit. Hours of fun. You get 1000 tiny little single block shaped pieces in multiple colors plus a board to attach them to. What is good about this kit is you can use regular legos on it too. This kit offers hours of fun. These little blocks are perfect for making pictures out of. There is instructions that come in this kit on how to download a picture and convert into a mosaic. These pieces can be used over and over or if your like me you like to create and save so I use clear glue to smear over the top so the pieces don't go anywhere. I'm going to get more of these to give as Christmas gifts to my kids.<br />I got this product at a discount in exchange for my unbiased review.
5.0	My daughter 4 loves these mermaids.  They are small and cute and fit well in her hands.  I like that they do not have strands of hair to tangle.  She loves that there are 7 of them to play with, so they talk to each other and go on adventures ect...  They do not float and make fun diving toys.
5.0	Our grandchildren love these things.highly recommend Thanks
5.0	I sent this toy to my three grandchildren aged 1, 3 and 5. They all found ways to play with it on different levels. The one-year-old likes filling the baskets then dumping the contents out on the floor. The three year old likes sorting games. The five year old likes running a farmers market and selling produce. The enclosed instructions also provide other ideas for educational games. The produce is quite realistic, and made of good quality plastic. Great toy overall.
5.0	very good quality. sturdy material, nice size!<br />comes with a patch in case you tear it, but it;s very unlikely you will!
5.0	I am converting my HO railroad from Railcommand, an older DCC system, to the current standard.  I needed several decoders, and settled on this one.  2 of my older locos have destroyed the NCE unit, but most work perfectly.  Be sure your loco has a modern can motor.
5.0	My daughter loves the baby doll. She kisses and hugs it all the time. I've priced other baby dolls and some are less expensive but they're not as cute and cuddly.
5.0	Great birthday gift for my grandson.
5.0	Originally received one of these as a gift.  Now as they wear out I always get another one.  Not always available in stores.
5.0	These bags are strong, flexible and are perfect for keepng books dust-free, fingerprint-free, and clean. I use lots of them and will continue to do so.
5.0	This was a gift for a little girl who's eyes lit up when she saw it. She grabbed and didn't let go. That's 5 stars to me.
5.0	Great product, great price
5.0	Granddaughter loves it. Was easy to assemble. Good quality
5.0	This is an adorable, well made toy!  I love that it is made from recycled plastic, and it is dishwasher safe!!
5.0	This is awesome and cool.It's weapons are its claw arm and the electro-rocket which can shoot.AND you can put any kind of Toa inside this suit of armor.Very awesome.
5.0	This is very, very good! I hope like this toy if you bought it. Charlie, Age 6
5.0	We got this as a Christmas present. Because of the negative reviews on here we thought of possibly returning it without even trying it out. Thankfully we did try and we love it. My 4 yr old wants to play it all the time. Everything works on it. Yes pumping the head down might be a little hard for a very young child but it really doesn't take that much pressure to do it. Can't understand why so many people are having problems with it.  As I am typing this my 4 yr old wants to play it again. My 6 yr old also has a lot of fun with this game.
5.0	Each year during the Halloween season, I'll go on a hunt for plush toys that suit the season and this year there were a couple in the Ty Beanie Boos range that fit the bill. Ty Beanie Boo Moonlight is a cute black cat with bright orange and black tinted eyes that gleam with mischief. He is plain adorable and together with Swoops the Bat, has captured my daughter's heart. She takes them with her when we go out and loves snuggling with them both. Ty Beanie Boos are cute and cuddly friends that are sure to delight children.
5.0	My grand-daughter loved it.  I feel lucky to have gotten this item at such a good price.  I probably would not have bought it otherwise.
5.0	Great quality, I got it for a friend of mine, and he really liked it.
5.0	All the cubes are very good and are made of high quality plastic. They turn very well, very smoothly. Among the four cubes i would rate the 4x4x4 cube slightly below the others because its slightly 'rattle'y and loose. The others cubes are phenomenal. Would definitely recommend this bundle to anybody looking for stickerless cubes.
5.0	my grandson loves it. runs around on track, kitchen floor, or carpet with no probs
5.0	I have a very active son with autism. He loves water and water guns. I have bought alot of water guns and they all end up broken or taken apart. This water gun has lasted. It is easy for him to refill, shoots far and he has a ton of fun with it. It costs a bit more but well worth it considering all the money I spent on ones that ended up broken.
5.0	This puzzle turns out to be so much fun for not only my daughter, but her cousin too. It's big enough for them to work on together and not argue about it! My daughter is four so she's not extra careful when putting together ,or taking apart the pieces. With other puzzles this results in some tearing. Not with this one though. The pieces are nice and thick and sturdy, but they still fit together easily so there is no frustration. We love it!
5.0	I got this as gift for my daughter from my brother in law. I don't keep a puppy home so it was a blast for my daughter. Fur is soft and nice to touch. FYI if your puppy doesn't flip over well, check the instructions under the box on how to correct it. The only downside is it constantly barks and never stops. It will continue to bark until Aliens invade our globe.
5.0	U needed this and perfect condition
5.0	My son loves his raptor
5.0	I got this for my sixteen year old daughter & she loves it. Pink is her favorite color. I would recommend this for ALL females.
5.0	Bought this item for vacation , very good for the price
5.0	these were the right size to hang out side. would purchase more next time
5.0	Beautiful set with finely crafted pieces with nice details.
5.0	After looking at numerous lighter weight plastic tea sets and porcelain tea sets, I finally found Green Toys version and it is well worth the price!
5.0	I like having stuff around my house that people can pick up and play with.  They know they will be severly beaten for fooling with my musical instruments, so this provides an outlet for itchy fingers.  It is basically a non-electric lava lamp, that you turn over like a sand filled hour glass.  I was lucky (you get no choice of color) I received one with a deep raspberry (my favorite) colored goo. They make a smaller version, but this one catches the light nicely.
5.0	Great time putting this together with my grandchildren.
5.0	Easy to use.  The baby loves it too.
5.0	When I receive this item I couldn't believe the quality so cute
5.0	Kept my 2 year old happy during a 3 hour plane ride!
5.0	This doll is a lovely addition to the Barbie Island Princess collection. Her dress, appearance, and song are equal in quality to the Princess Rosella doll. My 3 yr old daughter loves to make them all interact with each other, just like in the movie.
5.0	Much better game then apples to apples.  Truly sees if you know the others playing the game or learn things about them.
5.0	My two year old loves this cozy coupe!  She wants to go on a walk every night so she can ride along in it.  It seems to be sturdy and fits her perfectly.
5.0	I used organic chemical free markers for my toddler's first years but they are much more expensive and with less choice of colors. Now that she's old enough not to put them in her mouth, those do the job quite well!
5.0	Very cool for young boys.  Includes a motion detector, invisible ink pen and other &#34;spy gear.&#34; Great for boys and girls, even adults will want to play with it!
5.0	I think it is really a cute toy.  The Grand daughter will love it. Arrived on  time and<br />packed safely;
5.0	When my grandson open his gift and saw this vest we could not get it off of him, he even slept with it Christmas Eve. He loves it and it has been a part of his wardrobe since Christmas.
5.0	My granson LOVES this!
5.0	This was a good toy, my daughter was able to learn how to skate.<br />. . . . . .
5.0	This version of Venus McFlytrap is so cute & I adore that she brings her eco-punk style into her Ghoul Spirit uniform! Her hair, as always, is gorgeous and in my opinion, Venus has one of the most beautiful face molds in the Monster High line. From a collector's point of view, my advice is to pick up this ghoul! Great purchase, very reasonably priced, arrived sooner than expected.
5.0	Purchased this when they first came out for my son and daughter for Christmas.  They loved them.  They were 2 and 3 when they got them.  My 2 year old was possibly a bit young because he had just turned 2, but he quickly learned his way around it.  It's very user friendly and my kids even now still play them and they are 5 and 6.  Just got my 2 1/2 year old one for Christmas and he LOVES it.  Games are great and there a number of options and applications.
5.0	adorable - quality iyem
5.0	We ordered a Tween size extra large for my daughter who is 11, but very tall for her age.  It fits her perfectly, but she is very slender, so I would say if in doubt, order a size up.  The quality is pretty good compared to many similar costumes I've seen at Target, etc.  The seams were finished and tidy, no holes, everything draped like it was supposed to.  I would recommend this costume, it's very bright and colorful.
5.0	Very cool ship. Looks great in my collection.
5.0	Fast delivery-faster than any vendor in recent memory.  The system is to replace an older model of a Coby system I have (which is still working but not mp3 compatible).  An excellent product for the money.
5.0	Adorable and lasted long. I loved that all the characters were included in the sheet of tattoos. Great gift idea.
5.0	fun game for family game night for adults
5.0	The little Laugh-A-Lot Care Bear is adorable.  The grandchildren, four and seven, love to collect care bears. They are left at our house for something special when they visit.
5.0	Awesome. Kids loved it.
5.0	Finally, someone made figures from the kickass anime tekkaman blade. i watched this religiously along with the ronin warriors cartoon and now after a good 20 years i have Tekkaman Evil!!! Excellent sculpt, that's dead on accurate, comes with multiple hand parts and an alternate &#34;awake&#34; head(if you seen the cartoon it makes sense) He comes with his signature lance, that splits apart and can even be posed with his tek-buster pose(again makes sense if you seen the show). The only thing is the figure feels fragile, so be careful and i would say the price is high, but when compared with bandi's line of tekkaman figures, the price is right. If your a fan of the show this is a must buy along with Tekkaman Blade.
5.0	Great deal on a durable and accurate model.  My son can get a closer look at the details of this aircraft but still play with it unlike a model I would build.
5.0	This game is great! Sometimes frustrating, like when it asks you to draw a concept instead of an item, but if you have a good group of people it's easy to laugh off. It's now my favorite party game!
5.0	fast shipping and product came exactly as stated. Wonderful gift.
5.0	Very simple to out together and hours of fun. Three small children have played with this roughly for over a month and it has held up well
5.0	My grandson of two loved it and the the one of 4 even more ! Tibbie de Wet
5.0	A cute small lego set that will be a nice inexpensive addition to a little girls lego collection.  Seller was amazing and shipped it very quickly.  Very happy, thanks!
5.0	My 18 month old son LOVES his dino!  We introduced a sleep lovey to get him to settle in for sleep and sleep through the night.  We give him &#34;dino&#34; during reading time then he lays in his bed with him.
5.0	I grew up watching the original Yugioh Series with duelist kingdom and battle city so i've always wanted the egyptian god cards. For only $10 this card is well worth it even though it says it can't be used in a duel. I don't even play the card game anymore but it's still nice to look at like a collectors item.
5.0	Great game! Can't wait to play it at our next game night!
5.0	Daughter love the game
5.0	I am a bit disappointed in the &#34;glow level&#34; but frankly, they last 8h plus. For the money I paid, I am super happy.
5.0	I love her she is a nice part of my collection i wish she came with more than one face plat
5.0	Perfect for toddler puppet show combined w finger puppet doggies. Kiddies played with over and over. Puppets still in good shape
5.0	We got this as a gift for my brother since he doesn't have any games at his house. This was a great purchase. It's easy to learn, fun, and doesnt take too long. We play this often when we go over there, and it's better than sitting around watching TV.
5.0	Perfect size for beginning soccer player. He's 3 and my daughter is 13 and it's perfect size for both of them and it's pretty sturdy. We didn't use the ball it came with. Too small and flimsy.
5.0	It goes well in a gateless guardian and angelic armaments. Beefing up gateless guardian with card and angelic armaments is my plan.
5.0	"Recently, I started to become a TPIR Fan by noticing how clever and creative the games on the show has become.  Add the fun with contestants, a host, and prizes, its why TPIR is still on CBS for 34 years. <br /> <br />You'll miss the comfort of interaction with Bob Barker, but considering that TPIR has not had any video game since a terrible 90 Commodor 64 game, this DVD came at the right time  <br />when DVD's are added to the board game (no computer needed). <br /> <br />The game is complete with 6 whiteboards, 4 markers to write down the total prices. <br /> <br />They couldn't put all 40+ games they have done, but I love these games:  5 Price Tags, Cliff Hangers, Danger Price, Golden Road, Grand Game, Lucky 7, Most Expensive, Pass The Buck, Plinko, Push Over, Safe Crackers, and Shell Game. <br /> <br />Also, you can bid on Contestant Row's Products, spin Showcase Showdown's wheel, and compete in the final round selecting multiple choice to be \\""closer than the actual retail price without going over!\\"" <br /> <br />*Pro:  Easy set up, still shots of real products, great 3D view of the game show set, fun games that anyone can play, host explains instructions, play any part of the show, add a few video clips from the show, and 3D views of these games!  All the wonderful music, graphics, and models are from the show! <br /> <br />*Con:  Can't control the speed of the wheel, Todd Newton's voice and some of the price results are displayed too fast, different annoucners are used (Rich Fields, Rod Rodey, and Burton Richardson), and I've heard from others about control function problems.  Finally, Bob Barker's not in it, although they hired Todd Newton, a great replacement. <br /> <br />Overall, this can be taken to a party with a DVD player, and everyone can play it with no set up.  Although it's the first version, remember that a DVD can only contain so much and they certainally put a lot of effort into this game!  I'd rather play this type of game on a TV, than installing a PC Game that may even still stall, or play TPIR's complex board game where someone has to read all the instructions before hand and know how to set up the game pieces, taking a lot of time."
5.0	My 18 month old loves this Bumblebee Potato Head. I agree that they are higher priced currently, as you can get these from big retailers for $4-$6 in many different styles. $6 would be for a twin pack(two characters one spud).<br />  Before you buy, know that they are tiny compared to normal Mr. Potato Heads, but the interchangeable pieces are large enough that my 18month old would not be able to swallow them. An advantage to the size..the kids will add these into the mix with their other action figures! They fit right in with toys like the Transformer RescueBots. BONUS!<br /> Jaxon doesn't talk a lot, but on day two of playing he started saying &#34;Bubba Bee&#34;! My three year old also likes these so much that I had to put our first one on the shelf and buy a second to avoid some major fights. They don't do that very often, and have been learning sharing, but this toy just has something that REALLY appeals to them both.<br />  We have only had this guy for a couple of weeks, but the material they are made out of is that durable/slightly flexible stuff that the original Spuds parts are made out of, and the body is still the harder plastic. The face and ears are small, and permanently attached very well.  I tried to break an ear off and couldn't, or I would not allow a toddler to use it.  A set of these is going in their stockings for Christmas. That's a no-brainer.
5.0	we used these in a parade on a float.  Really cute.<br />would order them again if we have the need for them.<br />Fast Delivery too.
5.0	This is a great addition to my Star Wars Funko Pop! collection! First one I received came in a little damaged but Amazon made it good like always!
5.0	Proper size, nice and neat
5.0	K'Kruhk is a fan favorite and is certainly an interesting character. Overall, with one big exception, Hasbro did him justice. The figure is beautifully sculpted and painted. The figure has the majesty of a cross between a lion and a Jedi. He stands very well, which is perhaps surprising given his top-heavy bulk.<br /><br />Unfortunately, due to his popularity, this guy is expensive on the secondary market. I'd say if you're a fan of the character, it'll be worth the price.<br /><br />There is a big problem with this figure. As you can see in the photo, K'Kruhk doesn't have his freaking sweet hat. This is a MAJOR fail on Hasbro's part. Why not hat? The figure is awesome enough that I won't dock the rating, but this should not have happened. If you do get this figure, I'd recommend getting the Ages of Action Ninja Tateoka Muneyoshi Unimax and using the figure's hat. It's a close enough match and fits pretty well.
5.0	Bought this for my 8 year old granddaughter, and she loved it - especially the little jewel and bright embroidery.
5.0	These are fun. My fianc&eacute;e loves them!!
5.0	My grand daughter absolutely loves it! I couldn't have asked for better! Dress arrived earlier than excepted and material is better than what you will get at costume stores around town. Material is very soft! It was hard for me not to tell grand daughter what her gift was  but I managed not to say anything until party day. She opened mine first. Thanks for all your hard work and there are people out here who do appreciate it!
5.0	Our grand kids love these!  They are so much fun!  And the shafts are nice and long so the kids won't get burned.  We highly recommend these!
5.0	•:*¨¨*:•.♥♥BRILLIANT.•:*¨¨*:•.5 STAR •:*¨¨*:•.THANK YOU!!♥♥.•:*¨¨*:
5.0	It's a great board game.  A game the whole family can enjoy.  We opened it up and played it over the holidays.  Everyone got involved. If you like playing trivia type games, but with a competitive atmosphere, this game it the trick.
5.0	The wagon took about 15 minutes to assemble and it was ready to go. The directions it came with are a bit strange, but just carefully read what it is saying and you will be fine. The most likely mistake you will make will probably be facing the metal arms on the front wheels the wrong way, but that is easily fixable. This is a fun alternative to always using the stroller when you go out for a walk, and the kid(s) love being able to look all around. This was bought as a first birthday gift (in pink) and she loves it.<br /><br />It is also fairly easy to clean up. We took it with us when we went pumpkin picking and it got very dirty. Just hose it down and you are good to go. If you don't have a hose, or it's not messy enough for that, paper towels and windex work fine too.<br /><br />The wagon feels pretty stable when pulling it, but just watch for bumps. The passengers will definitely feel them.
5.0	The most beautiful AA medallion I have ever seen.  It has great depth, clarity, definition and color.  It is distinctive and classy without being in the least ostentatious.  The workmanship is perfection.  I have already ordered another one for a friend and that is the highest praise I can offer.  If you want a coin to match the caliber of the recipient, get this one.
5.0	Very soft and cute.  Maybe a little small, but my child lives it and sleeps with it every night. That's what matters most.
5.0	Put it together in about 5 mins.  Instructions were great and it flew very well.  Beautiful design.  Great bang for the buck also.
5.0	Best doll I've ever seen
5.0	this figure is really fantastic, great colors, great details, pants are real, you must have this beautiful figure in your collection, what are you waiting??
5.0	My daughter thought this doll was awesome. All parts complete, arrived with no flaws.
5.0	This is a great, fun way to learn about herbs and wild foods, not only for kids but parents too! The cards are well illustrated and can be used to play match as well or used in other ways. A friend and I used them to do a little activity for our homeschool co-op. Identifying the plants in our property and locating problem cards to match the plants we have on our property. Many ways you can edit the game to fit your needs and have more fun or to suit your child's needs. It is a cooperative game so it's not about winning or loosing but about working together and racing to beat the end of the day. The more people you have the harder it actually is because you hit more moon spaces so it is more challenging to get home before dark.  My kids are 6 and 9 and have been playing this for a few years now and they still love it and it changes for them each time they play. I use herbs to heal and nourish our bodies so my children are able to relate to this game since birth. They understand how important these plants are to our healing.<br /><br />Also a GREAT companion book for this would be [[ASIN:1885003366 Kid's Herb Book, A: For Children of All Ages]] it has lots of GREAT recipes and remedies for kids that many even kids can do themselves...the book is SUPERB and has great go to lists in the back for glossary, first aid etc... It is so great for families beginning with herbs and plant allies or to use as a curriculum in your homeschool. A wonderful resource to make the game a great adjunct to learning about herbs.
5.0	They were a big hit!!!
5.0	Bought for the kids, mom and dad  frequently play with as it is super fun
5.0	Went well with Thomas Train Tent.
5.0	Item was perfect, I miss the old style buttons.
5.0	My grand daughter loves it.  I wanted to get both of my twin grand daughters different Elmo backpacks because they needed them for day care.  They LOVE Elmo!!  It is adorable.
5.0	Works better than the original, actually created a tunnel affect at one point so my husband had to go out and adjust things.....really moving water much faster than last one!
5.0	My nephew kept re-enacting the bit from Cars 2 when Finn McMissile would turn into a submarine, so I'd hoped to find this toy and voila! Here it was. Works as advertised, nephew loved it!
5.0	I have purchased (3) A/C Adapter's for all (3) of my grandchildren.  All (3) of my grandchildren L O V E them like any of Amazon's purchases love them.  You can save on batteries and this can be used for both Leapster Explorer & LeapFrog.
5.0	This doll is very pretty and her hair washes up beautifully. (don't use a blow dryer on heat though) We have had many dolls w/ hair that eventually gets trimmed shorter and shorter because it's so snarled and tangled.  This one is different.  In fact the box states you can machine wash/air dry her if you put her in a pillow case.  I am told the Gotz company made the original mold and dolls for the Pleasant Co. (American Girl Doll) which eventually led to their own factory and this doll is made with an identical scale mold so she fits all of their clothing and accesories.  The thing my own daughter likes best is that she doesn't have two front teeth showing (the American Girl doll trademark)
5.0	My grandson requested several Lego Technic sets for his birthday; this was one of them.  So I got it for him, and he was delighted.  It's a small set, but he will use it in combination with other sets so it was a complete success.
5.0	My 3 year old, who is a Spiderman fan, loves making this puzzle. It has large colorful pieces which work very well for him. In addition to Spiderman it features Spider-Woman, The Green Goblin, The Vulture, Electro and Doctor Octopus.
5.0	I bought this for my husband, it was great quality and very sturdy and a lot heavier than I expected, which is good. It look great too, Ron's features were clear and well done. My husband loves it.
5.0	"These are clear when blown up.  Very very pretty if you're looking for a snow themed balloon.  I used these in a retirement party snow themed event.  Used air instead of helium and made a \\""balloon chandelier\\"".  Didn't lose a one while inflating.  Inflated to true size stated of 11\\"" and has stayed for 5 days and still holding.  This vendor had nice shipping time... First class USPS  (I think).  I just remembering them getting here fast."
5.0	These stilts are great fun for kids of all ages.  We got them for Christmas and kids from the ages of 5 to 11 love them.  they learn quickly how to balance themselves.
5.0	The balloons came before expectancy. They were in Peppa Pig packaging. Very professional.
5.0	Grandson loved this, recommend an area where they can run this without obstructions for the full effect.
5.0	cool card and nice to have dont really have much else to say but you know you should really pick it up
5.0	My seven year old son picked this set out as a reward for his helping me shovel snow. He took his time to build this set in about two hours. It is unique as it is more abstract than linear. It really looks like a mountain with a mine entrance when it was finished. It came with five mini figures that were very intricate and well designed. It had other nice features such as a moving mine cart and a pully with a basket that can hold the mini figures. The proce was dead on and I thought it was a bargain for under $50 considering what most licensed sets go for these days. The most important thing is that my so loves it and was so proud of his build that he took it in for &#34;show and tell&#34; and received praises from his teachers and peers on how cool his set was. I would not hesitate to receommend this set to another Lego loving family but I can't say that about the movie....
5.0	Odd rating this as a toy (!) when it's actually a pint glass!!  But have given high rating as was just what I was after.<br />Ordered this from Amazon USA as couldnt find one anywhere in the UK for a birthday pressie - arrived 2 days after friends birthday, but that wasn't a problem, it was well packaged and arrved safe and sound, my friend was chuffed to bits that I'd managed to find one as she is a Big Bang Theory Fan!
5.0	I don't have the product, but I would like to ask a question. I'm thinking about turning my scx10 crawler into a Ford raptor, but I can never find a crawling body, there all for race rigs. I was wondering if this would fit nicely, or at all.
5.0	They are easy to spin and look great.<br /><br />The DVD tutorial that comes with these babies is also very good.<br /><br />The poi are soft and don't hurt when they whack me and others.<br /><br />Higher quality than other LED poi out there.
5.0	Awesome figure but check Toysrus first. Wanted these figures desperately but I didn't wanna buy them on Amazon because I thought the prices were kinda ridicules for one figure. Went to Toysrus to do some Christmas shopping and to my surprise they had these awesome figures next to the TMNT cartoon stuff. I found Bebop & Rocksteady there and got both for bout $20 each.
5.0	Works great, good quality, my son loves it!
5.0	I have an 8 year old girl who like many is obsessed with Monster High. Catty Noir is one of MY favorites. She is so pretty. The price was nice too.
5.0	"Very awesome toy. His \\""skin\\"" is a soft, durable latex like material. There are touch sensors on his head, left side, right side, front, and back. So when you poke him he'll turn and face up to see you. In dance mode he has a few different dance styles to choose from by tapping on his head. My kids love this thing!  It was a huge hit at a birthday party."
5.0	Cars also work with Neo Tracks from Mindscope.
5.0	Fantastic learning tool for a toddler.  My son learned all the words and plays with them in the bath.<br />Great concept !!
5.0	loves it; 13 month girl loves it totally, learns she can put finger in door and it lights up and makes noises
5.0	This item exceeded our expectations.  The description was accurate and good quality.  I do wish it had been either postal wrapped or arrived in a brown box as the recipent of the gift found the box.
5.0	My son has all of these from his game on his leap pad ultra. I plan on ordering more of the accessories
5.0	I love Suzy Zoo stuff...use them in scrapbooking and on packages I send.
5.0	I resisted this once pricey toy given the large number of low ratings. My daughter read them as well. She still pursued us to buy it and my husband relented. My daughter loves it and plays with it a lot even after weeks. Her friends are glued too and they have together made crayons and more recently - the rings using the expansion. Some of the rings aren't fully molded, but she is determined to figure out how to make them whole. Don't know if its because we didn't have enough crayon or if the chips aren't small enough. All in all, it's a good product for patient kids who can wait for the end product as they play.
5.0	"I think that, originally, his title on the package was supposed to be \\""Ruthless Leader of the Evil Horde\\"", I guess Mattel just didn't get around to fixing it in time.  But honestly, who cares!?  We finally have the frontman and driving force of the Horde (we all know Horde Prime is the big kahuna of the Horde, but since he plays Emperor to Hordak's Vader, Hordak is the one really managing things)!  Just when I thought Hordak wouldn't and couldn't get any cooler than his 2002 mini-bust and staction figure, the Classics figure came along and it is sick!  The detail and sculpting on the entire figure is awesome, especially the cape, staff, head and armor; not to mention boots.  He's one of my favorites in the bad guys so far and I can't wait for other Horde members.  This is a great figure, and the Classics style really shines through with him.  Hordak comes complete with Magik Staff (which looks way cooler than Skeletor's Havoc Staff, hard as that is for me to admit), red Imp (not to be confused with Imp, beloved Filmation character), vintage Crossbow (it's very detailed, really amping up the gargoyle theme) and Removable Armor."
5.0	Bought for spare looks like a good belt!
5.0	Great toolbox for a sweet 4 year old!!
5.0	My grandson loves his Bow Blaster.  Thought it was the best gift next to his bike!!!
5.0	I love this Barbie. She is totally cute and retro all in one. I got her during the 50th anniversary week at the special anniversary price. A great addition to my growing collection.
5.0	Loved this right out of the box! Such a fun little dinosaur, great color and pattern. Grandson just loved it, great addition to collection or as a first pillow pet.
5.0	So I'm not a Pokemon fan. I bought this for a craft project I was making for a friend of mine who is a HUGE fan. It was a hit with her and she squealed like a school girl/fan girl. The craft project went over well too but the big hit was the Pikachu.<br /><br />I would not buy this again for me. But if you're a pokemon fan, by all means.<br /><br />Good quality product.
5.0	nice hat and arrived earlier then expected!
5.0	It's a TF. 5 stars says it all!!
5.0	This is our 3rd &#34;shuffler&#34;, this one from another manufacturer. The first two arrived with an extra crank. All four of the cranks eventually broke.<br /><br />The current model came with only one crank. Time will tell how good the One & Only crank holds up.
5.0	My daughter has slept with &#34;wormy&#34; every night for many years.  WE LOST WORMY!  Thank goodness this little guy was an exact replacement and was brand new!
5.0	It's Zetman, just as in the book and anime, in a great packaging, and a good quality figure. Recommended for collectors and fans.
5.0	Just as described. Cute little learning toy.
5.0	My son loves this doll.
5.0	The ducks are cute. I really ordered them because my granddaughter collects them, but they would make a great counting tool for younger kids or a very cute duck pond game.
5.0	Great minis, amazing detail!
5.0	Bought this to have at the house for our granddaughter. She was able to sit by herself the first time she played with it and she was totally fascinated with it. This visit, at a year, she still played with it constantly. She loved pulling up on it and the toy is very sturdy. It was such a hit, that I ordered one for her to have in her own home. Highly recommend this toy. It was a hugh success!!
5.0	I got this for my great nephew but his 20 month old sister has taken it over.  They love the crackling sound it makes. It is very well made and very age appropriate. Great for grasping and the colors really keep their eyes on it.   Love it.
5.0	A new favorite!  A fun length and soft and cuddly!
5.0	This hat was a great addition to the preschool dress-ups and it was popular with the boys as well as the girls.
5.0	Better than expected.  Came on time.
5.0	I love this doll! It is simple, but accurate and it's very cute and soft. I sleep with it every night, it's my favorite teddy bear :) (despite not being a bear at all!)
5.0	I have this sitting at my desk and I have ppl comment on it all day and even take pictures of it.
5.0	So cute my daughter loves him
5.0	My little joke teller loves this.  He uses it to entertain us all.  The lights and canned clapping......couldn't have designed it any better except to make it a little louder.
5.0	Since I was expecting pinkish colors (thank you other reviewer), I wasn't surprised. The zipper and rim of the hood are really bright pink, but the pockets are darker. The fabric is so SOFT. The outside and the inside...<br /><br />I felt so awesome putting this on. Some part of me wants to get blood on it (jk) to see what would happen.
5.0	We didn't actually play with this game since we bought it as a gift; however, it arrived on time and in great condition.
5.0	This was a perfect care package for my college daughter during finials!  The entire dorm loved it!  It relived the stress during study breaks and did not lose buoyancy at all for over 6 months!  It had to be deflated when she moved out of the dorm.  She says it was the best gift ever!
5.0	My 7 yrs. old grandson loved the kinetic sand.  It is a great concept.  Even the adults enjoyed playing with it.
5.0	Was perfect, came fast, and was the hit! Halloween was great. Great price and couldn't find it anywhere else!
5.0	Let me guess, the name got your first, right? Me too. Well, this really is a case of what you see is what you get. My game group has played this three nights running (and plan to keep at it), which is virtually unheard of among this diverse and hard-to-please bunch. If you like edge-of-your-seat type games, you've come to the right place. If you're not fully alert, forget about it.  It won't take you long to guess an answer...quite the contrary. We're talking about mere seconds here since the expressions, cliches, sayings, phrases are extremely familiar. We use them every minute of every hour of every day. That one word is missing should cause a momentary pause at most. No, the problem is that this is also one of those Say-It-First games so, you guessed it, you need to be faster than everybody else or you get zilch. Let me restate that so there's no misunderstanding: you must be Super-Fast, along warp-speed lines. I kid you not. Each card has four questions, so you get four chances to spare your blushes. Or, better yet, the chance to win all four questions and sweep the round. But don't count on doing that often, especially if there are many people playing. You won't always be the quickest. But you'll always have fun.
5.0	Great gift for the world of warcraft game player! This was a gift for my son and he likes it!
5.0	Si bien es un juguete, para los que no son niños seguramente les gustara ya que buen adorno para los que somos recien fans de TRON Legacy y que sin lugar a dudas luce bien en donde se le ponga.
5.0	Great variety for the children in my 3 year old class to use.
5.0	Great color, matched the description perfectly, melted great, and was overall a good product. Came sealed in it's original bag.
5.0	Works great with the newest version of settlers of catan. The new pieces are also slightly different from the original so your OCD mother-in- law can sort all the pieces back into their original boxes. The new player colors are okay but there's nothing a little spray paint can't fix. Enjoy your new expansion back, but beware more players means more chances of rolling a 7. Spend your cards wisely and may the roll be ever in your favor.
5.0	We bought this bed for our 2yo daughter. I thought it. Ought take her a few days to get used to the idea. No. She was ready as soon as we showed it to her, and she hasn't even glanced back at the crib. My husband put it together very quickly, less than an hour. She's been using it for over a month now, and we're very happy with the purchase.
5.0	I LOVE this bag!! It's roomy and holds lots of booty. If you love Capt Jack Sparrow - and who doesn't??? - you gotta get one of these bags!
5.0	Got this and my kid loves it but it does not have the ribbon around its neck like the picture shows. There is no ribbon in the box either.  So if you want to get it just keep in mind it probably wont have the ribbon like the picture shows.
5.0	This is just what the kiddo wanted! He barely puts it down during the day and it is one of his faves!
5.0	Great little helicopter. Easy to fly and lots of fun.. Highly recommend for anyone. Easy to fly and very well built...
5.0	This was a Christmas gift for my son and he loves it! The trike doesn't come with a seat belt to it (as many people have asked) but if you get the [[ASIN:B00005OAQV Kettler Seatbelt 3 Point Harness Seatbelt]] for the kettler brand trikes it fits on here perfectly. All you need to do to install the optional seat belt is drill or punch two small holes in the back of the seat and screw the straps in. I have a very big one 16 month old (35 lbs) and I didn't trust him to stay on the trike himself. I installed the seat belt very easily but I left off the middle strap (to make it a three point harness) because it held him on very well with out it, and believe me he put it to the test! I uploaded images of where to install the seat belt in the images area of the product viewer.  All in all I found this trike to be of very high quality and I can't believe I ever thought of spending the rediculous price of the kettler trikes. Great first trike!!!
5.0	I liked this set of stars and planets most of the package was little stickers. Suprising the glow very well. Good purchase my son was 4 and thought they were AWESOME!!! Better than other ones I bought.
5.0	This is the fifth expansion for the game Zombies!!! it's Zombies!!! 5 Schools Out Forever 2nd Ed and it's great!<br />It adds a university campus with a hospital to the game play and a new game feature called GUTS. With endless possibilities the game is hours of fun! I'm so please with this game I bought all the expansions so don't be surprised if you see a review from me on each of them. If you are a fan of zombies this game is a must have! The art is wonderful. The figures well made. Don't forget to buy extra zombies cause you will need them and they are very inexpensive!
5.0	I have 12 great grandchildren that I buy Christmas for, also birthdays . I have found that quality and price  is essential for me when I shop . I always return here for the service and other necessary requirements  when shopping. definitely a satisfied customer
5.0	When I first saw this figure, I wasn't sure if I was going to buy it. Eventually I decided to get him and I do not regret it, he looks much better in person as opposed to photos and the quality feels great in hand. Luigi comes with several accessories: a stand with a movable arm to hold him in place (though I got him to stand on his own), a green warp pipe that's completely hollowed out so Luigi can slide into it slightly, a Bullet Bill with another movable arm to suspend it in the air, and finally a Goomba.<br /><br />As for Luigi himself, he comes with extra arms, legs, hands and faces which offer many different display options. You simply pull out the default limb or hand and put the new one in its place, as for the faces, you remove his hat and pull off the default face and put on the desired one. There's the standard open-mouth smile face, the closed-mouth smile face, and a surprised face and each fir Luigi very well. The figure is roughly 4 inches or so and seems pretty durable, though I wouldn't go trying to find out just how durable it it, and the paint job is excellent with little to no flaws or anything of that nature.<br /><br />To conclude, I mostly got this because I wanted a collectible Luigi figure to display on my shelf and that's exactly what this figure is meant for. He looks alright next to the Figuarts Mario, but of course they have style differences. This Luigi is meant to be displayed by himself on the shelf for now, if you're looking for a Luigi that goes with the Figuarts Mario, you might want to wait until the Figuarts Luigi comes out, I've  already preordered mine and can't wait! However, if you're looking for a collectible Luigi figure that looks great on the shelf and commemorates the Year of Luigi you'll be happy, though that price tag might not attract too many people. Besides, at some point in the future Good Smile Company will be releasing a Nendoroid Mario to go with Luigi, and of course I'll be getting him too!
5.0	Awesome!!!! I've got three of these in different colors for my three girls who are 12 , 11 and 7 and I must say they surpassed every other present!!! However I wouldn't go over 12 years old for these I don't think they would fit and also the heavier the weight of the child the slower they move but they wanted to leave a Christmas party at their grandparents which is very unusual to come home and play with these in our basement! I haven't tried them outside yet.
5.0	Prettiest little dress.  There was another review that said buyer  received the entire outfit. Item description only said dress.  What I received was the dress only as the description said.  It looks better in reality than in the picture.  The lace at neck and cuffs is delicate and the velveteen red fabric is light weight while it looks a little heavy in the picture.  Also the picture is angled down a little which makes the dress look longer than it really is on the doll.  I am pleased with it.
5.0	Now initially I had a bad experience with buying a plush Bowser. The first one I had tried ended up being a horrible knockoff. However I had heard that this product was the real plush Bowser. So I gave it a shot, and much to my relief this ended up being the actual Bowser plush. It is a fantastic plush toy, incredibly accurate to the character model in the newer games, and pretty soft. I love it and even though I haven't been playing Nintendo games much anymore I still leave this guy on display. If you want a plushy Bowser, this is the one to buy.
5.0	I have been collecting Halloween bears for a while, and I was happy to see this one which was definitely different from the other costumed bears. It is really cute and a wonderful addition to my collection.
5.0	This wig is great.  It fit my 8 yr. old son's head perfectly.  The hair stays very well in the styled position.  It made the really good costume, a really great costume.  Loved it!!!!
5.0	I was amazed how fast these cards were delivered. Once I had opened the package I found 3 cards in perfect condition, and the price was reasonable for what I needed. These will definitely help my deck, and because they arrived so soon, I can use them in the next local tournament. Thanks!
5.0	Jus wat i wanted............ easy for my son transform from robot to car and vice versa..........
5.0	Very sturdy and easy to put together. Can be wiped down and used over and over again. I fit 30 cupcakes on 2 holders and still had room left for more!  I'd say you could fit 18-20 cupcakes on each holder. They looked even better in person than in the picture - almost a shame to block the design with cupcakes.
5.0	Sooo adorable.  Who doesn't love dancing baby groot?  This cute bobble head is awesome and I love looking at it everyday.  I am Groot!
5.0	We ordered this for our son's 4th birthday a couple weeks ago.  We have already put in hours of fun on this and it will definitely continue to be used (by dad if the critters don't anyway:)
5.0	This was great for my three year old.  He's had a few other other RC cars, but could never figure out the controls.  This one was easy for him to learn and having the option of turtle or rabbit speed gave him the opportunity to learn on slow without detroying the walls by running into them.  It's his new &#34;favorite race car&#34; now and he even wanted to take it to bed with him.<br /><br />For parents, take a look through the instructions.  It took me a bit to figure out how to bring it out of sleep mode.  The car seems very durable.  We had it take a tumble down a few stairs and it seemed no worse for it.
5.0	So far, so good. I like the little legs to keep it more stabilized. After we put it together, I was pleased to there is a little seat for a baby doll. This a great qaulity like you would expect from Melissa and Doug.
5.0	Two year old grandson loves it. Especially the lights. Great value for the money
5.0	I don't know what every one else is doing but ive been playing with legos scince I was 3 which probably gave me a big advantage im 10 and built this in 20 (I actually timed myself) and every one else is doing it in like days!!!
5.0	Fast shipping - product as described.  Thanks
5.0	My wife is a helicopter pilot,  and she loves hueys with a passion that makes me jealous at times. I bought her this as a stocking stuffer,  and she was so happy when she opened it. She carries it everywhere.  (I gave it to her early)
5.0	Great size for two decks at once, or if you have a bunch of spare cards that you don't want getting damaged. I really needed it for mine & it's in great condition. Little bulky, but worth it.
5.0	i GOT THIS FOR MY GRNADNSON, HE LOVES IT, HE LOVES PLAY HATS, HE SAID THIS IS A SMOKEY THE BEAR HAT. MUCH BETTER QUAILTY THAN EXPECTED. GREAT PLAY HAT FOR KIDS, OR FOR COSTUMES I recieved this prduct for review but it in no way affected my opinion
5.0	Grandkids love Mermaids so this was fun toy for bath time. It was used as a cute xmas stocking stuffer.
5.0	Great toy for Monster High lovers!  My daughter loves it! She enjoys building new dolls.  Best for older girls since there are a lot of pieces.
5.0	Cute as can be! Hours of fun for the little ones. Easy set up for mom.
5.0	I was looking for fun bath toys that wouldn't grow anything funky after long term use. This toy is awesome! The water easily comes out of the fish to dry. Teaches my daughter fine motor skills and lots of fun to play with in the tub.
5.0	Kids loved these toys. Great decorations for the tables
5.0	Fast service and they look very real. Worth the $ and have produced lots of laughs. I would buy again from the co.
5.0	This is an enjoyable toy...Adults and Kids alike will enjoy Squawkers! Our whole family loves it!
5.0	my little one loves it , its perfect for traveling with toddlers
5.0	My 4 year old niece loved it.  Sturdy wood pieces rather than the ubiquitous plastic you see nowadays.  Good buy.
5.0	This card is pretty much your final turn yor finisher and is the cross ride for dragonic kaiser vermillion it's a great card and a good addition for your deck
5.0	Excellent game. Speedy delivery
5.0	We play with the number cards face up and I help them find math problems. We have been playing for about 6 weeks and now my 6-year old is helping my 4-year old with the math problems.  They can't get enough.  We act out the roles, like the Turtle King walks slow to wake up queens.  As soon as we finish a game, my 4-year old screams &#34;again! again!&#34;  ...and we play again.  Its a lot of fun.
5.0	I got a set of these for my almost 10 year old son and 11 year old nephew for Christmas, and they enjoyed them so much that I have since ordered 2 more for friends and 1 extra set to keep at home for when a friend comes over. It is a great toy to encourage outdoor time!
5.0	Excellent for play therapy. Children and adults. Is the Dragon symbolizing anger? Strength and power? Prosperity? Blood? Let your clients discover more of their own &#34;inner dragons&#34;
5.0	Learning game is fun and stunts you realize things forgotten as well realizing what children are learning about today. Fun.
5.0	I got this for my daughter even though she isnt old enough for barbies yet. I just love this set. And it is such a great value
5.0	Very cool game my little cuz love this game it very easy to learn how to play even a 2 year old could play it
5.0	SOOOOTHING . . . BRAIN HAPPY IN HIGH STRESS ENVIRONMENT
5.0	My older siblings gave me an ipad inside this box for Christmas. I HIGHLY reccommend this for bringing laughter and cheer for any occasion. It was sooo convincing! The box says that the pot is not included as the box is too small for that. As I was looking at it my sister told me that the pot is not included and she had bought me a shatter-proof pot for it! When I first read the box I was a little confused, but as I read the details, I was amazed by such a product! My oldest brother is more of a serious type but he could hardly breathe from laughing! It was so much fun for everyone. It's one present everyone still remembers and that was 10 months ago! Warning: causes laughter
5.0	I love this set. Especially when I get the Hammer Robot doubles.
5.0	Adorable!!! Great quality, made well, perfect!!!
5.0	Perfect for all Duplo lovers!
5.0	Excellent price and fast shipping! We love the bows!
5.0	My eight year old son got an ipod for chritmas, with in the first week he had it , it had been dropped several times. An as most of us parents know ipods are to expensive to be dropped and broke. So I went on a hunt for a good protective case for it. We tried out a diffrent brand first, but the dang case broke leaveing my with a broken case and on the hunt for a diffrent option.<br /><br />That's when I found the fisher price kid tough case! This case is so solid and heavy duty that it has saved my sons ipod MANY times!!! We absolutrly LOVE it!!! The only complaint that I have is that there's no place for you to plug the charger in. So you have to remove the ipod from the case completely to charge it. I would absolutely LOVE to just leave the ipod in the case 24/7 that way I know it's ALWAYS protected!!!!<br /><br />Other then my one complaint...I would and have recomended this product to everyone!!!
5.0	Bought this game to take on a bus with a lot of kids. Excellent! Wished I had bought two of them, they passed it around like it was candy and these were middle school kids! Sometimes old games beat the electronic ones, this one did! I remember when my mom had to confiscate our game...
5.0	My 1 1/2 year old son loves this toy!  He spends a lot of time taking it apart and putting it back together.  When we need something to occupy him, we get this toy out!  It has been excellent!
5.0	These were so nice. They are really really tiny but I was totally prepared for that. I made a 3 tier birthday cake and used these as decoration which was such a hit that as soon as we blew out the candles a whole bunch of tiny little hands came and grabbed them instead of the cake! My poor baby didn't get one but maybe I should just buy him a whole new set :)
5.0	My grandson loves it!
5.0	Totally awesome details
5.0	This is an excellent ship with lots of small somewhat realistic parts.  My grandson loves it.
5.0	Still have not played with these as much as I would like to but so far so good!
5.0	Safe for. Granddaughter.  She loves it
5.0	Gone through two of these.  Of course I'm the only one who knows that.  My daughter has many stuffed animals, but this is her favorite or some reason. All of the Jellycat animals are very cute and super soft.
5.0	This kit was perfect.  A little knowledge from college, a couple books, built my first robot by months end, pretty good for starting bfr9m no knowledge
5.0	This plane makes an incredible presentation as a gift, and is entertaining to a wide variety of ages. My toddler son really enjoyed zooming it all around the room, since he has just learned about airplanes and has been super excited every time he sees one go by.<br /><br />The only thing that I wish were different about it, is that there is a tiny little switch on the underside to turn on the lights and the noise, which are very exciting, realistic, and add greatly to the fun. However, I wish this were like some of his other toys that just have a button you can hold down as long as you want the sounds to stay on, so that it would be easier to engage in imaginative play. That said, this toy is clearly marked for older children, and I doubt that older children would have any problem at all flipping the tiny switch at the bottom when they are beginning to take off.<br /><br />It is absolutely huge, much bigger than expected, and when we took it out of the box I almost wished I had purchased it as a present because it would've made an awesome presentation. The sounds are very realistic, and the lights add so much to it. I don't know how they managed to get the lights to go all throughout the body of the plane and the wings, maybe some kind of fiber-optic something, but in any case, it's very cool.<br /><br />If you have a plane obsessed youngster, or want to have a fun toy for a variety of ages of kids to play with at a family gathering, you can't go wrong with this. Everyone will enjoy it, and there will be a lot of zooming around playing airplanes.<br /><br />I received a sample for review but all comments are my own.
5.0	"This is the perfect toy for that toddler in your life that you want to get started in Star Wars before they are old enough for the action figures!  My nephew (now 2 1/2) has loved these (with supervision) since he was almost 2..they have soft edges and any figure with a \\""weapon\\"" is close to the body of the figure."
5.0	"We had a great time with the family on these when went tubing on the \\""HOOCH\\"".  We got so many remarks asking about where we got them.  I highly recommend them for fun times in the water."
5.0	My granddaughter collects all the ponies.  She has that little booklet that comes with the doll and she circles the ones she doesn't have.  This pony is so cute and it has lots of little extras too change the ponies appearance.
5.0	i love this little puppet<br />it makes me smile<br />got a really cute face ,well made and looks like elmo
5.0	Considering my 3.5 year old's ability to destroy virtually everything, this has amazingly proven to be durable in comparison. Yes its decals are stickers you have to put on, and while it would be nice to have it printed on instead it is what it is. All the same the kiddo loves it and its lived through more than enough tests with rough play. Awesome for a little turtle fan, and even better for a parent who doesn't want another toy that's instantly broken right off the bat.
5.0	Just look at it. What's not to love????
5.0	this car is awsome. The thing i like was it shiped the next day. Then it was here before i know it. With out any poblems just order and thats it! thanks man the car is awsome.
5.0	Though this is more of a kids collector item, I love the detail (even the bottoms of the paws have the foot pads) and the realistic attitude and dimensions of the bear. Really well done!
5.0	Yes, this will definitely do the job for which it is intended!
5.0	Item was exactly as discribed.
5.0	Fast delivery. Very satisfied.
5.0	My kids loved playing with this! I have a six year old and a two year old. Both girls had a lot of fun and barely made a mess.<br /><br />I received this in exchange for my unbiased, honest review. All opinions expressed are 100% my own.
5.0	I love this stuff. The colors alone are mesmerizing and pulling and stretching it really eases my stress. It's like silly putty except for grownups. It's neater looking, larger and doesn't heat up and &#34;melt&#34; like silly putty did.
5.0	this was a very beautiful puzzle to make .. i framed it , as it was  too nice to put away . thanks
5.0	Cute, educational, soft.
5.0	Super cute puzzle.  18 month old grandson loves it!
5.0	These are great, my nieces and nephews loved them. They were much bigger than I thought they were going to be as well. The ones I played with as a kid were quite small.
5.0	Exactly what I expected
5.0	Went into my nephews Rustler easily enough.  He says he notices much better handling with the steering at higher speeds compared to the plastic with bushing stock set he had.
5.0	We bought this for our children but my wife was concerned about the magnets and small balls. Not good for young children because of the small (gum ball size) balls that can be swallowed. With that said, it's now my desk toy and its pretty cool.
5.0	I ordered this item standard shipping and it arrived within 3 days.  My son was so happy to open up his gift for his birthday.  Thank you so much!
5.0	Not sure what it is supposed to be maybe a bird or a really fat peacock. Either way it is cute pretty and well made and the sparkle effect is a nice touch.
5.0	I bought these for my great-grandchildren, who were thrilled.  I was happy with the price (under $5 each).  I tried working with one, but couldn't figure it out, lousy directions.  I'll ask the 5 yr-old.
5.0	Adorable! Little girls loved them!
5.0	I bought this Lego set for my young nephew who is just learning to put these together and it was a BIG hit!  We ended up doing several more.  Loved it
5.0	Well made fun toy.  Bought for my almost 3 year old grandson and he is able to play with it as a game with others and by himself.
5.0	This was awesome and for $18 you can't beat that.  My toddler had a TMNT birthday party and this way the main event.  We had battle offs against each party member and prizes were won and the kids had a blast and were really getting in to this.  Would definitely recommend this great quality product.
5.0	This was a good value for the price. It has a hardback spiral album with cute backgrounds like Paris, poodles, pretty prints, etc. It has the drawings of girls, and you get stencils of different dresses, skirts, tops, pants along with stickers of shoes, boots, scarves, hats, handbags, and glasses. Along with these, paper, glue, scissors, alphabet stickers, glitter pens, and ribbons are included. This would make a great gift for any child from age 6 up, who is interested in fashion or art. This would also be a fun set for someone recovering from an illness who needs something to do, because everything you need is in the box. The only negative I found was the glue stick does not work very well, so a different glue stick will probably be needed. The scissors are round point so would be safe. Good set for the price.
5.0	This was a gift for my girlfriend who loves lord of the rings. Best stocking stuffer ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!! If you have a nerd in your life this is a great gift.
5.0	Stop scorning a product just because it's not pink.  I had a hard time finding something for my grand-son and my grand-daughter loves it and that's what counts.<br />If you check you'll see most of the items online are only for girls.  So cool it...<br />Vtech Switch & Go Dinos - Horns the Triceratops
5.0	This is an extremely well made, versatile and durable toy.  I still have the one I bought for my first born son who is now 26.  It is being played with by my nieces and grand-nephew.  Also, the Tommy Toot is wonderful.  All in all, you CANNOT go wrong with AMBI toys!
5.0	Great fun for ages 5-?.  Even the the adults enjoy this.
5.0	Our great grandson loves it.
5.0	I'm really pleased with the Battle Mech.  The sculpting and paint apps are great, and the helmet and armor will make for great custom space-themed minifigures, not that the Battle Mech isn't one already.  A great buy for sure.
5.0	I'm really pleased with this cable. It works really well. I am now having a blast flying my plane around on my pc while using my real life controller. This is great for developing muscle memory. I'd highly recommend this for anyone who wants to learn how to fly without the risks involved with the real thing.
5.0	Love it.  It reminds me of my dog.
5.0	Gave this to my grqnddaughter for her 7th birthday...Home run!!  She loved it and her 10 year old sister wants one too
5.0	Good quality rubber bands.  Do not break easily.  I recommend it for the rainbow loom products.  My daughter says they are great.
5.0	It came just as described.
5.0	The book is very interesting even for me as an adult since my baby still can't play it. The picture and the color also very attractive.
5.0	I like this product. It has all the screws that I will use.
5.0	use it every weekend very nice scores wright in front of you no chasing sloppy dice great family fun for hours
5.0	Good. Came right on time
5.0	Great game. The game plays easily in 30 minutes maybe faster, and is very easy to learn.
5.0	Took me a bit to get used to 4 channel, well worth it!<br />Used it outside and is incredible!  Go to the treetops, fly low through trees, do the eversion, it is awesome!<br />So just when i got the hang of it, I managed to hit a tree and pop the batter out in the snow at the neighbors.  Ordered a couple batteries, waiting lol. Def going to put an iPod nano on it will give unreal footage!
5.0	My Great grand son has many toys but this is his favorite and mine also.  Big people can sit on the floor and play with it along with the toddler, learning to walk, run and jump.
5.0	She loved it! It was nice to have a unique part of  Barbie Life!!!
5.0	nice addition to her collection
5.0	This game is very well made, and easy to use. The big screen is great (I don't have to use my reading glasses). If you can beat this (card simulation) go to Vegas, if not stay home.
5.0	Daughter loves it. The cash pocket could be a little longer. Seems sturdy and like it will hold up.
5.0	What can I say? My newly 6yr old grandson thought this was just all that and a cup of tea. Happy boy, Happy Grandma!
5.0	I was delighted with this lamb. It's perfect for infants as well as toddlers in that it's really soft and plush. Perfect as a sleep companion in a crib.
5.0	It was the hit of the 5 year olds birthday
5.0	Expensive but worth the money. My grandson really loved it.He especially loves using the different shaped keys and locking and unlocking the animals.
5.0	I received this product very quick so that makes excellant deiver time. The table is very durable with chairs to match. My baby boy loves it. The colors are exactly the same as they are online. Great buy
5.0	Our 4 year old daughter has been asking for this for Christmas for over a month. She is obsessed with Jake and the Neverland Pirates, We even wrote a letter to Santa with her.  We've played with one that a friend has and it's a decent little toy. We also got the Captain Hook Battle Boat because you need someone for Jake to fight with. So I ordered it up. Christmas shopping done early!<br /><br />My only complaint is this... the day before it arrived, our daughter saw Toy Story for the first time. When I saw the package sitting on the doorstep I asked her again what she wants for Christmas, her answer was Buzz Lightyear.  No amount of reasoning would get her to change her mind. No, she doesn't want the Jake boat, just Buzz Lightyear. Stupid Pixar and their quality movie making. I guess it's time to force the kid to watch a LOT of Jake for the next month so she remembers how much she loves it
5.0	This is a wonderful wagon, and I can't say anything about it that hasn't already been said in the many great reviews. I only wanted to give some helpful tips to anyone planning to buy one of these or who already has one. I used a small quilt to make my daughter more comfortable and that worked fine. I don't think the pad that Radio Flyer makes will fit this one because it's narrow and rectangular shaped, and this wagon is wide and oval-shaped. If you would like cushioning on the sides, an old baby crib bumper will do fine. Slip the ties between the small cracks in the wall, tie, and there you go. I haven't tried this myself, but I'm sure it would work. If your planning to buy the umbrella for it, please read my review for more helpful hints. This is for the Radio Flyer umbrella. Personally, I feel it is too small, but I have come up with a good solution. Read the review for more info. If you haven't bought one of these wagons yet, what are you waiting for? The reviews in here speak for themselves, and are the reason I made the decision to get one for my daughter.  I'm so glad I did. She can kick back and enjoy the ride, take along toys, and pillows, and be way more comfortable and less confined than she was in a stroller. Enough said.
5.0	Grand daughter crawls with Minnie all over the house! Great purchase
5.0	"This is a fun game, very enjoyable for all - young and old. Other than the names of the \\""Agents\\"" it has nothing to do with \\""Clue\\""; I guess they wanted to capitalize on the familiarity of the name. Unlike some other board games that include the name Clue, this one is NOT a spin off of Clue. It is a totally different game.  Get this game, it will give you hours of pleasure. It can be played with and without connecting to the message center; connecting adds one more dimension to the game.  Get a die to choose who goes first. The instructions call for the oldest player to go first, but this of course is practical only assuming that each time a different group of players participates."
5.0	Already reviewed this - wonderful mascot, extremely well made, far superior to american and chinese made animals, he makes you smile, too!
5.0	My 6 year old daughter loves making bead jewelry. I've purchased many of these kits over the years and this one is a favorite. This comes with plastic cord unlike some that have elastic cord. Plastic cords are much easier to work with, they untie easier and the ends don't fray.
5.0	It was great.  Packed ver well.
5.0	This was the last Eagle Proof I needed to fill my collection, so I was very excited to receive it. It arrived on time, and was exactly as described. I would recommend this seller.
5.0	Gift for a child....good quality
5.0	Daughter is going to love her Christmas gift
5.0	Excellent , , tiara paint smeared but for cost of original worth it.
5.0	These were priced very well, arrived in 2 days as promised, and were perfect for our daughter's Hello Kitty Birthday Party! They are good sized napkins for toddlers and young children, who tend to be a little messy. We would recommend these to anyone who is having a HK birthday party!
5.0	This bag is made the way they are supposed to be made. Kids punching and playing rough. This is worth every cent. Dont waste your money on cheap imitations. This one holds up and has a sand base included, not water. Very easy to blow up.
5.0	This Shane figure is amazing. Looks way better than the original. Looks great. I have my Walking Dead figure collection set up at work and it's been a big hit! Very happy with this!
5.0	My 6yr old daughter got this for x-mas and it is great.  We decided to buy one for her best friend for her birthday.  Really cute and so much fun to watch and even interact with.  Great buy!!
5.0	Prince Dexter Charming is an EAH Royal that seems to have a thing for the Rebel girls.  He has had a huge crush on Raven Queen forever after, but lately Cupid seems to be gaining some of the attention she has been dreaming of.  Dexter Charming lives up to his name.  Here we have the handsome prince that spends most of his time hiding behind his glasses (they help to block his “enchanting eyes”.)  His eyes are vivid blue and he has brunette hair and thick eyebrows.<br /><br />Dexter comes with the aforementioned glasses that have thick black frames (with no lenses).  He is wearing a gold crown (the crown is attached to his head with small removable tags).  Dexter also wears a blue checked blazer with gold trim and hems, a blue and white striped scarf, gray jeans, an emblem print t-shirt and gray high topped sneakers.  He is wearing a gold medal on his lapel and has a gold wallet chain hidden beneath his blazer.  Dexter carries a black backpack/bookbag that has molding that features badges and buckles.<br /><br />Dexter comes with a doll stand and bookmark that has details of his royal story.  Like all EAH dolls Dexter has multiple points of articulation for posing any play.  It is so nice to have another EAH boy character doll available – and Dexter is perfect.  (A note to parents – Dexter has quite a few extra plastic tabs that you might want to remove before playtime – check his crown and his scarf).
5.0	This toy is sturdy and has a great design on it.  I'm sure it will get a lot of use this summer in the backyard!
5.0	My 3 year old loves this and since there are 2 poles, he can play with his friends without having to take turns. Fish float for playing in the water but poles are a little long for a bath toy. Really happy with this set!
5.0	I saw Tokyo mew mew when I was 12 years old, My childhood is Tokyo mew mew and Sailor Moon! I really love it! I hope you also have the strawberry ring and mint arrow! I want buy them too!
5.0	Grandson loved itand plays with it for hours.
5.0	Cool WSP vehicle , is all die cast and the details are nice, hope they come out with more WSP vehicals
5.0	OK, I know you aren't supposed to launch this near homes or trees. Yes, I know that, and I knew it before I launched it, however, I'm going to try to use my experience as a warning for everyone else.<br />We purchased this for our 6 year old's birthday and it was one of the first items to be broken out and played with. Being the kid I am, I decided I couldn't wait and took it to the back yard. What's the worst that could possibly happen?<br />Well, it took us a while to figure out where it landed, and another day for it to finally blow out of the tree. Being a clear plastic bottle, and grey fins isn't all that great for locating it against a cloudy sky.<br />I will say that it sure does fly high, and it's amazing fun! But we painted it orange and it is a lot easier to locate now. You may want to find a color combination that doesn't match your local flora.
5.0	Bought these for my kids for sleeping over at grandmas house. They are super cute and my kids love them! They are very noisy but I believe that's true for all sleeping bags. Just as pictured and made my kids excited for their sleepover!
5.0	My forebear old and my best friends three year old love playing with these! It's cool that you can touch them without breaking them. And when they do pop finally, the bubble just rubs away. In the worst of my daughter-Best. Bubbles. Ever.
5.0	Amazing game, kept quoting the series as we were playing it
5.0	when I put these in the windows and look up at the house its 1971, and I love that iam the only one on the street with them
5.0	Very happy. Came in condition I was told, with all of the pieces.
5.0	Bought for my sister for Christmas.  The look on her face when she opened it was priceless!
5.0	I got my four nieces Lalaoopsy dolls for Christmas this year and they all loved them!  Fortunately, the variety of Lalaoopsy dolls allowed me to find one to match each of their personalities :)
5.0	This is for power. Series connections boost power versus battery length. These are perfect match Traxxas connectors. I use a twist tie from a bag of bread to tie the cables together, to keep the battery leads from rubbing on the tires.
5.0	I bought it for my 8years old daughter, she love it, since it's small, soft and cute perfect for her back key chain, since all her friends are with this fever
5.0	Works great, my 9 month old loves it, but tends to slouch in it as he is still a little too small for the swing.
5.0	My niece loved it! She wanted coffee, though. LOL
5.0	Great pin for a costume. Dressed up as Katniss and it added a nice little touch. Not the best quality, but good product
5.0	arrived on time, easy to assemble.
5.0	grandson plays with it every day, loves it
5.0	My daughter love it !!!!
5.0	Since his b'day, my grandson hasn't put his Sin Cara down. It was just as described. Thanks a bunch for saving me money.
5.0	My great granddaughter drags this pillow everywhere with her.she loves Dora more than her muppet collection. She said &#34; that's mine! &#34; with a big smile.  This little two year old was well pleased with her birthday gift.
5.0	Beatrix Potters' Collectible Peter Rabbit is animated and a total delight to our granddaughter who coos and smiles with joy.  It's animated and recites childrens' rhymes.  We are looking forward to lovely playtime for hours and hours.  A great asset to any baby nursery, but, especially wonderful for grandparents to share!
5.0	LOS DISE&Ntilde;OS DE LOS SELLOS ESTAN BIEN DEFINIDOS, VARIADOS Y DE COLORES BIEN DEFINIDOS, SON TAL CUAL DESCRIBEN AQUI EN LA PAGINA
5.0	Great Detail, and the they redesigned the way the peg goes into he base. Much more secure. I love the &#34;action&#34; pose
5.0	The chair is great except it may be too small ! My child fits perfect she sits in it everyday! However not all children are same size and shape everyone is different. It does clean easily! I love it was a great present
5.0	This doll is absolutely gorgeous. I was so happy to give this doll to my grandmother for christmas. : )
5.0	Bought two of them.  Very satisfied with the look and quality.<br />Recommend to any 1800S owner.  Buy it while you can.......
5.0	As one of my favorite characters the family guy I was impressed it was big and talks so glad to add to my collection and so happy to see Brian back on family guy
5.0	"Once a baby becomes a toddler, she loves pushing and pulling things along.  This bright green frog pull toy may just be the thing she won't travel without.  It is sturdy and should last.<br />It's always great to have a toy which allows a child, with help from a parent, to use her imagination, and as the frog \\""hops\\"" (or maybe it's a waddle) she can pretend the frog is in its natural habitat.<br />Of course, I say \\""may\\"" because, from birth, kids  are drawn to some toys and have no interest in others.  You really never know, but any parents who are \\""frog people\\"" (me!) would love to have this around to entertain baby and for a toddler to play with and learn from."
5.0	My 9 year old has always liked this castle and he was thrilled to get it for Xmas.  You can use all kinds of characters with it.  Well built and is shipped all put together.
5.0	Great gift for my grandsons to organize all those LEGOS!<br /><br />Thanks for the quick service!
5.0	gift as it is a gift i have not yet heard about it it seems fine it it it it
5.0	This is a great inexpensive toy. A sure hit for any kids birthday. Buy two they're cheap!  Check that, buy three.
5.0	Very bright and colorful, I refolded to use again.
5.0	The colors came in a nice variety, no bubbles, and the paint jobs were really nice.  My group will love the dice especially since they get to pick and choose what set they want.  If I ever need dice again will definitely get this bag of dice again. (The second picture is after a member and I picked out our sets)
5.0	This Buddy Dog was a real savior. My little daughter lost her Buddy dog recently and we couldn't find it anywhere. When I looked on the internet to buy a new one in Denmark, there where no one available on the Danish market. So I became very happy, when I found the Buddy Dog on Amazon.com! And so were she!!
5.0	My 3 year old son absolutely loves this game. It was easy for him to start out with on his own without getting frustrated and he is slowly learning to play the higher levels. This is a fabulous learning tool for colors, shapes, tracing and learning to think about what you are doing without overwhelming a 3 year old. So far this is his favorite go to game.
5.0	We bought this puzzle for a &#34;future&#34; gift for our granddaughter.  Right now she is liking the &#34;peg&#34; chunky puzzles so this jigsaw puzzle will be her next &#34;step&#34; for fun.  Can't wait for her to learn how this puzzle fits together and tell her the animal names!
5.0	"got this as a gift for a \\""tween\\"". would not recommend for younger children. very fun to watch your TAMAGOTCHI hatch, then you care for him/her as they grow and mature. great tool for learning responsibility!"
5.0	This is the right size to teach the kid.Works with all all smart wheel vehicles.  It is lot of fun for the kid & durable & safe to handle.<br />Dear Sir I ordered several toys for my grandson through Amazon.Com on June 19,2014. My order ID is 107-7865710-7085016. I received all of them except the WolVol Electric Fire truck Toy with Lights, Siren  & Sound was not in the package. The invoice in the packing states this is in the package along with WolVol Electric Train. Only the Electric train was in the big box which had 7 other items I have ordered. Can you please kindly check this. I ordered this for my grandson. Any help will be appreciated. The other order IDs were 107-6870932-5474604 dated June 20, 2014 & 107-6566148-7364211, dated June 19, 2014.
5.0	Boba fett is hard to find in the store. My son has been wanting one for months and we could not find him.  Plus they go for about 10 bucks each - paid about that for all three.  This is a great deal.
5.0	THIS WAS AN EXCELLENT LUNCH BOX, I HAD PREVIOUSLY BOUGHT AN EDWARD LUNCH BOX THAT I ENJOYED VERY MUCH. SO I DECIDED TO BUY ONE WITH JACOB ON THE BOX. I LOVE THAT IT COMES WITH A THERMOS, IT MAKES IT ORIGINAL. IT WOULD BE A GREAT ITEM FOR ANYONES COLLECTION.
5.0	Grandson love these, best Christmas present ever according to him.
5.0	Perfect! I love this product. It is a true pillow pet, just like they sell in the store. Very soft too.
5.0	Daughter wanted Santa to bring a soft pink penguin. This little guy isn't little.  He is stuffed perfect for squeezing and is really soft.  The price is perfect!!!! For the size and quality!!!
5.0	My daughter loves them!
5.0	My four year old son loves to play this game. I like it because even at four, he understands the gameplay. It's really simple. But with many board games, the pieces are either very small (easily lost) or easily broken. (Cheap plastic) Neither is true with Snail's Pace Race. The board is well marked and easy to follow, and the game pieces are actually large and made of wood. Yup, you heard me, WOOD!<br /><br />How fun is this game? Well, I like to play it with my son, and my nine year old enjoys partaking as well. It's a simple racing game, nothing complicated at all. And for a quick ten to fifteen minute game, that's a good thing.
5.0	My daughter just loved it.
5.0	This is an adorable charm! I love it. I was afraid it was going to be flat like the keychain versions I saw of skeleanimals, but turns out it's not. :) Very happy about that. The only downside was that it was difficult to get it on my cell and I actually ended up ripping the black mesh of the string...but no matter. As long as it stays on there, I'm happy. :)
5.0	My nephews loved these and my sister in law says they have held up great! Highly recommend. Very realistic looking toy and great size.
5.0	Fun game for the family!
5.0	Fun game for adults and children can also play
5.0	Nice leaning project for children.  They seem to like it.
5.0	My three year old loves Curious George!
5.0	When I ordered this for my grandsons..ages 7 & 9...I was afraid it would be too small and juvenile for them, but they didn't think so.  They've enjoyed playing with them.  The bow is actually well made for the price.  I did order longer arrows just in case, but the ones that came with the set worked well for them.  Granted, they don't shoot very far, but they enjoy just shooting at the target.  With the rubber tips, they are not dangerous, and should prepare them for using a real bow & arrow.
5.0	This is a great helicopter at a cheap price.  Its very stable and easy to fly, good for beginners.
5.0	I would have to say it is a good toy for little ones to play with its safe and not really annoying cause it turns itself off and is a pleasant and unannoying toy. the bad is that anything turns it on and the buttons are hard to push but other than those it is a very good toy my son seems to like it he smiles and I sing along to the songs its got 6 diffrent songs and another good thing is the classical music it plays six diffrent songs also and if you keep pushing the nightime hand it will go for 6minutes continuously whish helps put my son to sleep. I would recomend this toy.
5.0	This rating is based on the delight of a one year old. He got it for Christmas. Loves it, loves it.
5.0	Thsi was a hit with my mother in law this christmas, it runs great in snow ice or rain! I recommend
5.0	use it to charge all batteries and it does great took time to get used to but worth it in the end RECOMMENDED BUY
5.0	My kids love this and it keeps them occupied for a good 30 minutes straight.
5.0	Picked this up on a whim as a gift for my husband. I've never played risk but he loves it so I thought this would be a good game to learn on. It's a fast game that's actually fun for two people to play. The objectives make the game even more fun as there's more then one way to win. We've played it several times already. It does take a good minute for set up but once you get going it's very entertaining.
5.0	Perfect condition and such a cute bear! Thank you!
5.0	This was a very nice set for this price, and my friend's daughter love it! I will buy this set for my daughters too!!
5.0	wonderful addition to collection. it is so hard to find gohan figures that actually look nice. everything cool looking is for goku. it took me a while to find this on amazon for some reason, but im glad i did. so far best one iv found of gohan. the colors are vibrant. this is smaller compared to most statues from dragonball z out there, but i think it must be because gohan is kind of short. although it arrived late because of an issue with shipping, the seller did its best to help me out with the problem and did a wonderful job. seller decided to send me new one with expedited international shipping so it could arrive day that i needed it. i definitely recommend to buy from ANIME FIELD. found it the cheapest with wonderful customer service. i really loved this statue i know that the person im giving it to will too. well worth the money and time.
5.0	Like everyone said, runs long, roll it up, get the next size up.  Well made so they can actually grow in to it.  Nephew is 2, wore it to Disneyland the first time and loved it and got all kinds of comments from everyone that saw him.  Uses the hat even when he doesn't have the rest of it on.
5.0	My granddaughter (17 months) just loved her Trunki!  This was my present to her instead of Candy for Halloween.  She put all her toys and babies in it that she had brought on vacation.  She has not quite figured out yet that it is a riding toy too, but give her time.  Love you Abby!
5.0	I bought this for my 5 year old and he loves it.  It's one of the first toys picked up when friends come over.  It's durable- been dropped a few times and it's always back up and running.  The robot goes up and back and then can make full circles and change directions.  I think it's hard to find a good remote control car that's durable and this robot fits the bill.
5.0	I am 8 years old...I am going I to the third grade.  I love all of the power ranger sets....you can make all the  megazoids.
5.0	This is a great boom. I'm over joyed that the stock boom is SQUARE and not rounded, which seems much more durable. I've cracked a couple from some hard crashes.
5.0	This toy sickle was much bigger and sturdier than I had expected. Would definitely recommend - especially at this price.
5.0	F - B - Ab - D - Ab<br /><br />Teaching my child about something other than major and minor scales.  Two thumbs up!
5.0	It's a stuffed lobster, what's not to like? The price was also much lower than that of the mall's.
5.0	Looks good on my window, and is a good touch to Halloween decorating.
5.0	This is still a bit different than the G1 cartoon where the smoke stacks are on the shoulders, and no wind deflector cover which is new to all trucks anyway, at least not on trucks in the late 80's. But the figure is very anatomically proportional, and joints are mostly flexible, so I can put it in many really cool poses that I can come up with, and it would stand sturdily.  Both guns are transformable and integrates into the truck which is a very good design touch.  The G1 robots look better staying in the transformed modes, but this one is WAY COOLER to pose in your room/cube in robot mode. <br /> <br />I have to admit not having the trailer box/command center like the original version is a bit disappointing, I feel like I'm not getting my money's worth :-) <br /> <br />Some rotating parts have a distinct clicking sound when moved, makes me reminesce of when I played w/ the older robots as a little kid, and making my own sound while transforming the robots. <br /> <br />This might not be suitable for kids too young because some parts are very stiff and I was afraid if I pull too hard I may break something.  Make sure you follow the manual when transforming, until you have the routine memorized. <br /> <br />Overall, this is a very good toy with a moderately complex design, and definitely a keeper for collectors.
5.0	My 2 year old received this for his birthday, came with the trailer for a MUCH better price than buying them seperate.  He was sooo excited my husband had to put it together with him in it the whole time. :)  Didn't take him long to have his trailer filled up, and his cup in the cup holder.  Perfect toy for a child that loves transportation!
5.0	Exceeded my expectations! For true fans! Not for kids IMOP! Great addition to my collection will be back for more!
5.0	"I ordered this thinking it would be a full game. Which i'll admit was sort of stupid on my part considering it was only around $20 and I was sort of like \\""How come the description doesn't mention board or pieces?\\"" but in the rush of buying gifts for under the Xmas tree and my love of Nightmare Before Christmas I just ordered it for me and my family.<br /><br />Reasonably, is a deck of cards and one dye worth &20? No but obviously you're paying for the licensing and all that. I guess i'm happy with it. Plus I could always just swap out the cards and dye in my 80s Trivial Pursuit and play with them.<br /><br />I am relieved this was part of FREE Super Saver shipping though cause if I did pay anywhere over $5 for shipping on this, this review would be a whole other story."
5.0	I love the Gosei Morpher so much because it feels so much like I am an actual Power Ranger !
5.0	Fun for an engagement party! Lasted forever!
5.0	Great beginning s for young skater
5.0	There are a million reviews for this thing so I won't get too detailed. Basically, this is tons of fun without a huge investment. Awesome beginner's quadrocopter.
5.0	The dress is very pretty and it worked perfect for our trip to Disney World. My daughter especially loved the gloves.
5.0	This toy is just perfectly sized and made of fantastic materials. I love it and it was great purchase very very happy with it.  We got it along with the ulitmate Rudolph the red nosed reindeer set of 21 figures. It is hit with allkids in our fmily.  They play no end with it. I was searching for perfect set and I found it on e  b ay as they don't sell it anymore,  it is the one that has nice christmas colors of santas and helpers not the awkward ones but classic red white and all that.  It was great idea and it is just beautiful beautiful set, the kids played whole christmas with it and then the whole  year they would pull it out frequently to bring memories back.. we are going to celebrate wih it every year.
5.0	Good hand held game for my mom,  simple, easy to use,  good size not too bulky or too small. Good price.
5.0	simple and easy pick, pay, and received !
5.0	Just as promised....grandson LOVED this!!
5.0	My daughter loves her Annabelle Dollhouse!  It is study and holding up will although some of the furniture pieces could be a little better made.  A few of them have needed to be repaired and glued.<br />We got this for a good price at Christmas so for what I paid I'm happy with it.
5.0	My two year old received this for Christmas, and he played with it forever! The truck comes with one little car,it has room for three, so you have to purchase a set of cars. It is funner for my son when we load up all three cars and he watches them race.
5.0	Great card game for the whole family aged 8 and above. Backstabbing and dungeons and bizarre monsters. Also, plenty of twists on words.
5.0	My son loved getting this for Christmas!
5.0	This beagle is adorable!  It is softer than most of our other webkins!  My 10 year old daughter will adore it.
5.0	The pinion gears in my four helicopters wear out way before the electric motors. With this simple tool, you can replace the pinion gears ( I buy them in bulk from China for 10 cents/gear- $1.50/ gear with free shipping). Don't buy new motors, especially the pricy coreless ones costing $20-40 when you just need a new brass gear.
5.0	this product does its job to hold your domino's in an upright position while playing and does not allow them to fall over where other players can see them.
5.0	This was the second one I have bought.  Cute and the perfect statement piece in a nursery.
5.0	My 4 year old got this doll for Christmas of 2006 and it is now July of 2007 and she still loves her.  She is her favorite doll.  She can soothe her when she cries but rocking her, patting her back or giving her a bottle or pacifier.  It makes her feel important and like a really mommy.  She now has 2 other Chou Chou dolls and will be getting the mommy make me better one next month for her birthday.  So far this is our favoriate Chou Chou doll though.
5.0	thank you very cute. love them, ordering more
5.0	This puzzle was very challenging and fully tested my skill.  I believe this enjoyment can be contributed to the odd shape pieces. An amazing piece of art even though my love lies in scenery in oppose to people.  The pieces fitted so smoothly.
5.0	I became a big hit with this one.  The kids all loved it and played for hours and hours making pretend cookies and things to eat.
5.0	Fun for my grandkids. It challenged them to stack all the cups.
5.0	These zombie dogs are great additions for the [[ASIN:B000HX1NBA Zombies!!! 2nd Edition]] game. We have found that we needed at least one expansion set of zombies to have enough to play the game, and wanted additional zombies to augment those that came with the game. Zombie dogs can be used like regular zombies or given special abilities, like double the movement and half damage.<br /><br />We also have [[ASIN:B000E9T8GE Bag O Zombies (Glow-in-The-Dark)]], which makes a fun addition.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />CFH
5.0	best mini servo worth the money
5.0	The puzzle came with all the right pieces which now days means a lot. I have a client that puts together many puzzles only to find out that one piece is missing and that there is an extra piece from another puzzle in the box.
5.0	I had a construction themed birthday party and ordered a few of these napkins for the kids<br />it was very thick and lasted well
5.0	My son recived this for his 4th Birthday and he loves it.  We have probably 50 diggers/construction toys.  This item is fabulous, it pays so much attention to detail and the a very large nice toy.  My husband was also very impressed!  A must have for any little construction worker!
5.0	We all love it. Fun game. The istructions on how to set it up were very difficult to read. But, they weren't needed at all. It's totally self-explanatory.  Everything fit together just fine and the game was easy to set-up without any instructions. The durability is alrigt it helps to play the game on a hard surface and if I took it apart I could see where it would be a pain. But, it looks cool enough to keep set up in my little boys room. Glad I bought it.
5.0	Bought for children ages 6 and 8 for Christmas and they loved them, playing with them daily and very satisfied.
5.0	I used the map pieces for my Social Studies classes for mapping it is great
5.0	Soft and cuddly. Perfect my SO. Reccomend.
5.0	Just adorable! I, too, wish he did the fist bump thing but am happy with the construction and sound quality. My nearly 4-year-old loves it, as do I, and he's cuddly but well-made, so my 19-month-old son won't break him when he tries to love on him and maybe body slam him. I'm so glad I purchased this Baymax!
5.0	This dress is perfect. It is so beautiful and makes a great Elsa costume. My daughter loves it. The seller was easy to get a hold of and immediately replied back. I received the item much sooner than the estimated delivery time and the seller was very accommodating in my request to have before Halloween. Definitely would recommend this item and seller!
5.0	I'm enjoying it, I'm going to order a couple more for my daughters. I also want to get the butterfly and bumble bee.
5.0	I got this years ago when my daughter was 2. She is 4 1/2 now and still plays with this Mickey! The only problem with it, is that he get stuck in a position from time to time and he asks for help to get up, but she doesn't mind it, she laughs and helps him. It gets her to try all his &#34;dance moves&#34; too!
5.0	First experience with this Aerobie was on a seven day raft trip through the Grand Canyon. When I got back home ordered it for my grandkids and they love to throw it.
5.0	Bought this with another spy set. My son loves playmobil. It enables kids to grow their imagination, insteazd of sitting in front of the TV all day.<br />He's 7 and he loves every playmobil thing he owns.
5.0	Burgess Meredith was, for many of us growing up, THE Penguin.  Forget the gross portrayal from the Batman film, this is a spot on portrayal from the 1960's show.
5.0	We play with these daily.  They are a great size for toddlers, and fun for music time.  They bright colors are fun and the kids love them.
5.0	My daughter just received Periwinkle Deluxe for her 3rd birthday and she is darling. It was her favorite present by far, which is great, but my favorite feature are her wings.  They velcro onto the back of her jacket, are super lightweight and flexible so there is little fear of breaking. Much better quality than the ballerina series...more expensive too, but at least you get more for your money.
5.0	I was looking for a fun game to play at girls game nights, and this one was just what I had envisioned.  This game is a lot like Apples to Apples, but a female version.  The first time I played this though, I though to myself that once you've played it with a certain group of friends you probably wouldn't be able to play it again.  But I played it the second time with other friends and it was fun.  It's definitely not a game you could play over and over with the exact same friends because the questions would end up being the same.  Super fun game though, be prepared to laugh lots
5.0	My Daughter has TONS of animals stuffed in this, no problems at all!  She loves it, it was easy to install in a corner of her room.  Good buy!
5.0	"I can't get over how cute these are! I personally think $8 is a little much, but still they're cute enough that I bought two. I've loved doll twins and doll bunk beds for as long as I can remember. They fit perfectly in any dollhouse, and it's a great place to put the twins when you want to move them from their cribs to \\""toddler\\"" beds as they are just the right size.  Now under the listing it said that these beds were \\""beige\\"", I took that to mean that they were wooden, they are not. I was ready to stain them to a nice cherry. They are a hard molded beige colored plastic. Which I guess is better for kids, as it means no spliters or splitting wood, even though I would have prefered wooden.  Education wise? Well, it teaches a child that if you don't stack the beds properly the babies will fall out and go crashing to the floor and end up with some nasty head boo boo's.  Durability? Well, I guess as far as children go, it can withstand a few temper tantrums, but if you(a bigger child) hurl the thing down the stairs or have someone over 25 lbs step on it, most likely you'll be buying a new one.  Comes as shown with Nine pieces: Two bed frames, one ladder, two pillows (pink/blue), two mattresses (white with pink/blue flowers), and two blankets (pink/white; blue/white)."
5.0	these are so fun no matter what the age.  i found a set second hand for my granddaughter, but it was my daughter who absolutely loved them:-) tho my 2 year old granddaughter certainly enjoyed the putting and placing and watching it stick magnetically.  Santa brought my daughter a set for Christmas.
5.0	This was a gift to my grandson. He was so excited to open his Christmas present and fid this inside. It was delivered promptly.  I wasn't crazy at the cost of shipping and handling but  this purchase was to make my grandson happy and it did.
5.0	I love these colorful balls for the fisher price basketball goals.  It is a great indoor ball, more substantial the old Nerf foam balls of the past.
5.0	These are for my daughter's crystal polishing.  Works well
5.0	Worked as advertised. My friend really enjoyed them
5.0	My dog went nuts for this!
5.0	Great costume my son had a blast wearing it for holloween. The costume was very well made and held up ageist a 2 year old on a sugar high so I'm pleased with this product and would consider purchasing from this same company again in the future.
5.0	My nine year old son has been flying his for months now and even after several crashes it still works great - no damage.  I love the fact that we can charge it via USB instead of using the remote.  Saves money on batteries.  This chopper hovers nicely, it's well balanced and easy to fly.  My son likes shooting the missiles.  Each has an independent button to fire.  My experience with Syma is that they make good, inexpensive helicopters (I have a few different ones) and if they do break, spare parts are available online. A+A+A+
5.0	A birthday gift for a 6-y-o girl, these stamps were liked enough for her to remember them when next she saw me. She told me (unprompted) how cool they are and how much she likes them.
5.0	for the kids, better than the cheap ones that never work
5.0	Bought as a gift for our 11 year old nephew. He hasn't stopped playing with it!!!
5.0	This is a great toy!  Well-made, user friendly and priced right.  I compared to others and this one was better by far.  My grandson (4) loves it.  Would recommend it highly.
5.0	Look forward to many projects from my grandchildren. Service was great.
5.0	my daughter is 8 and she loves it!!! small pieces just make it more challenging and she loves small details...
5.0	This was a great gift for my 1 year old son.  All the kids love to use it.  It is cute and practical.  I only wish it was a little but longer.
5.0	My husband loves this product! I got it for him for his birthday and it was perfect! Nothing wrong with it! You get exactly what the picture and description is!
5.0	Exactly as describe and will buy from again . Will definitely recommend to family and friends. Looking to get more
5.0	If you like repairing your RC car, Buy these! So much power! Fit perfectly In My Savage Flux. Careful though, last time I crashed, it took out 2 city blocks, and I'm still losing my hair from the radiation!!! OMG SO STRONG!
5.0	Bought these to put into our Halloween goody bags last year and I think they were a big hit but I wish they would have been bigger.
5.0	I was first introduced to this in Hong Kong, but I didn't actually learn how to play it until i was visiting friends in Nebraska. Such a fun addicting game, my whole family loves it.
5.0	Got this for daughter from Santa. She loves the sound effects and how the toilet picture changes.  She is very excited to help her baby go potty and wash her hands afterwards.
5.0	My little dog's teeth can tear apart a toy almost instantly. Beanies are the only toys she can't destroy,  they are made so sturdy. She loves them and so do I, because I don't have to throw them away!
5.0	Oh my lord where did I even BEGIN to describe how awesome of this doll is! I've been waiting nearly a solid year with baited breathe for this baby and when she became available I had to get her! First off when you have her in person she is WAY bigger than what you expected in the pictures. I was literally floored by her size and the fact she is not only double jointed but her torso has the swivel ability. 8) She is sooo beautiful and her gooey details just make her pop! She is a really unique addition to any Monster High collection and even to Doll/ Ball Jointed Doll collections! So wonderful and worth all the time and waiting I had to go through just to get this gooey beauty!
5.0	Beautiful doll. Doesn't play music for a long time but sometimes that's a good thing lol
5.0	Purchased this toy for my 1-1/2 year old grand daughter. She enjoyed the manual dexterity of the stringing activity and the bright colors of the animals. We talked and made animal sounds as we strung them, unstrung them and did it all again and again.
5.0	Great value, a good product and lovely detailing. If only the castle could be edited to include the fairies talking too.
5.0	Arrived quickly and just as described.  Awesome gift for a kid.  One of the favorites received for Xmas.  One should never expect the batteries that arrive with a toy to ever work for very long.  At least this toy actually arrived with batteries that worked for a little bit.  You need to make sure when holding the remote that your fingers do not block the signal (keep them away from the little circle/eye), otherwise you will think the toy doesn't work.  Also, if playing with more than one at a time, both the remote and toy/spider from each pair needs to be set on a different channel from the other pair, or the signals will interfere with each other.
5.0	Bought this for my 12 yr old grandson for his birthday. We had given him a similar one the year before. He loved it so much, he wore it out. Every year they improve stuff like this, and every year we are very happy with it.
5.0	This was a gift for an admirer of the character of Daryl in The Walking Dead.  She cuddles it daily!
5.0	Granddaughter loves it. Easy to assemble.
5.0	We love this game! Our little family of 4 really enjoys this game, it keeps us laughing. Also the games are short enough that you can play more than one game and give other players a chance to win. The only con is that a Max of 4 people can play.
5.0	This is a really cool product. Ours hasn't fully hatched but it neat watching it progress. You place it in the water, change it daily and eventually it will completely hatch. So far we're cracking and it's awesome watching it progress.
5.0	Great Quad, I fly it all the time, Beauiful at night with the Leds, Only suggestion I will make, Stock motor will burn out after about 30 or 40 packs run through them, Replace them with the Micro Motors, I did replace mine with them and have ran about 70 packs through it so far and still running strong, and they cost less then the traxxas ones.
5.0	I found Jay Jay planes at a yard sale and needed this one to complete the set.  My grandson loves them.
5.0	When i recieved the product i didnt know it was a limited edition hand numbered product, so i was that much more happier when i got it, packaging was good, product was in good condition and even had plastic packaging on it still. I ordered it for more of a collectors purpose rather then as a toy, and therefore i rated the educational and durablilty low. But it's a great doll nontheless for me.
5.0	I bought this for my nephews for Christmas and they loved it!  It's extremely addicting and I personally found it kind of hard! ;-) My nephews love brainteaser-type games, so this was perfect.  It didn't matter what age, from 9-15, they all enjoyed it!  I ended up buying two so they could play against each other to see who could finish the puzzle the fastest.  What a great game and a great price, too!
5.0	Great buy! I wore these the morning of my wedding and still wear them 7 months later.
5.0	This product is no longer sold in stores.  I was glad to find it on Amazon.  It arrived in perfect condition and the person I gave it too enjoyed it.
5.0	Really cute and soft little toy dog
5.0	I got this for my Grandson as he loves Elmo, it is a great hit. He loves sitting in it and watching Sesame Street.
5.0	I got this for my 16 month grandson for Christmas.  Since we only get to see him once a month I wanted him to know us from sight and I feel this album really has helped him.  He points to the pictures and knows who the pictures are of (we filled in the album of us, his grandparents, and pictures we took with him).  The album is durable, easy to turn pages for his small hands, and easy for him to carry around.  We don't worry about him when he chews on it or tosses it around.
5.0	thanks you so much i love it....fast and good<br />good quality<br />i recommend to every one..<br />it was exactly the way they describe....
5.0	I BOUGHT IT FOR MY GRAND DAUGHTER AND HER FRIENDS THAT ARE GIRL SCOUTS SO THEY COULD PLAY THEY WERE AT GIRL SCOUT CAMP AND BUILD THEIR OWN HOUSING UNITS
5.0	PERFECT GIFT FOR CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN!
5.0	My pre-teen granddaughter loved it as a gift she had requested.  She takes it to sleep overs and uses it in her own room.
5.0	Looks great as a car or robot.    Transforming from car to robot was kinda difficult. Robot was well packed in there, instructions were not very clear. Word of advice, like most other transformers, do it slow.  Some of the joints were so tight that I thought I was about to break it. Hardest parts to transform were 1) that first opening/loosening the car door to be able to start off the whole transformation, 2) getting out the feet and rotating in the right position and 3) rotating shoulder into right position (complicated joint that snaps/locks into place)     Once I finally finished changing it to robot mode, I love it. Its pretty cool as a robot.  Joints make it very poseable. I got it posing like the figure on the back of the package.
5.0	Love the outfit and her hair. The Lightning bolt headband I was kind of meh about but it's detachable if you want to remove it. I thought this doll was one of the &#34;true&#34; fusions, but apparently she's just dressed like Frankie Stein. The neck bolts are also removable. Overall a cute doll, looks just like the photo.
5.0	"If you're into jigsaw puzzles, then this is the ultimate challenge for you! I put it together in about 2 weeks, but I was at it at least 8 hours every night. The instruction manual says that the puzzle comes in two pouches of pieces, but mine was just in one big bag! This made it twice as difficult, but that's the fun of this puzzle! You definitely need a really big table to work on, and you'll spend about a day just sorting out the pieces and disgarding the \\""scrap\\"" pieces with all the red dots on them. There is a secret \\""mini-puzzle\\"" of about 35 pieces that is mixed in with the bag, but they stand out so much you can't miss them, even though you have over 3000 pieces to choose from. Start with this first just to get the feel of how the pieces fit, then it's onto the big kahuna! I started from the base and worked my way up, assembling all the panels. It's important to follow the instructions when it comes to \\""raising the city\\"" because of the way that all the sections interlock together. The Empire State side is harder than the World Trade side, so you may want to do World Trade first. Don't be discouraged! You'll be proud with all your hard work, I promise! It's great to display and will definitely be something to strike up a conversation about!"
5.0	Got this for my little sister, she absolutely adored it when i got it for her. It's pretty decent sized and it's made nicely.
5.0	good seller, nice item.
5.0	My daughter is 6 yrs old and absolutely loves this game!  She had never watched the show but enjoys the Maze type game that has math problems to achieve before you qualify for the next maze.  She spends a lot of time with this game!
5.0	I got this for my sister in law. She loved it! I'm so happy I bought this. Really cute!
5.0	Awesome!  Came with everything shown in the image.  My son is going to love it!
5.0	My daughter loves this kitchen set and plays with it all the time. Making breakfast, lunch and dinner and serving it to her whole family while she plays.
5.0	Hex is one of the most popular skylanders and was very difficult to find in the stores.<br />which meant all of the children knew about Hex and it was one of the ones my grandson wanted for his birthday.<br />He is very happy with it.<br />I found it on Amazon because a woman I talked to at a game stop told me I could<br />probably find it on Amazon.......so .......that is the story of Hex for grandson's birthday
5.0	Hi - this is a great product.  Our girls love it.  However, walmart sells it for $13 - be sure to check around before paying $24 from amazon!!
5.0	Love the fact that we get to decorate it ourselves.  After owning several other iDogs, this one is the same functionality as the others.  Some mechanical noises while playing, but all in all a cute, fun way to play your music.  :)
5.0	It's fantastic toy. wellmade. my son loves it!!
5.0	This is so much better than I was expecting!  It's the perfect toy for my 2 year old to learn and grow with.
5.0	My hole family likes playing with this. I got it for my little one to work on fine motor skills and we all like to play with it.
5.0	Perfect for a toddler.<br />Unfortunately, the white board is NOT magnetic, as I expected, but it's still a good art center.<br />The pieces can come apart easily when you're moving it, but still sturdy enough, and good quality for the price.
5.0	My grandson especially loved this set!!
5.0	This is just what I remembered playing with when I was a kid. Cardboard stencils, plastic letter magnets. Bought for my niece. She loves it.
5.0	The stamps make a clear imprints - no smudging and the handles help keep the fingers ink free. My grand daugher really enjoys them.
5.0	I got this for my  nephew on the occasion of his 3rd birthday, but when it came in the mail I was a little nervous that it was too juvenille for him, and since my son's 1st birthday was coming up I gave it to him instead.  He LOVED it, as did my 3 and 5 year old daughters.  Apparantly it is a toy for all ages.  They happily play together with it for 30 minutes and giggle and squeal.  I will be buying another one for my nephew's birthday as originally planned.  The toy is beautifullly made and very sturdy.  Few pieces mean I don't have to worry about the kids losing them and I know the wood will last for years.  My only regret is not getting it until my 3rd child.
5.0	This is exactly what it says. To see my son blowing and marching around and laughing... need I say more?
5.0	We bought this Super Mario Sanei Super Mario for our boys ages 5 & 6.  They play with them like typical 5 & 6 year old boys do and they have survived, lol.  They have &#34;flown&#34; off our 2nd story balcony, been tied up, , been in the bathtub/ hot tub, dragged behind bikes, thrown, etc.. etc... They are very well made, super durable, nice, soft, quality plush.  I think you can always trust the Nintendo plushes with the red tags.
5.0	Great way to celebrate a big accomplishment like a hat trick.  The pin arrived quickly and the description was accurate.  I plan to purchase this item again soon since my son just earned another one!
5.0	Minecraft action figures??? You bet! They were smaller then I thought they would be but my 8 year old loves them just the same. Only wished that there was a more complete set of mobs to buy (only creeper, enderman and zombie are available).
5.0	This is a great product for children preschool and up. Even adults can join in  and use their imagination and build some thing great.The straws and connectors are strong and don't break.This is a kind of toy that you can spend several hours playing.I recommend these straws and connectors for anyone who wants to bond with the kids and spend quality time together.
5.0	The Captain America Business Card Holder is hands-down the best of the three office products Marvel put out a few years back.  It's also the hardest to find, so when it becomes available you should snatch it up!  Not only does it perform it's function exceedingly well, it looks awesome doing it.<br /><br />Don't expect the paint-job to be amazing, though.
5.0	This quiet and unobtrusive toy fascinates everyone, including a little girl.  My Granddaughter loves her that she got under this year's Christmas tree.
5.0	nice details, and price is good.<br />we used this one for my kid's science project.<br />many parents who have similar topic asked us &#34;where did you get this?&#34;<br />After the project, my son is still playing with this polar bear.
5.0	Great model, very detailed. Always loved the car, can't afford the real thing.
5.0	Amazing quality for the price! Exactly like the costumes at the Halloween store.
5.0	FFGs XWing game is one of the best new games of the last year and this addition really pushes the bar. The models details are excellent, all the other components are also top knotch. Up your game and get one of these.
5.0	It looks awesome but thers no caowl
5.0	Very nice, vibrant colors and a perfect fit for my daughter's doll house.
5.0	Products arrived on time.  Everything worked great just as promised. The kids took a while to learn how to fly them well, but I hear they are doing great with them now.
5.0	Came earlier than expected perfect everything, very happy with purchase!
5.0	I use this game at home (with a 20 month old and a 3 year old) and at work (with preschoolers) and all kids have loved this game.  It is fun and easy to use and set up.  You can work on letter identification, colors, quantity, turn-taking, sorting, etc. with this game.
5.0	My 3 year old daughter loved these stickers!
5.0	Beautiful!  Assembling was easy until the last 5 pieces.  So beautiful will buy again as gift to others.
5.0	Get your Lili of the Veil sleeve now! There will so no where to found
5.0	Stacking & fitting objects together will never go out of style. My grandkids love this one a lot....I think it intrigues them, and it's fun!
5.0	WE purchased this as a birthday gift for a 10 year old girl.  She loves it!
5.0	Lego set was fine but I had to drive to UPS location because there was no name OR address on the package.  Good thing for tracking numbers!
5.0	My 6 year old and 9 year old sons got these for Christmas. They love them. Easy to build. They enjoy changing out the different colors of crystals.
5.0	This is a good sturdy toy that provides hours of entertainment on the floor or in the water. Both the boat and cars seem good quality and should last for years.
5.0	looks fun have to wait to grand son likes.
5.0	I bought this chair directly from Toysrus.  The price listed here must be wrong because this chair cost me $35.00.  My daughter has had it for a couple of weeks and she really likes it and it's very comfortable.
5.0	grandson son loved it. I don't &#34;get&#34; the zombie thing-but grandson sure did-whewww SCORE for gramma! Came in good box and did not look cheap.
5.0	This is the best face paint I have ever worked with. Dries quickly and does not smear like others. Step by step tutorials are great. Would buy another when I'm out. Bought it for a children's event at my local church, kids loved it
5.0	I bought the Barbie Junior Laptop for my grandaughter on a lightening deal offered by Amazon over the holiday.  She is 2 years only old, so I wasn't sure if she would like it or not.  This a toy that she will definetely grow with, but she is having fun with it now.  We are working on her shapes and letter recognition.  It amazes the family how well she is doing with it.  I would definetely recommend this product for an child older than 3.  This product has several different games that teach children numbers, letters, shapes, memory and so on.  I really like this game and are glad we bought it.
5.0	This Gundam model kit is from the 0080 War in the Pocket series. It is a Master Grade 1/100 and comes with an internal skeleton and is usually more durable and takes longer to build than HG. The Kampfer has a large variety of weapons ranging from shotguns to bazookas and a beam saber. I would recommend this to someone 11 and older with supervision for the first time. Or I would try a 1/144 or 1/100 HG version which are much cheaper. Always helps to have practice. Sadly I do not know why the price is so high on the English model kits. I bought a Japanese version for 37 USD and had to go by the pictures on building it but thats fine by me.
5.0	I believe this is one of the best toys on the market. Although they are expensive, they are good quality and played with constantly by my children.
5.0	K, I'm not gonna lie and say I got these for my kids. I got them for my husband (*but secretly for me) to see the coyotes at night. I use them every night lol. They feel cheap, like kids toys do, but they work really well and I'm stoked on them. I just need a longer range IR flash light and I'm set. Kinda wish they mounted to my head so I didn't have to carry them but the strap makes it pretty legit. Battery life suck though.
5.0	Grandkids loved them​
5.0	Adorable!!  I love his angry expression!  Very pleased.
5.0	This item is very nice in both quality durability.  Its nice to see dinosaur figures (I wont call this a toy, because it would be a shame to give this to a child to have them destroy or damage)in more realistic poses, other than the standard museum posed that are static.  The detail is superb as are the colors. I'm keeping this for my collection, were it will be displayed.  Well worth twice the price.
5.0	I'm impressed by just how cool this blaster was and it exceeded my expectations.<br /><br />Basically, the ball enters the chamber when you have the handle all the way forward, some UFO sound accompanies a light inside the gun which charges the ball glow even in a totally dark room, then after 20 seconds or so, you can launch a round in the dark and see the soft glowing ball bounce around.<br /><br />My only complaint was that the gun seemed impossible to fire at first (I struggled as a relatively in-shape 200 lb. man), but after several shots, the mechanism loosened up to the point where my four-year-old could fire at will.<br /><br />Neat!
5.0	Saw this set in the doctor's office and realized it was the perfect set  for my 3 year old grandson. He loves to work and read at his table. The quality and sturdiness is excellent. And the price is exceptional compared brick and mortar and a couple of vendors on Amazon.
5.0	We bought a bunch of really big balloons for my sons 2nd birthday party. He loved seeing all the giant balloons and everyone thought they were really cool. The only downside is that it will cost you as much to fill the balloon as it does to buy it. That being said this balloon lasted FOREVER!!! Literally a month after my sons birthday it was still trying to float around the house. I would buy this type of balloon again.
5.0	This kitten helped me take care of one before my cat had kittens, the kitten is now 1 year old, she's very cute, and so is my lovely kitten, if you have a child who loves cats or kittens, get them this, it's fun, (...)
5.0	This was a BIG hit in my house.....  we own 3 other Imaginext playset, and this one topped the lot!  Sounds and lights added extra, but the boulder and gate were going all day.   We love Imaginext.
5.0	Perfect for a infant!!
5.0	Fun game for the whole family working on 2year old mastering the skills of this game.  If you love chutes and ladders then you'll love this.
5.0	this was a great purchase! definitely love the look and feel of my keychain. would recommend to anyone who is looking for something like this.
5.0	I loved the golf version so much I HAD to have one for myself! It already has served me & some of my friends Very Well!
5.0	This game is fun and challenging.  It is one that you will want to play again and again with family and friends.
5.0	Really helpful if your kid is standing and learning to walk after two weeks of just standing now she's walking
5.0	It was the perfect gift for my 8 year old sibling, he loved it! And I loved the service!
5.0	Grandkids just love playing dressup.
5.0	It is my all time favorite table game whether to play with two or multiple players, it's a great entertainment for hours on end.<br />Although easy to understand for everyone with language barrier.
5.0	love it my son was super happy
5.0	great game, fun for the family to play together, was a fun Christmas gift for my husband who loves trains
5.0	Great product, amazingly small! My kitten loves  to play with it!!
5.0	Kids need games that are interactive and not on the computer
5.0	Very hard to find and good to collect. Nothing else to say but need more words to finished this review!!!!
5.0	Great spidey masks for public library summer reading program
5.0	Very good quality,  it was perfect.
5.0	Good product. No problems.
5.0	This is a great little model of the Delorean. As many reviewers have noted it's not 100% accurate to the movie it's from but that doesn't take anything away for me, it looks very cool on my bookshelf!
5.0	Fast shipping and correct description.
5.0	The helicopter is so welll mqaade that i did not need the extra parts that bought at the same time i bought the helicopter
5.0	This is so awesome. Selma comes with three catchphrases, jub jub,a rope and bars that says enter here, and of course Selma. Once I got it I immediately put it on display. Selma says I'm sweating, let's ride through the car wash, aw, jub jub, and your application to talk to me has been denied.
5.0	I have not seen the Webkinz Schnauzer yet, but my little grand daughter loves it and that is what is important to me.  She is 3 1/2 years old.
5.0	Nice item and great price/
5.0	This has Play Doh's Fun Factory beat by a mile! My 2 1/2 year old has no problem using these, whereas my 5 year old needed help with the Fun Factory. Also, if you are looking for a sofrer dough, the dough by Alex is good, just dosen't smell as good as Play Doh.  Great design, Great Toy!
5.0	Perfect size and manageability for my 4 year old as well as 2 1/2 year old.  Sturdy but maneuvers well.  Always getting asked if it belongs to the store or myself.  I keep it stored in the back of my mini van for all our grocery trips.
5.0	After playing Apples to Apples with the 1 expansion for awhile, getting this second expansion was a great deal! They are current cards, and make for hilarious game playing!
5.0	This doll captures Edward so well.  His face is otherworldly, beautiful with the faint luminesence of polished marble.  His expression is distanced and reserved and so like the early Edward.
5.0	just as I expected. Wonderful. Thank you.
5.0	This is a very nice sand play toy.  My grandchildren loved playing with it and it fits well together for storage.
5.0	Cute bank, works great like the ones I had when I was a kid.
5.0	Who wouldn't love dust bunny slippers? These are awesome.
5.0	The hat fit nicely, but I don't promise that it will fit every head. It's perfect for a cosplay costume, and stays on, even if you're moving around a lot. You may need to get used to the hat and adjust it at the trim, just so it looks more like Link's.
5.0	This game provides hours of fun with incredibly obscene combinations. Not for the easily offended or prude. The game does get a little repetitive with such unique cards but hey, that's what the expansion packs are for.
5.0	I have 5 grandchildren, ages 6 months - 7 years. They all LOVE the little owl puppet. The construction is incredible. The older children love to tell stories about the owl while the puppet is on their finger. The little ones like to hide MY owl in their pockets. Wonderful toy.
5.0	I have a 5 year old grand son and he absolutly loves to make up stories with these.  Great product.
5.0	I bought as a gift to a 6 year old, who is the son of a friend of mine. He loved it, I was told
5.0	I bought this to use in my classroom as an attention cue, for which it is perfect.  It's loud enough and the kids love it.  I will also in the future be using this to teach some music, including the notes on a staff and the key to songs.  The songbook that comes with the chimes is also going to be helpful for this purpose.
5.0	These are awesome!  They are educational, unique, and fun.  My children loved them.  They are easy to throw in a bag and take on a car ride, to use at a dr.'s office while waiting, or to use anywhere your kids need to be quietly entertained.  After many uses, the pages start to warp, which is understandable (putting water on cardboard does have that effect).  But for the inexpensive price, I will just buy more and replace them after they warp.  My kids use them weekly in church, and I will probably be getting new ones in a year, they can handle a lot of use.
5.0	Good learning game for all ages.
5.0	What I love about this game is that you really get to know the darker side (and funnier side) of people.  Talk about an easy way to break the ice.  The only time I regret playing this game was when we had the pastor and the church ladies play along with us--was so tired of explaining &#34;tentacle porn&#34; and &#34;bukakke&#34; through the evening.  True, the cards get learned pretty quickly and the game will get old if you don't change things up a bit, but that is easy to do.  But I will never get tired of the initial shocked looks people have when they have never played the game before.  And this game has taught me so many sick and twisted things that I had to become educated about thanks to search engines.  I hope the IT department at work never looks at those or big brother is going to have a conniption fit.  What can I say, this game blows my mind.  The creators are jaded geniuses and I love how they were not afraid to include every race, creed, color, religion equally within their brilliant, but merciless sphere of humor.  PC is for weak people who want to lie to themselves all day and pretend things don't exist.  Anyone with the cahones to take on the world needs to buy this game.
5.0	Great key chain. The head isn't removable so don't worry about losing the body.
5.0	Hey LOVE LOVE my badge...great service from Findingking ..the size is just right. I wear it proudly. thank you. Mahalo .
5.0	these things are awesome after I ordered them I found a bunch that were cheaper and thought I messed up then I got them they are much better than the stock props they don't pop off at all and ive went through 8 batteries flying fpv and crashing and still have the same props well worth paying a little more for.oh ya I used them on my hubsan x4 107d
5.0	This is adorable & my granddaughter love it! Very happy with the chair and the prompt service!
5.0	These are fun little toys, and even months after Christmas, our daughter still puts them together and plays with them.  For a small, inexpensive toy, they were well worth the money.
5.0	Gave this to my grandson for Christmas and after everything was opened, this is the toy he came back to over and over again.  It's easy for little hands to hold and very sturdy.
5.0	Super easy to assemble. But I found this at Target for only $40!!!
5.0	This costume is Adorable
5.0	I am always suspicious with these type of gifts ... use them for stocking stuffers for my kids and sometimes products like this are BIG DUDS.  These pens were a real hit.  They shock strongly enough that you don't want to do it again ... but not strongly enough for me to worry about her trying it on her friends.
5.0	Arrived Quick and just as described... Would def. Buy Again :)
5.0	Good price, fast shipping. Thank you.
5.0	I order this on Tuesday and today is Thursday....and its here! Mine was the girl hispanic with a gorgeous pink and peach w/ small flowers as her attire. I have put up a picture in case anyone wants to see what the girl version of this adorable doll looks like. I also have the Asian and African version of these dolls. A great collection!
5.0	Slick looking glasses! I got them the other day and I get lots of compliments. Just yesterday I was in the elevator and someone was like wow those are some cool party shades!<br /><br />I got mine in black!
5.0	This doll is absolutely GORGEOUS!!! I love her shirt and the pants are perfect!!! So glad I got her as soon as I saw her on here!!!! She is going to be one of the best xmas gifts for my lil ghoul.
5.0	bought this for my son for his birthday. he loves to draw and we just can't keep enought paper on hand for him. So when i saw this i was like gotta have it. It's so easy to use it has different layers or pages, that you can draw on mix up anyway you want put them in any order you want. It's great cause if he messes up one on layer he can erase that & start again new without messing up the other pages or layers. He will play with this for hours on end. when the markers run out you can use DRY ERASE markers & they work great. I will be buying another one of these cause my daughter wants to be a fashion designer & she will use this to designer her outfits & her brother runs threw the house looking for his glow book.
5.0	Bought them for bday party favours. The kids loved them and I have received back feedback from all the parents that it is the best party favour they have gotten.
5.0	worked great for our skit at work
5.0	"As all the online reviews as the s107g is stable and GREAT to fly. I have had a lot of fun with it.     My ONLY complain is that it feels \\""Slow\\"" when moving forward. I wish it moved a little faster.  I have ordered a [[ASIN:B004L2J7W0 Syma S109G Apache AH-64 3-Channels Mini Indoor Helicopter]] as online people state it is faster.  I would recommend this to anyone for its price / durability and fun.    I have crashed this a bunch and it shows no sign of damage.      To charge I use my iPod wall charger (usb to wall outlet) and it takes 50 minutes.  I tested that against USB hub I have, same time, and I have yet to charge from the controller as it seems like it would waste the AA batteries that are in it.    Overall its an A++."
5.0	Amazing little toy! Very entertaining and durable, but take it easy on him since it takes time to get use to it and control it. A must have.
5.0	My grandson loves Yo Gabba Gabba!  For him it is a rediscovery of the show.  He can't stop playing with the gang.  I am the only person in the house who knew what he was talking about!
5.0	its nice and big and will work great as the backround for first cake pics! cant wait to decorate .
5.0	Bought it for my 6 yr old, he has an engineer-in-the-making mind and his dad sits down and helps him with projects. He really enjoys it but it is a toy he can't quite do on his own without frustration but that works out fine for us as we all like to play with it together.
5.0	"My son is ten months old and absolutely loves this toy. He was pulling up on all of our furniture when he was 8-9 months old, but our furniture was too high for him and he had a hard time getting back down to a sitting position. He cried a lot, thinking he was \\""stuck\\"" once he stood up using the sofa or end table. He wasn't fond of falling down to the ground at all. This little table is lower and taught him how to sit down gently without having to crash to the ground. Now he would rather pull on his toy rather than the living room sofa (although he still does that, too!) and the activities on the table keep him busy several times a day. I've noticed him dancing to the music, too. There is a lot for him to explore on this table and he has gotten a lot of use out of it. This is a wonderful transitional toy for babies learning to stand and walk. I know it has really helped my son."
5.0	I bought this styling hair from Amazon for my 6 year old granddaughter who loves to try out different hairstyles and hair decorations in her own hair.<br /><br />We also bought some doll hair brushes and downloaded infomation from Pleasant Company to give her ideas.  She is learning how to braid hair and has lots of fun adding bows and barrettes.<br /><br />An unexpected bonus is that having been told to begin brushing from the tips, she is getting the tangles out of her own hair in the morning making that before school time more pleasant for everyone.<br /><br />And unlike many plastic toys, the chair is cute to look at when it is not in play.
5.0	Wanted lots of colors for my lamp. Thank you
5.0	This is a great Lego set. None of the tiny one and two stud pieces that are almost useless. The smallest piece is a four-stud brick. And it came with a plastic storage box that I wasn't even expecting! A great toy AND a great value!
5.0	Its great! My favorite game as a child I was so excited to find it!
5.0	Fast delivery and as expected
5.0	My grandson loves it; he can be just like his daddy!  Great product!
5.0	My son loves his Ubooly. Ubooly is very engaing & has an adorable voice! My son is 5 and can easily follow his commands. Ubooly knows his name and tells him what to do to to move on to the next activity. We purchased extra apps to use. He learns about space, addition, hygiene and the planet in engaging activities and stories. The menu easily identifies available learning stations. Some activities are physical and encourage him to grab his crayons and paper and some are educational and asks him questions. he loves the rainforest station best and I love the hygiene as Ubooly shows him how to properly brush is teeth and cheers him on. My phone is secure inside Ubooly and no harm if dropped by my son. Ubooly and your child will become instant friends and Ubooly will encourage your child to read & learn.
5.0	This was the perfect gift for my 8 year old nephew for the christmas of 2013.  He loved it, this was one of the few figures that had extra pieces.  The penguin fits inside the giant penguin and shoots discs. He loved it.
5.0	i love cozy coupe its wonderful<br />she play with it everyday<br />she enjoy sharing cozy with her friends and family
5.0	My 3 year old loved this. It's super cute hanging on his wall, and is fun to turn on at night. (He doesn't care much about the phases of the moon just yet, so we just turn it on and choose a phase based on how bright it makes the room). We use it in combination with the Cloud B turtle with moon and stars that project onto the ceiling. They both seem to time out and shut off around the same time, which has been nice. It gives him enough time to fall asleep without being in the dark.
5.0	Great game to play with kids. Gets them thinking, planning, and plotting. The more you play the better you get at it.
5.0	Very cool R/C toy.  Cannot believe how well it flies for something so small.  Camera quality is not fantastic, but the fact that you can take a still picture or video is pretty neat.
5.0	Well detailed little model!!  Impressed with the quality of the little HO caboose.
5.0	This game has been catching my interest for a long time. I was only discouraged by the fact that the models needed assembly and painting, and Im a boardgamer. I finally decided to buy it and start a new hobby, believe it or not, it's ALOT of fun! Once you learn how to paint you will have lots of joy painting these great models. Ever since I became a big mantic fan, specially dreadball. The game is very fun and easy to learn. You may need to download a quick reference sheet from BGG as it will make your first games much easier to play. Dfntly going to support Mantic and buy everything Dreadball-related :)
5.0	My son and all the other kids went nuts when he opened the box containing Kirby.  It is a quality plush that looks like it can take a lot of handling.
5.0	My wife, my son and I love this ready. If durable and very comfortable with a center area to put stuff in like sunglasses, lotion or whatever you need to bring out into the water with you. Great to just float around in. I recommend this raft!
5.0	It is perfect toy to learn how to draw ,easy to use so even my 3 year old love to play with it. perfect way to learn how to trace shapes and then you color inside .
5.0	So far I &#34;love&#34; this piano.  I have macular degeneration, and playing a regular piano has become almost impossible, but I still want to learn music so I can sing in a choir.  With this roll up piano, I can put it on my kitchen table and play the alto line on the choral music.  The sound is so much better than I'd imagined!!
5.0	So what if he &#34;seems&#34; like a bad guy... give him time. He is just a character you love to hate. And yet there is something about him that you don't completely understand? What can I say this little guy looks cool and makes me think of the Jamie we don't yet know.
5.0	Fast shipping and exactly as described, thanks!
5.0	Such a great novelty gift. It just puts a smile on your face. Arrived on time. Goood quality &  price.
5.0	Adorable! My granddaughter loved it.
5.0	The Laugh & Learn was bought for a precocious one-year old girl.  She tore open the package and started pushing all of the buttons.  She loved the laughs and the musical sounds of the &#34;radio.&#34;
5.0	This set was really cool, the colors of her dress were awesome and the bear was sturdy and awesome, daughter loved it.
5.0	Bought for my younger female cousin (age 20) and she loved it!! She's in love with Edward Cullen. lol. I DO however think they could've done a better job making him look like the actor. Regardless, buy this for any die-hard fan and they will indeed love it. I need to get her the Bella Bride to match!!
5.0	Beautiful and exactly what it shows! Thanks!
5.0	I bought this for my son, appropriate for a child named Clark.  He is still too young to really enjoy it yet but I believe it's going to do what it needs to do--protect and comfort him when the need arises.<br /><br />The doll looks well-made and is soft and pliable. I like the rather iconic look, even down to the spit-curl, and the rather serious expression.
5.0	I read all the reviews for this item and some people said it didn't work with the Alphie. I was hesitant to buy it but I did and I had no problems at all. My 5 year old likes the colorful pictures. Some cards are not challenging enough for him but I have a 2 year old that will be using Alphie in the future.
5.0	So cute and well made.
5.0	Great bag.  Pieces were perfect for two weeks at the beach.
5.0	Great size and quality.
5.0	I always have a hard time finding a gift for my 6 year niece.  I lucked out with this one and she loves it.  Since its a gift, I don't know how well it keeps time or how it functions, but she is satisfied, and that's what counts.
5.0	Cool, Sturdy, Fun, Toy, Easy Instructions.
5.0	Fun toys for the cats. Unfortunately some people forget to turn them off so many now have dead batteries.
5.0	Very cute & great quality
5.0	Love the art, needed a foil version, cheaper on here than other markets. Looks great foil for my EDH deck.
5.0	they're really amazing.. everyone wants to know where to get them. ive never seen then ANYWHERE, but my face..thats cool
5.0	This little guy is adorable and so easy to put up and put away
5.0	we did not want to spend a lot of money for this summer project.  The price was right and we got exactly what we need.
5.0	"I was looking for an excellent, almost museum-quality scale model and this is it.  I actually display mine in my home (I'm that kind of guy) and it really looks great.  Easy to assemble (extremely clever design BTW) but I wouldn't call it a \\""toy\\"" -- it's not the sort of thing a kid would bounce around the house with really.    But it's the best model of its type at a reasonable price.  Extraordinarily detailed and nicely finished.  If you have a clever \\""dinosaur kid\\"" in the family they will probably love it."
5.0	"After reading all the reviews on cheaper tumblers, we chose this for our 8-year-old daughter.  It really works!  We put it in the basement and we were not bothered by the noise at all.  After 4 weeks of tumbling using the different grades of polishing grit, my daughter was rewarded with beautiful, smooth \\""gems\\"".  She was delighted.  The sample rocks provided were varied and interesting.  We will be ordering more grit to make more."
5.0	This toy is well put together and stands to most wear.  Though the wing release wore out fast.  My nephew doesn't care about that though.  As soon as it arrived, it became has absolute favorite toy.  He takes it everywhere.  Well worth the price.
5.0	Nice quality, was a huge hit at our Mad Hatter Tea Party.  Am purchasing a second set to use as decoration next time.  Thanks!
5.0	Received it pretty quick. Dress looks just like the picture. Very impressed. The only thing is, the sleeves could've been about an inch longer for the 3T, but I'm not too worried about it. Definitely recommend this dress.
5.0	I am a big Harry Potter fan and getting a Gryffindor scarf has been on my wish list for ages but I always thought they were too expensive until I found this bargain. I couldn't be happier with my purchase. The quality is great and the coloring is just what I was hoping for. If you're considering it, do it. You won't regret it.
5.0	This card helped me improve my deck and I love it.
5.0	I saw this on the history channel during a special on the history of supermarkets, and thought it was a great novelty....
5.0	This is a birthday gift for our son and it is going to be perfect for bath time!  He loves Spiderman so he will have fun with this item!
5.0	If you like jigsaw puzzles, you'll enjoy the novelty of photomosaics. If you have a hard time with jigsaw puzzles, or you're just starting out with them, you should give photomosaics a try, they're a little easier (because you can tell which way the pieces have to be oriented), and they're a lot of fun.
5.0	So glad they brought back this classic toy. My 4 year old daughter hasnt put it down. She was so excited to get 4 puppies!!
5.0	I bought this for my 3yr old daughter. Her sister is 5 and now in Kindergarten. She loves doing whatever her sister does, but doesn't like the fact that she can't go to school yet. So, when I came across this set, I thought it was perfect! There are so many fun projects in this box that we can do together. The quality 1 on 1 time is priceless. She loves bringing the kit out and learning new things. The materials are good quality and perfect for her. An absolute buy to get your preschooler ready for school!
5.0	Boy Bratz dolls are hard to find in the stores. He's cool looking with real hair and the 'leather' jacket is a must have for the girls to play with. The tatoos were great too!
5.0	I purchased this for a school project.  The quality of this product was great.  I would definitely recommend it to anyone wanting to get an product that fits and looks and feels good.
5.0	i bought this for my daughter because she loves pigs for some reason.  she is 13, so she does not play with it, but i think a younger child would love it, it's very cute.
5.0	This was an amazing buy. It arrived the first day out of the estimated week, was easy to assemble, and looks amazing. I would highly recommend this to whoever wants to buy it.
5.0	This works a lot better then just standing tiles on end.  Also able to sort tiles a lot better for better strategy playing.
5.0	Being a wacko Adventure Time fan, this doll fit perfectly in my collection! Great quality and very sturdy (I've slept with her in my bed for awhile now) and even holds up for my 2 year old sister! Couldn't be happier! (Plus the hair is really fun to stick up!!!)
5.0	Very cool. Got what I expected. Very satisfied
5.0	Granddaughter loves it. Not too big and steady on carpet for little ones pulling up
5.0	Bought this as a gift for my man child of a boyfriend. Let me tell you he loves this thing. Its awesome that you can put ice cubes in it to make the water super cold. I hate when he sneak attacks me but I do highly recommend, your kids or man child will love it!
5.0	I am very happy with my Pokeno game. I purchased it to have in time for Christmas and did not think it would arrive in time but it did. My family and friends had a great time playing.
5.0	I bought this for my goddaughter for Christmas, she loves it and most of the time wants to play with this toy.  She is only 1 and can say her ABC's. this has helped a lot.
5.0	I bought this trio to complete a set with dancing reindeer, christmas bear and poinsettia.  So happy that altogether they move and dance to the daylight.  Can't wait until December to display them.
5.0	my nephew absolutely loves dump trucks, I ordered this for his birthday and it's perfect for indoor play. He loves loading and dumping the blocks. BIG WIN
5.0	Much smaller than I thought. Only about three inches tall
5.0	This is a great kit to build and play with. Very durable for the kids. Boba Fett is just plain cool! Make sure you look around for the best price.
5.0	She is only 1 1/2 years old but loves the little monster university movie and this character is her favorite.
5.0	"This is going to be a little tough to review because well, Rumble and Ravage aren't your average Transformers. Rumble and Ravage transform into Data Discs which are designed to auto transform when ejected from Soundwave. While that feature is cool and you basically do nothing to transform them, it really hurts poseability big time. There is some poseability with Rumble ,you can move his arms up and down and toes in and out but that's it. Ravage has some poseability as well.You can position his arms,legs and tail. Rumble does looks pretty cool the sculpt is very nice. I'm super suprised Hasbro even put a decepticon logo on his robot mode.There is nothing different about Rumbles overall look. No retools or nothing. He and Frenzy share the exact same mold. Ravage is very cool.I'm still trying to figure out how Hasbro even thought of the idea.Ravage into a disc?? Yeah kinda mind boggling. I do miss the poseability of the G1 Cassettes but I can't argue when these new Data Discs automatically transform in midair after being ejected.<br /><br />Transformation to Data Disc mode is super simple.My three year old has no problem with them at all. They do have a tendency to pop open when you don't want them too but most often it's user error. With a push of the button on the bottom of the disc boom they transform.Ravage is a bit tough to get transformed into Data Disc mode. There are quite a few things you have to control all at once. It's in no way complicated but more of an annoyance.<br /><br />The set does come with cases to store the Discs in much like the original G1 Cassettes. The case is translucent purple and sports silver decepticon logo. Really cool.<br /><br />Overall I'm very happy with the new \\""cassettes\\"" It brings back welcome memories of the G1 Soundwave and his minions. If you have FOC Soundwave...you must have these guys!"
5.0	In the interest of full disclosure, I have a high  level of mechanical ability and have been building  things for a living for nearly twenty years.  That  being said, most people should not have much difficulty  assembling this.  I had this together in under an hour  and my right hand was bandaged up with stitches.  Just pay attention and make sure each connection is  made fully- then it will not come apart.  I would not   advise using any type of lubricant to assemble the  pieces as this also makes it more likely that the  connections will come apart.    We have had ours for four years now.  The only wear on it  is some fading of the colors.  I had to take it apart when  we moved and then assemble it again- no problems.  I also  move it once or twice a week when I have to mow the lawn-  it never comes apart.    This has proved extremely durable.  It is very common in our  area to see people selling these (or similar versions) after  their kids outgrow them.  These hold up so well you may be  able to get a great bargain on a used one.
5.0	After looking at several reviews online, I bought this brand & have not regretted it!  It works great, looks great.  Unlike some of the other reviewers, my 5 year old son had no problem at all snapping together the spokes.  He doesn't exactly understand how to make the angels but he doesn't't seem to mind a fat roofed fort lol.  My only recommendation would be to buy two sets. Two sets will allow you to really get creative with your forts :-)
5.0	My daughter (1.5yo) loves this set!  She got it for christmas along with a kidcraft kitchen from santa, and several other small kitchen sets like pizza, cookies, appliances, etc.  (never mind that it is hard to find sets containing actual healthy food)  She loves them all, but I will tell you that a few nights a week, she brings me (and everyone else at the table) a fresh ice cream cone after dinner!  This is definitely one of the more heavily used sets in her kitchen.  Probably second only to her strawberries, which she likes to serve boiled =)
5.0	Much nicer than other similar products. This makes the perfect gift for anyone waiting for vacation!
5.0	The grandaughter loves the kitchen, play's with it all the time and it keeps her busy for hour's. The stove top noises are great. The unit needs to rest againt a wall or such as it will push over. Assembly was not bad.
5.0	I bought this toy to help my 16 month old daughter with her fine motor skills. I think it's a good product. The pegboard is very light and she carries it around. It's easy to put the pegs in and take them out. The pegs are a good size for her to use. If your looking for a toy that will help develop fine motor skills this is something I would get.
5.0	No review needed here. Walters a bad ass dude as Heisenberg. This is a must have item along with pinkman and goodman.,
5.0	"We play this game all the time.  In fact, when another game gets boring, someone usually chimes in, \\""Hey, let's play Catchphrase.\\""  What's especially good about it is that parents, older kids, and younger kids can all play together....and it's not a snoozer like Monopoly!  :)"
5.0	My three year and eight month old got other presents for Christmas - but, he hasn't noticed. This toy is awesome. It is easy for him to go back and forth between helicopter and dinosaur. The dinosaur sometimes sprouts a propeller to fly up a mountain. It shoots out a little torpedo, you push a button and the propellers turn, and it makes appropriate noices for whatever shape it's in. I highly recommend it.
5.0	Excellent.  I loved this!
5.0	Glow in the dark bubbles are the best! Bought these for my daughter and the entire family loves them! The bubbles explode and leave a residue that can only be seen with the black light. So fun!
5.0	It is large and sturdy, just what I was looking for.  Great for building robots. Solved all of our stability problems.
5.0	Our grandson likes to wear them while helping his DAD doing yard work.  He helped with the planting of the annuals this past Memorial Day Weekend and kept his hands clean for Mom.  A good value. He should get alot of use out of them.
5.0	Love love love!  I had one 20 years ago when the movie first came out and lost it :(  i bought this and the movie for my nephews bd and he loves it too!  It says so many things and it was so cool to remember them all!  Now i want Babe for myself again!
5.0	This is a big success and my daughter can keep lots of things TOGETHER!! Like those tiny shoes!! The vendor was awesome!
5.0	Great toy to go with the other planes.  We have the aircraft carrier and purchased this for it (even though the aircraft carrier had a Dusty).  Read other reviews saying die cast is the way to go and definitely agree since the aircraft carrier comes with a plastic version of Dusty.
5.0	"This dog is superb.  We got it after other smaller jellycat products became a huge hit with our daughter.  As she grew, the \\""large\\"" jellycat animals became not so large anymore so we got this dog.  Our daughter loves it.  She loves reading on it, she love staking naps on it, and occasionally she sleeps at night on it.  It has just the right amount of softness and squishiness, it's fur is pleasant to touch and it doesn't smell of toxic synthetics like toys from some other manufacturers.  It folds for relatively compact storage and it spreads into a nice large sofa equivalent for our two year old."
5.0	This is such a unique set.  It is a must have for all Lego movie lovers.  The car is adorable.  Unikitty is not included in many sets which makes this a good find.  The figures and food that come with this set are fun.  Our favorite part is that ghost Vitruvious glows in the dark.
5.0	Great for toddlers. Used at the sitters house for naps. Still looks great after 4 years!
5.0	just who I was looking for this guy is so cool looking I want one on my side of the field
5.0	Exactly what my niece wanted
5.0	Purchased for my 13 year old granddaughter for her birthday.  It was well manufactured and colors were very nicely applied.  It will be treasured as a collectible for many years.
5.0	My son is obsessed with the Legend of Zelda. Always has been. When his birthday was coming up this year I knew I wanted to purchase him a Link action figure. Sadly it does not exist (at a reasonable price that a parent would pay for something that is likely to be played with).<br /><br />When I found this little guy I thought it might not be well received, but it was welcomed and has been trapsed all over the country side in a backpack and is a constant companion. It is well made and a good likeness of the more cartoony Link of GBA and DS design.<br /><br />Overall a great toy for a LOZ fan.
5.0	Great for carrying my dice.
5.0	I got this as a birthday present and first year anniversary present from my boyfriend and I couldn't be any happier with it!!<br />Kyogre is by far my favorite legendary (and possibly Pokemon in general) and I can be a little bit picky on accuracy and quality of a plush.<br /><br />This plush. Is perfect.<br /><br />Hands down, the detail, the fabrics use, everything I couldn't be any more happier with it. It's made beautifully and of good quality. I suggest getting it for ANY occasion!!!!!!!!
5.0	My son is a big fan of Thomas stuff and he wanted Emily along time ago. So he was very excited to receive it finally.<br />It's solidly made and has a lantern ahead and button for speaking. Good toy.
5.0	Beautiful. We'll made. Thank You!
5.0	Just what the costume needed to finish off the look
5.0	Perfect for my 1 year! We just moved into her house and both her and her 2 year old brother play non stop with this doll house
5.0	Took a little fabrication of the gear box to install, but before it was installed i was replacing rear motors about once a week. it's been about a month now and the same motor is still going strong.
5.0	Great value.  High quality.  Grandson loves it!
5.0	Cyndaquil is seriously one of my most favorite Pokemon. These sets all run small (they fit in one hand), but Cyndy runs just a smidge bigger than the others such as Bulbasaur or Chikorita. He's still fantastically put together. I'm impressed with how they did the ball of fire on his back, the side is just simple thin faux leatherette, but the back of it has a really neat-o sewn sun-shape. Seams are great, but his arms and legs are only glued on, so be careful if you plan to play a little rough with him. His tush is rounded so he won't sit straight unless you lean him against something.
5.0	just like a day at the beach
5.0	Granddaughter likes these sets, just wish they came with a carrying bag.
5.0	After suffering through the 30 year old version of this game, it was great to finally have an updated edition of Trivial Pursuit. Transaction was great, the product arrived brand new in a timely fashion. No issues. Looking forward to many great 'games nights' ahead!
5.0	Just the right size for my grandchildren's 7 and 9 year old hands. Some of the packs out there are much too big and regular sized cards are too small for them to fan out successfully.
5.0	Bought a couple cannisters of these and we've used up about 800 balloons this summer.  The kids love filling them up, making a cache of water weapons, and then unleashing havoc on their sibling.<br /><br />Get a balloon filler or you will be sorry.
5.0	a good product as expected and very good would that offered a gift for each product purchasing and so motivate more users 100% recommend this particular product
5.0	Doctor #4 looks exactly as pictured. I absolutely love it. I grew up on this show and remember Doctor Who being on in the background as a child when visiting my Grandparents. Anyone that loves Doctor Who or grew up on it should definitely get this action figure. I also appreciate that they shipped the toy off quickly and that I received it so quickly and it was well packaged to prevent any damage. It's so cool. Love it! I'll attach pictures.
5.0	This is a fun toy and can keep anyone young and old a like. This is a lot of  fun and well made. It is a toy that is more out there and takes a bit of skill to be able to get it to land and work but it is a lot of fun. This is a solid wood toy with a strong string that attaches the ball to the hammer. I really like the color and design of it and this is a great challenge to anyone. This is a strong durable toy that will last a long time and it is a great item to have to keep people busy and entertain without electronics. I received this product to share my honest thoughts and opinions about it.
5.0	I have a 7 year old boy, so we have bins full of Imaginext toys, everything from pirate ships to dinosaurs to planes.  We don’t have any of the aliens though and I just couldn’t pass up this guy because he’s so cute.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. The toy actually does quite a few different things.  You can place figures in his tentacles (they don’t have to be Imaginext figures either) and squeeze a handle on the back and he’ll kind of thrash around with them.  He’s got a flyswatter, so it looks like he’s trying to swat them.  You can also push his brain and his mouth opens.  If you place something in his mouth, it makes sounds like he’s eating whatever is in his mouth.  Lots of sound effects!<br />2. He’s a villain, but he’s just so cute!  Truthfully, a child could use him on the good guys side as well.<br />3. He has an exposed brain!  This was my son’s favorite part.  There’s the ick factor, but in a fun way.  My son kept saying, “Eww, I’m pushing his brain!”<br />4. As with all other Imaginext toys we’ve had, this one is remarkably sturdy.  Ours took a tumble down carpeted stairs onto a tile floor and was no worse for wear.  I’m honestly not sure if you can break these.<br /><br />Cons: Usually, I can find at least one thing I’d like to see changed in a toy, but so far, I haven’t with this one.<br /><br />The description also states that he makes sound effects when other spaceships from the aliens series shoot at him.  Unfortunately, we don’t’ have any of the other items from this series, so I am unable to test out that functionality.
5.0	This toy is such a simple design with no gimmicks, it's no wonder kids love it. I am a pediatric physical therapist and I use this toy frequently with the children I work with age 1-3.  It can really hold their interest for quite some time and is simple enough for even the more physically challenged children to manipulate.
5.0	My son had the little Speedy and fell in love with him so I had to get this extra large version. He Loves it. They can cuddle with him,throw around and roll around. Super fun soft and great buy.
5.0	My 6 year old nephew LOVED these stuffed angry bird toys.  I got him 3 for his birthday, and am getting him the rest for Christmas.  They are great quality and really soft. Highly recommend!
5.0	This product is top quality. It serves it's purpose
5.0	I ordered this for my nephew and he seems to love it. He's 3 years old and fits him well. It was really easy to put it together, took maybe 5 minutes, everything just snaps together. The only thing that's not so great about it is that you can't turn the wheels. My nephew seems to enjoy it in spite of that so I am pleased with my purchase.
5.0	The Light Up Building Construction Set - Laser Pegs - 3-D Light Board came quickly and in great condition.  This was a gift for my grandson and he absolutely loved it.
5.0	I purchased these for my two daughters ages 11 and 7 and they have not put it down. They love making bracelets!
5.0	This ship quite detailed. Just what I was looking for. Thanks.
5.0	My son got this toy for his third birthday.  Not only were he and his 18 month old sister fighting over who got to play with it next, my husband and I wanted turns, too.  Besides drawing on it, which looks amazing, we write words on the board for my son to practice reading on, which is more motivating for him than, say, flash cards.  It's a little tricky to erase the bottom of the board - you need to push the erase button on top and press on the screen at te bottom at the same time, but once we figured this out, no problem.  The whole family really loves this toy.
5.0	Seem to be good quality, got them for a great price on Amazon.
5.0	This skin is great. Keeps scratches off leappad and adds a nice look to the leappad. My daughter loves it.
5.0	"The colors are bright and \\""happy\\"". These are perfect for little girl dress up times. However, may not want them for under 4 or 5 year olds"
5.0	can't review of the quality of the crayons themselves since we gave them all away, but it was a great party favor addition for such a great price. :)
5.0	My boys love them, they stick them to whatever they can. I'm glad I found these, just wish it could have been for Christmas
5.0	This grill has a lot of things to say and my kids love playing with it.  It does randomly go off when nobody is playing with it though.  It's also kind of loud with the lid up.  Overall we really like it!
5.0	I got this for my wife as a stocking stuffer and she couldn't be more thrilled, she loves taking baths and turning it orange or green or another color is a blast. They keep from staining and the fizzing is cool to watch!
5.0	I played this game at a friends house and I loved it. I brought it to work for a team building and EVERYONE had fun playing this game.
5.0	Some things never change...  Lincoln logs seem to be one of those things.  These are pretty much just like I remembered them.  The box comes with a fair amount of them, so you can build the set up pictured on the front of the box or you can freelance and have fun on your own.  If you buy them I hope you are as happy as I was and thanks for taking the time to read my review.
5.0	came in perfect condition.<br />picture is HD amazing.<br />nice lamination.<br />perfect.<br />tysm!
5.0	Bought this for party favors and all kids 2-7 loved them.
5.0	Really satisfied with the purchase... I really needed this card for my relinqiushed deck.. but now i'm going to have to order another one for my monarchs.... willing to buy from the same seller...
5.0	I bought these for my 1 Year old Twins Grandsons for Christmas. They Love them so much.
5.0	Bought this for a daughter to use entertaining one of our grandchildren. (Dad was already having great success with a hand puppet.) It served the intended purpose admirably.
5.0	As expected.  Daughter loves it!
5.0	Great gift for the kitchen chef.  Very funny and useful!
5.0	Great product!!!    Great seller..I like this toy store because they do a great job on delivering great product. I have bought many items from them before    Octonauts Figure & Creature Pack Shellington    Keep up the great job    Also in additions love these best sports books online site    [...]    Bobby
5.0	I got this set because I wanted some more period-correct figures for my Roman display - Playmobil didn't make nearly enough Roman civilians. This family though is a great set for filling out the seats of your arena. As far as I can tell from the google machine the clothing is fairly accurate.<br /><br />Two quibbles: the set I received had a standard silver dagger for the boy. The product picture isn't clear but it seems the dagger there is different. I know the Roman boy got a wooden sword so I was disappointed that the Egyptian got a metal one. I replaced it with gold Egyptian dagger.<br /><br />Secondly, the printing on the boy's shield was slightly offset.<br /><br />Both of these points might imply that I got a later-production set. Caveat emptor!
5.0	Packed very good  colors very vibrant  exciting  Grandson loved it and has so much fun time with it he puts down his games
5.0	Great item and price... Bought it for my daughter's Christmas!
5.0	I recently ordered a ring from this seller and it is perfect! The ring was exactly the correct size and looks beautiful! It's in the state I wanted and it's made very well. It's exactly what I wanted and I absolutely love it.
5.0	We bought the Little Tikes 4-in-1 trike after seeing a friend's daughter playing on hers. It had belonged to her big brother before her and she was having such a good time. We decided to purchase one for our granddaughter.  She loves it! Because I know Little Tikes products are great quality I know it will last I know her future siblings will enjoy it also. I love the fact that it will grow with her stages.
5.0	All good! Time of delivery and merchandise
5.0	I bought this for my Granddaughters birthday.  She has an 18 inch doll that is similar to the American Girl Doll.  She only has a couple of outfits, so I have been looking for reasonably priced clothes.  I will be probably be buying more, since I love to spoil my granddaughter!
5.0	5 star game, 5 star service! She even gave us a little bonus to go with it! Thank you from a very satisfied customer
5.0	These socks are very good and they are very easy to clean and they are also very warm too. i really love these socks.
5.0	Most comfortable costume ever. Fit great, well made and perfect for cold Halloween night. Also very cute and received lots of compliments!
5.0	We bought this toy for our 15 month old daughter for christmas and she loves it.  It has so many neat settings that can teach her many different things.  She loves to crawl through the doorway and it's very cute.  I was afraid she may be too old for this toy but she loves it.  I would definitely recommend this toy to everyone.
5.0	Great product. My 3 year old plays with this for at least 30 minutes at a time, which is a record for her! Love the quality and colors!
5.0	This was a great product. I was able to put it together in a day, including gathering the necessary lumber and hardware . My only complaint is that I wish they were more clear in the &#34;tools required&#34; part of the directions, and listed that you would need an additional 2 pounds of screws. Directions also state that you can use 2  2&#34;x6&#34;x16' boards and laminate them for the main beam. I used and would recommend spending a little extra time to find the full 4&#34;x6&#34;x16', as the bolts would go right through where the 2 boards are laminated. I just feel this would weaken the support.<br /><br />Otherwise great, and I flipped it to build the platform on the opposite side as stated in the directions, due to how I was setting it up. This was do easy to do! I highly recommend it !
5.0	The baby pool, is really cute and provides the right amount of shade as well. When we are not usingit outside we bring it in and fill it with stuffed animals and my son loves to crawl in and out of it and play. And he also loves the velco fish too!
5.0	loves these alligators.  We use them for our &#34;Alligator Song.&#34;  The alligator climbs up a tree (themselves) and then climbs down the tree.  The kids really enjoy them, they're the perfect size for little hands, and they're soft.  Plus, they can identify colors when I give them a choice.  Awesome!
5.0	"this is an AWESOME water monster. it is high level making a litter hard to summon, but it is worth it thanks to its ability.. it is a great card to have in water-type decks.. it is the second to only other card (from whale fortress) to be base off a species of whale (considering it is a fish-type) along with some others(like,airorca,chrysalis dolphin,and orca fortress of darkness) there are not many marine-mammal based monsters...it be great if there where more..  it is great for xyz summoning.. its effect is the same as the anime spell \\""three slice\\"".. this card is a great ad-on for fish and aqua-type decks..."
5.0	If you love I Love Lucy, you will love this doll to start, expand or complete your collection. One of my favorite episodes.
5.0	Just bought this for my daughter and I'm very happy with this product!  It is very well made has neat little shelves.  At first I didn't think I would like the ribbons that you need to pull to open the bi fold door but I see that it needs to be a very tight closure so it makes sense to pull the ribbon.  I paid 54.00 at target.  The only suggestion is that I wish it had a heavy duty handle on the top or something to be able to carry around.  It is pretty bulky and when you move it from place to place it's a bit like carrying a medicine cabinet around.  But love it overall!
5.0	Any time I can use the phrase &#34;when you fart and a little bit comes out&#34; or &#34;a windmill full of corpses&#34; in a conversation, you know it's going to be a good one.  This game is terrible and amazing, and you don't even need to be drunk to play it!  Just make sure to play with people who are as perverted and twisted as you are. It's awful (in an awkward way) to play it with clean-minded people. I mean, it makes for a great laugh later on, but at the time, you'll just be cringing inside and wishing for more tequila. Get the game and the packs; you'll love it. Laughter, after all, IS the best medicine.
5.0	if you even looking at this then don't think any further &#34;buy it&#34;. It's well worth the money when you compare anything else
5.0	Great for my 6 1/2 year old who loves Pokemon.  Perfect for him to play with them.  They are not the most durable as some have lost tails etc., but he loves them and they were well worth it.
5.0	Everyone Loved it.  Cute, cuddly, can't go wrong.  Exactly what I expected and more.  Words just can not say enough
5.0	This skeleton is well made and structurally sound.  It will be a family tradition to pull &#34;Bonnie Bones&#34; out every fall to dress her up and move her around the house… We love it!!!
5.0	This little guy is just adorable and looks exactly as pictured.  He sticks perfectly on glass and just adds that little whimsical touch to any space you choose to put him in.  :)
5.0	This item works as described. It went on easily and has a nice texture feel to it. Almost like your seat texture. It was weird at first but I like it now.
5.0	Fit my 8 year old son just perfect, quality was good and sizing was great as well. My son normally wears a size 10 in clothing, so sizing was spot on. He got lots of compliments for his costume.
5.0	This outfit was a Christmas gift for my granddaughter.  She loved it.  Was of good quality and fit perfect.
5.0	Very cute toy. My 3 yr old son got this for Xmas and he loves it. He is a big Caillou fan.
5.0	My niece loves her costume and has put it on several times to show what she is wearing for Halloween. Looks great on and very official.
5.0	Lionel does not disappoint and is the same quality product it was years ago. Magical for the two boys Santa Claus brought it for!
5.0	"It is rare to find a game that is both entertaining and educational.  Blurt! is a game which accomplishes both while leaving the players begging for more.<br /><br />Blurt! makes my teaching job so delightful.  I am a teacher in a medium security facility for juvenile felons (a jail), and my little felons absolutely love playing Blurt!  (Some of their answers, based on their unique experiences, are quite humorous - \\""wife-beaters\\"" - their slang answer (referring to t-shirt or underwear) for the question, \\""Clothing worn beneath other clothing and next to the skin,\\"" \\""drive-by shooting\\"" or \\""gang-banging\\"" for the question, \\""A violent disturbance created by a large group,\\"" etc.).  Blurt! has become the reward for my \\""captive audience\\"" of students when they have done well in class.  They have so much fun that they don't realize that they are developing their cognitive skills.<br /><br />I am particularly impressed with the way Blurt! acts as a catalyst in the classroom - students find themselves interacting with their peers in a fast-paced, competitive game that allows everyone a chance to contribute to each other's success.<br /><br />Certainly Blurt! is not limited to use in an educational setting.  In fact, my grandchildren and my colleagues enjoy the game as well as my students.  However, I find Blurt! to be an invaluable addition to my bag of teaching tricks, and I will continue to use the game of Blurt! often and with great delight.<br /><br />Thank you, Tim - you truly do make the world a brighter place."
5.0	Bought for my daughter in laws nephew. He loved it😀
5.0	I looked over many sets and this is the best quality compared to sets even more expensive.
5.0	I bought this for my two year old grandson for his birthday.  He has not stopped playing with it.  It is well constructed and looks like it will last a long time. I did the recommendation of buying the set of straight tracks and I am glad I did as now he is able to have a bigger track to play with.
5.0	Had a lot of fun on Easter Sunday.  Everyone seemed to have a nice time.  First we did the party play but then went to the competition play which I think was more exciting and there was more interaction with the competition
5.0	My son absolutely loves this toy and it came so quick thanks!
5.0	This is a cute little version of Captain America.  I gave it to my coworker and it now proudly protects her desk.
5.0	I bought this for my son who loves to play Minecraft and I could say that they really appreciate having this.. the quality and material that was used is really good..
5.0	Really good gift idea
5.0	Love it!! Its so cute to snuggle with I just want to squeeze it tight!!
5.0	My 11yr. old son LOVES Legos.  This has been a great set for him.  I was pleasantly surprised at the size of the finished product after all the pieces were out of the little box.
5.0	"So, as of my youngest granddaughter's 2nd birthday, I am her FAVORITE grandma!  She loves the movie, \\""Cars.\\""  So, I bought her the Cars pull luggage and the Lightening McQueen Pet Pillow.  When she opened the luggage, she found the pet pillow, that I had packed away.  She pulled it out and for the rest of her party, she refused to put it down.  Kudos to me! :-))"
5.0	I purchased this for a 7 yr. old and he loves it!  He can access the map easily and is careful using the key.  A great purchase!
5.0	The mugs were even better than pictured!  I used them for centerpieces for a Mary Engelbriet themed party and filled some with fake cherries and some with cherry gummies.
5.0	Nice gift idea for a catwoman fan. Arrived as described.
5.0	I paid more than I should have on amazon, but my son loves his Bad Cop/Good Cop. He's a fun mini-figure to play with!
5.0	This is a great family game to play with you kids.  I bought this when my boys were 2 and they still play it today - 2 years later.
5.0	My 3 year old granddaughter was very happy with this cute little pony.  The wings look like they wont break off easily after snapping them into place on the back of the pony.  Looks like it will be a fun toy for a good while....
5.0	Beautiful, My daugther is happy
5.0	The detail of this kit is amazing.  The quality, research, and fit of the parts is the best I have ever seen in any kit.  Built just as is the results would be awesome.  I bought some after market enhancements and in some cases decided the stock was better.  I have not finished it yet but I have only been working on it for a month.  I detail under a lighted magnifying glass so it is taking time.
5.0	I grew up playing this game with my mom and brother. It should really say for all ages cause I don't get tired of playing it when I can find someone to play with me. When I can convince hubby to play with me it will be best out of three. It has some strategy and it's a little on the competitive side cause it's a race to get all your pawns home. This Parcheesi in particular is much better than the one at toysrus, the board is bigger, sturdier, I like the pawns in this one two. I purchased the toysrus first because it was actually in stock this game sells pretty quick and doesn't get restocked as quick, the new version does but I like the classic version more. At the same time I was looking at the one in Amazon with the hope of finding one that was closer to the one I grew up with and I found it.
5.0	Fit perfectly ( a lil long, but easily fixed). Looked beautiful on her. Worked as her costumer and birthday dress (she is a halloween baby)
5.0	It's amazing each and every card is different except for the JQK and i still find it amazingggg
5.0	The tail rotor is great! Many helis don't have it and it makes steering harder. This enables the heli to go back and forward.<br />Battery life is pretty darn good too!
5.0	Awesome was worth buying!
5.0	This die cast of Austin Power's Shaguar is simply superb.  Austin's car from the movie is captured in great 1:64 replica scale. This is the size of your average Matchbox or Hot Wheels car if you are unfamiliar with the ratio sizes.  You could leave this in the packaging which is quite colourful and comes with one of a range of character from the movie screen grabs which sits above the car in the packet.  Which one you'll get though if ordering online is anyone's guess.<br /><br />You're going to want to get this thing out and play with it though.  See my customer images for what it looks like out of the packet.  The car also comes with a removable clear elastic band sort of thing that you can keep on when playing with it to protect the bonnet (hood) from opening up and getting damaged in a car chase or action scene recreation.  It slips on and off with ease. The front of the car is a little bit fragile because of this option, as when the band is off you can lift up the bonnet and see the silver engine underneath.<br /><br />You can also seperately get the American flagged car from the Austin Powers movie. This car and that one are also available together in a Johnny Lightning diorama packaging and come with little figurines of Austin, Dr Evil and Felicity Shagwell as well.  That's a lot more expensive and harder to find option though but if you're a huge fan of these movies you may well want to try and locate.  If you just want the Shaguar then this single packet Johnny Lightning is the way to go.
5.0	My grandson wanted a batman custom.  I found it easily at Amazon, ordered it and it arrivd within a few days. it fit my grandson perfectly.  He adores it.
5.0	What a great first robot! We purchased this for our 5 yr old son's birthday and he loved it. Hasn't stopped playing with it since!
5.0	I was doubtful at first, but love the games readjustment of game play mechanics.  This game became reborn so much so the first edition owners like myself had to buy a converter box just to keep up and since then Fantasy Flight Games has been systematically draining my wallet every six months with new expansions.  Each time a new one, like &#34;the Manor of Ravens&#34;, comes out I get giddy as a schoolboy to check out the new skill cards and new class of heroes, that the expansions provide.  I always recommend to the Descent 2nd ed owner to also take some  time to set up your account at Fantasy Flight Games, and play in the Quest Vault. The Quest  vault is an editor in which you can design your own scenarios, based on the tiles from all your currently owned expansions. The style is that of the patently &#34;Descent&#34; for game play credibility. You can also contribute to the community's tribute of scenario ideas.  Keep flourishing Descent two and thanks for keeping it interesting.
5.0	We got this yesterday in the mail, super fast shipping.  It was easy to put together and seems to be a very good quality for the money.  My daughter loves it! She loves that it came with a detachable latter and that the beds can come apart to make two separate beds.<br />The only complaint she had was a few stains on the pink bedding. Maybe dirt, rust or something like that?<br />Either way,  she loves it and so do I.
5.0	Our infant twins love this toy.  We teach them the concept of &#34;up' by continually placing the pins upright... and now our daughter does it herself. Our son still just knocks them down.<br /><br />Also the ball is not a perfect round sphere so when it rolls on the floor it wobbles, which adds to the fun for the twins.  Finally, the twins double as large rattles or maracas.  Overall a fun toy.
5.0	An awesome family game!
5.0	Was looking for something fun and yet a little more challenging than our grandchild's existing puzzles.  With 60 pieces, he needs a little help getting going, but he enjoyed working it with 'Grammy' and was quite proud when completed.  Excellent Ravensburger quality and sturdiness,  as usual .
5.0	Just like the AG name brand but affordable for mere mortals!  Thank you my daughter LOVED it!!
5.0	LARGER THAN EXPECTED.  PRETTY COOL!
5.0	This is a great game for family and friends.  My friend from Arizona introduced me to the game and after two games I had picked up on the basics and different strategies you can use.  The expansions make this game very fun and add more depth so as not to become redundant.  I introduced this game to my family over the holidays and we became hooked on it pretty quickly.  I grew up with old style RPGs and have been an avid fan of the Setters of Cataan game and expansions as well.  Great game for family and friends.
5.0	I bought this T Track so that my son has more versatility when building his tracks for his trains. It was a great addition to the sets that he has and he is now able to make even more designs!
5.0	Perfect product for birthday's. I used this product as cupcake toppers, this was a great hit with the kids. I highly recommend this product.
5.0	Perfect. Exactly as described-very soft-cutest nose in the world!
5.0	14 month old grandson loves it.  especially after flying for his first time!  Now one of his favorite toys.
5.0	"My son and I study the Korean sword martial of Haedong GumDo. I bought it so we could have some fun with our forms and step sparring. And of course I have always wanted \\""real\\"" lightsaber having grown up with Star Wars as a kid. The saber is very well balanced and pretty durable. I liked it so much that I got the Yoda one for my son."
5.0	Card came in mint shape! My son loves it!!
5.0	My Granddaughter loved it!
5.0	My husband and son just built this in preparation for Christmas morning.  My granddaughter is going to love it....it's sturdy, entertaining and plenty of space for storage etc.   Cant' wait to test it on her...the adults are loving it for now!  Thank you!!!!
5.0	I wasn't sure about this game - it seemed too simple to be enjoyable.  But - it's really, really fun & we've played it every night since it arrived last week.  It IS simple, but fast paced & competitive.
5.0	This is my daughters favorite video game character, she wants to collect them all, She would recommend it to others.
5.0	Nice sturdy puzzle. Provides hours of fun!
5.0	My 6 yr old LOVE Elephant and Piggie, we own every book. They are adorable and well written.
5.0	This was the third Bruder toy that we have purchased for our grandchildren.  They are simply the best toys out there.  The quality and realism have made them a favorite with said children, too.  Undoubtedly, they will get years of enjoyment out of these gifts.
5.0	this buggy is awesome with endless upgrade parts and the VXL system that it comes with is just wonderful it would  absolutely do  70 miles per hour and probably over 100 miles per hour with the right gearing I love it
5.0	bought all of them for granddaughter.....she loves them!
5.0	I bought this for my two year old daughter. I thought she might like to have a truck because she points out real trucks quite a bit.   Great qualities about this truck: 1. I like that this one is pink and lavender, which is perfect for a girl.  2. It's great for children to drive with stuffed animals in the back (at least that's what my daughter does).  3. It can also be used as a sandbox toy.  4. It makes a great toy for both indoor and outdoor use.  5. It is made of plastic, but it is very sturdy and of good quality.  6. It is not too bulky and not too small (the perfect size). 7. It's easy for little hands to handle. 8. The wheels work just fine. They roll like they're supposed to do.  9. It looks just like in the photo.  I recommend this truck for any girl who likes vehicles or dumping sand.
5.0	When I bought this, I waited a long time for it to grow, but I kept on watering it regularly and finally it started to grow. I got VERY excited. Its about an inch tall now and it is SUPER cute!!!
5.0	I purchased this corduroy lion for a baby shower gift.  The toy is soft and well-made - I'm sure it will be cute in the baby's nursery and later will be a favorite cuddly pal.
5.0	I actually purchased this from another store, using a price match from this website. I ended up buying 2 of these at $6.64 each, which was the cheapest I have seen them at. Since my son is starting to enjoy Nerf wars, I thought I would join in the fun.<br /><br />Pro's: Pulling back the hammer to cock it is awesome, it also seems easy to re-cock and fire that second dart quickly. I think it looks cool, and can look really cool if painted. Accuracy is decent, and seems predictable after shooting it a few times. Can accept Nerf scopes. Price, very cheap and seems like a good value compared to some blasters.<br /><br />Con's: Only 2 loaded darts at a time, which is very low compared to most Nerf blasters... That is why I bought 2, dual wielding them with 4 darts makes them a lot more effective and fun.  Hard to cock for children, at least for my 4 year old it seems he can only pull the hammer back about half way (in stock form). Only comes with 2 zombie darts... I wish Nerf would throw in about twice as many darts with all their blasters.<br /><br />Modified: After playing around with them, I opened them up and added some spacers to the spring to make them more powerful. I found that with about a 1/2&#34; spacer the range and trajectory improved a fair amount. It did make them a little harder to cock, but not by much, especially when you consider the performance boost. The air seal seems good out of the box and all I did was add some lube to the o-ring to reduce friction. The barrels & cylinder are one piece so there should be no air seal issues there.<br /><br />Overall: I would buy them again... and again. For around $7 they are fun and perform fairly well, especially if you modify them a bit. I wouldn't recommend them for small children because they will probably have issues cocking them.
5.0	My grandson always loved to play with his toy animals.  I was looking for a barn to keep them in.  This was perfect and he LOVES it.  The whole product including hinges and construction is durable and so much fun for my [...] grandson.  The windows, swinging gates, bull pen and sliding doors make it a toy he wants to play with all the time at grandma's house.
5.0	My older kids are learning about chance and probability, while my youngest is learning his numbers.  Great for all ages.
5.0	Perfect for the Bath my daughter really really wanted a sail boat for the bath and will be great for the pool as well.
5.0	My 15 year old would be horrified to know I wrote this but she has loved playmobile since she was about 7 years old (old enough not to eat all the little pieces) and still spends hours playing with it!  The penguins were a big hit!
5.0	I bought this for my 8 year old, to keep her american girl doll clothes in. It works just as I envisioned - she keeps shoes and things in the bottom tray and the clothes hang on the handle. It is well made, took only a few minutes to assemble, and is affordable unlike the rather ridiculous american girl furniture and other doll wardrobes sold here on Amazon. My daughter loves it.<br /><br />10/21/12 update<br />My daughter still loves this. Me too it's easy to pick up and put in the closet. Just fyi the American girl brand hangers don't fit on the bar... and the additional hangers you can buy to match are overpriced. I found super cute wooden doll clothes hangers at hangers.com
5.0	Zingo is a super fun game!  My 4 yo son loves it and we all enjoy playing as a family!
5.0	The foam material is great. It's a good toy that kids will enjoy!
5.0	This 4pk of wheelies was not found in our area stores and has the exact collection of trucks our 2.5yr old son is interested in. The purchase price was comparable to local stores.
5.0	Awesome!  Hours upon hours of fun!<br />My son and daughter LOVE this!  It's sturdy and while the pieces come apart, they haven't broken yet.  Putting it together was very time consuming, but it was worth it.  This is the favorite toy and has been for the last 3 months.
5.0	Bought this for my grand nephew to work on over the weekend when he visits my sister.  He loves making new bodies for his Hot Wheel cars.
5.0	My 8 year old niece loves this! It's great to play with. It's pretty big and it's not falling apart or anything.
5.0	My son got it as a gift and loves it! Took a bit to put it together but he loves playing with it.
5.0	This toy is not for children.  It has a lot of delicate moving parts that can easily break off if you don't follow the directions exactly.  However, it is a great model that transforms into the 3 different Valkyrie positions.
5.0	My helicopter was resurrected
5.0	Yet another Hess vehicle added to my nephew's collection.  Great quality and wonderful vendor to work with. I am not sure just what I will do when I have purchased all the past trucks in the collection.
5.0	Fits bike well. My daughter loves it. Would recommend, no issues with mounting like others have said in previous reviews.
5.0	My son loves these cars... So cool how they come apart and go back together...<br />I'm sure we'll be extending the collection...
5.0	There was a time when dinosaurs roamed the Earth. But we all know that. The massive Brontosaurus and the fierce Tyrannosaurus Rex, and all that. But I speak of a different kind of dinosaur, one equally extinct in today's market of automobiles as those long-gone giants of flesh and blood. The dinosaurs I speak of were giants of steel and oil, of iron and power steering fluid. They best of them were adorned, inside and out, possessed ridiculous amounts of all that made them great- steel, glass, chrome, and above all lots and lots of fake wood. The last wood-paneled station wagons whose paneling was genuine wood were made in the 1950's, but the ones made since retained premium status. A lesser Vista Cruiser would have had no exterior wood to speak of, so the ones that carried it on their exterior body panels were marked as the best of their kind, kings of the road and undisputed masters of family motoring. There was no minivan in 1971. There was no titanic SUV either. Only the V8 station wagon.<br /><br />This model pays a fitting tribute to all those grand old automobiles- the Kingswood Estate, Vista Cruiser, Electra Estate, Safari, Colony Park and so many more. It carries what I believe are real rubber white-stripe tires, is adorned with remarkably good-looking fake wood, and has a glossy black paint job in addition to a fair bit of chrome here and there. It runs far more than the average Matchbox car- $5 or so in most cases- but it is worth it. Build quality, entertainment value, and educational value are all tops. This car could be used to teach as much about America- and her love affair with cars- and what both used to be like as a trunk of history books.<br />Huge, crass, and inefficient in their use of fuel, cars like the Vista Cruiser are now gone, but perhaps not quite completely. Even the dinosaurs managed to leave some lasting legacy, keep some part of them alive. By that I think I mean alligators and crocodiles. Been around forever. But with the recent trend away from trucks and back towards cars among both the fading minivan and the changing SUV, new vehicles have emerged. Vehicles that serve as an indication that while the exact form of the Vista Cruiser may never again grace the interior of a showroom, something like it may be doing so now. Take a look at the Ford Flex, for one. Ford calls it a crossover SUV, but with that body, that profile, I don't know who they think they're kidding. The Flex is a good old American station wagon, just like this Vista Cruiser. I think I've even heard of some enterprising folks slapping fake wood all over a Flex or two. I don't think, hearing such news as that, dinosaurs like the Vista Cruiser are truly gone.<br /><br />This is as fine a Matchbox car I have ever seen. Not only is it simply well-made and good-looking, but as you can see it represents a tremendous amount, a whole era of motoring and family cars. And for folks like me, who grew up seeing and riding in such dinosaurs of steel, oil, and fake wood, a model like this has tremendous nostalgic value. And models of Oldsmobiles, any Oldsmobile, help serve to remind the world that such cars were once being built. They help, essentially, to ensure Oldsmobile is remembered.trucks and back towards cars among both the fading minivan and the changing SUV, new vehicles have emerged.

5.0	This is an amazing game.  Battletech has an incredibly rich setting, next to star wars and star trek probably the most developed in all the sci-fi I can think of.  The game is extremely deep. Don't be fooled by the dice, while there is always an element of chance this game is usually won by tactics and though. It is also very complicated at its deeper levels and you should keep a calculator handy.<br /><br />The quality of the product is superb. The maps are no longer paper, but wooden boards, the mini's (while unpainted) are of good molding quality.  The books are made of heavyweight paper and are filled to the brim with lore and art.<br /><br />I would recommend this to anyone willing to learn an advanced battlefield board game.
5.0	Definitely play with people you know. Can be a bit off color, so know your audience, and have a good laugh
5.0	We have a couple of neighborhood kids who have these, so our son was quite adamant that he MUST have one (in blue) for his 4th birthday.  Of course, we obliged him.  He has ridden it every single day since, and is always ready to get home to ride it if we are out.  The construction is very solid, it's a snap to assemble when it arrives, and quite simple to operate by the kids.  Thanks for the great product!
5.0	This chair is awesome!!  It is very well made, assembles easily and is very comfy!  I love the padded arms!!  I can't believe what a great price it is too!!
5.0	I love that markers like this allow kids to make pictures that look like them!
5.0	"I purchased the Max and Ruby Beanie Babies for my daughter's Easter Basket this year - needless to say, they were a BIG HIT!  I also purchased a few of the books to go along with them and she has been \\""reading\\"" them their stories and acting the stories out as well - which is why I gave them 5 stars for educational value.  They are small and plush and look very much as the characters on the Max and Ruby show do.  I would recommend to any fan."
5.0	what can i say about glue its very strong and does what its supposed to i would highly recommend  this glue
5.0	A good product that works well with the Melissa and Doug easel that we bought for my youngest for Christmas.
5.0	I was impressed with this 10 inch wonder.  Nice size, boxed and displayed so well, if my grand son had not seen it, he would not have gotten it. Great looking toy, better for a collector!
5.0	My kids, ages 12 and 10 love this game. They love rolling the dice with the cool dice cup mechanism, and almost enjoy the cup action more than the game. The game is easy to understand and master. Highly recommended for those who enjoy dice games!
5.0	Really solid and durable material well worth the price. fits perfectly too.
5.0	No problems with booster or tape! Yes, the booster has to be connected to the yellow wall plate to work. (Safety feature!) This was my 1st experiment with Wall Tracks, I picked this up for $9.99 at a discount outlet store and it's surpassed my expectations for ten bucks. The car it comes with works about 75% of the time. However, I found the Hot Wheels &#34;Super Stinger&#34; (green lizard car, wide at front, narrow at back) is perfect for this and never crashes. I'm guessing the weight of the wider front keeps it forward and therefore never goes sideways. I would search for the Super Stinger and add it to the order.
5.0	Cool product for kids and a nice collectible for adults who are kids are heart.  I like the detail of these Rement products.
5.0	Another Christmas gift!  Grandson was thrilled!
5.0	COMES WITH DIAPER,,,, SQUEEKY BEAR,,, TOYS N FOOD FOR DOLLS ,, UR KID CANT WANT FOR MORE N OFCOUSE THE DIAPER BAG ALSO,,,, GREAT BUY FOR LITTLE GIRLS HAS EVERYTHING IN ONE BAG
5.0	Love the doll, excellent conditions
5.0	I was hesitant to try these arrows since some other reviews stated that they got stuck on the Nerf N-strike, but they work great! You have to push the arrow all the way down and they will fly further than the original arrows. If you don't push them down all the way they will not work. Much better pricing than buying from Nerf!
5.0	Arrived promptly, as described. My 3 year old cousin loved it! Has a neat feature that spins the yellow disks in the air. Great toy!
5.0	Just the right size for toddlers.  Easy to assemble.  Arrived on time and in good condition.
5.0	Came. Nothing broke. Perfect condition all same size. Kiddo had big smile. Thanks.
5.0	Im still unsure whether I open it and use it or keep it in its wrapping for another 50 years!
5.0	I bought this because I collect model cars of the 1950s and I wanted to add some sort of Police Vehicle to the lineup. There are not many available and the problem with the others is that the manufacturers generally use 2 door pillarless hardtops as a starting point and paint them in Police Livery. This is not the way these cars appeared on the streets.    Hardtops were expensive and usually only top-of-the-line offerings; Fairlanes, Bel-Airs, Belvederes, Roadmasters, etc.    This car is, as it should be, a Plain-Jane two-door pillared sedan and would have been Buicks lowest price offering. It wears standard black sidewall tires and plain hub caps (with trim rings) as it would have in real life.    I'm not sure if the Centurys had four portholes on the side or not, but I like them.    The model itself is modest. The Hood and front doors open. The engine is nothing special, just black plastic.    The paint is a little sloppy, but it's still a great car for the price.    I wouldn't consider this to be a toy. I can't imagine a child wanting one of these. Collectors like myself should love it.
5.0	Great item, it is excelent for gift or any event you made, i totaly recommend it, i just love it.
5.0	I bought these for my son who loves dinosaurs. I was impressed with the size and quality of the set. They are very durable.<br /><br />I was looking at a similar set at toys r us for double the price!
5.0	My family and I are as I write this sitting at the table with confused/pained looks on our faces due to this game. Although the marker art game board is quite lovely. All our love to Henry L Collins for the knowledge of knowing.
5.0	Good product at a great price.
5.0	She was perfect, she loved her, plays with it everyday!  The doll was in excellent condition in the package just as it stated!
5.0	These rings are sturdy & a nice addition to our playset.  Liked being able to mix & match the colors of our accessories.
5.0	Great price and use for a small space.
5.0	Just what I hoped it would be!
5.0	My son really enjoys the stories and the activities that are part of the game.
5.0	This is what advertised. Very good quality. Another good think is, what I bought came with 110v/220v 60Hz/50Hz power adaptor. Please see attached photos what I received. You need min 6 hous to build. It is not very easy to install but also not very difficult.
5.0	Highly recommended items to put into any collection, good value for money as well as high detail.
5.0	great size for little ones and not to worry that they eat a piece of crayon (a nephew almost died when choking on one).<br /><br />Great product for 12 to 36 months old will like to have more colors available.
5.0	"The latest iteration of Spektrum's DSM series of transmitters simply blows the competition away. The DX3R is without a doubt the best transmitter you can buy! Yeah, yeah, it's a \\""racer's\\"" radio, but for those who are tired of \\""glitching\\"" (as ALL AM and some FM radios are prone to), spektrum's DX3R is your answer. Spektrum has been working with some RC manufacturers in creating better OEM transmitters for their RTR cars and trucks, but they saved the best for themselves, and why not? They practically own the Spread-Spectrum market.    The DX3R has all the improvements racers wanted from their DX2.0 and DX3.0 transmitters. The grip has a better shape, the antenna \\""bends\\"" at it's base, rather than 2 inches up, and best of all, Spektrum finally integrated the roller used in their \\""air\\"" radios. The roller makes changing settings a snap. Just press and roll, then press again to lock in your choices. Simple.     The wheel can be switched for lefties, and all the appropriate parts are included. This makes the DX3R a transmitter for anyone. It also takes only four AA batteries, instead of eight, as in other brands. The menu has more adjustments to \\""tailor\\"" the way your car or truck performs! Need less oomph for a tight track? Simply adjust it with the roller! How about max power for bashing with your buddies? Same-same!    There is only one gripe I have with this transmitter. Spektrum opted to drop Throttle Dead-Band (TDB) on the DX3R. Now the dead spot just off neutral has to be adjusted out in a way that is more complicated than either the Dx2.0 or DX3.0., both of which have the TDB feature. Also, the exponential for throttle and steering is reversed. I found this out after my E-Maxx did a six-somersault stop, shedding parts along the way (maybe I should have read the instruction manual better!)!    The one major improvement to this system is the receiver. Spektrum is now using \\""micro\\"" sized receivers for their DSM2 radio systems. This makes receiver placement much more practical, but if you use the OEM receiver box, you'll notice that there is a lot more room in it, after installing the DSM2 receiver! Also, the DX3R uses what Spektrum calls \\""modelmatch\\"". This means that your DX3R and ONLY your DX3R can operate your car or truck (think of it akin to your RC car or truck having it's own ignition key!).     Alot of folk I know use the Airtronics M11 and swear by it, but why spend so much when Spektrum offers the DX3R for around $200.00 less! and think of this, if Airtronics owners want DSM, they STILL have to buy a Spektrum module system! On top of all that, the DX3R is HALF the size of the M11!    Spektrum in my book, is STILL top dog for RC transmitters. Sure, you could keep on using your OEM transmitter, and for most folk, that's just fine, but if you want more versatility from your RC car or truck, the Spektrum DX3R is the ONLY choice!"
5.0	The set with the mask only came with one ninjaken so this one was necessary to complete the set.  My kids love chasing me around with them.
5.0	My three year old is a big Toy Story fan! When he saw his bed he jumped and said, Toy Story bed! He sleeps in his bed, and stays there! Finally my husband and I have our bed again!
5.0	My kids love this! They are 4 and 2 1/2. Great learning tool and it makes it fun.
5.0	As a life long fan who collects all things Simpsons, the Kidrobot collectible figures are among my absolute favorites!
5.0	Best Price, good shipping, Had no problems with blower, it works very well. Keeps our inflatable aired up very well.
5.0	I love theses two dolls they're sow pretty .... f*ck the haterzzzzzzzzz that say these two dolls are ugly
5.0	Items are just right for a little one I am sure she will love it Christmas motning
5.0	My son received this as a gift for his 4th birthday. He loves it. Very soft and cuddly for nap time.
5.0	the shipment was fast and I got it early and it great present for anyone that in amish puzzles and barns
5.0	"I got this for my Angry Bird obsessed 5 year old. We used parts on his birthday cake this past weekend for his Angry Birds birthday party!   It took a little while to get the hang of the launcher and some of the \\""buildings\\"" are hard to put together. But...who cares...it's so much fun. We have played and played this and it doesn't get old.  The almost 2 year old belly laughs watching us play!"
5.0	My son had a blast with this! We got it for his birthday a month ago and he's still playing with it!
5.0	This is a great costume. I bought it for my 4 year old to wear to a costume party and she loved it. It fit perfectly and we got many compliments.
5.0	I bought this for my 1 year old.  She loves it.  My only problem with this product is my 3 and 6 year old won't stop playing with it and it is not their toy.
5.0	This is a great mini lego play set for any Doctor Who collector or for your children. It's exactly as described and I didn't have any problems with the shipping.
5.0	Quick shipping and perfect mystique color! I'd suggest using a setting powder over it so it won't smudge or transfer and stain what you're wearing.
5.0	What's not to love?! Make one thing. When you get bored with it, make another! Plus you get to add all these pieces to the rest of the Lego collection.
5.0	My 1 yr old daughter loves this puzzle. Its easy for her to pick up and grab the chunky pieces. She even chews on them sometimes and the paint never chips off. She can put it together very easily also!
5.0	Love this, it is actually much bigger than how the internet shows it.
5.0	I ordered these for my 9 yr old daughter (who's favorite hero is Capt. America) and they fit great! She's worn them everyday - to play in and tries to wear them around town with us! Lol it's a perfect accessory to the costume.
5.0	Came in great condition, some doubles but not many. Overall, it is worth the money considering many cards you receive.
5.0	Bought this for our 8 year old daughter. Definitely needs adult supervision and help, take your time tapping at it so you can get bigger pieces. They are beautiful geodes!
5.0	Great toy set! My 3 year old son loves playing with them.
5.0	My son got a set of Wedgits for his second birthday.  He loves them!  Over and over he builds and knocks down. When we went for his annual check-up, I brought the wedgits, which kept his attention the whole time we waited for the doctor.  (They also kept his hands off the communal toys and books!)  His older siblings (ages 4 through 10) love the Wedgits as well.  They like to make specific structures shown in the included booklet.
5.0	Chinese checkers is a fun way to teach strategy to kids. This tin version is quite durable.    Please note: the marbles that come with this version are SMALL: less than half the size of a regular marble.     So if you want regular sized marbles, go with the wooden versions that Amazon sells.     And if you don't want the marbles falling off check out the version that uses pegs.
5.0	"My neighbor and I have anyways been playing pranks on each other. One day he apparently ordered this stuff. He comes dashing out of his house with it in front of him as I was mowing my lawn. Running at me I think to myself \\""IS THAT PEPPER SPRAY?!\\"" and back up. He comes within a meter of me and I hear a spraying sound. Turns out he got too excited and had the squirt nossel pointing towards his face. It hit him directly on the lips. I enjoyed the next 30 minutes watching my neighbor roll on the ground, vomit, and attempt to wash the liquid off of his face with a hose.<br /><br />After the incident, my neighbor wanted the spray out of his site so he vowed to give it too me as long as I don't use it on him. I use it everywhere and it is the funniest thing. Smells terrible, worth a thousand laughs. Not that much in the bottle so use sparingly unless you buy a few!"
5.0	My young son wanted this for a reward for a good report card and he was so thrilled to get this toy!  So soft and well made.  He plays with it constantly!
5.0	This got me SO much attention, and was highly entertaining! Will sun fade after awhile, but it just became a white/pink flower and still moved.
5.0	"My sister liked it enough to have it under the tree unwrapped on Christmas morning from Santa.  My neices response (she'll be 7 this month) was \\""Wow, I've never seen so many colors\\""!  Highly reccomended for older (school-age) children."
5.0	Awesome quality. My daughter said &#34;Santa brought me an American Girl doll bunk bed!&#34;
5.0	Got these beauties within just a few days of ordering it! Great shipping, beautiful quality. The box was in proper condition and the paint on the mini pops was in tact. I adore this set!
5.0	These are worked great with lots of power. they are very loud like a gunshot when set off though, so be warned.
5.0	6 inch tall<br />and totally adorable<br />holds up good too<br />my niece loved it!<br />and so soft<br />Have bought some before and will be buying more!
5.0	This was a Christmas Gift for my granddaughter.  She loved it.  It fits with the mythology that she is learning about in school.
5.0	Exactly as shown, my daughter loved it.
5.0	Oh my gosh, this stuff was awesome! It's name says it all. I could actually smell it through the bottle so it was kinda hard to keep it discrete but still totally worth it!  Works best in an area that is not ventilated, the stench will linger... The mist is pretty smelly and lasts a little while but if you open the bottle and pour a little out on the carpet or bare floor, just wait a few minutes and people will leave the room.  Also great if you could drip a little or splash some on somebody's pants (we all know somebody that deserves it) they will be smelling like this product most of the day.
5.0	My 4 year old absolutely loves this toy. He always enjoys having a book read to him and he is so excited that he can do it by himself now. the books even have little games that they can play.<br />The only downside is making sure not to loose the pen. My son puts it down and of course never remembers where it is. Since it is so small (which is great for him to use) it gets lost alot. (under the couch, in the bed, put in the toy box and wasn't found without clearing the entire box out)
5.0	Gotta have Itchy AND Scratchy.
5.0	The new additions to the game as a whole new level of excitement and repeatability to the original game and the mall expansion along with it being a stand alone. Only use I have is getting all the pieces back into the box in an easy manner. Beyond that small issue everything is great
5.0	We took two of our grandsons these and have already ordered more of the characters for them. They both love Paw Patrol and were excited to get them. The autistic grandson never put Marshall down the whole day were were visiting them. Thanks!
5.0	Nice and i love it.<br />It was a great price for this kit.<br />I do recommend other people to get this.
5.0	My daughter loved this for her 2 year birthday.  Didn't want to get a smaller, slower one as she can grow into it with the two speeds. It goes very well on grass and pavement
5.0	This is something I have been looking for this for a long time. I am glad to own it now.
5.0	These are great pool toys. My kids loved chasing them around the pool. I was impressed by the battery life too!
5.0	Scary for the birds. Works as advertised.
5.0	I’ll make this short and sweet.<br /><br />Love this figure. He’s about a foot tall and he’s also pretty decently articulated but I won’t test his joints too much since he’s an old figure so I don’t know how they’ve held up over time. He comes with his lightsaber in 3 parts. 2 beams and the handle they go into to. One of the beams was a little bent.  I still love having him around though because he sort of looms over a lot of my other toys.
5.0	Uses them to make tables!
5.0	My baby, by that i meant chrome darth vader minifigure, has just landed on my hand, safe and sound! it is quick and packed nicely with bubble wrap....execellent seller, highly recommended!
5.0	delivered time was better than expected<br />is an excellent option for a present<br />I really recommend it to my friends
5.0	I bought this for a gift. It is very sturdy and made of high quality.The engraving is done with great detail.
5.0	This set provided countless hours of enjoyment, the materials are high quality, and once finished left me with a feeling of great satisfaction. I couldn't wait to order my next kit. I did have to use a few of my own tools though (needle nose pliers) as I have large hands, and the screws and nuts are fairly small. I'm a senior citizen with lots of assembly experience, and frankly I was challenged in following the graphic instructions (no written instructions). But they were clearly printed, and it was fun following each step. The set says for 10 years of age and up. Forget about that! I would say high school age and up, and then only if one has patience and a keen desire to construct a quality set. Despite the minor shortcomings, I highly recommend this set, and/or any other metal set made by the same company. One can check out their website to see all available models, but it's in German so you'll have to go to Amazon to get the English descriptions. (I also put together the Ferris Wheel, another great set!).
5.0	I got these cubes because I was originally looking o replace my old 3x3 and I decided that I could try some others as well. These cubes turned smoothly and don't fall apart. They're the best cubes I've had so far and the 4x4 is my absolute favorite.
5.0	Promptly arrived. Product has no chips or mistakes.
5.0	Much bigger than I expected, which is definitely a plus! An amazing replica that's very detailed. I was really happy when I opened the box and saw how awesome he was. Totally worth every cent.
5.0	She went above & beyond expectations. Thank you so much my daughter loved it and said to tell you she will take great care of it
5.0	I got this toy for my stepson for his birthday. I'm happy to say it was the only present he played with that day.
5.0	A warm day in San Francisco, 8 girls from 18 mos to 4 years and  water table provided hours of<br />happy  fun.  The table is sturdy and simple in design, so less chance of something being broken<br />or not working.  great value!
5.0	The boots were a little big, but we made them work and my little one thought she was Wonder Woman!
5.0	My five year old was so excited to take this to the beach. This is her first kite and she had a blast with it. Her father had to help her, but once up in the air, she was screaming with joy. It landed in the water a few times, but this did nothing to harm it. It came in a convenient little black, drawstring bag, which I really like for when it's not in use. It's sturdy and flies well... what more can you ask? We're very pleased with it.
5.0	We love all of the grave robbers and other Z-man games. This set goes perfectly with grave robbers 1. If you are looking for a fun party game this could be the game you are looking for.<br />If you haven't played any other grave robbers games warning: almost all Z-man card games are pg-13.<br />If you have any other Z-man games you will love this one as much as you love the others!
5.0	I think my almost 2 year old grandson is a little too young for this.  He hasn't quite got the hang of how to put on records
5.0	This is a great extention to the Thomas train track my grandkids already owned.  Super durable and impressive.  Good job!
5.0	This is probably THE Hardest Monster Truck to find in the Stores right now. We went to quite a few stores looking for it. But it was worth it. Our son Loves it and it really does have an Impressive Paint Job. It Retails in Stores for about 4-6 Dollars.<br /><br />It does have plastic horns, so only time will tell if they will break off. Because they are angled backwards we're hoping they don't Break Off as easily as some of the other Monster Jam Horned trucks have. This truck is definitely a must have for any Monster Jam Truck Fan!
5.0	My son received this game for his birthday...he plays it atleast 6 times a day now.  He absolutely loves it.  I like it as well because it teaches him game skills, patience, number recognition, and putting together a puzzle.
5.0	it is a great family game.  it brings the family together every saturday it was worth the money I spent. I love this game
5.0	Great for Halloween prop!
5.0	This one quickly became his favorite!  Recommend!
5.0	This is a great new product line from the markers of play dough!  We loved the fact that everything you need for the project is included in the box!  no looking around for things you need to complete the project.  The product does seem to take a long time to dry so plan for that accordingly.  We will be on the look out for more of these kits in the future!
5.0	I have already had $100 worth of fun!!  because there are 12 in the pack you can pass them out to your friends so they can get their spouses too.  They do take a while to arrive around 2+ weeks (seeing as how they come from China and it's free shipping what can you expect).
5.0	My 10 year old grandson loves this kit. Hard to tell which he enjoys more: building the models or moving them around with the remote.  Well- designed.
5.0	great program - and it runs on my pc, but the content is terrific, just like its predecessors.
5.0	Purchased this for my two grand daughters, ages 2.5 and 5. They love it. It is very well made. The only complaint I have is the stickers seemed to be numbered incorrectly, but it was no problem figuring out where they belong.<br />Worth the price.
5.0	My 2-1/2 year old loves these &#34;guys&#34;. Quality and fun factor is just as we have come to expect from the Playskool Heroes lines of toys.
5.0	It is a great toy and very durable! My son is just a bit too young for it but I know in time he will enjoy it very much! :)
5.0	Amazing statue. The big guy looks huge and makes a statement in my display cabinet. The statue came with some paint blemishes as some of these do.<br />However, they are barely noticeable and it still looks great in my display cabinet. Absolutely gorgeous statue, a must own for superman fans and collectors.
5.0	I bought this model for my 8 year old grandson for Christmas. His dad flys the aircraft for a major airline. He loved it.
5.0	Just as awesome as the picture shows. It is a good size. My child will love this on Christmas morning.
5.0	What a fun and engaging game for the little ones! The Frozen theme will be guaranteed to be an immediate hit. A great way to learn and practice letters.
5.0	"Perfect best friend.  My daughter has had one of these dolls since she was born and it's been through everything.  We wash it at least every other day and the doll has held up VERY well.  I ordered this one as a replacement doll for \\""just in case\\"" since she's so attached and so far she's holding up just as well as the first doll."
5.0	This was bought for a 20 month old to help learn pretend play.<br />The little items that were included, toast & spoons were all put away<br />for when shes older.<br />The cups, plates & tea pot were the perfect size for little hands.<br />I put little graham fishes on the plates and we now have pretend tea time.
5.0	My 5 year old loves it as he plays with grandpa.  It teaches him about circuits.  His favorite so far is the propeller and also the music activated circuit.
5.0	There are small beads on it i guess to make them easy to pic up . really all the small beads are is a big pain it the ass
5.0	Purchased for my WWII history buff husband. He loved it!  My 12 year old son and I enjoy playing it with him as well.
5.0	Whoever painted these really cared. Some figurines you get have such a sloppy paint joy. These were really nice. They arrived quickly, too.
5.0	The Granddaughter loves this especially as she takes dance!
5.0	I got this bag mainly for the two dolphins inside to use as cake toppers.  They were a good size and the cake turned out really cute.
5.0	excellent ship for the price. Lots to do and plenty to make better. The parts are quite detailed and the customer service superb. Great buy!
5.0	Grandchildren loved it!
5.0	Came quickly.  My granddaughter absolutely loves it.
5.0	Good product that I have used on previous occasions for cleaning model railroad track. Highly recommeded to others for the same use.
5.0	Very challenging.  A great gift.
5.0	Oh boy! My 8 yo granddaughter, HANNAH, loved this new toy and really impressed me with her ability to focus for hours as she patiently put this complicated ( to me ) project together!
5.0	Educational, cute and cuddly!  The red parts appear to be made of cotton rope.  The eyes are well sewn and feel safe.
5.0	I do not have a layout but like to get out trains and run them on the floor in a small apartment with lots of sidings and switching. I am trying out this Power-Loc system. So far I like it.
5.0	Awesome cards.  I've used these for years.  They replace at least 50 decks of standard cards.
5.0	This plush toy is exactly as described and was shipped quickly.  Very pleased with the product and I highly recommend.
5.0	This is such a fun potty-training product that I've never seen anywhere. The graphics, cards, and the game are so fun and cute (we all actually enjoy playing the game!). Would highly recommend this to help parents & kids in the potty training adventure.
5.0	It is the first 'computer' toy we have bought for our children (3 and 5), and they love it a lot. Aside from the camera and video options it also has a few games on it. The games a child appropriate and don't go on forever, not having 10 levels before it is over. There is an option to turn off the sound but the kids worked out almost faster than I how to turn it on again. Surprisingly it hasn't annoyed me to death yet. We have even already uploaded some of their pictures to our main computer. We have had the cameras for a month now, and the only very small problem we had was that one of them got frozen (no real surprise since the kids push the buttons pretty aggressively sometimes). I just took out the batteries and put them back in, and it worked as before.
5.0	Really like this little brown elf. Kids seem to enjoy him and named him Carlos. Will be a great holiday tradition for many years to come!!!!!!
5.0	These were a great purchase.  My kids loved them and I loved the price .
5.0	She loved it, the casters are strong enough to hold me...I'm 183 lbs myself.  I wouldn't do any jumps on it with my weight but i can sit on it and move around with it not breaking.<br /><br />Anyhow, the casters aka wheels on the bottom move very smoothly on my hard wood floors.  360 turning is very smooth and nothing needed to be put together as it arrived completely assembled.<br /><br />UPDATE: Since buying this, I also later brought a non-knock off PlasmaCar and the wheels puts lines in my hardwood floors as compared to this Mega Bloks Whirl N Twirl which doesn't.  (Even when I'm sitting on it @ 163lbs (i've lost weight since my first review post)
5.0	This is a good quality train set. Our 4 year old train lover enjoys this set because he can drive the train.  The only downside to this set is that the controller eats batteries.<br /><br />The track and pieces are sturdy and can take some toddler abuse.  You can connect other Little Lionel sets to make a bigger set.
5.0	Great design, and great cards. Go buy this game.
5.0	Cute foam letters and numbers. They stick to the side of the tub nicely. This is the second set I bought, my son plays with them all the time. Lost some so that is why I need a new set. I also bought the pastel colored ones for my daughter.
5.0	Bought for rewards at my kids school and the kids loved them
5.0	My four year old loves this firetruck.  He has played with it everyday since he received it three weeks ago and takes it with him to visit friends - who also love it.  It's very sturdy, cool looking and has three ladders (the one on top and two on the sides which you can take out).
5.0	I sent this to my grandson when he was under the weather, he was so exited.  He loves anything MInecraft and this was large and plushy.  He called me and told me the whole story of Ghast.  I am slowly giving adding to the collection of Minecraft plushies.
5.0	My son calls this the Rah Rah and he is in love with it, I recommend blowing it up as firmly as possible so there's no buckeling in the body but other than that we really enjoy this rider, its totally perfect.
5.0	we will be getting another this winter for spring  it is being used at a free day camp for children, they want a longer higher one next year. thanks so much. Pastor Ulery
5.0	Stars tell the story... AS advertised and described in listing. Color is correct. Size is appropriate. Easy to handle. Smells great. Delivered to me close to what I needed.
5.0	I got these for my sons first birthday and he loves them.  He is a little young for them still, but i build them up and he loves to knock them down.
5.0	I love this figure. Her pose is so cute!!! She is well done for a lower price figure. She is worth every penny.
5.0	These scissors build confidence, actually cut well and are easy for two year old and up. We start with these and build up towards traditional scissors when they are ready.
5.0	Good price too..most all the toy guns in the toy stores just plain STINK. this one is what they should be selling in the toy stores. bought the real UTG holsters to go with it kids gonna love it. they sell toy plastic cheesy holsters and guns for same price or more  Why buy a cheap crap toy gun for 3-4 dollars? spend a couple bucks more and get something that actually looks and feels like real deal.
5.0	My kids love it.  They have nice colors and you can let kids use it because they are very easy to wash.
5.0	My 3yr old Goddaughter/Niece loves<br />these!!!
5.0	Second set I ordered and still fast shipping and good sleaves
5.0	Really fun. Me and my friends get a kick out of it. (Note: If easily offended, do not buy. Not a family-friendly game, unless all grown-responsible adults, with a bit of crudeness...)
5.0	Hey, it's Fisher Price; the colors, the sounds - you cannot fail.  My 15 month old grandson loves the school bus and the tractor set.  He moves the bus around and rearranges the little people.  Then he presses the bus driver to enable the sounds.  Sturdy, well made and not annoying.  Buy it - well worth the money and wish all toys were this well received.
5.0	&#34;Santa&#34; brought this for my four-year-old granddaughter.  She loves it!  The included book with characters that match the toy house characters allows her to &#34;read&#34; the story to her little sister while acting/moving Goldilocks and her bear friends to their appropriate positions.  A great product.
5.0	Bought this to go with the First Computer and know they will appreciate not having to buy batteries all the time!
5.0	The 3rd pet. A cute, colorful, spunky,  and well-designed.  Great gifts for girls of all ages to play with! I recommend this.
5.0	love the necklace. its better than i expected it to be.
5.0	great product. just as advertised.
5.0	"So it goes without saying that Cards Against Humanity is an incredibly fun party game, but are these expansions really worth it? Yes. Yes they are. When you open a fresh copy of Cards Against Humanity, the first card in the pack is \\""A big black [expletive]\\"". I knew that the second expansion was a winner when the first card in the pack was \\""A bigger, blacker [expletive]\\"". We've played with the base game and both expansions a handful of times now, and each time we find a new card from the second expansion we can only nod in approval."
5.0	Arrived in good condition. Looking forward to making it. Cheers, Roger
5.0	This tank is big! Detail is excellent, my son was ecstatic to receive it. When he wheels it around it has a slight squeak like the real thing would! Overall this was an excellent buy. A great tank for a collector as well.
5.0	This is the latest addition to my Harry Potter Lego Collection.  I love Harry and these great books!! It is fun and entertaining to build and collect these sets and the characters!!!!
5.0	She really is very cute.
5.0	Expansion packs to this game are always a bonus!! WOOHOO!!
5.0	My only words:  AMAZING WONDERFUL RARE BEAUTIFUL GREAT DEAL. I prove my point. How? You'll see.<br />Cocky Corny person that only types nice stuff! Smiley Face!
5.0	I bought this for my sister in law who is 33 years old and still obsessed with star wars and she absolutely loved it! It also shipped really fast. It was perfect!
5.0	They fit our Pottery Barn 18 inch doll perfectly!!!
5.0	My five year old nephew absolutely loved these.  I got him the Iron Man 3 and the Ultimate Spider Man & he was very happy with both :-)
5.0	Gave this gift to my 2 year old grandson for Christmas. He loves it - it's one of the few toys he actually goes back to on a constant basis. In the less than a month since the holiday, he is able to recognize and identify 97% of the alphabet. Very durable. The magnet holds better than the plastic versions. I'm very pleased with this. I may purchase another set so he can begin spelling multiple words without reusing letters.
5.0	We received the Let's Imagine Elmo free thanks to Playskool and Bzzagent. I have two daughters; one who is two and the other four and they both loved this Elmo. It was a little harder for my two year old to use but my older daughter is always there helping her with the hats and she is learning how to do it herself. They love to sing and dance along with Elmo with the different hats on and they get into character with him as well.<br /><br />When Elmo is in cowboy mode, you can count up to twenty by squeezing his nose and my four year old really gets a kick out of it. He also sings a song that she is already memorizing!<br /><br />Elmo also has a captain hat that he wears and my two year old loves this one the best. She likes to dance along to the music and press his tummy to hear more from Elmo.<br /><br />Elmo also comes with a prince hat and they both like taking direction from Prince Elmo.<br /><br />Overall, they both love this Elmo and i love that he is fun to play with as well as educational.
5.0	The entire family loved this game and it was the favorite of the holiday with all ages. Easy to learn, yet challenging. Great size for packing and travel.
5.0	As described. Very fast delivery.
5.0	adorable and great price
5.0	This pack is excellent and my daughter was thrilled when she realized she finally got Heath Burns!  I did NOT purchase on Amazon because I found this pack at Target on December 22nd for $20 on sale - along with all combo packs of Monster High Dolls.  I will say it is worth what it's being sold for on Amazon.
5.0	My 3 year old loves this backpack!  It's just the right size for her to carry on her back just like her big brother carries his batman backpack.  Makes her feel like a big kid.
5.0	This is a great baby toy.  My boys danced to the music - it was so cute.  The other two buttons have sounds or make drum beat sounds as babies bang on the top.  Really great for 9months to 18months.
5.0	We will be using the trays to play Mexican Train. Good shape and nice quality. Glad you were able to supply this hard to find item.
5.0	For an educational science experiment with fun galore, try this slime kit!  The chemicals work great and adding food color makes the project cool looking.  The students loved taking their slime home.  I hope they learned a bit of chemistry in the process.
5.0	I bought these dresses at walmart and they are so beautiful on my Barbie dolls. Absolutely gorgeous.  They fit perfectly and the Velcro is well made and does not come apart.  I am very impressed.  The shoes and accessories are so pretty.  My dolls look amazing and ready for a night out on the town.  Happy doll playing young and younger.
5.0	Great products for the M & D easel.  Only problem was the dry-erase marker.  On day 2 of playing with this pen, my children pushed too hard on it when writing on the white board and pushed the ink part back inside the pen, rendering it useless.  Bummer.  Wish there had been at least 1 more pen in the pack.
5.0	This is my second unit.  My first I have had for years and finally started having problems with it (had to reset it all the time).  I have bought others kinds and always like this one the best.  I hope this one last as long as the first.
5.0	My 18 month old daughter loves this toy. We got it for her for her 1st birthday and she hasnt stopped playing with it since. I would also recommend the farm.
5.0	I got this for my 5 year old daughter and she loves it. She sleeps with it every night and I really like how soft it is. Perfect size also. It is not to bug so it does not take up that much space in the bed. It also has gone through being brushed and having tea parties and doctor visits and it is still in one piece.
5.0	Our daughter loves them!
5.0	I purchased this for my daughter to play dress up with and she absolutely loves it.  I basically have to beg her to take it off, thank you!
5.0	The deliver duration was unexpectedly fast and the puzzle is also finely produced
5.0	Product as described.  Arrived on time.
5.0	Glad I got my small 3 1/2 yr old size Small. It's adorable, and she LOVES it!
5.0	Some friends had one of these and we loved it so I bought one for our kids. It's a great toy. Rugged, fast, easy to use and lots of fun!<br /><br />My one complaint is that the tires need to be a bit more sturdy... they come off the rims fairly easily. Maybe a spot of air inside them would help the seal... I'm not sure, but that's the only downside.
5.0	Barbie clothes that fit well and the kids love to swap and make outfits. Delivery is a little long but the girls love them.
5.0	The kids tore it open & played with it all afternoon;  really a hit for young & old alike!  Hoping to order more soon.
5.0	Has all main princesses perfect for growing little girl and each had different hair color so any girl can relate to her favorite princess and her friends
5.0	i recieved this as a gift for my baby shower. my first thoughts were that it was a gloworm rip off and silly looking, it doesn't even stand up, the music is cheesy and it was sterotypical boy or girl colors. i really didn't like it so i put it in the baby's toy box and forgot all about it.  I WAS SO WRONG!  a couple of months ago we returned from a trip and all of my sons toys were still packed but he wouldn't settle down for a nap so i went searching for something to cuddle with and pulled the seahorse out. we haven't gone a nap without it since, and i'm on here today buying 3 more... 1 for each grandma's house and one 'just in case'!  here are some of the features that i love:  - the music is adjustable, and at the highest setting it is loud enough to block out other sounds, but not too loud to bother the baby  -the light is a soft glowing light that my son just loves to gaze at  -the body of the seahorse is a soft fuzzy material that is soothing when he runs his hands up and down it  -the fins are made of a satin-like material, similar to the feel of the tags on the taggie, when he's just not tired enough to fall asleep he plays with the fins and it soothes him  -the seahorse is actually washable, although the tag says only surface washable, it's easy to take out the insides and throw it in the washer. i haven't tried drying it in the machine, but it washes up well in the machine  -you can turn the music off (it took me forever to figure this out) the music plays for 5 minutes or so, and it is easy to turn on by mistake... but hold down the tummy for a second and the music and light fades off (which is actually a nice feature, baby doesn't notice it turning off)  - turns on easy enough that my 5 month son can turn it on on his own when he wakes up (i don't think he does it on purpose, but when he wakes up in the middle of a nap upset he has turned it back on and settled back down)    - helps the cosleeping transition. we cosleep at night and he naps in his crib during the day. we were having a hard time with this, and i would end up laying down with him in our bed after the torture of him screaming in his crib for a half hour. it was awful. now that we have this toy nap times aren't a problem! at night my son rubs my arm to fall asleep or if he wakes up in the middle of the night. the belly on the seahorse must feel similar enough to skin, because he runs his fingers up and down the belly the same as he would with my arm.     i hope this review helps, my first impressions couldn't have been more wrong, and i'm glad i gave this toy a chance. now we own four of them!
5.0	My daughter wanted to be Minnie for Halloween.  We had our own bow, so we got the traditional Mickey ears.  They're very soft and comfortable.  The headband is covered in soft black fabric, so there are no pointy or hard parts.  The ears are a semi-rigid material (maybe like a cardboard?) also covered in soft, plush black fabric.  They're much softer than I expected.<br /><br />They would fit a child to adult sized head.  I've worn them myself while playing at home, and they comfortably fit on my head.  I love the versatility of easily changing these between Mickey and Minnie ears with the addition of a simple bow.<br /><br />These will be great to play with for years to come!
5.0	This is really cool! I absolutely love it! I am amazed at the detail on this little hammer! I am also impressed by the weight of it! Love this product. I have not had it for very long so I do not yet know if it can be scratched by my keys or not but so far, it seems like a sturdy product.
5.0	Just what the little guy wanted! Great condition, still loves it!
5.0	I have been building scale models since the 1960s when Renwal ran the scale model show, followed by Monogram and then Revell. Once Tamiya came on the scene I chosen them to be my Sherman Tank supplier as well as Italeri which is another fine scale model company. I used my M4A3 for a conversion project that came to mind where I switched hulls and turrets from one to the other to get the desired tanks. I still have both original tanks in their respective kit boxes and will build them each straight out of the box. I can never have too many Sherman tanks around. There are so many parts with the kits that one could supply at least two tanks and with the figures the complete crew can be represented. Be sure to see Hobbies in a Barn on Facebook for more.
5.0	You just can't go wrong with Hot Wheels cars for a 3 year old.  He plays with them endlessly in all sorts of different scenarios.
5.0	This was a huge hit at Christmas for my 1 year old niece. We all had a laugh because all of the older kids wished they had one in their size to play with!
5.0	you cant take this to the park without every kid around wanting to stomp it.  great buy and it takes some time to loose its excitement value.
5.0	This is a terrific game - we love it!  All the grandkids get involved - everyone enjoys it.  It's fun for all ages, because everyone has seen Disney movies!  Big variety of questions, and since difficulty varies too, all can participate.  Highly recommend!
5.0	a very happy grandchild # 11
5.0	Great! I wish there wasn't a word requirement though, filling space is really annoying to the reader and the writer
5.0	My 21 month old son received this for Christmas and it is his favorite toy.  He puts the attachments on and off and uses the foot pedal all by himself.  I would highly recommend this toy!  All his friends want to play with it too.  <br />This plastic piece that covers the attachments is a bit flimsy.
5.0	My 9 year old nephew loved this item as a Christmas gift and was completely unaware the difference between these planes versus the $60 planes he asked for.
5.0	Very nice piece \Thank you
5.0	Kids had a blast at our party! Really got people playing with it. . . . . . . .
5.0	This is a must for small children.  It holds them level in the water, where traditional life preservers tilt them on their back.  The child in errect in the water with this one!  Love, Love Love it
5.0	"We have been using tattoos as a reward for our son primarily for potty training. It is working quite well and we have gone through hundreds of tattoos. This is the second set of Savvi brand tattoos we have purchased and the quality has certainly improved. Those of the previous set, Dangers of the Deep, had very short life spans, lasting a couple days. The tattoos in this new set are surviving twice as long. Not to mention, the spray bottle is a nifty alternative to a wet towel for moistening them.<br /><br />Yes, as others have stated, some of them may a bit graphic for those with more discerning tastes. Both my wife and I think they are \\""pretty sweet\\"" and my son loves them (he is 4)."
5.0	This game is fun for children and adults.  You determine the pace... It can get really hectic passing the egg - you don't want to be caught with it. There was a problem with removing the battery cover on the egg.  Otherwise would recommend.
5.0	My kids absolutely LOVE playing LEGO!!<br />Especially this specific one, their eyes seriously lit up when they received this as a gift from their gramma.<br />LEGO from the LEGO movie?! A dream come true! They were in their element! :)<br />It's something they play with time and time again and don't get bored<br />Great product and well LOVED!! Definitely a must have!
5.0	This game is FANTASTIC. A must have in any house with adults who can handle off color humor.
5.0	Happy with product  great service
5.0	I happen to own one of these cars, and I hadn't been able to find a model of it until I shopped on here. The price was perfect and came to me in the mail like it had just been made yesterday. It looks new, and everything on it appears to be there (and probably works). I have never actually opened it, so I can't say whether or not things move, but it looks just like my 92.
5.0	Super cute and great price!! My son was a great prince!
5.0	This is one case where the picture really does look like the product
5.0	My 4 year old &#34;loveloveloveloves.....&#34; this!  Her head just about exploded from both Frozen and all the art supplies. They're all high quality crayola products loaded with so many bright vibrant colors. The case is pretty solid. I think it's some sort of reinforced cardboard with a wrap for the picture. Everything is easy to get out by just pressing one side down and then it pops up out of the holder - same thing for putting away so here's hoping this helps keeps us organized.  It's a great &#34;wow&#34; present for your little artist. She's already made me 2 cards in the time it took to write this &#60;3
5.0	Gave as Christmas gift to our neighbor's 5 year old son...He LOVES it! Well made according to &#34;mom&#34;!
5.0	"I loved this product!  I am purchasing 2 of them, one for each family of my grandchildren for Christmas. As well as some books on ants, an ant puzzle, ant stamp,and ant games and an insect reference guide.  I purchase one for myself for a trial run, and I am not parting with it!  I wanted to see how I could facilitate getting the ants here by the time I gifted the ant farm so the children could enjoy their gift right away.  ScienceKit, where I ordered them had the ability for me to pick the ship date.  The ants arrived with a heat pack to make sure they arrived alive, and they did.  They came from California and we live in Michigan.  I did not really have to poke the 4 ant starter tunnels that they recommend.  The first day the ants figured it out on their own.  I had about 3 ants a day die for the first three days, and all of the rest are still alive after 3-4 weeks.  I was glad to do the trial run as I have some pointers for the moms.  When I opened the lid to get the dead ants out (as recommended) I panicked as about 5-6 escaped before I could get the lid back on.  After I caught them in a small plastic container I put that container and the ant farm in the frig for 20 min or so to let the ants go dormant so I could get them back in, which worked fine.  Deciding that this was probably not conducive to good health for the ants as I had to repeatedly get the dead ones out, I discovered that if I put the ant farm in an empty ice cream bucket when I took the lid off, any ants that escaped could not crawl up the side hence I could easily slide them into a small container to dump back into the ant farm.  As the ants tunneled and tunneled, more went underground, and less where on top so this became easier.  When putting the lid back on I had to make sure that none of thier little legs got trapped in the lid. The only bad things is the ants got less active after their tunneling was done. I found some replacement gel called \\""Ant Chow\\"" on line so I can reuse this product."
5.0	It has been hard to find these big transformers that don't transform. My son is 3 not ready to manipulate the functional transformers, so these work perfect.
5.0	We received this product as a gift about 8 years ago. It has held up perfectly for that long - through 4 children. None of the pieces are broken, faded, ripped or had to be thrown away. We do clean them regularly and make sure they air dry. Our kids have loved building with them. Our older style is a bit thicker than these, but I suspect these stay on the wall easier. We highly recommend this product!
5.0	Although my granddaughter received another set like this for Christmas, this one came with a blonde wig, which was different.<br />She has two Liv dolls, so she could use this set.  Delivery was on time.
5.0	Just started to collect figures but I must say I am impressed, should easily cost 100$+ in my opinion. Yolo!
5.0	I can't really say it's durable yet. I bought it for my niece for her birthday a few weeks ago, but it appears to be well made.<br /><br />What I can say is she loves it. It's one of her favorite stuffed animals.
5.0	my 2 yr old loved this
5.0	Wonderful tool and kids love it
5.0	Perfect for my fairy and elf-loving 9 yr old daughter, who saved up to earn/buy this herself!
5.0	Even though it is rated for age 5 or above, I bought it [at thestore] for a 3 1/2 year old and she loves it.  The training wheels were the main selling point for me as I won't have to buy her a preschool scooter and then another one when she is older and it looks like the big kids scooters, so she loves to use it.  It came with the wrist guards and assembly was very quick and easy.  The wrenches are provided and you have to have one screw driver to put it together.  I highly recommend this item.
5.0	This is a beautiful heart-shaped Name Train vehicle that can be added on to your other letter-shaped Name Train vehicles. It looks great, it feels great, and it rolls great. We love it! 5 Stars
5.0	My husband and I have empty nest syndrome but we are like kids at heart so we bought this just for us. I can't wait to have grandchildren so we can include them. This will become a Christmas tradition.
5.0	I got this for my 6 year old son with moderate autism. what a god-send! he uses it every day, for several hours. i bought the speaker accessory so he doesn't have to use the head phones all the time. it is so easy to change the song list. he is able to use it independently, except for pushing the song vs. story button. the icons and ability to customize the icons have made it so he can quickly search for what he wants. i found the drawing screen for the icons challenging at first- but even me with my lack of artistic talent was able to accomplish the task so he knows them. i would give this my highest recommendation- very tough player- dropped who knows how many times- yet keeps going. the best thing i've purchased for him in a very long time. well worth the money.
5.0	I purchased these because they looked and sounded just like the Faber-Castell Gelatos which sell for a higher cost.  As far as I can tell, the only difference is the lower price.  Great for crafting.<br /><br />Fast shipping. Order process was perfect.
5.0	Schleich products never disappoint.  Super high quality and my son just loves them.  He hauls them all around the house and when we go out anywhere.  I am always checking for a good deal on prime shipping for these and adding more animals to our collection.  Great detail and super durable. These will be in great shape long after he tires of them.
5.0	We bought this toy for my 16 month old son after he showed some intrest in it at a friends house.  He loves it!!!!  As soon as we get home from work in the afternoon he runs over to the fridge and plays with it. He has even shown intrest in it for more than one day.  Yesterday he was even singing with it.  My son has an attention span of a 16 month old (all parents will know what I am talking about)  This is one of the only toys that has consistently kept his intrest.  I would recommend it to anyone who wants a few moments without a child hanging on them.  It might not be the quietest of toys but it is better than most.
5.0	I was amazed that it came so quick. And my grandchildren love it. yes I would tell others to check you out.
5.0	Being a Grandmother to 4 kids, you can't have enough blocks to build with.  All of them enjoy carrying this bag.  We have had it for 2 years now and the bag has really held up.  The zipper is still actually working even after 2 years.
5.0	I just happened upon these by chance after seeing them featured on the Amazon homepage and I'm so glad I purchased them for my 5 yr old son (will be 6 in the fall)!  Normally he loses interests in toys pretty quickly but these have held his interest.  Is it just me, but they all seem to have the same voices as the Dinosaur Train toys?  I think the $15.99 price is right on, don't pay more!  I can hardly wait to add to the collection with the larger dinos that will be available in the Fall!
5.0	Yevetal! He's big, he's mean.... and he's so gosh darn soft! I think Pokemon Center is determined to make their plushies so soft that they're irresistible! XD<br />Ok, he's awesome! No denying it! Beautiful blue eyes, beautiful detail! The black markings on his belly/wings could have been embroidered, this is true. It is more like a fusion set into the fabric, but hey! You'll know how much he's loved by a few years! I love how the claws were made! They can easily fit around my finger! ^_^ This and I love the fact that they use an embroidery to make some of the markings on many of their plushies!<br /><br />I really don't know what else to say! He's very lifelike and well made!<br />Last pic is a size comparison of him and Xerneas (yes, that's my foot measure XD I wanted to give a size comparison) . Yevetal is larger in-game, but even if he's smaller as a plush than Xerneas he's still awesome! I highly recommend Pokemon Center plushies like him!
5.0	My son is 15 months old and when I would take him to local Early Childhood classes he would always go play with the school's brick blocks like these.  So I decided to get these for him for Christmas.  He loves to stack them.  Great value!
5.0	Schleich toy animals are hand painted and are so life-like looking.  They also have a nice weight to them.  My granddaughter loves these toys - we've been collecting many.  The shipping company &#34;Really Great Toys&#34; had a delivery date of July 10 - 15 (something like that) but the hedgehog showed up before July 4th holidays.  Great service!
5.0	In a world ever changing Fisher price keeps some things simple. I had this when I was a baby I remember it well with wood shapes and now my son is learning and playing with the same type of toy
5.0	This was a great purchase. My granddaughter loves it  easy to put together. Light weight and easy to push.
5.0	I've lost around 10 discs so far. My roommates complain the discs hurt to much, so I let my friends shoot me with it. It doesn't hurt. =D
5.0	This hive is awesome!  We have had it for about 6 months and my two daughters (6 and 8) have spent hours moving the pieces around and racing the bugs.  The hive closes up nicely and keeps all of their hexbugs together neatly.  The girls pretty much abuse this toy, but it is holding up nicely.  The pieces fit even after tons of moves.  Nothing has broken although I swear they have tried their best.  They even manuever the pieces specifically to get the bugs stuck, still no issues.  Honesly, I can't think of anything bad about this set.
5.0	Love it. Actually rec&#34;d more than ordered. Customer service great. I painted one to match my other kitty so I now have two for my terrarium.
5.0	These pillows have been enjoyed for over a year by our young son, and even mostly survived attacks by our dog. ;)
5.0	A gift for my 1 year old niece...once she got over being scared she loves it now.
5.0	I love this card because I have it in a blue black white deck and once it comes out its just a matter of time before all the creatures on the table will be under my control.
5.0	This is an awesome game! Both my 4 yr old & 2 yr old play with it & have stacking contests ! You won't be disappointed .
5.0	My daughter was excited to unwrap this on Christmas day.
5.0	Adorable shoes for the outfit we got our granddaughter for her doll on her birthday.  She loved them which made us very happy.  They did seem well made and were reasonably priced as well.
5.0	Great quality and it comes with everything shown in the photo. I was expecting the images to be blurry and dull, but they are the complete opposite. All of the images are clear and vibrant. This set is perfect for my sons birthday party which I ordered it for. I know he's going to love it!
5.0	awesome tools for learning child. been looking for learning tool for growing toddler and i believe we have found it.
5.0	my sister wanted a power bank for her new phone and i'm happy to give her this item.. i don't know much about this kind of stuff but I think this 10000 mAh is good enough.
5.0	First of all, no stickers! That's awesome ^^  Trick is that it feels loose, so first time I thought it would fall into pieces.  But as soon as you get used to it, it becomes very cool and fast.
5.0	This fuse works exactly as advertised. My PT-19 is airworthy yet again!! I am glad, because this model is discontinued, and I would hate to see it go...
5.0	This game is really fun!
5.0	Have you ever bought a toy for a kid where he was honestly jumping up and down because he was so excited?  This is that toy!  The durability and quality if this fire truck is sure to be passed on to my grand kids. That alone makes this rather expensive toy worthwhile.  My almost 3 year old played with the fire truck for nearly four hours last night.  I even let him fill the water tank multiple times and wash other Lego vehicles in Tupperware bowl which he thought was super cool.  The ladder really extends quite high, taller than he can reach.<br /><br />I would say the only real negative is now I want to buy other bruder toys for him because he loved the first so much, as do I.  It is hard to find a quality toy nowadays and this one truly is.
5.0	The grandchildren love this toy
5.0	Bought these for the ice cream for kids they loved the colors at my party will be buying more for next years party
5.0	I purchased this item as a father's day gift. He hasn't stopped playing with it. He did end up having to get a couple of extra batteries after the first one died on him while playing. This is a blast!
5.0	The box is literally filled, with the cards being stacked vertically, vs the original game where the cards were on their side. The cards feel professional, and are about the size of your hand. The delivery came in about a week, and I found no problems with the product. Opening the case without ripping the flap might be a pain the first few times, but will eventually become very easy.<br /><br />Obviously don't get this without having the base game. If you buy this and don't like it, but you didn't try the base game first, you fail at life and all of its prospects. If you still aren't sure for some weird reason, I suggest you play some rounds of the game Pretend You're XYZZY online, which allows you to play this, and all of the other expansions, for free against others. Playing this will let you know how you will feel about the game.
5.0	These are wonderful gifts for children, and decorations for your home.  I loved the feel of the fur, it is so soft.  The item was exactly as pictured and better when it arrived.
5.0	nice product we love them. perfect fit good color looks great glad we decided to purchase them for our grandchild.
5.0	My daughter received this doll for her sixth birthday, and she absolutely loves it!  It was the only thing she requested for her birthday, and she has not been disappointed with it.  As we read in another review, newborn diapers work very well.
5.0	Ok, these things are made of plastic and are made in China, they are not made out of tempered steel by German engineers.  So obviously they are not perfect, but all 12 of mine worked out of the box, and you know what even, if a few didn't work, it wouldn't have really upset me at this price, I was more or less expecting that but was surprised that they all worked.  This was a stocking-stuffer for my kids and they had a blast with them.
5.0	"I purchase the Teen Trends outfits for my Mini Super Dollfie (Luts Delf Kid), and they fit great, minus the shoes.  The slippers fit in this outfit, but just barely.  The robe is soooooooooooooooo soft, I wish they made them in my size!  My doll is very comfortable and happy in this robe.  The accessories are precious, too!  The little eye mask is laugh worthy (in a good way!), and the nail file is too cute!  Very thick, \\""warm\\"", plush robe!"
5.0	I would have probably given this thing 4 stars, but it helped me teach my son to ride his bike on his own in less than 15 minutes.  That alone is worth more than 5 stars in my book.  It's decently made and easy to install.<br /><br />In terms of use, my suggestion is to not get ahead of yourself...  Keep your hands on the bars and just push your child around an open parking lot for 15 - 20 minutes.  You'll likely be tempted to take your hands off and let your child ride on his/her own after several minutes, but I found it to be better to make sure they are completely comfortable with the act of &#34;riding&#34; before that happens.  Good luck!
5.0	These boots are adorable, and I am sure they will look good with her new outfits.
5.0	Our 4 year old got this in the mail yesterday and has been playing with it for 2 days straight.  It's great at keeping him entertained, giving lots of opportunities for different types of play and challenges him to improve his fine motor coordination & strength.  I wanted to give a complete list of what exactly is included in this set, as, had we known earlier all that it contained we would have bought it months ago.    R2D2 storage caddy with 6 Star Wars stamps under head (jedi fighter (space ship/plane), jedi insignia, clone trooper helmet, General Grievous & 2 we couldn't identify), 3 half molds on feet (Ahsoka, C3PO & Obi-Wan), side jets on R2D2 that you can put red Play-doh through to make it look like he's flying, removable head is also a press to create shapes (Play-doh worms) that are not Star Wars related but makes it look like R2D2 has hair  Anakin 3D mold  Push out light saber mold (the mold is the light saber's handle)  General Play-doh tools that store inside R2D2:  plastic rolling cutter (like a pizza knife)  plastic knife  plastic scissors  3 2-oz cans of Play-doh
5.0	a nice add on to &#34;You've Been Sentenced&#34; game. The good cooks in our party really enjoyed these cards.
5.0	GREAT set! Comes with plenty of blocks of various shapes and sizes- more than I expected. Durable, brightly colored, and offers lots of creative opportunities. Lots of fun.
5.0	I was very, very pleased with these stamps, they came in a nice protector sleeve, and were in perfect condition.
5.0	A perfect little set to go with the Hape -Playfully Delicious - Gourmet Kitchen. Everything has its own place and the salt and pepper shakers even make noise when shaken. Bought for my 1 y/o and she loves stirring the pots and pretending to eat the food she &#34;makes&#34; while mommy can get some real cooking done.
5.0	This is a very nice and well done figure the paint lines were clean and the details pretty good for a small figure. The price was pretty low when I purchase this from Amazon so I guess I am a little more favorable to the figure.
5.0	An amazing gift for a young girl.
5.0	"I bought my three year old son these foam letters as we were running out of foam letters that we had previously bought from a national chain craft store.  I'd say that the Chenille Kraft foam letters are better quality than what we owned previously: i.e. the Chenille letters and numbers are all cut out completely and are all perfect (more than I can say about the national chain store's version....).  As a note, these are not self-adhesive letters, you would have to apply glue yourself on them if you wanted to stick them down as a craft.<br /><br />Size: Each letter is 1 and 3/8\\"" tall and wide.  The numbers are a bit taller at 1 5/8\\"" and are narrower (of course) at 1\\"" wide. They are a decent thickness at around 1/16\\"" thick (same thickness as the national chain letters we own).<br /><br />Variety:  They give you an excellent variety of letters and numbers -- I first released a smaller amount of the Chenille Kraft letters by scooping out a random 20oz (by volume) cup of letters/numbers and we found every letter of the alphabet and every number plus lots of extras, so you don't have to wonder, say, that some letters are not present.<br /><br />Colors: The letters and numbers are are solid colors and appear in the saturated-color basic-crayon-pack colors of red, orange, yellow, light and dark green, blue, purple, and pink.<br /><br />Amount: There is a massive amount of letters/numbers here, this is way enough for say a birthday party or large gathering, or for ongoing play with multiple children.<br /><br />Overall, we are pleased, they are what we are looking for, my three year old son likes to use these letters with our help to practice the alphabet and we spell easy words for him (\\""cat\\"" \\""dog\\"", his own name). Sometimes we glue them down onto drawing paper. Lots of fun."
5.0	Bought this as a Christmas gift for my 5 and 7 year old from one of amazons daily lightning deals for like $2. They seem to like it and have fun when they play. Well worth the sale price!
5.0	I bought this for my 8 year old daughters room. She has a little chair that is her &#34;reading space&#34;. So I ordered this swag chandelier to go over her &#34;reading space&#34; and give it just a little extra pizaaz. Now she loves to curl up in her space and read books. I honestly could not be happier with it. It is just small/big enough for a little girls room. And it really gives off good light. It isn't gaudy like some chandeliers. I would recommend this to anyone. It also comes with the hardware to wire it directly if you don't want the swag.
5.0	Gift for my one year old niece. She loves it.
5.0	My daughter takes her dolls EVERYWHERE! They are well loved but get rather dirty quickly. I loved the fact that this doll is washable! She has taken a dip in the washing machine and has held up fine! The doll is precious. She very well made as to be expected from the Madame Alexandre brand. This sweet doll has provide hours of pretend play for my little girl.
5.0	This was a gift for my friends 6-year old son. He loves it, and uses it as his pillow each night. I had not heard of these before, but my friend said this is one thing her son wanted for his birthday. So I can't say whether it is the real deal, but in the end does it really matter? It's not about a name brand, all that matters is that the product is well made and is enjoyed by the recipient, right? The fabric is super soft, the hook and loop closure works great, and it's just an overall great product. I would definitely buy this product again.
5.0	Really nice and I'm sure my daughter will like when she sees it tomorrow, but I was hoping it was bigger than it is. My daughter is 5, so hopefully she is able to fit in it! Other than that, it's exactly as described above.
5.0	My son is 9 & loves legos. He put it together in no time! He plays with all of his legos for hours. Great choice.
5.0	Was just what was pictured.
5.0	I have not bought this set. But I have held so many lemonade stands and am using all of my allowance money to buy this set. From what I see and heard this set is outstanding.
5.0	It looks great. Its a Christmas gift so havent used it yet
5.0	i needed a table that would fit both my 3 yr old, 6 yr old and any friends or family. this is perfect. its not to bright and hideous as some of them. its light weight to move, it can be hosed off and it seats 6 comfortably. I even fit at it for picnics! the umbrella is a big hit to keep the sun off the kids. great item for the price.
5.0	My grandkids (ages 4 - 9) LOVE this game. Easy to play and fun even if they don't win.
5.0	Fisher Price never fails.  This is the favorite toy at my house.  I am actually going to buy more cars as two isn't enough for this group of kids ranging from 18 months to 5 years old.  I had my daughter put this together and it took her about 30 minutes.  You will need a Phillips screw driver.  I was actually impressed with the size of this toy,  I stands 3 feet tall and the cars can take different twist and turns.  It comes with two cars one with a  boy driver and one with a girl driver so it is enjoyed by both genders. It's fun to see how the kids imaginations run wild with this toy.  A little tip.  If the track gets dirty or if you want to make it go a little faster put some wipe some furniture polish on it and they will fly!  Great toy for the price from a trusted name we all love... Fisher Price, I was fortunate enough to get mine free from Fisher Price for trying it out as I am a member of bzzagent.com,
5.0	This is the best Square-1 to get if you want one. It is a good cube, but it was a lot harder than I expected.
5.0	This thing is Badaz!!!!! My Daughter has had hers for 5 years now. Unfortunately she's finally getting too big for it so I'm giving it to my nephew for his boys! It goes anywhere she's taken it through deep mud up hills I thought for sure it would never climb. It literally goes miles before you need to re charge it!!! I would plug it in every few weeks or so and she used it every day!! The battery holds a serious charge!! Fortunately I never needed to replace it since its about 100 bucks for the battery. The crappy little radio broke in the first month but that's certainly not why we bought it!! The only thing I did replace in 5 years is the wheels the rubber dry rots after a few years but you get a set for 35 bucks. So no big deal!! Honestly I'm shocked that's all she broke smashing it into as much stuff as she had done over the years. I would highly recommend it no other battery powers ride on toy even comes close to its traction and power even with 2 people in it the neighbors power wheels jeep cant catch it or even climb the hills it can let alone go through mud.
5.0	These are very cool! Comfortable and fun but huge! They are hard to fit in my van to take to the beach. Perfect for a pool in your yard or somewhere you don't have to transport.
5.0	My granddaughter loved it.
5.0	I bought this for my grandaughter, it works and looks just as stated in the discription. She loved the doll
5.0	Honey viscosity. Dries clear, possibly with a very slight amber tone (hard to tell because I was filling deep holes with the glue). Easy to machine after24 hour cure at room temperature.
5.0	My kids LOVE this toy!! The 3-year-old loves to press the giraffe over and over and my 6-month-old loves to watch the balls bounce. It provides hours of fun for our family. A favorite!
5.0	It was very great to see and use thanks
5.0	This puzzle was an excellent addition for my lesson on the &#34;life Cycle of Frogs.&#34; My kindergarten students love it!
5.0	My 2.5 and 5 years old love this set. They can sit still for an hour playing this. I only let them play with it outside because scraping step on dried play doh on your floor is not fun. They came with good amount of play doh, but I decided to buy more to last them through summer.
5.0	These are all the rave on YouTube. I looked for them at my local stores and no one carries them. My daughter loves them!
5.0	The first one we received had damaged side panels. It's probably pine- very light- but Amazon sent a speedy replacement and it was fine. I helped my husband put it together, and with the pivoting front axle I think 4 hands are better than 2. Our daughter loves it! (Though we didn't consider how much exercise it would be at the time we purchased it. Lol)<br />In fact all the kids love it and were very intrigued to learn the sides are removable so they could climb into themselves (we are around kids age range 1-5)<br />It holds up to 200lbs, it's all wood and metal but the wheels. It had no problem with our slightly treacherous,  bumpy, hilly back yard. I think it's very lovely and stylish. The handle folds underneath the Wagon for ease of storage. We keep it in our building out back- I certainly wouldn't leave it out in the weather at all. The sides have a thin varnish but the bottom has little to no varnish.
5.0	Got this so baby would be distracted from the real remote when we change the channels or start movies. The remote actually has real volume controls, so you can turn it down if playtime is too loud. And there are a couple different interactive songs/narrations to keep her entertained. She puts it in her mouth and it still works great. The only downside is that there's only 1 light on it, so she does lose interest in it more quickly than the VTech Touch and Swipe Baby Phone. But fortunately we've finished with the real remote in that time. Second best toy investment we've made for her.
5.0	I bought this as a gift for my 4 year old grandson and it has become one of his favorites.
5.0	daughter loves this kind of stuff. Came before Christmas
5.0	My 7 month old and 4 year old are interested in this toy. The 7 month old hasn't figured it out yet but likes to push the buttons and &#34;eat&#34; the characters.
5.0	I ordered this for my boyfriend because we LOVE apples to apples and we were getting pretty used to the original cards. The expansion pack has loads of new cards and some of them are pretty creative and modern. We play the game with the two sets mixed together at least once a week!
5.0	The Webkinz stuffed animal itself is pretty typical -- cute and soft -- what is great is the website that goes along with it.  My daughter is engaged and learning new things from the site.  It's very creative!
5.0	Fun little game from the old school version of what I played back in the day. Bought for my 7year old for Christmas. My 7year old has lots of fun with this as it has many levels of gaming to chose from. Helps 7year old with memory and skill.
5.0	i luv britain.<br /><br />i just noticed something there is no china/<br /><br />why is that?
5.0	This game is fun. We have Game Night parties every so often. Cranium was the perfect game for groups of people to play. We had a ball and laughed very hard!
5.0	Feminine version of one we had for grandson. A great portable toy.  Instantly installs on Hi chair, crib, car seat, pack n play. Love love love it.
5.0	These rubber bands are colorful and sturdy according to my daughter who makes bracelets with them. They do not burst easily. She loves them so I'm glad. Will buy again except the price is a little high for rubber bands. Yes I know it 7200 in the pack but.....
5.0	adorable doll, very much liked by five year old neice.
5.0	Too cute!  My grandson loves his Fisher Price Little People Musical Zoo Train.  It is so cute and perfect for little hands.
5.0	This Syma helicopter is better than any others for the price in my opinion.  It flies steady and is durable.  You will inevitably crash these into something, and this little heli takes quite a bit of punishment.  Eventually things can become damaged or break, but there are spare parts also available on Amazon that are fairly cheap.  For the price of a lot of other helis you can buy several of these.  You cannot fly these outdoors, but indoors they are very responsive.  These also have made great gifts for my young relatives.  Boys and girls alike love these things.
5.0	U need to get the sewing machine. My 7 year old loves It, no parent needed!
5.0	my grandson enjoyed it for one of his Easter toys
5.0	I got this for my sister for Christmas. Since it is not Christmas yet we haven't tried the tag but I have bought from this seller before and the tag did work. It is a great animal. It is soft, cute, and I know my sister will love it.
5.0	I brought this toy to my Sunday School kids and it was the most popular item.  It was the first time I could hold all of their interest for more than 10 minutes!!  I love this product and want to buy more for all my kids.
5.0	Great setup and fits on the big reduced starter S652 without any adjustment!
5.0	The sand is wonderful and the kids love it. The problem is I found this exact same thing at Target for $7.00 less and was going to return it but they wanted $6.52 shipping to return it.
5.0	Looks great haven't opened it yet. But I am sure when my daughter is old enough she will love it
5.0	You can't go wrong with Jellycat, all their stuff is soft, cute.<br />This is the perfect size for little hands.  I have a 4 month old.
5.0	Blacker than night, stronger than you'd expect. This is the &#34;Batman&#34; of super glues. Or, it could be like the weird goth superglue, if you think regular superglue is too mainstream.
5.0	it did not work I want to end it back
5.0	Beautiful dresses. The long sleeves are too difficult for my 3 year old to put on. She loves them. I ordered this set hoping for the purple rapunzel dress to replace one that had been damaged but of course my order did not include one. Instead I received 2 pink aurora dresses. I'm terrified to order again because I'd probably receive all duplicates just like the mini dresses.
5.0	This is one of the best versions yet but challenging. Looks amazing. You need needle nose pliers as it is a must.
5.0	Bought these for grandchildren and they have not used them yet.  Very happy to find scissors that only cut paper!
5.0	only glowed for a little while
5.0	"I hadnt really looked much at this product.  My 3 year old daughter recieved it got Xmas from her grandparents.  It has been a hit for her!!<br /><br />She also received 3 more books to use with it!<br /><br />SHE Loves to sit and hold the book for her carebear to see and \\""read\\"".  It fits in her lap pretty well too.<br /><br />SO far we have had no problems.  My niece who also recieved one did have problems with the mouth working properly I guess.<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />Designed well to remain stable when seated with a figity preschooler.<br /><br />Does not have an overly loud or soft voice, great for both parent and child.  And it is a nice voice to listen to.<br /><br />Desiging the \\""keyring\\"" to hold the cartridges and keep them in one place.<br /><br />the books are a great size and HARDCOVER big bonus IMO!!!! SIck of products cutting cornors and adding flimsy small paper\cardboard and passing them off as books or play pieces.<br /><br />the movements it makes while reading are pretty smooth BUT loud.<br /><br />CONS<br /><br />like I said it is a bit loud with it movements, but not too bad IMO.<br /><br />my only real complaint would be the cartridge \\""door\flap\\"" on the bear.  I have a hard time getting in there to change them, it could have been designed a bit bigger.<br /><br />OVerall the CONS for me arent bad at all and only minor peronal preferences"
5.0	You get some fantastic models for two starter armies, not just click together, sub par versions. In addition, you get the FULL rule book, unlike Games Workshop games. This means that, minus modeling and painting tools, is got everything you need to get started. The game is fun, fast paced, got plenty of complexity, and is far more balanced than any other table top war game I've played before.
5.0	Nice table and chairs but lots of pieces to screw together.
5.0	So apparently no-won has reviewed this item so I will go ahead and do that.so first off I'm giving 5 stars (cause I have the hots for harley quinn) but also because it's pretty AWESOME if your a big harley quinn fan like me then you will love this plush.im gonna go now cause there's really not that much to say about it<br />HAVE A GOOD DAY AMAZONIANS!!
5.0	The table is a big hit because of the center piece which you can throw balls down or dump water, it comes apart easily in case (or when) something get put in there that won't fit.  It is a little expensive, saw this at Target and Aldi for $15 cheaper.
5.0	This really is for puzzle masters. There are no instructions. Trial and error. It took about two weeks to finish, but it is a really cool puzzle.
5.0	My grandson enjoys playing with these. We did have some concern about some of the letters being shaped/sized in a way that might make it easy for the baby to choke on - particularly the letter I. We removed it from the set until he's a little older and not so likely to put them in his mouth.
5.0	However, I wish the company would offer more holiday gel clings than this.  The grandkids love them !
5.0	Having so much fun with my brothers they love it.
5.0	This has become my sons favorite Avenger - since he has wings and can fly
5.0	Ok this kit is old very old but it's held up as a kid i had all the wing kits except this one so i jumped to get it even if today's HG's leave it in the dust (note I'm not sure what to call this I think it's a non-grade but I can't be sure) all and all it's a good kit because it's mostly white the colors are almost all there you will need some green paint for the eye (I used a lining pen) and the white on the feet as well as some of the black but even without them you wont notice that much it's not very mobile but that to be expected with it's age in mind
5.0	The Cars vehicles are really enjoyed by the 3 1/2 year old that I give them to. He loves them and plays with them all the time. He uses his imagination while playing with them. I love to see his reaction when he receives a new one.
5.0	bought as a gag gift - very funny
5.0	"Very high build quality compared to most \\""Christmas Train Sets\\"".  The tracks snap very snugly together and the joints are tough enough to withstand unintended separation without breaking the snaps.  The train is very heavy duty plastic and can take the abuse of small children playing rough with it.  The detail is nice (quality paint job) and touches like spring loaded doors that open on one passenger car and the hobo on the roof-top that can be flipped to hide or show him(smooth roof when hidden-or hobo+kid by campfire when shown).  The remote control requires close proximity but is great.  Only minor downside is the train/sounds cannot be turned off from the remote-you either have to wait 10 minutes for it to \\""sleep\\"" automatically, or unplug the engine from the coal-car power supply."
5.0	My son was very happy to receive this item and add it to his collection of Vinylmations.  He loves it!  Thank you!
5.0	OMG so cute!! Love it worth the money
5.0	My son loved it!  So happy for online companies that make dreams come true and come through in a pinch.
5.0	Excellent quality and easy to use. My eight year old granddaughter has enjoyed using this microscope in her homeschool studies. She read and used the enclosed instructional booklet, too. I would recommend this.
5.0	We have yet open the product but I could imagine that my son shall have lots of fun with this stack & roll cups.
5.0	The instructions are easy to follow and they work PERFECTLY if you read them well and put the head set on correctly. It takes a minute or so to calibrate once you put them on and if it seems to be doing the same repeats of movements, then it is still calibrating because you did not put the headset on properly. reclip the ear piece, or there might be hair in the way of the sensor. They last about 3-4 hours straight on a set of new AAA batteries, sometimes less if your brain is very active. You can train yourself in a mirror to learn how to do the set emotions. They are delicate and should not be treated like a child's toy.<br />I love my necomimi and when going out, or to an event or party, people ALWAYS ask me where they came from and are stunned that they are moving based on my brain and emotions.  Will be buying the different interchangable ear sets soon!
5.0	100/10!! definitely one of my favorite pop figures..
5.0	I can't think of any cons to any of the Melissa & Doug puzzles we've bought thus far.  This puzzle has such cute, fun graphics and big sturdy pieces.  My 34 month old loves it.  He puts it together on his own and will even take it apart and put it away.  It is usually hard to get him to willingly pick up his toys.  He loves to look at each part of the picture and tell me what is going on - the cat is trying to eat the birds, etc.
5.0	I bought 3 and gave a blue  waves to my friend, and  a pink ice cream to another, and now i have an artic blue 1  4 me.  they rock.
5.0	i like play with the new phase 10 dice game
5.0	Perfect size for my dollhouse.
5.0	"i got this toy a few years ago on christmas and this is my only talking pull-string woody i own. this is awesome 4 the green soldiers and it wud b better if u had the buzz that also goes with this \\""theme\\"". woody comes with 3 regular soldiers, 1 soldier with a parachute, a baby moniter, a mr. potato head with a removable back, himself, woody's \\""real\\"" hat, a soldier hat, and a blue pirate-looking hat. he says:<br /><br />\\""Red Alert! Red Alert!\\""<br />\\""Come in Motherbird.\\""<br />\\""Buzz, we got trouble! Red Alert!\\""<br />\\""Buzz!

Do you hear something?\\""<br />\\""I'm counting on you Potata Head.\\""<br />\\""A good soldier doesn't leave a man behind.\\""<br />\\""Send in the Paratrooper.\\"""
5.0	quick shipping and product was as described
5.0	We got this for our daughter as one of her Easter gifts..., she absolutely loves it and has already spent many hours playing with it in the few days that we have had it.  Just make sure you have a power screwdriver handy otherwise it will take you a while to screw in the legs.  Only complaints are that I wish the table was permanently attached together and that the water was a little easier to drain out of the tub.
5.0	These toys are soft and adorable! On top of that you're giving them a real star! How cool is that? Half of my grandkids are now planning to be astronauts! They use the Nasa site to check on their stars and usually end up widening their search. The teens and preteens really enjoy the game site. In addition to all this a portion of the profits goes to children's charities. I have rarely been happier with a gift I've purchased.
5.0	It is exactly what I expected.
5.0	Excellent quality, fast delivery, awesome service. I don't regret buying it.
5.0	It is just as cute as the picture. Pikachu itself is kind of squishy making me worry that if you push to far one way or the other he will come undone. But the squishy pieces also allow for you to take apart and put back together this amazingly cute Pokemon. I will definitely be buying more puzzles like this one. It was easy enough to put together and just difficult enough to challenge me.
5.0	Love it ...my students love it!
5.0	I bought this learning resources cash register for my 5 year old daughter, in pre-k in the Texas Public school district (which is a whole other issue).<br /><br />I have done a lot of curriculum work with my daughter and when she remained persistent in asking for a cash register, this was among the 3 choices of consideration based on educational value.<br /><br />I have always been fond of Learning Resources, but this register makes me real proud of my selection.<br /><br />She uses real coin money, in conjunction to fake paper money. The coin bank will calculate and identify each coin that passes through the slot. It has 5 different modes, 4 of which are games, for money learning progression; the count bank, coin quiz, addition of coins, subtraction of coins, and money matching. The screen is nice and similar to a calculator, but very simulating of a cash register in a child's perspective. You can pass items over the scanner, it will apply a cost to the item and continue to calculate until 'the customer' pays.<br /><br />Once you decide to close out, there should be also provided a coupon card and a debit card. The coupon can be ran in the card slot and will remove a small amount of purchase.  The choice to pay with debit or cash is yours. If debit is selected, you swipe the card; it makes the fancy old school Internet connection sound; wa la! The debit is approved.<br /><br />I was pretty blown away that I got an almost new version of this register, SHIPPED, for $20 from NY.<br /><br />A buck well spent.<br /><br />My daughter now can make simple coin additions, small price identifications, and with both of those can purchase small items we come across at the 'checkout traps'. I believe this would not have been possible nearly as soon without this very constructive, tactile learning method.<br /><br />Happy:)<br />Lindsay Lara
5.0	This was an awesomely made hat.  Even when my 4 year old jumped on it and smooshed it, you could still shape it back to look like new.  Glad this was a part of his &#34;Jack Sparrow&#34; costume.
5.0	Lovely addition to my collection--very &#34;Twiggy&#34; inspired
5.0	Bought these for my Grandchildren for stocking stuffers.  Cute idea and one that they will have fun with through the Holidays.
5.0	We bought this for our 2 yr old grandson because he always wants to play his parents' video games.  We bought the Pooh game that is for the 3-5 yr range.  He loves it and plays it everyday.  I know he will learn alot as he grows older with this game.  You will be glad you buy this if your child or grandchild is showing interest in computer games or video games.
5.0	I love this toy! I bought 10 of them over the course of a year or two for all my friends that had babies. Every single kid and parent loved it!
5.0	Bought for my sons fourth birthday and he absolutely loves this rescue center! He wants to watch youtube videos of imaginext toys while playing with it! I love that all these toys are built well and the same size for adding superheros or whatever to the collection!
5.0	This was for my 7 yo girl, for Halloween. She loved it and enjoyed it every minute. And the quality is pretty good.
5.0	My son absolutely adores this new toy. Switches very easily for dual us play.
5.0	My 2 yr old is loving this addition to the farm he got for Christmas! He has fun going to the park and seeing the geese and ducks, then coming home to play with his own little pond. He thinks it's pretty funny to put the pig on the roof too. I like that it came with one fence panel to connect with the farm and garden but I really wish I could buy more fence panels as my son loves connecting them.
5.0	Grand-Daughter loves them.
5.0	About four years ago our niece who had done some tie dying as part of her work got us started with tie dying t-shirts while at the family camp each summer. It has become such a tradition we buy a kit each year. The kit has all the pieces and desired colors to do all the t-shirts for our family.
5.0	My wife has a very large collection of turtles & tortoise's 5 of which are over 100 lbs. she gives tours to all the local schools & other groups. At the end of her tours she has a big plastic tortoise just full of your assortment of turtles she holds it up high & lets each child reach in & get a small gift to take home with them.All of the children love them. The number & price of them are very good & worth the money just to see how happy all the kids are when they leave.
5.0	Fit my little girl perfectly.
5.0	My grandkids have enjoyed this car for two years.  It has received rough treatment but has held up well. Thats all
5.0	It's a pretty bracelet to show my tribute pride! Will be wearing it to Mockingjay P2 in November.
5.0	Thank you so much for your prompt delivery of the dozen squirrel underpants.  Although I was a little disappointed to find that they where not made of real squirrels, after stitching a few together I am finding them extremely comfortable.  Cant wait to see what underwear you come up with next, Yours Down Under, S
5.0	Very well Made and a nice size.<br />I use this for my Foxy Doll Red Hatter<br />and my Fox Vette Corvette Club
5.0	I love these tarot cards!! I have had a classic rider-waite set for years but the beautiful designs and goddess symbols of this deck are wonderful.  The book that comes with the set is also very well written and has some great sample readings, and layouts that are worth a try.  It comes in a handy set that easily fits on my bookshelf.  I would recommend this set to anyone who wants a beautiful yet usable tool.
5.0	If you do not get sent one that is defective that is!
5.0	I wasn't expecting these bracelets to last long as most fall apart after one or two wearings, but these are good quality!
5.0	It is a Christmas gift and just what they want
5.0	My grand daughter and I did this puzzle in about an hour...loved the picture...made us both laugh.  We are puzzle fanatics!
5.0	My grandson loved them and your delivery service was excellent!
5.0	I bought this for my new grandbaby. This is a cuddly toy, very soft and I highly recommend it.
5.0	My daughter has played with this puzzle everyday for the last month since she got it. She was able to recognize every letter I wrote down on paper after 2 weeks of using this toy! The puzzle is bright and colorful and the pieces are big for easy handling. I plan on getting all of the other puzzles in this collection!
5.0	I LOVE MY DONUT!!!! It's huge too!!
5.0	very pleased with suitcase, well construed, my grandson loved it
5.0	I bought this for my fourth grand child, I ussually make my own but ran out of time this year. Great quality it looked very nice..
5.0	Her style is so chic. Beautiful blond hair is rock !!     Don't hesitate more!   She will never disappoint you !
5.0	My son just turned 5 y.o. He started from junior set and finished it very fast. Now we have regular sets 1,2,3, and 4 (from 8 to adult), and he solves all of them too! I can't believe it. Sometimes it was very hard for me. Really great game for my family!
5.0	I have been wanting one of Romero Britto art pieces but couldn't afford one.  Now I have one and not only is it beautiful but it is soft and lovable.<br /><br />I received it in just days and of course it was in mint condition.  I will continue to use this vendor.  Not only are they quick to ship but have one of the lowest prices...that is why I could finally afford this cute elephant. This is my third Romero Britto plush.<br /><br />Great job amazon.com...keep up the great work.
5.0	Works very well but needs to be zip tied on to avoid falling off.
5.0	Very good product everything feels professional like it was made well done
5.0	My dad got this a few years ago and I thought it was stupid but I got hooked so quickly. I soon had beaten all the puzzles included, so i bought sets 2 and 3. Right now Im somewhere with 3. I dont play often but when I do I dont stop. Its amazing how something so stupid cold be so much fun. I dont see how its educational because I havnt learned anything. Its not made especially well but its not bad either. Get it and you'll love it
5.0	They're little, not a full sized rubber ducky.
5.0	One of the coolest features of the 2002 line of MOTU figures is the fact that while they look cooler and more realistic, their colors and functionality are nearly identical to their 80's counterparts.<br /><br />It took me a while to remember what triggered the release of Ram-Man's legs but then I just had to go down memory lane and voila!  The trigger's in the same spot on the back of his leg.<br /><br />Love it
5.0	Kids love to have Lego
5.0	We received this when our first son was about 18 months old. He was slow to warm up to it as he is a prettty cautious guy, but once he did it figured in every play experience in our playrooom.  Our second son was rabid about it from about 8 months old, and they played with it continuously for 2 years, when they were 3 and 4 1/2. I then put it away until our youngest was ready. Now they are 1,4, and 5 year old boys and it is again the center piece of our playroom play scenarios.  It has held up through a lot including a move.  I think i will get a ball pit to be the landing again. That did not hold up so well.
5.0	"These shoes have gotten loads of use at our house.  My daughters got these for Christmas 2 years ago, and they are still in great shape even though they are played with almost every day.  These shoes have even been thrown down the hall several times and are still fine.  They are not slippery due to the non-skid part on the soles.  That is so important - my 3 yr. wiped out last week in her slippery tap shoes and busted her lip.  For now on they only play dress up in these. <br /> <br />My 5 year old wears size 11.5 shoes, and my 3 year old wears size 8.  They have been wearing these disney shoes without complaint (and they do complain about shoes!) for a long time.  I'm not sure why other reviewers have problems with fit.    <br /> <br />My only complaint is that they are very loud on our hard floors.  My girls really like making that \\""clicking\\"" high heel noise so I've learned to get over that. <br /> <br />P.S. - our favorite, non-scratchy, washable dress up clothes come from mydressuptrunk at Ebay (no affiliation!)"
5.0	Love this toy.  It is a clock, a shape match up toy, a number match toy, etc...
5.0	Very cute and perfect for the new little guy!
5.0	Kids love it. Amazon had a best price.
5.0	My daughters love this.  It holds their dolls and can withstand getting pulled around.
5.0	This is a perfect backpack for a day trip or preschool. Its a smaller backpack that fits my 3 year old perfectly. HE can wear this. Everything on this is sturdy and well made. Zippers are all well done and function great. The imprint on the backpack is solid and<br />&#34;deep&#34; in color. NO regrets in getting this backpack for him!!
5.0	Perfect for little girls.  Great set.
5.0	the set is great love the action figure and the sword and pickaxe it comes with and the chest is really cool
5.0	We had a version of this game in our home as I grew up in the '60's and it was fun then, it is fun now.<br />This particular version is in a great storage tin with durable tiles for the game. I highly recommend this item.
5.0	This is a really fun game.  Took a little bit to get the play going but once we did we really like it a lot.
5.0	This is very nicely packaged for display. If you're a Bat Fan then I would recommend this Batpod for your collection.
5.0	Very nice but bulky for a 1 year old
5.0	This set is GORGEOUS!!! I have been looking for a doll crib for my daughter for about a year. She just turned 4 and is in a 'mummy' phase.  After going through practically all doll cribs on amazon, I decided on this one and I am glad I did.<br />It took about an hour to set up. The picture instructions were clear. The crib was easy to set up but the chair was a little more difficult. I needed help with that. Matching the screws was a little confusing on the pictures. The wood seems solid. I had to switch from a manual screwdriver to a power one to screw in most of the screws. It was a little tough. I assume it means the wood is solid?<br />The crib is small for an 18 inch doll. My daughter has the &#34;My life as a Ballerina Doll' and she barely fits. All her other dolls - Lalaloopsy and Mooshka fit perfectly. The only problem I have with the crib is the length of the mobile. I think it's a little too long. I shortened the string on the mobile but it still gets in the way. it does not swing aside. The bedding is a little thin but my daughter didn't notice.<br />The high chair is perfect. It fits the 18 inch doll perfectly. The cushion slips all the time so I don't think it will be long before it gets missing.<br />Its the perfect size for a small apartment. I do not have a lot of space in my apartment but this fit comfortably in my kids room. It is light and DD was able to move the high chair from her room to the sitting room by herself.<br />I am glad I got this set. Even my 2 year old son tries to tuck his plane in. I expect it will last for a long time.
5.0	My 14 month old granddaughter loves this puppet!  She tries to feed it toy blocks and likes talking to it.  It's really cute and fits easily on your hand. It's also very soft and made well.
5.0	Grandson couldn't wait to open and start coloring great set.. Very happy with this product.. Smart idea wish they would make more kits like this.Maybe like magnets for fridge.
5.0	I brought it for my sister. She likes it..  very soft and cute.....  all kids will like it!! I like it too.
5.0	I always wanted this game as a kid and when my son ask for it for Christmas, I found it on your website and bought it right up.  I got it couple days after I bought it.  My son will have hours of fun with it.
5.0	It was great!  My son love it.  Thanks!
5.0	The first time I played Blokus I was at a pot-luck gathering at Church.  This game has very simple rules and only takes a minute to learn how to play.  I had so much fun playing this game that I knew I had to get one for my family.  I now play with my three kids (ages 6 and 5 - twins) regularly and we all love it.
5.0	Grandsons love them<br /><br />Just like the movie
5.0	My son loved this and these were not super cheaply made like the horrid Mario ones we got.
5.0	This cane fully assembled and just needed the stickers applied which was easy. The gas pump is a great addition to the car and my son seems to love it. It is made out of the same durable plastic as the car so it appears that it should last a long time.
5.0	work great with american girl
5.0	Our daughter really started to get interested in this toy around 4 months.  Once she could grab on to things, the different activities of this toy kept her occupied for at least a half hour at a time.  Now that she is older, she loves to chew on both the soft star and the squeeky heart.  Great toy for babies, like most Lamaze products!
5.0	I bought this for my 18 month old to use on our deck since he didn't like the swimming pool. He had a blast with this! The dipping cup is perfect sized, the water wheel begs to be played with, the there are no plugs to get pulled out & accidentially drained. It is very sturdy & safe. We put sand in it during colder weather but take off the water wheel, as it doesn't work well with sand even if you take off the blue reservoir on top. The sand just gets into the wheel and stops it from spinning freely. But it makes a great sand table without it! You can do sand & water on separate sides of the table since there is a divider.  I have no complaints at all with this table! Perfect!
5.0	The puppy  is new but algo soft and has a lovely music. It´s perfect for baby and toddlers.  My daughter won´t stop hugging it.
5.0	These are pick up sticks.  They are substantial and the grand kids liked them.  The ends are blunted, which I suppose is good.....which means you can not stick each other and then complain to your mother that Bobby is sticking me.  Maybe that is a little disappointing
5.0	This Rudolph is really cute. He is a good size, bigger than I expected in a good way. Since this is the 50th anniversary addition he has special colored antlers. We were expecting his them to be more of a lame type gold material. In actuality, it is a golden/tan colored satin material. The best part is that his nose lights up! I ordered him directly from build a bear for $25. He came pre-stuffed and in a little house box.
5.0	My 3 year old granddaughter loves this toy.  She can easily change out the cds and press the buttons and the music is happy music with lots of short little tunes that are pleasant and fun to listen to.  Its very durable also. The cd's area also designed so that scratches don't effect play (not that they really scratch up) but they still think they are really using a real cd player. Once she threw it across the room and the cover came off and it just popped right back into place with no problem.  This is a great toy!
5.0	My daughter loves playing with the voice settings of this microphone<br />Easy to use and plug in your MP3 player and sing
5.0	My granddaughter loved this doll.  She told me it was her favorite out of all her Monster High doll collection.  This was a difficult doll to find and I'm glad this merchant had it for me to purchase.  It was a grand day for her and I thank you for that!
5.0	I am impressed with the Miniatures which is well crafted.  The characters sheet card made of hard cardboard is of good quality too<br />The game is easy learn and fun to play.  I have a great time playing with my 2 boys.
5.0	this was really a great buy. my nieces are 8, and almost 10. we just got done doing about 3 or 4 of the experiments and hey even i learned something lol. they are fun, hardly messy, kids love them, and it actually teaches them about stuff. and also i like that some experiments you have to wait an hour or two for the final product but the majority of them are done within about 15 minutes. i think most kids would be very interested in this.
5.0	My son got this for Christmas. He loves the chunky easy to use numbers for his little hands. They are really well made.
5.0	A great design for a car that goes along perfectly with the Jurassic Park movies. My Lil guy is just delighted that he can help rescue his toys when his dinasaurs attack.
5.0	My Grandchild loved it!
5.0	This is the best diabolo my son ever owned. It is super quite and smooth. He enjoyed it very much.
5.0	The Black Lab Puppy is especially cute!! I buy Webkinz as collectables and don't get into the gaming or sim world much. The Black Lab Puppy was my first Webkinz. I have several now and all have held up well but I also take excellent care of all my collectables.
5.0	My Daughter really loves it
5.0	my daughters love them. I think they are pretty cool too. Wish they also come in a bigger package than 10 sheets.
5.0	Got this for my 9 year old niece for Xmas and she loved it! Couldn't stop playing and figuring out what object to make next. Big hit!
5.0	Very good quality paint. Works well with air brush when painting 1/35 scale armored vehicles.
5.0	My seven-year-old daughter adores this toy. The mat is bouncy, the ropes are springy, and it's large enough that two people can play comfortably. Pretty happy with this purchase.
5.0	Awesome looking pop! One of my favorite in the Universal Monsters line.
5.0	My 20 month old loves this car because it can go quite fast on the tile floor.  Additionally, he loves the light on the tow truck which turns on when the car is activated (sometimes we dim the lights in our house for greater effect).  He's dropped it several times on the tile floor and it still looks and works like it did when we got it.
5.0	My granddaughter is crazy about these for her dolly tea parties. They are darling!
5.0	I purchased this basketball set for my 15 month old great grandson.  It stays at my home where he comes for visits twice a week.  He loves putting the ball in the basket and looks at us to clap for him.  He never tires of chasing the ball as it comes out of the hoop and puts it right back in.  I feel it was the best purchase I made at Christmas for it not only makes him have so much fun it also brings me joy to see him. This basketball set is sturdy, fun and teaches balance,cognitive thinking and confidence
5.0	awesome game..playing now and cannot get enough
5.0	This edition with the raised ridges to hold the tiles in place is a MUST HAVE for any serious Scrabble player. I belong to a Scrabble Club, and now we use this board religiously. I also visit people in a Nursing Home, one has tremors really bad. This board is excellent for her and for Seniors in general. I would highly recommend this edition for anyone who loves to play Scrabble.
5.0	I stuck this behind a file cabinet that was sitting under my boss' desk. I set right outside his office which conveniently has a large glass window so I had front row tickets day after day. His reaction was initially perplexed but that quickly turned into pure fury by the end of the 2nd month. I watched him waste countless hours searching around his office until an IT guy finally found the culprit. Culprit being the device itself--I however, was never caught.
5.0	More awsomeness from playmobil. My three year old and I assembled it and its becoming quite the vehicle for hauling all the schlike animals about the living room. Having worked in the Shipping industry, there's quite a bit of realism to the truck and containers.
5.0	The board worked well and bound at first try. The price of this board is really good.
5.0	good if you are playing prodical sorcerers, etc.. amd have a lot of mana
5.0	My grandsons have had lots of hours of creative play with this loader.  All Melissa & Doug toys are well-made and durable and we appreciate the creativity in this loader especially.
5.0	Our great grandson really loved it.
5.0	These look as nice as they feel. Have a weighted roll that makes them fun to use. The detailing is crisp and they appear very well made.
5.0	Great condition and won me a match against Shaddolls.  10/10 best side
5.0	Loveable  horse sure to please a toddler.
5.0	This is the 2nd set we have bought.  One for home and one for grandma's house.  They are very sturdy and well made and have provided hours of building fun for my kids (ages 2, 5 and 6).
5.0	My grandson loved this product. At 7 he was able to identify all the states and put them where they belong within the puzzle. He loved it!
5.0	I bought this for my nephews after seeing all the boys at school playing with Kendamas. This was a great value for the quality product I received. Whenever a toy is popular it is important to purchase something the kids won't be embarrassed to have. This Kendama had the official Kendama stamp on the handle. It was the first thing my nephews looked for. They didn't say anything, but I noticed they both looked and I could feel some of the tension melt away when they saw the confirming stamp.
5.0	This is a very cool Lego set!! My son loves it!! It was very easy to put together and the instructions were easy to understand. No complaints. We are big Lego fans and this set did not disappoint!!
5.0	My 2 year old granddaughter LOVES this suitcase!  It is big enough to hold a weekend's worth of clothes when going to Grandma's house and seems well made.
5.0	works so good, kids love it
5.0	This doll is so cute in a miniature size. Absolutely adorable!!!
5.0	My son has had a great time figuring out this game and doing different configurations. Perfect for him and his sister at ages 6 and 4.
5.0	As a new mom I have decided that it is harder to find dependable equipment than it is to fly a plane! But I found this chair and I love it!! Another thing it is made of WOOD NOT PLASTIC! My nephew had a plastic high chair and tore it all to pieces by the time he was 2! And Ya I know it is hard to assemble but what isn't now day's? I also think the table is a great option, and a great price($75.00 Babycenter.com). I have researched so many high chairs and other equipment and I read all of the reviews and I think that this chair is great!
5.0	SUPER DETAILED!! GREAT ADDITION TO MY COLLECTION. I LOVE FERRARIS AND I AM REALLY HAPPY AND GLAD I PURCHASED IT.
5.0	"Having done childhood in the 40s when \\""Lincoln Logs\\"" were sold in big enough sets to do something with, fit together well and didn't come with a chemical smell that raised all your instincts to throw them out (let alone the worry about what the Chinese used to stain the wood for export to us), I found this set, made in Maine.  From their website, it sounds like the company was started by a couple who felt the same as I do, and it's mentioned these are stained with a food-safe coloring.  They look just like the ones I had, you can make way more than just the structure pictured on the box because they didn't skimp on pieces or sizes, and I'm not terrified they'll poison my grandchildren. If they do leave reddish stain traces on fingers or their storage bag or carpeting (mine didn't), I'd just put down a sheet.  The storage bag they come in is old fashioned burlap and I like that about them too. A real winner."
5.0	This game is really amazing
5.0	These eye goggles fit for kids and adults.  We just put them on and started playing.  I bought extra goggles so that other people could play.  They look  great on and don't look nerdy!  Kids didn't mind putting them on at all.
5.0	Exactly what I ordered! Got it for a xmas gift for my nephew and he loved it! Kendama craze is crazy!
5.0	If you have a little one who enjoys playing in sand or water, this table is great. My little guy will spend 40 minutes pouring water and sand through the waterwheels, etc, before he gets bored and starts splashing. The only thing to be aware of is that it is high enough to make it a little dangerous for climbers...all things considered, however, couldn't given this product a more favorable review!
5.0	My grandaughters, ages 21/2 yr. and 1 yr. liked these dolls and furniture. They were eager to play with them in the doll house. They were easy for the little fingers to grasp and hold.
5.0	Liked adding the extra pieces to train set. Helped with our set up. Grandson loves it. Would certainly  encourager others to buy extra pieces.
5.0	I bought the V-Smile Pocket back in June to keep my 4 year-old entertained during a long road trip.  The Smartridges are accurately age labled and the games have a good balance between what young kids already know and what they need to learn, which makes the games fun and challenging, but not frustrating.  The game controls can be switched from left-handed to right-handed.  The color screen is clear, and the graphics are much better than I expected. Battery life is also better than I expected.
5.0	The variety of tools in this set was exactly what I was looking for. Anyone with children or granchildren who like playing with PLAYDOUGH should consider buying this set!
5.0	Man s*** I charged the battery for the boat and I took it all the way to the lake and I didn't know the remote needs batteries so I never got to use it. #whatislife
5.0	Great challenge for my 8/yo....it took him about 3 days to complete. Working on it for only an hour at a time (est).  Looks great in his room.  It's challenging and I had to help with some parts, but its great.
5.0	Got this for my daughters 5th birthday and it PERFECT for a budding scientist. We have this set up in our school room and both kids love looking at various things with it. The first week we had it, it was hard to tell who enjoyed it more, me or the kids. Perfect for younger kids, and big ones too.
5.0	Great product for the price! Compatible with all wooden tracks; ie Thomas, imaginarium, etc. All pieces fit together nicely. My two and a half year old loves it when we build our own layout on the floor! This set comes with straight, curved and quite a few junctions. I wish it had come with a couple of pieces to make a figure 8 track, but I can buy those later. I would recommend this product to parents, grandparents and child care Providers. My son loves his train tracks and I have not been dissapointed with these tracks.
5.0	My 3 y.o. daughter asked Santa for a turtle for Christmas.  I was very happy to find a turtle in her favorite color.  She loves it and sleeps with it every night.  It's the perfect size for cuddling with and well made.  I would recommend for any little girl.
5.0	They carry these at Michael's so I knew what to expect. Quality is much better than knock-offs and the hook is quite sturdy.  As with all Rainbow Loom products, the bands and clips are quite nice. Not cheap feeling at all...bands haven't broken yet.<br /><br />For the price on Amazon, I can't imagine why anyone would buy this from Michael's (especially since you can't use a coupon.<br /><br />Since I've bought this, the price has dropped at Michael's, but what I paid on Amazon was still cheaper.
5.0	Purchased this for my grand daughter and it was a huge hit when she opened her Xmas presents. 'Real' size and snuggly.
5.0	My son got Sonic and this game for xmas; he keeps saying that sonic is more fun but cant stop playing get puzzled!! The cartridge includes 5 or 6 games with 3 levels each and 15 puzzles each level.. my son has around 5 puzzles left to solve... IM VERY GLAD HE GOT THIS GAME FOR XMAS.
5.0	My 10 year olds on is addicted to Minecraft.  I bought this for him for Easter and it overshadowed everything. He loved it! It is huge, very plush and well made. He carries it around, it plays Minecraft with him, and he sleeps with it.  All his friends were so jealous, which he loved as well. Great buy!
5.0	so much nice than the cheap plastic ones. My grandson loves it.<br />Came in the mail in just a few days.
5.0	My 5 year old is really into experiments, and my 3 year old wanted to help.  So I got her this kit and it's perfect for her age.  The experiments, so far, have been fun.  Would buy again.
5.0	Wicked funny and pretty outrageous! Played with a group ranging from 21 to 55...laughed so hard beer came out of Carmen's nose!
5.0	I was nervous upon opening the box because I could here the giraffe sliding around & had fear that it may have been damaged. After carefully opening the box I found that the head of the giraffe was wrapped with bubble wrap, ensuring that the most delicate parts were not damaged in shipping.<br />The giraffe is beautiful & smooth to the touch. I bought this as a birthday present for my friend's granddaughter & it will add a nice touch to her bedroom. It's going to be very hard for her to resist picking it up :-)
5.0	My niece loved the mask she wanted a cheaper mask but i ordered this one instead. She needed it for a dance
5.0	This is the ultimate Shift Car for the Kamen Rider Drive line. It features an Screen with mirrored effects and lights. Its made to work with the Drive Driver belt, BUT, can actually work without it. The lever, (which goes into the Belt's wrist holder) flips up - but can be pulled out on its own to activate effects. You can also use the item without turning the Drive belt on (since it doesn't actually communicate between each other)<br /><br />There are two major buttons. One says &#34;Fire All Engines&#34; -- you press this before activacting and putting the item into the Wrist Holder, and then flip the Shift Car up to active Tridoron jingle.<br /><br />The other major button activates the Tire Mix Up system, going between 7 different Combos. Once you've landed on a combo, Turn the Drive Driver on (or leave it off, to hear only the Shift Car sounds), and flip the Shift Car up to activate attack sound of the combo you selected.<br /><br />The Combos are:<br />- Attack 1-2-3 (Flare, Spike, Shadow)<br />- People Saver (Hunter, Doctor, Braver)<br />- American Dream (Vegas, Cab, Circus)<br />- Construction Site *This is the only one said in Japanese* (Gravity, Mixer, Dump)<br />- Weather Report (Solar, Winter, Commerical)<br />- Tough Guy (Wrecker, Traveler, Monster)<br />- Grand Prix (Manta, Jackie, Spanner)<br /><br />Every so often each button with give you a bonus sound, of Belt-San either saying the Engine Stalled, or that he wants to switch who's driving.<br /><br />The toy is cool, the jingles and effects are impressive. The mirrored surface of the screen does get finger prints easily, though. Best seen in the dark or dim lighting.<br /><br />There are a lot of sounds, but you do go through them quickly.<br /><br />Warning - the flipping mechanism is probably sterdy, but it WILL sound like its breaking when you flip it up. I'm worried it might break someday; but it's probably not if you take care when flipping it, to not stress it out.<br /><br />The item gives anerror sound in the Break Gunner, and will not work in the Mach Driver (since it's too long to fit).<br /><br />It does work with the Trailer Cannon, though -- giving you a jingle and sounds when you put it in the device -- but it's also meant to work with Type Speed, where it only takes the entering (of the inner compartment) of one shift car to enter final cannon mode. Press the All Engines Fire button and slide it into the cannon, and you'll be able to see the lit up screen through the window of the cannon.<br /><br />Bigger Warning, and biggest crisism of the toy, has to be the fact THERE IS NO OFF BUTTON! It comes with batteries, but I don't know how long it will stay active before needing new batteries. I don't know wether it turns off (or saves any power) when not in use; but the lack of an on off switch means it will eventually run out of energy. Use a screw driver to take off the battery compartment to replace batteries, LR44 (Or equivelent AG13, L1154, LR1154)
5.0	The Oberth Class model is bigger than most models from the collection even though the Oberth Class is one of the smallest federation starships. But that is not a problem at all! This is another very well detailed model. Very happy to add the USS Grissom to my collection!
5.0	I love this developmental cause-and-effect toy, an oldie but goodie I had in my own childhood. I bought this toy for our godson, who has Down syndrome. It was a delight watching him thinking about the toy and how to make it pop: &#34;If I do this, the toy will do that!&#34; Then he discovered that pushing it around would make the dogs bark and zoom around. He and the dogs have enormous fun. It isn't the quietest toy and the barking dogs really raise the roof, but! It's a classic toy, it requires no batteries and it provides a lot of happiness and fun. And what a great price!
5.0	We got this for my son for his 9th birthday and it was a huge hit!  He really loved being able to morph himself into a cartoon, and changing the story that he got to star in.  The website that he does this on is easy for him to understand, he could do it all on his own I only had to help him with printing.  He still hasn't finished coloring the book, I only wish there was an option to print it already colored?  He loves to show his story to everyone and the best part is that when he is bored with this story he can go back and make two completely different stories!  This toy will last for a while!
5.0	Cute.....happy with this
5.0	These blocks are a great little boy toy. Decorated with bright colors, the blocks are shaped like a ship, pirates, and accessories. The wooden blocks are sturdy and thick for little hands to hold and manipulate easily. They can be stacked together to build the ship and add the pirates and other pieces or little ones could play with the pieces individually. This will let them play without frustration that they can't &#34;build&#34; something.<br /><br />I think these are a good first blocks set for little ones who like pirates.
5.0	Its my first time ordering a product through amazon.com ..I wake up everyday with excitement expecting to receive the product i ordered and when i received the items i wasn't disappointed. I received it the way i expected to be....Great service too..updating me online on time regarding the ordered status,you won't get lost anywhere waiting and wondering...considering the place where i am living..THANK YOU AMAZON...keep up the good service and good quality of your product!!!!MABUHAY!!!<br /><br />Mylz<br />Palau-Micronesia
5.0	This toy is a hit with my two year old son. We purchased it for his birthday, and it has been a daily toy of choice since. It's well built and sturdy but does take a little bit to put together. Surprisingly, my 6 year old and 9 year old can also have fun with it which is a bonus when I want them to help entertain their little brother. The track comes with two cars, but there are many others that you can buy if you want to mix things up. Cars glide easily down the track without getting stuck, and the entire toy is easy for my two year old son to play with independently.
5.0	Excellent toy and price, my Grandson loved it..Still does... Looking for Remote control James, so if anyone knows where I can purchase that, I would greatly appreciate the info!!
5.0	Brought it as a christmas gift for my niece and she absolutely loves it.
5.0	Add playdough, kinetic sand, or dried black beans/rice, and you have hours of fun on your hands. Seriously, this is my son's go-to toy every day, and it costs less than $6. Amazing.
5.0	Lots of fun.  My daughter is 3 and we still use this.
5.0	Terrific stocking stuffer!  Presents were pushed aside and the children eagerly used them.  Fun for all members & ages of family.
5.0	I got this for my 5 yr old son for v-day, he will love it. Item is exactly as pictured, soft, durable, right size for a toddler or small child. It will fit a few of his action figures or a little snack to carry around when we go to the mall or shopping. He just loves pengiuns and this one is a very good one.
5.0	The grandkids had fun with these. Makes fun educational!
5.0	My 5 year old daughter really likes this tent!  She gets it out every day!  It's very easy to set up and the quality is what I would expect from a Playhut tent.  It is so  spacious compared to the other tents!  I picked this one because it was the largest.  It can fit a 2, 3 and 5 year old ( no problem) or a 5 year old and a teenager.  :-)  It has 2 &#34;rooms&#34; which is a feature that my daughter loves.
5.0	Fun item and well made.
5.0	Nice items and fit perfectly.
5.0	My wee friends tore into these and are just loving them! Nice bright pieces, sturdy enough for the rough houses in the making!
5.0	My daughter LOVES all the hiding places in this cat!
5.0	Exactly what I expected!
5.0	this is a good quality consruction paper for any art project you would want to do with the children.<br />Easy to cut, paste and make things.
5.0	Loved the way it shows a child the break down for a story and helps them to see the main points.  It is the little things that many miss and this book helps them to figure out each question.
5.0	This is the greatest Stringer figure released so far.  Stringer's power is based on sound, so it's great that his large blaster looks just like a guitar.  The translucent blue parts look great mixed in with the black armor pieces, and he has his original helmet back as well.  A great buy.
5.0	Oh my goodness!  She loved this! Wish I could post the priceless video of my 4 year old granddaughter opening this gift.
5.0	My almost 3 year old Princess Anna mega fan was so excited to receive this dress for our trip to Disneyland later this year. It's unlike any of the other dresses we've seen in that it's the gown Anna wears for Elsa's coronation. I can't speak to the quality because she hasn't worn it yet, but it appears to be a little better made than the dresses we get at Target.
5.0	This is perfect for my daughter.  Love that it has the chalkboard on one side and dry erase board on the other.  The letters and numbers that come with it are awesome.  Great way for a kid to learn how to write letters.  She has played with it everyday since we got it.  It was almost $20 cheaper to order it on here than from anywhere else.  I think this would be good for any child 2 to 7 years old.
5.0	my daughter loves it!
5.0	These are for those who are used to railroad/military/scenic hobbies. They are plastic, unpainted, and some are not fully assembled (needs glue). I gave it 5-star because this is what I expected to get. The detail is nice and where else would I find &#34;gold miner figures&#34;, make them myself? No, thanks. These were perfect for my project.
5.0	This toy was very nice, the price was worth it , its big and lights up and also says quotes , i was so glad i bought this disney toy
5.0	I went all over town trying to find these erasers. Apparently they are only made by one company and I had to buy them here. They work great, don't slip off, and last a long time. Highly recommended. BTW, they are designed to fit the average sized white body dry erase markers.
5.0	easy to learn .. as with twisted Farkel  the more people the more fun ..have a calculator handy ..great beer game
5.0	Power Up makes the base game so much better. Unique traits for each monster makes choosing a specific character worthwhile. Allows for really neat combos.
5.0	As a family, we love playing monopoly, so when I saw the Alpaca-opoly, I had to get it because we raise alpacas and dearly love them. Not only is this game fun, it is also a teaching tool, as it describes different things about alpacas!
5.0	When my 4 year old granddaughter Bailey received this, it was like I had given her the most wonderful toy in the world! She discovered my father's old Christmas DVD and now we have the whole collection! It is amazing how the shows hold her attention with very minimal talking. I may just have to order another as a back up!
5.0	I bought this as a Christmas gift for my mom. She loves it and plays all the time.
5.0	I have owned my Mooky for over 20 years now.  He still looks brand new.  Saw they were selling them again and had to get each of my kids one.  They grew up with him.  When I have my first grandkid I will be passing him down.  This is a durable, long lasting stuffed animal.  He's not the ordinary looking animal.  Thats what turned me on to him.  Love him, love him, love him.
5.0	I got this from another store. I Love the design. This is art deco, and its so american, you need to  look up for pictures online to get the idea. the screamliner (maybe named after the style, &#34;streamline moderne&#34; which was popular in the late 30s, when art deco was focused more on nautical elements and stream lines). I loved it so much in my hands that I'm going to get the other two variants. I'm not a hot wheels collector, but an art deco streamline lover. I really recommend it tho, to any hot wheels collector. when you get it in your hands you won't be dissapointed, the pictures don't make any justice.
5.0	This is the figure pack not the carded figures so you miss a weapons and things but they are easier to display with a collection. The figures are a great addition
5.0	good on its own, but when using these piecces with Lego no tight fit
5.0	This is a great space saving pdb. I wish they had Pololu step downs you could get on amazon along with this board though.[[ASIN:B00VV6Y0SK Lumenier M-PDB 4Power Mini Power Distribution Board]]
5.0	My toddler is obsessed with my vaccuum cleaner so I got him this & he loves it ^.^
5.0	We use this in our Sunday school class for dramatic play.  It has been well received by the children and workers.  It is easy to use and really completes pharaoh's outfit.
5.0	Cute toy! My 2 year old likes it.
5.0	great, awesome, gnarly, radical, fantastic, superb, amazing, majestic, mind-blowing, impressive, magnificent, exalted, breath-taking, beautiful, awe- inspiring, wondrous, grand, astonishing, overwhelming
5.0	I loved it! Good quality and beautiful colors.
5.0	"My nieces and nephew (3 1/2 years old) loved this  puzzle because it's brightly colored and very engaging! All Ravensburger brand puzzles that I have purchased in the past, including this one, are high quality and durable cardboard stock that snap into place with no small gaps in between like other puzzles I've purchased. The pieces are thick, large, and are perfect for small hands to work on fine motor skills and spatial reasoning while lining up the pieces. The images on the pieces are firmly attached so they won't peel off either.<br /><br />Even the box is engaging - it's shaped like Thomas and my nieces and nephew even enjoyed playing with the box and rolling it across the floor like a toy train. The finished puzzle is about 27\\"" by 19\\"" and I'd highly recommend it for little Thomas the Train enthusiasts!"
5.0	Actually for my dog. She loves them.
5.0	They are beads. Cannot say too much about them. They worked out and I would buy again.
5.0	I purchased mine from Walmart as it's the cheapest price. Although, I did return the first one and the second one I modified for longer durability. Once it's purchased use fender washers for the front wheels as the bushings that rotated on the axle did separate from the wheel. The wire from the driver's side motor did break but one call to customer service and they'll give you the whole right side motor installed in the gearbox, where it takes five minutes to replace.<br /><br />The reason for giving it five stars is because it's a very well made piece with a steel frame. It's detail is top notch and my son absolutely loves it! He rides it all the time. It goes excellent on off-road through tall grass and rough terrain. After looking at the Fischer Price Power Wheels and having an old Barbie Jeep that still works, the Kid Trax Dodge blows it out of the water! The Power Wheels gets stuck in normal grass where the Kid Trax will easily go up any hill or off asphalt terrain. Though, in order for the off-road capability the high speed gear needs to be selected as both motors, one on each side, turn the wheels. I have a video showing the off-road capability that I need to post online.<br /><br />Kid Trax does have 95% of the Dodge engineered well but, it's just quirks and missed areas of the truck that needs addressed. Though, I still feel it's a better vehicle than what's offered.
5.0	Great gloves!!  I ordered these for my 9 year old granddaughter for her halloween costume.  She is the Queen of Hearts and with the costume I bought for her, these were such a wonderful accessory and fit so great.  She absolutely loves them. So did I.  Fits an older child up to adult. Stretches. Would recommend them.  Very cute.
5.0	Easy to learn.  Fast game (30 minutes) for two.  There's an expansion to add two more players.  Some strategy and planning are important, but not likely to cause &#34;analysis paralysis.&#34;  Only complaint is that the packaging is excessive.
5.0	I bought this toy for my husband because he works on the Ospreys. Thought it would be neat for him to have the transformor Osprey.
5.0	This wagon was perfect for my grandson. The transaction was flawless. Super fast shipping. I will buy from vendor again!
5.0	My girls play with each & every Dora doll & accessory I bought. Each one is sturdy & played with daily. These are a must for your childs Dora Talking dollhouse.<br /><br />Amazon beat everyone else's prices & their excellent service with my purchases will certainly bring me back for future purchases.<br /><br />If you child loves Dora, then the Talking Dollhouse & all the accessory toys will be a smart buy!!!
5.0	It is a Christmas gift for a special son-in-law. He will be thrilled. Product just right, as expected. Thank you.
5.0	Grandkids loved these and can't get enough of conversation with them!
5.0	This bundle is awesome! I really liked the sling bag and the sleeves! The extra playmat was a bonus plus!
5.0	Haven't opened as it's a gift but I'm sure it will be nice, it's Detroit Tigers!
5.0	I bought this for my son for Christmas to replace the Tonka Mighty Motorized Garbage Truck that broke, and he loves it! This truck is very durable and has withheld being thrown off the bed onto our laminate floors, and is even strong enough to support my 2yr old's weight as he uses it to ride on sometimes! It has all the same features as the Mighty Motorized version: able to lift the garbage can and dump into the hopper (manually), hopper lifts and back panel opens up to empty the &#34;garbage&#34; (also manually). Yeah, it doesn't come with the handle that's pictured, but my son is none the wiser, and the handle still makes the revving sound it's supposed to make. Definitely worth the money and I know it will stand the test of time, as opposed to the Mighty Motorized version whose &#34;motorized&#34; feature broke within a week of receiving it. I recommend this to anyone whose kids love garbage trucks, especially front loaders!
5.0	Our 5 year old loves to dress up; accessories are key - weapon, mask, gloves the whole package, saw these went with Bumblebee costume we ordered so added to the cart.
5.0	I bought this for my 5 year olds 5th birthday. She screamed with joy when she opened it! It is very well made and is just as described.
5.0	This gundam is fantastic, it has so much detail and it was a joy to put together. I love how this gundam comes with two shiny swords and also one big sword which is bigger than the gundam it self. The big sword is fun to see it transform into a arrow.
5.0	My daughter loves these - great price
5.0	can not wait for granddaughter to open very cute
5.0	My Granddaughter loves this. I bought it for her 6th birthday. She likes horses & she loves My Little Pony! I had let her choose her gift.
5.0	If you like Killer Bunnies, you must have ALL THE EXPANSIONS!
5.0	great way to start getting into mtg
5.0	I LOVE my new doll of queen's blade rebellion, it is so detailed and perfectly made, thank you so much. Even it came to my house before the date they told me.  EXCELENT!!
5.0	My kids LOVE Adventures in Odyssey!  Even though they are in high school, they eagerly await each new volume and when it comes, they disappear and somehow consume it in a day or 2.  They come up with all kinds of trivia questions for each other and laugh over old episodes.  I appreciate that AIO is biblically-based and hits topics that kids really need to hear about in a way that they remember!
5.0	The product has the level of detail and all the characteristics to be called PERFECT
5.0	It is beatiful!! My daugther love it.
5.0	"We started giving this bear to our daughter when she was around 6 months old so she could self soothe.  She hasn't been without it since, and will be 18 months in a few days.  I love that the ribbon is sewn on, so she can feel it & we don't have to worry about it coming off.  She loves silky things.  She LOVES her \\""Bo\\"".  It is machine washable (at least from what I remember on the tag that now is blank from my daughter rubbing it so much) but the fur has matted down after 1 year & 3 machine washes/dries.  My mother in law washed it & didn't put it in a pillowcase or anything, so that may have helped.  We are going to get her 1 or 2 more as backups, but this one has held up very well.  She carries it in her teeth & swings it around & overall abuses the poor thing, but when it's night-night time, she squeezes it so hard & loves all over it!"
5.0	this is the best loved it
5.0	Was looking for a fun game we could play with our college age kids and their friends when they were home on break.  They loved it.  One even requested to take it back to college with the. There were some &#34;older&#34; questions about movies and music that were &#34;before their time&#34; allowing us older folks a leg up and there were plenty they aced that I had no idea about.  Everyone was able to participate and it actually was a fun learning experience too.  Need at least 3 players and the more the merrier was our experience.
5.0	I was looking for a new game for my 4 year old and this fits the bill! It's a great set of trivia that can be used for a few minutes or an hour (depending on attention span). I really like the broad range of topics this set covers and was really shocked that my son was able to get some of the answers...highly recommend.
5.0	Well worth the price. He loves it
5.0	This Elsa doll is beautiful.  My granddaughter loved it.
5.0	My 3.5 year old loved these.  The doors open, they are pull back, and they are much bigger than a Hotwheels/Matchbox = exponentially more impressive to a little boy.  I thought 4 of the same truck might be excessive, but he plays with all 4 at the same time.  We've had these trucks for several months, and they have all held up to a rough 3 yr old.
5.0	Super cute.  Arrived quickly.  Birthday gift for a 3 year old, she loved it.
5.0	This is a great toy. My 7 year old saved his money and bought Boomer a few days ago and absolutely loves it. It comes with a remote control but it also can operate without it. I was a little weary of him spending so much on a toy but so far I think it's definitely worth it.
5.0	So much fun for my 4 year old grandson!  He loves it!  It seems to last very well with the kind of heavy play it sees!
5.0	The products were everything they were described as!
5.0	Bought these for my daughter for Christmas.  She is very happy with the colors and loves the S clips she received with them.
5.0	The deck protectors are a fantastic addition to the magic set and hold up very nicely. Definitely worth buying for any collector.
5.0	My six year old grandson loves the disk that fly out of his mouth. Thank goodness they are made of soft material!
5.0	Very pleased with the seat.  Constructed well.
5.0	My daughter absolutely  loves this toy! Seller quickly  replaced when original toy found defective.
5.0	my kid loved this toys thanks
5.0	Our kids always wanted to play the adult version with us, but they didn't quite get it with playing cards....now they are able to set up and play their game on their own table.  My husband played it with them a few times for them to understand the cards that can add or take off chips...they do enjoy playing.
5.0	My Mom gave this to our daughter for Christmas (she was two weeks shy of 6 months at that time).  My daughter has been mesmerized by these buckets ever since!  She loves to pick them up, bang them together, move them from hand-to-hand, and has just started throwing them at six months.  It's a perfect toy for now, when she is learning how to handle items and develop hand-eye coordination.  From others' posts, it seems like she will love these for many more months to come, and then be able to use them even in her toddler years.  If we put out all the toys she's been given in the past six months (and even having my 3 1/2 year old's toys close by), she will go for these buckets every time. It's been amazing to watch how engaged she is with such a simple toy.  I actually got on here to buy these for a friend, and decided I should add my review so others know you don't have to spend a lot of money to buy something your child will love for a long time to come!<br /><br />Update:  My daughter is now eleven months old.  We took these to the beach with us last week for her to play with,and continue to get use out of these.  She played with them in the sand and enjoyed watching the water spray out of the ones with holes on the bottom.  My four-year-old son also loved using them for sandcastles as we could make different toppers for our castles with the various sizes.  Definitely worth the money, as I feel these buckets will be played with for years still!
5.0	My kids love there legos, everyday they come home from school they go get there legos and start playing with them.
5.0	Nice colors--fun & relaxing
5.0	Got this for my son for Christmas bc he asked for a Bumblebee Transformers car, I decided to not buy a branded version that would have stickers and crap all over it and go with the original while bumblebee is driving look, and my son LOVES IT!  product works great, and is well worth the money!
5.0	Hours of fun pretend play.
5.0	The pieces are very well made and it is a lot of fun to put together! The puzzle is higher quality than I was expecting and the pieces fit together very nicely.
5.0	As described, had the taps but no handle.  Excellent price.
5.0	Bought it for grandson.  He loves it.
5.0	New quality card. In protector. Lightning fast shipping. Love it very happy.
5.0	It's cute! I love it!
5.0	What a deal! I ordered this train table for my 2 yr old for Christmas. My husband is very excited that the track is already put together and glued down - now we can ENJOY Christmas Eve instead of going crazy assembling and gluing the track.    RELAX about the track being glued down, most kids love to play with the train tables in book stores and toy stores without ever complaining that they can't refigure the track. Preschoolers are more apt to lose track pieces anyway. Our glue job was really neat, only a few areas that showed glue (much neater than our best efforts at midnight of Christmas Eve would likely be).  We opted for the free delivery and our table was delayed in shipment twice. Luckily, we had plenty of time and would rather pocket the $80+ shipping costs.   If you want a quality train table at budget price, buy this one. We can't wait until Christmas!!!
5.0	I cannot recommend Frigits enough! It is great for a child's imagination, my son is forever coming up with new ways to make this work. It is brilliant! If you are on here considering this toy I recommend you just go ahead and buy it - you won't be disappointed!
5.0	I am using these for swag in my geocaching bag for kids.  They are nice quality and a nice size.  The kids will enjoy them when they find the geocaches
5.0	It has really good power for a 12V battery. We've put all sorts of things in the trailer including firewood and it moves along wonderfully. The second gear is quite fast, but it has a &#34;lock out&#34; key for the 1st gear, so you can leave it there if the 2nd gear feels too fast. It could easily fit a 3-7 year old, so the description is accurate. The radio is also a very cute feature. My son LOVES it.
5.0	These shovels are great--Kids can not break or bend them like they do with other shovels. Very durable and sturdy
5.0	The Signal Station is well made and adapts to the other Brio train accessories.  It was a big hit and hope you like it too!
5.0	It was super easy to install and it made it fly again!
5.0	Me and three D&D buddies (2 new players, 2 vets) split this monster bag after a 16$ Lightning Deal. At 4$ a head, we were happy!<br /><br />Chessex make some really cool dice and this set is a random sample, with a full set in one pattern. Our total haul ended up being:<br /><br />15 d20: 3 small clear, 12 large (some solid, some mottled, some clear)<br /><br />15 d8: all same size except one that was huge and clear. Some mottled, some one color.<br /><br />8 d4: all mottled<br /><br />12 d12: some were sorta wood looking, some were chunky plastic.<br /><br />12d10 ten digits and 15 d10 one digits: enough for percentiles!<br /><br />23 d6: some numbered, some pipped.<br /><br />There were a few repeats on the dice (mostly the d10s, we got 4 each on two colors).<br /><br />There were only 3 dice with blemishes or chips but that's nothing for so many nice dice!
5.0	8 year old girl loved it!
5.0	Service and product were excellent.
5.0	This is a game of physics, economics and engineering that requires strategy, planning, luck and steady hand. Don't underestimate the value of your beans (we use kruggerands). The game is very conducive to camaraderie, drinking, and general debauchery. More fun the more you play. Definitely buy this. It's Great Fun! Thanks Chuck for introducing us to this awesome game.
5.0	Ever since I first pointed out the moon to my daughter when she was eighteen months old, she has had a deep fascination with the moon.  This toy is great because it brings the moon into her room.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Its just smaller than the size of a dinner plate<br />- It lights up in phases (4 total) with a remote<br />- Manual Mode: It has a remote control that allows on off of each phase manually<br />- Auto Mode: With the remote you can put it in auto mode which cycles through the phases automatically through all the cycles in about 30 seconds<br />- On Off Mode: Allows you to turn on all phases on at once or turn them all off<br />- The moon has a light sensor that turns on the moon whenever you turn off the light.<br />- It turns itself off after 30 minutes automatically.<br /><br />CONS:<br />- The moon has a light sensor that turns on the moon whenever you turn off the light.  This winds up having the moon on more than I'd like it to and during the day you can't tell if its on or not so this causes some battery waste.<br />- It uses 6 AA batteries and I've had to change them too many times to count so I've gone to rechargeable batteries...so if you hang it too high, you'll wind up having to bring out your ladder quite frequently.<br />- It only has one handing hole for a nail so if you want to put it on the top of your ceiling or on a slated vault wall you will have to cut an additional hole in the plastic back.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great toy - my daughter adores it and it has brought quite a bit of joy to her so I highly recommend it.  It's not quite perfect but the challenges with it are small compared to the joy it brings to my daughter every night.
5.0	I was excited when this arrived. My 10 year old grandson is into Star Wars Lego. He will take about 2 seconds to put this together and then put it on his tree.Thank you for the prompt delivery.
5.0	"The [[ASIN:B00000K1VR Radio Flyer All-Terrain Cargo Wagon]] wagon is a must have for us.  THE key feature that was the deciding factor on this wagon (over others) are the air tires.  We live near the beach, and air tires are a must for negotiating the beach.  I wanted a wagon with a cooler (like Radio Flyer's plastic ones) but found none with the right tires, so this one will have to do.  We have outdoor movies on weekend evenings at our house, and have found the wagon to be invaluable as a kid corralling tool during the movies.  They think it is their own special space, and we know it has a \\""fence.\\""  It made a great Mother's Day gift."
5.0	It was great watched the butterflies transform and it was a wonderful experience for myself and my granddaughter
5.0	Have you seen the &quot;Sunshine&quot; lately?  My wife and I had trouble keeping our son occupied for more than five minutes.  We purchased this (innovative) product for its' entertainment value, but we received so much more with its' developmental attributes.  The lights, music and different textures it provides has truly captivated our son.  When our child understood that by touching or moving the Sunshine Symphony it will generate music, it amazed us.  The smile on his face playing with his favorite toy is incredible.  Whether we are home or traveling (Enjoying the Sunlight) this toy goes with us.  Not just today but for many years to come.
5.0	the pictures and the description are misleading. the stock picture (and the title) refer to the blackfoot extreme. The Description describes the blackfoot extreme. The other pictures (presumably the pictures of the real item for sale) is of the BlackFoot, not The BlackFoot Extreme.  there is a huge difference between the two, and i hope that mammoth hobbies can straighten out the confusion.... is it a blackfoot or the blackfoot extreme for sale?<br /><br />here's an image of the blackFoot extreme's construction:<br />http://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=http://img1.findthebest.com/sites/default/files/2436/media/images/Tamiya_Blackfoot_Xtreme_518605.jpg&imgrefurl=http://rc-cars.findthebest.com/l/197/Tamiya-Blackfoot-Xtreme&h=509&w=800&sz=76&tbnid=7QhmP5Nfz5fW_M:&tbnh=90&tbnw=141&zoom=1&usg=__u8Kf3P-00zkVwwodm2FWSV4SHxE=&docid=IROmmMMtxqCDBM&sa=X&ei=WJKnUdT-L6-24APro4CgDQ&ved=0CE0Q9QEwBQ&dur=420
5.0	Except for the Candy Land fatigue that sometimes sets in after playing this delightful game too many times, I have no complaints. Excellent choice for young kids who have difficulty counting as is needed in so many other board games, but not in Candy Land. Yay for moving by color not number!
5.0	Bought this for my nephew.  He loved it. Very easy to do but when done well it will fool even wise adults.  you cannot repeat it with the same person or crowd, unless you secretly swap it for another one.  You can change it to one color.  Having multiple sticks will allow you to repeat the trick and produce a different color.
5.0	Bought for a gift for a 4 year old. He loves it. Well built, provides hours of entertainment. Looking forward to future toys.
5.0	My 2 and a half year old has been playing w this for over a year now. She loves it. It's a perfect size to throw in her small back pack.
5.0	All was well - huge birthday hit
5.0	Best family game ever! Really good memory game! So much fun!
5.0	Cut down to fit the cube, some were a little big for this, these will give our grandson plenty of play time on his light bright.
5.0	Much nicer than I expected!  Thank you 👀 👀 👀 !  Ordered these to be included in many nature gadgets to hang on Dora Explorer Vests!<br />🐌🐝🐞🐜🐌🐝🐞🐜  Thank you!
5.0	I love that this five-pack of puzzles were the same price as just one. My 3.5-year-old son had fun working them together when they came in the mail. They are hard puzzles, but the age on the box says 6 and up, which seems accurate. It would be nice if each of the puzzles had its own box... that's my only complaint- but for the price, it's worth it.
5.0	Product was very good
5.0	My 11 year old son has a rather large collection of elanco snap kits and gear.  Sometimes you find that your experiment isn't working and have to deduce whether its the batteries or if you have made a mistake.  This takes a layer of guess work out of the operation and make &#34;snap kitting&#34; more fun.
5.0	grand daughter loved it
5.0	This is the softest and well put together bear. He is great.  A+++++
5.0	Another three in one Lego success.  My seven year old managed the construction challenge well with just a tish of help from his older brother.
5.0	This was a gift for someone who is under a great deal of stress.  It is helping her de-stress!  Just something tactile to fidget with but apparently, it is working.  I bought it because it claims to help with quitting smoking by helping one to relax.  Very pleased that she saw results, and quickly.
5.0	My granddaughter squealed when she saw these.
5.0	Installed on johndeere gator . Runs like a new one
5.0	Solid performance deck.  No issues.
5.0	awesome exatly as described
5.0	This is my first fixed pitch helicopter and it is really fun and easy to fly. It is fairly durable and its cheap to replace any parts that might get broken.
5.0	Have ever wondered what it would be like to have an energy ball in your hand. Well perhaps Glofx can help with their 4 LED Double Light Set. This rave item will certainly have the crowd looking in your direction when these lights are flickering.  This gives you an assortment of colors and it is durable. This  a great item to feature at any rave.
5.0	This box is very beautiful and usefull. I will use to keep the regards os the baptism of my little daughter.
5.0	This little Darth is WAY too expensive, but if your little guy needs a Darth and you don't want to blow $150 on one set (why is Darth only in the high-dollar kits???) than this is the way to go. Comes in a nice little box and my boy was happy.
5.0	I am a therapist working with children and these are the best bubbles.  They last the longest then any other and even in cold weather when they are in my car they are the only ones that consistently work.  Love them.
5.0	It's freaking cards against humanity. The more people you can get to play the funnier it gets.
5.0	Such a fun way for children to make art! Long lasting markers that do not get damaged know matter how hard the kids pound the markers on the paper. My only issue is that these markers are not washable, recommend a smock when using.  Markers come off skin after a few wAshes.
5.0	I've been playing this game for over 25 years.  Once you get the hang of it, you're hooked.   It's a fun alternative to backgammon, chess or other two person games.
5.0	My boy loves this trike.  We push him around the mall and I have to laugh because all of the other kids look at him and point as to say I want to ride that trike. He is so proud to have it he is just beaming with joy. The handle detaches easily for transport and it is pretty easy to assemble.
5.0	It's perfect! A little heavy though and breakable, so leave the kids away from it.<br />100% satisfied, the blood drips is a great detail
5.0	This was purchased for a 7-year-old.  She has had no problem coming up with her own creations.  She has spent a lot of time making her jewelry.
5.0	my 4 year old loves this toy. he loves being able to take the wheels on and off. Very cute. This price listed is kind of high I've seen them cheaper at toysrus
5.0	"This riding outfit was designed for an \\""American Girl\\"" doll. I hand made an 11inch Waldorf doll, and the horseback riding outfit fits perfectly, and is easy for a child to take off and put on. There is some Velcro, and some buttons, but altogether, very nicely made, and perfect for an 11 inch doll, and a 6-7 year old child!"
5.0	Fun toy that my boys love. Creativity went in to making this product and my sons enjoy the features. Great price and free shipping. Best experience.
5.0	Gorgeous and worth every penny! Arrived in perfect condition.  It's a little difficult to get it to lay totally flat due to the design, but I like that aspect because it gives more dimension.  it's a beautiful but not over the top statement piece. I can see it kinking up easily in transit so pack it carefully (it arrived in a longish bag that prevented it from curling in the way I warn).
5.0	This is a great idea and a pretty sturdy little bank. I gave them to my niece and nephew for christmas this year and we put a little starter money in each of the areas--Save, Spend and Share. Their parents have already instilled this in them at a young age, but it was nice for us to be able to reinforce it.  I suspect there is a familial &#34;sweet spot&#34; where you can presume to know what kids should do with their money, without having their parents get annoyed with you for being preachy. I think Godparent, or Auntie/Uncle type relationship is perfect for that.
5.0	The Fisher-Price Baby Go Crawl and Cruise Musical Jungle is an entertainment toy of fun.  My great niece just loves this toy and it has helped in her development, as well.
5.0	We bought this for my 2.5 year old to get him comfortable with using utensils himself since many of the utensils on the market for toddlers are too large or small.<br /><br />For us, these work well. He can handle the fork and spoon on his own without overloading either. The other plus to this set is the fact that it comes with a case--this is perfect for traveling or eating out.<br /><br />I have no complaints thus far.
5.0	This was a fun and cute button.  The release of frustration it provided was helpful and just plain fun. We enjoyed it.
5.0	I buy the Holiday Barbie for my daughter every year.  She is a collector and loves them.  However I've noticed that the quality isn't quite as good as previous ones. That's really a shame.
5.0	Same hats you will find in the Disney parks! Great deal and great quality! Wearing these in the park sparks everyone from cast members to other guests to say &#34;congratulations&#34; every time you are around, perfect idea for honeymoons or anniversaries!
5.0	I’m sure you have read the write up on the artist and the background of guest boxes and will not bore you by restating that.<br />In the box are two new Survivor/Zombivor figures, dashboard cards in English, French & Spanish and 2 skull trackers.<br />Bones is a good survivor for play.<br />The starting skill of tactician is useful when playing with others, less so in a solo game.<br />His orange and red skills are useful but not great.<br />The combination of slippery and lucky is interesting but needs a good melee weapon to be really useful.<br /><br />Padre Johnson is almost a “must have” survivor and the real value in this box.<br />Super Strength converts any melee weapon into a three-damage weapon.<br />Give him the best melee weapon the group has and turn him loss on the Abominations.<br />The group no longer has to run and search until they find a 3-damage weapon if you get an early abomination spawn.<br />The orange skill Medic allows him to heal one wound a turn keeping survivors alive and in play.<br />With a good melee weapon, Padre Johnson can reach Red early in a game.<br />Lifesaver or Toxic Immunity can make him a defensive or offensive power depending on the pick.<br />My preference is Medic and Toxic Immunity with +1 to dice roll: Combat in Ultra Red.<br />Add a Dog Companion to increase his melee hit chances and there are few combinations of zombies he cannot beat.
5.0	"This was my very first \\""speed\\"" cube and I mus say that it was/is a good cube. It arrived sooner then expected, was lubed without having any excess grease or what not, but I fixed the tension to my liking since it was a bit tight. I bought it about 2 months ago and it is still going strong. The corner cutting is decent, it likes to lock up a bit, but other than that its a good starter cube to start getting used to, rather than using the rubix brand. Stickers have a nice texture to it but after a while the yellow side started peeling so I just removed them to have a white opposite of black. My times started from 5 minutes and with this cube I have worked it out to get an average of 31.28 sec."
5.0	exactly how i expected it to be. came so nicely packaged fits size 3-5 kids. great look my daughter loves it
5.0	Great! Son loves it. It was exactly what I was looking for. Really helping him out with his reading. He enjoys doing the computer lessons.
5.0	Bought this for my daughter for Christmas. Super excited for her to open her gift. She loves Abby on Sesame Street and will certainly love this doll. Super adorable.
5.0	My 3 children range in age from 4-10.  We all love this fast paced game - never a dull moment!  My 4-year-old needs a bit of help from Mom or Dad!  This is a must have!
5.0	My daughter will love it.
5.0	These are great to give to the grandkids when they sleep over.  They from dusk until dawn.  I'll buy more.
5.0	My 9 year old daughter loved it!
5.0	I got this for my nephew (4) as a Christmas gift.  I can't wait for him to dig into this.  Great seller, fast shipment.  Product is as described.
5.0	Bought the mini wrex dawg for my 4 year old twin boys Robot Birthday Party and it was a huge hit. All the kids played with this little guy and my boys have played with him every day since. Love it!... great deal and a lot of fun for under $10.
5.0	Shawna Karrasch uses this toy to help desensitize horses in her On Target Training video for despooking and building confidence in your horse. It is a very effective training tool since it is triggered by motion, it rolls about and laughs infectiously.[[ASIN:1872119271 You Can Train Your Horse to Do Anything!]]
5.0	My daughter loved it.
5.0	Easy to see.  Well made.
5.0	LEGOS!  Kids love them!<br /><br />SUPER HEORES!  Kids love them!
5.0	My 3 year old grandson loves the bike We bought for Christmas but it's too small for me. Also I have bad knees. It hasn't broken but it's too soon to tell how sturdy it is but it looks well made.  Hoping there is no lead paint on it but as he won't grow up smart like Granpa.PS Sharon is my wifes name.
5.0	updated version of the older game released on the 80s.  Light and sounds are great.  Great for kids and adults too.  Great for memorization and coordination skills. everyone in the family enjoys it from my 5 year old to grandma. If you have the opportunity get it!
5.0	My nephew can't put these down! He loves the size, texture and color of the trains. I thought they'd just be fun in the tub, but he carries them around every waking moment.
5.0	I enjoyed this product a lot aside from only a few cards in the series I got a lot of new strategy to my deck even built a few new ones. Well worth it.
5.0	My son loves this train! He plays with it and the other trains for hours and hours. Worth the money
5.0	Wasn't sure about the quality of this item when I ordered it because of the price, but was pleasantly surprised when it arrived. The quality is pretty good for the price, and it's just adorable on my daughter. She loves it and I'm happy with my purchase!
5.0	It arrived in good time, but the box had many duct tape. Apparently it was opened before and several times which made me think it was used, but then i checked every single detail and part and the figure is perfect, not a single  scratch... on a second thought it appears new.<br /><br />... anyway it deserves the 5 stars, its amazing.
5.0	Bought to accompany Friar Guido costume- for price it is very effective
5.0	I gave this as a gift and they loved it. They always bring up how much fun it is every time I see them.
5.0	Huge hit with the 4th grade boys indoor recess in the North this year :-)  Really beats spending 75 cents in the vending machine at the dollar store to get all 32 teams together!!
5.0	My step-dad sent money for the kids (almost 2, and 3.5 years old) and we weren't sure what to get them. They had a little riding-bus they were fighting over, so we started looking at riding toys. My husband found these and I was a little skeptical. I loved the concept that the wheels spin 360º so we purchased one each for the kids. Even though it says 18-36 months, my 3.5-year old has as much fun (if not more!) than my two year old.<br /><br />We have tile throughout our house, so it's great for this. They have had them for almost two weeks now, and play with the constantly. When they first got them I think the spent 2 solid hours with them.<br /><br />The padding seems to be getting a little squished on the 3.5-year olds ride, but other than that I only have great things to say about this product!
5.0	Purchased to use as goody boxes for a child's birthday. Fit the bill exactly. Once assembled the box offers plenty of strength to hold party favors. So long as you don't have unreasonable expectations of the weight that these boxes can handle you'll have no problems.
5.0	My daughter loved it!!!
5.0	Our 5-yr-old grandson loves to take this dump truck apart and reassemble it repeatedly with the battery-operated screwdriver.  He also loads the truck with toys and integrates it into his other play activities.  So we have purchased take-apart dump trucks for our younger grandsons for Christmas.
5.0	The way you can tell a good board game is if you want to play it again after you play for the first time. We instantly wanted to play again. Everyone I have shown this game to feels the same way. They understand it quickly and always want to play multiple times.<br /><br />The cards are quality and I love that you can choose which cards to use each game. It makes replay-ability great.
5.0	Well, OK, strip poker is still pretty darned fun. But if you have a group of people who won't be offended by offensive stuff, you will laugh you a** off.
5.0	I purchased this great little truck for my grandson about 6 months ago. He is turning 2 years this month and plays with it even more now that he is a little older. He loves the little driver and monkey...we somehow lost the giraffe. I recommend this truck. It makes great noise and moves well. Great value for your money.
5.0	I LOVE this analogy:  Imagine your child took the same interest and wonder in Jesus and the Christian message as they did in princesses, fairies and elves? The Jesus Sees Us doll and accompanying book are tools to assist you in engaging your child and starting the conversation with them about Jesus' teachings.  It is NEVER too late or early to learn about Jesus!!  Your child will need Him his/her whole life!!
5.0	My family loves playing this game.  It's great even for smaller children.  We put all the tiles in a big ziploc bag so we don't lose any, makes it easy to transport to friends' houses.  I highly recommend it for a good game night at home.
5.0	I'm always confused why this model is more easy to find than the other two that are out, even so though the company that made these are out of business and they are hard to find.  I've been wanting one for a while now beings I'm an unreal fan, and she is one of my favorite characters from the game.  It came fast, and when it got here I eagerly ripped everything open, with unreal taunts and battles that I've been through running through my mind lol  Once out I found it to be just as awesome as I expected.  Some notes.  It will not stand on its own, even with the feet attachments included it is off balance and needs to be leaned against something to stand upright.  I used a large medicine container spraypainted flat silver so it looks like metal.  Overall I'm happy with it, and love glancing at it and remembering all the time wasted akin my youth playingnunreal2k4   Get it while it's still here, that's all I can say, these things are hard to find.  They may only be worth $4-3 but you will not find them many place, I chalk my purchase down to pure luck
5.0	Hooray for another Barbie with brown skin. I combed Amazon, looking for brown Barbies, as gifts for the children of my friends and employees here in Ghana, where I live. This doll is pretty, has a cute outfit that is easy to take on and off, and wears cute shoes. I don't think she looks particularly African, rather some unspecified brown &#34;ethnic&#34; look. But her Ghanaian mommy loves her, and I do too. And she fits into generic &#34;Barbie&#34; style clothes and accessories.
5.0	We love making stories with the story cubes.  Great way to bring the family together.
5.0	Daughter loves this toy shipping was super fast.
5.0	to let the kids get creative with their tracks. We bought our train table and track second hand, so we have a mish mash of different sets and no plans to actually know how things are supposed to go together. These let us easily use all of our pieces and make all kinds of configurations. Great buy.
5.0	was a gift over a year ago...children loved it
5.0	My girl loves it and it fit her fine.  It's pretty fluffy too. She is 8.
5.0	this was a great toy when my daughter was a toddler and it is still a great toy for my grandchild
5.0	Fun doll.  Granddaughter plays with it all the time.
5.0	Growing up I was fortunate enough to spend a lot of time with my dad at work....dad was a pathologist specializing in skin and female cancers. I used to read the pathology reference books while he was working.  I learned what cancer looks like under a microscope and even more importantly how sad my dad would be when he would have to tell the oncologist that a child had been diagnosed with cancer.  I have seen so much cancer in my life and never once has it made me laugh...but these stuffed bits of cancer cells, that turn into a healthy cell not only have made me laugh but made me think of my dad, who died before his time.  It would be wonderful if the company that made these donated some to various children's cancer hospitals every year.
5.0	Everything's all good!<br />Priced decent, arrived quickly, packaged fine, fun game, moves quickly, great purchase!<br />We play for quarters, dimes, nickels or pennies...whatever roll of coins everyone can afford/agrees to 'buy in' to the game with.<br />Based on luck and roll of the dice, not skill, and no matter what, last man standing wins everything! Good fun! Instructions included. Great metal keepsake box. Recommend product and seller.<br />Can't ask for more from a simple dice game can you?
5.0	"My mother gave my daughter this doll on her [...] Christmas, when she was [...] We now have a number of \\""Molly\\""s. When you ask my nearly [...] what she does with Molly, her response is \\""I scrach her feet, scrath her tummy, and love her.\\"" My [...] son sleeps with Molly as well. I have order over a dozen Mollys' in the past few years as gifts and replacements. This is an awesome doll, as it is washable, small enough to fit in a purse (she doesn't mind being cramped up!) I hope everyone else can love Molly the way we do at my house!"
5.0	My daughter loves these on our slider. A little messy as the crayon gets on her finger & then face/hair...but what art thing is all clean anyway. I just used my vinegar/water cleaning mix and that with a paper towel washes it right off.
5.0	I have received a pic of my great-grandson standing at his new workshop playing.  It made my heart happy.  We live in different states so delivered it to him at his 1st birthday party(in wrapped box).  His grandfather over there had to assemble it and we haven't seen any negative posts from him on FB so assume that wasn't too hard.  The pic was posted on FB so all the family could enjoy it.  I have purchased other Little Tikes toys.  This was one of the reasons I chose this toy.  Perfect match.  Thanks Amazon Prime for the quick delivery as we had just returned from vacation when had to purchase and make the trip for his party.
5.0	I got this for my 4 yr old granddaughter and she loves it. It does so many things and worked great right out of the box. No extra batteries to buy. Fast delivery
5.0	Bigger than expected, and gives plenty of room for extra large sleeves. I was able to fit my main deck, and about 8 packs worth of cards in it!
5.0	Not only is this adorable, but it is very effective.  EVERYONE wants to put money in this bank.  I think if she could put it out in any random public location and just sit with it strangers would put coins on the button to watch this kitten sweep them in! The only dis advantage, if you could call it that, is it fills up quickly and has to be emptied.
5.0	All of the Ryan dolls I see in the store have painted on hair. I wanted a Ryan that had real hair. So I am very satisfied with this purchase.
5.0	My mother bought this for my almost 7 month old daughter this weekend and she just loves it.  She smiles and laughs constantly when she plays with it.  She has already figured out that if she presses his ear, he says stuff.  She hasn't figured out the other ones yet.  I love this toy because of the variety of things it says/sings.  I don't get sick of it!  Great Buy!
5.0	Great magnetic dart board for young and old alike. Highly recommend this product!
5.0	I have used DVDs like this before, but this produced just the write affect to project through windows, on a sheet or on tombstones even.  This is quite a bit of variety from scary to subtle.  Gave the affect of real people or ghosts in the windows.  I would definitely recommend products by this company.
5.0	This is a really nice chess set. We really like that it is magnetic. It is a nice size and good quality.
5.0	Super cute. Nice size to be reused for play. Used as a prob for son's birthday party.
5.0	Perfect for the price. Pieces are really good quality and my daughter loves it! Nice case to keep it organized!
5.0	None of them were broken (The extra bubblewrap wrapping probably helped), despite my worries, and they taste delicious! What else can I say?
5.0	This was just a perfect addition to the castle.  My son enjoyed helping me put this one together.  Since it wasn't too big, he helped here and there with it.
5.0	This is a fantastic figure. The articulation is incredible for $25.00, paint job is spot on, and shipment was speedy.
5.0	Purchased as a very very early Christmas gift (I'm OCD; sue me). I set it up to be sure that it worked and didn't have to be returned. It was very easy to set up, very easy to operate, and very engaging. It probably took 20 minutes tops and that included putting the batteries in.  I have no doubt that my 5 year old girl will LOVE it when she receives it. We have several Leapster products and they never fail to please. Much smaller than I thought it would be; it's a little larger than her Leapster Explorer, but that's really not an issue. The camera and the video recorder are of a pretty good quality and I KNOW that she'll especially enjoy that (she's at that age). Very excited also about her being able to enjoy the e-books on a slightly more accessible screen size. The Explorer isn't really good for reading and this is much better suited to that. Since we're just starting kindergarten and reading, we're very excited/interested in that aspect of this system.
5.0	these were a great hit at the 80's bday party - sorry for the late review!
5.0	Given as a gift. It's beautiful. It arrived quickly. It works. It's exactly what he wanted. Will be ordering again.
5.0	For my great-grandchild for a holiday gift.  I have been getting items like what her grandmother had when she was a child.  My daughter had every &#34;See and Say&#34; type of toy there was, and learned quickly and was an early reader, and still loves to read. Miss Emma, my g-gd is already learning songs (ei ei o) from the puppy that talks that I got her, and am sure this will be a winner, too
5.0	Great figure! Looking forward for Reverse-Flash. :)
5.0	Bought this for my daughter who is in the 4th grade. She really enjoys putting the things together. It is very educational. I also purchased it a a gift for other kids. Everybody liked it
5.0	Very cool glasses. Not super sturdy but the effect is exactly what I needed for my Vampire costume.
5.0	This was a gift for my granddaughter. They are well made, and very cute! Would recommend them to anyone looking for reuseable products.
5.0	I bought this for my grandson. He has so many sets and loves them all. I'm sure this one will be a hit.
5.0	This is a blast for everyone in the family.  I left it out on the coffee table and everyone who sits down picks it up and starts trying to figure it out.  We all keep coming back to it trying to get further along than the previous person.  Lots of fun for both kids and adults.
5.0	I bought this for my wife and her research... It is an excellent product.. Light is bright and clear.  Perfet
5.0	My grandson dressed in a black grim reaper hooded cape and carried this axe on Halloween; he was totally happy with the effect.
5.0	I have had this for a year and a half, and it is as sturdy as the day we assembled it. There are a few semi circles in one seat where a kid got it with a hammer while I was hanging pictures,  but even that shows very little.  If you want an attractive kids set that will last, I highly recommend KidKraft. Our kitchen is the same age,  and still good as new.
5.0	This was NIB and came just as promised...<br /><br />All the items were there! I have it out of the box sitting with my other lego items... its just awesome. I am looking for others! `
5.0	Super cute! Great size and very durable. My boys are having a blast with these. Usually my boys can break something within minutes but these have held up very well.
5.0	This was a great cup! I bought it for my brother for Christmas and he loved it. Worked just like it said it would
5.0	I bought this as a spare part. I haven't need to replace the original one yet, but is better to have it and not to need it, than need it and not have it. This helicopters are made with very good materials and they are very durable. I highly recommend you to always keep some spare parts available so you could be back flying in no time.
5.0	Super cute item. was just as described. Goes great with the rest of my scuba set. Very resonable price for this item
5.0	I have wanted this plushie for awhile. And, although it took awhile to get here, I LOVE IT! She's SO sute and she's the perfect size for hugs! Sorry, but no bossoms (lol). I would buy from the seller again! Oh, and no you may not have it, because its MMMMMMMMIIIIIIIIIIIIINNNNNNNNNNNNEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5.0	Great Quality, very beatiful???
5.0	The Funko POP Adventuretime Series is probably my favorite. Cake is a wonderful addition to any collector's menagerie of POPs. It's great that even the lesser known characters were included, especially Cake, Fiona, and Lemondrop.
5.0	My grandson will really enjoy this I like it and the detail is good. Price was very good.
5.0	<br /> This is the best Optimus Prime they ever made. I've been a fan since the original line back in the 80's & all the other versions of Optimus Prime are a joke compared to this one! I still can't believe how awesome this Prime is,and he only get's better when you combine him with Leo Breaker or Wing Saber. I doubt there will ever be another version of Optimus Prime that can beat this one.
5.0	Extremely pleased with this particular figure...the movement of the eye/eyelid in conjunction with the head are by far the most impressive feature...Very well done...Have a kid who is a Despicable Me fan?...Buy it...Collector?...Buy it...Can't go wrong here.
5.0	My daughter who is a kindergarten teacher picked this out for my grandson.  He loved it so much that I bought it for my boyfriend's granddaughter who is a year older.  The kids are 2 and 3 yrs old.
5.0	This is the type that uses a magnet to move the displacer, which means it has less friction and it runs in either direction. These are usually a lot more expensive.<br /><br />If I rub my hands together until they get really hot, press for about 30 seconds to prewarm the aluminum, then rub my hands again, that is enough heat to get it running for a few minutes. You do have to give it a small spin to get it started.<br /><br />It really gets going sitting on a cup of hot coffee.<br /><br />If I set it on top of my laptop's charger brick and set that right next to the laptop heat exhaust port, it runs forever from that.<br /><br />The ability to run would be enhanced by adding some heat sinks to the top plate, otherwise the top warms up slightly as it is working and that is enough to slow or stop it on very low sources of heat.
5.0	Great game, Fast Setup, Plays great with any number of players. Quick to learn, very quick to learn, even with players not familiar with many board games, and its much easier to intruduce than the first pandemic game, since this one has dice, and... everyone loves dice &#60;3 (if you dont, you are  horrible person :c).
5.0	I don't think you can ever go wrong with the Squadron Walk Around series. They may be light on historical information, but that is what the &#34;In Action&#34; series is for. These books are for the modeler and/or geek who wants detailed images of all parts of a military vehicle or plane. Lots of pictures. If you want to ever detail a 1/6 M5 Stuart, this book, and Bob Steinbrunn's book &#34;Large Scale Armor Modeling: Building a 1/6 Scale Stuart Tank&#34; will set you up.
5.0	This is just what I was looking for... a super heavy duty thick jump rope.  I gave this to my children's school in honor of their birthday and it gets used many times over every day!
5.0	My loves it! He won't put it down, he loves his new friend. Got it quickly, we are all happy with his new toy.
5.0	Great game for 2 or more players who are familiar with worker placement type games. It's a game where strategy is involved in the way you play, but it doesn't take itself so seriously that the fun aspects of a table top game are lost. I'd recommend getting the game, thoroughly reading the instructions and then jumping in.
5.0	We bought it for our one year old two years ago, and it stills comes out every now and again.   Our second child has been using it now since he was about 5 months old.  This is the gift I am giving now for any one year old's birthday party.  It's great.  It has a little bit of everything like tools, shape sorting, and music.  Love it.
5.0	always love mousetrap but it's getting less trecherous which was part of the fun.
5.0	I was very lucky to find these available here a few weeks before Christmas. I could not find anything like this in the local stores.<br /><br />This is one of the reasons I do not bother shopping at the local corporate owned boxes anymore. Most of the time they are out of stock, the package is damaged or it has been opened. You have to wait in line. You have to waist the gas to get there. I could go on but that is not what you want to see here sorry.<br /><br />All the cars were in perfect working order as always with Mattel products<br /><br />It is exciting for the kids because you do not know what you are getting until the package arrives, the cars are not always what is pictured if I remember right.<br /><br />I would buy again
5.0	This is a very cute little fabric horse. Perfect for a baby gift which is what I purchased it for. I was looking for something just like this and was happy to find it.
5.0	These were for gifts,<br />They well enjoyed.
5.0	Looks great! Very fast delivery!
5.0	This baby doll is a fabulous choice for someone who wants a baby boy doll. It is a perfect size for a toddler to hold and cuddly. I gave Baby Owen to my grandson when his brother was expected and he carried it everywhere. When his new brother was born - you  guessed it, they named him Owen!
5.0	This set brought back a lot of nostalgia. It does not have any mini LEGO men, just lots and lots of blocks! Fun for all of us. Plus, the container comes in handy for storing and organizing bricks while you are playing (the top cover, converts into a four section tray). It also comes with a small instruction booklet with some building ideas.
5.0	received in good condition and works well in sunny window. would buy from seller again. price was right too. thanks
5.0	My grandson who is not quite 2 yet loved the train.  He would sit for several minutes (which is record) and watch Thomas the Train roll around tracks.  Was nice that train could run on bare floors also.
5.0	Awesome hit for three year olds. Smaller than I expected but the kids enjoyed them. They were given to three year olds
5.0	Big enough for 2 camp chairs or all 5 of us on a blanket.  Both front and back  can zip closed for privacy or open for a breeze. Easy to fold closed if you take 2 minutes to learn how (YouTube videos for this). Can push bottom closer together to make it taller or have it short and wider if sitting on the ground. Zipper pocket on inside for keys or phone. Pockets on outside to fill with sand if you don't prefer to use the stakes on the beach. Very nice and easy to use product. Perfect for my family with 3 young kids because there is no complicated set up or break down.
5.0	This deck of cards is not for learning to read the clock face, but for understanding how long a period of time is. For instance, by comparing the cards, our daughter could explain that fifteen minutes is the same as a quarter of an hour. It's easier now when we tell her that dinner is ready in 20 minutes or that she has to finish watching TV when the program is finished in 8 minutes.  She's become more interested in using her wristwatch, and she simply understands the concept of time better.
5.0	very amusing and a must have for the birthday gang, if you are a richard scarry fan. Your little ones will have a great time with these
5.0	My son needed them for a talent show where he was singing Dirty Diana. Everyone was very impressed!
5.0	I love Jellycat. The Thumble Penguin is so cute!
5.0	My son Loves his Vsmile Pocket. I definitely recommend it to other parents for their kids. He's dropped it quite a few times and it still works great. My only recommendation is BUY RECHARGEABLE BATTERIES! You won't regret it.
5.0	Perfect &#34;first&#34; game for my 2 1/2 yr. grandson. Assists in learning about taking turns and has diverse activities to appeal to multiple intelligences, as well as involving physical activity.
5.0	Cute toy, fun and small enough to take on the go
5.0	for my grandson and he loved it. thank you
5.0	My niece who is 6 months old got this for Xmas. She spends a lot of time chewing on it so we're all crossing our fingers there isn't any lead in it.
5.0	This was bought as a gift for my 4 y.o. grandson.  He spends many hours playing with his Geotrax trains, usually able to set them up by himself.
5.0	This was a gift for our granddaughter. She loves dressing her doll, and we were pleased with the quality of the gown.
5.0	Perfect to use as party favors for my daughters birthday party.  Great price too!
5.0	This was easy to use once I figured out how to flip the puzzle without it falling apart.  Used the hanger that was included and it makes a great wall hanging.
5.0	the best game ever, for young and old. Takes a few rounds to get the strategy, but most of ages catch on quick.
5.0	Very cute and my friend loved the all so much. Very much worth the buy!
5.0	Ours arrived frozen due to where we reside. I just left it for two days and it was thawed out and ready to play with. It sits on my desk. It is peaceful to watch. It is also great for calming (autism). The screen is 5 x 7. It is attached at the side to a frame which it can be removed to just hold in your hands. It has held up to a couple a drops from desk height to a wood floor. I expected it to break.
5.0	The outfit was just as described.  No complaints!
5.0	Awesome fun for little guys. New peek a boo, hide n seek,  raceway and ball chase. Awesome fun.
5.0	Pots and Pans are awesome.  Very fun colors.  This was a cute little set.  My daughter loved palying with it.
5.0	It should have been sold as a 6-dart Magazine 4-pack instead of a Hailfire pack, but whatever.  I tested all of mine and they work properly.  Note that if you own a Hailfire, these smaller magazines (aka &#34;clips&#34; to most people nowadays) actually jam less than the larger magazines in the Hailfire.  For those unfamiliar with the Nerf gun line, they also have see-through material to let you know how many darts you have left.
5.0	My son loved it and dad thinks it's pretty cool as well!
5.0	This game is so fun and so wrong on so many levels.  My friends and I are very avid fans of this game and it is always brought out when ever we have a group.
5.0	Perfect!!!!  I used them for my daughter's baby shower.  She loved them!!!!
5.0	This was my favorite model to build so far (and first RG).  The RG skeleton really embraces the mobility and allows the Exia to form pose after pose.  Although he comes with a great selection of beam swords and solid swords, I really can't remove the GN Sword from his hand based on principal alone.  It's that cool.<br /><br />Some clear green (for the headpiece and GN drive) make great eye candy.<br /><br />Although there's a TON of decals, it's satisfying to apply them all and they really make the details pop.  This is one you can show your friends, point and say &#34;I did this&#34; and they'll be all &#34;Wows&#34;
5.0	This little set was just an addition to the many bruder toys I have. My nephews love this set and play with it all the time.  The pieces are small so we keep them in a small container when were done playing so we dont loose them.
5.0	Got these to protect hand written recipes from my mother-in-law. My old recipe box was not organized and the cards were fading and getting spills on them. This is a great seller. Fast shipping and items arrived in great condition. I would purchase again!
5.0	Looks and fits awesome. Great buy.
5.0	Nice card. Perfect for any Pokemon Card collector.
5.0	I purchased this teddy bear for my first granddaughter who is 6 months old and just learning to play peek a boo.  She was totally fascinated with it and loves the softness of the bear and the sweet voice of playing peek a boo
5.0	These miniature figures are super cute and well painted. I got all the figures advertised, including the special extra figure and one duplicate for a total of twelve. As my first piece of Madoka merchandise, I'm happy to have gotten a whole set of cute figures.
5.0	This is so cute!!! It is very well constructed and sturdy.  My 15 mo granddaughter loves it and it keeps her busy and quiet(er) during church.
5.0	Searching for another one for my second son.  Very soft and cuddly.
5.0	Awesome for teaching time.
5.0	My husband and I always joked that we will buy our first grand baby a pony... well she's too young for that so we got her this.  ;)  It's soooo cute!!!  Nice and soft and cuddly too!
5.0	Bought this costume for my little girl. She loved it and after several wears, it is still holding up well.
5.0	I love it and the kids love it! They play with it all the time and some of them are ruff and this did not break.
5.0	Great company and quality toys! As a bonus the toys are made in the USA and from recycled material. We have several other sets of trucks, cars, boats,plane, rocket from this company and our son enjoys all of them. They are durable and beautiful.
5.0	My son loves this ATM Bank. He used to loose or misplace his money before he got this bank.
5.0	My 4 year old son LOVES Paw Patrol and requested that I make cupcakes for his preschool class.  The kids Loved the rings.  The shipping was fast and they were a reasonable price.  I was very pleased with this purchase.
5.0	mandisa true beauty cd
5.0	Good quality. Durable.
5.0	My neice loves stuffed animals, especially ones that have a companion with them. She will be thrilled. Very soft and true to picture.
5.0	My grandson was extremely delighted with this gift
5.0	My son loves this item.
5.0	Very nice and looks like Arnold.I am very happy with this purchase. A must have for any collector and fan of the Treminator Movie.
5.0	Really nice! complimented the party's theme.
5.0	I have had one of these at work for maybe 20 years.  Works great indoors and has entertained me and my co-workers without fail for all that time.  Perhaps the greatest toy ever invented!
5.0	This is one of our new favorite games! It's a little complicated to understand when you first get started, but by the time you actually begin playing with friends it's great. And it doesn't take that long to finish the game either, which makes it easier to fit in than a game of Catan.
5.0	Exactly what we were looking for and an unbeatable price!  The set even came with the utensils that are shown. This made our little Birthday Boy very happy!
5.0	They are awesome and just the perfect size for party favors!!
5.0	i was hesitant to purchase a wig online (as you never know the quality until you see it in person), but let me just say: wow! this wig is lovely and as natural looking as an inexpensive wig can be!<br /><br />first of all: the color. so much more beautiful than the photo. it looks like a very natural glossy raven black. it is the most natural looking black wig i have ever seen.<br /><br />second: the quality. the cap itself is very sturdy and comfortable. and the 'hair' feels nearly real. the wig is advertised as being heat-resistant, and i believe this to be true.<br /><br />the bangs are a little long and i will probably take this to my stylist to have her adjust the length so i can see better when i wear it. because of how low the cap goes, the bangs start fairly low on the forehead. i'm not sure if this will present a problem, but i doubt it will.<br /><br />in all, this is an excellent wig for the price, as well as an excellent wig overall. i will definitely be purchasing more wigs of this brand!<br /><br />*** *** ***<br /><br />as a side note, this arrived FAR faster than the estimated delivery date. i believe it took about nine days to reach me on the west coast from its point of origin.
5.0	Bought these for they raceway for my 2 year old and he loves them! Cant go wrong with Fisher-Price.
5.0	It was lots of fun and easy to follow. Children really enjoyed playing the game. Other friends wanted one too. Thank you.
5.0	I love all of Playmobil's advent calendars, and I never thought they'd come up with anything more adorable than the pony calendar.  I was wrong - this one is just adorable, and great for boys and girls alike.
5.0	quick to put up. quicker to take down. my 1yr old LOOOOVED IT.
5.0	WOW, what an amazing mask.  Let me tell you a story.  We originally cast a real horse for the film clip below    [...]    And we had nothing but problems.  Turns out ex racehorses are complete Divas.  Always wanting to go to their trailers, always bitching about the quality of the their oat bags and don't even get me started on how hoofy they get with the production assistants after a few drinks.  So we fired the bum and payed a non union actor 50 bucks and the rest of the oats to don the mask and play the role of creepy skittish horse for 3 WHOLE DAYS.  I'm not going to get my hopes up just yet but thanks to the horse mask....Oscar Season 2014 here we come
5.0	Came LSQ and very beautiful!<br />I received the sport horse and blue roan mustang, just what I wanted :)<br />These horses will be a perfect fit in my breyer collection!
5.0	The drift King is a very nice heli to start with.  I have been interested in this RC world for a while but didn't know where to start either planes, boats, cars, trucks but then decided to start in the air with a heli. Nothing to fast but just right with no sim. This heli is fast but very controllable, durable,  the first two days I crashed into just about everything in my house ( nothing broke) by the third day I could hoover make circles and working on my figure 8 but im not there yet. So my over all rating is a 4 Good learning tool.<br /><br />suggested<br />1.  Buy an extra landing gear.<br />2.  A Must Heli anti crash kit a carbon fiber training gear set<br />3.  Learn to hoover first and then everything will start to become easy.
1.0	My son got this and has to put a cartridge in the pen to play with the right book.  The cartridges get LOST and you are out of luck.  This pen does not work all the time and it is pretty weak.  I also found out that this product is a KNOCK OFF of the Tag Pen by Leapfrog.  We picked Tag up recently to replace this one.  What a difference!
1.0	The toy says it is for 6+ month, it is definitely not! My son is 9 months and this toy makes him cry many times in just 3 days!<br /><br />My son can not stand by himself, but he is good at hold something as a support and stand up, and this toy has a big problem with kids in this period. When he sits, his head is lower than the upper-red-doorpost, but his head is much higher than it when he stand up. There were many times he sit in front of the door (and under the red-doorpost), held the door, and tried to stand up...you may guess the result, 8 out of 10 times his head will hit the doorpost, and the hit is at top of his head, the softest part, and he cried heavily.<br /><br />The slide part is also very very small, you do not expect a 1-year old child can slide anyway, because even my 9 month son can hardly get through it. The highest point of the yellow arc just reaches his chest when he stands up, how could you imagine he will play it as a usual slide?<br /><br />The installation is also horrible. For the 2 purple-side-door-post, the holes for screw is narrow and deep. I have a toolset which contains 50+ different size of screw driver bits, but I can not find one which could be inserted into the hole. Finally I have to use force to push the screw driver into the hole and enlarge it.<br /><br />Another ridiculous thing is, for the same purple doorpost, there are 2 screws are designed under the sticker, which means once you have the thing installed and put the sticker on, you can not take them off without tearoff and damage the sticker. As I said the red-upper-doorpost is too low and I decided to take it and the 2 purple doorpost off, suddenly I found I have to either tearoff the sticker, or punch 2 holes on the sticker to unscrew it.<br /><br />For a toy for 6+ month child, this thing is ridiculously small, everything is smaller than it should be (for save cost? I don't know, how much it costs for some more plastic materials?). It's just like I said I designed a car for basketball players like Shark, but it turns out that I give them a Smart.
1.0	Mine did not light up.  Will request a refund :(
1.0	the figure looks great, but Hawkman is horribly unbalanced and simply doesn't stand up for any length of time.  it's incredibly frustrating.
1.0	It was broken when I received it
1.0	This doll is horrible and so dissapointing for my 4 year old daughter.  Forget about combing her hair you'll loose half of it in the process.  I sware it is horse hair!  The head popped off twice.  And the nail painting is a huge dissapointment too.  The makeup is a waste and I personally woulndt bother getting this, too much money and not worth it.
1.0	This product is junk. We followed directions for baking cookies and &#34;muffins&#34; gross. Very disappointed. Gave to my daughter for Christmas, sadly it will now sit in a closet until we either toss or sell at a garage sale. Waste.
1.0	It broke the very first time the kids used it. I purposely bought better quality so it would last a few years, very  expensive for what it is.
1.0	The middle stripe was yellow, not white
1.0	Was damaged when arrived. Cheaply made and not good quality at all. Spend a few more $s for a much better quality game.
1.0	I'm so annoyed I didn't read the reviews first. This is literally the worst excuse for a piñata ever haha. It's two props pig posters held together with flimsy paper. Won't even hold candy.
1.0	THE PUSH HANDLE DOES NOT STEER THIS BIKE. I was very disappointed when I reached the end of the assembly and realized that the handle on the back is for pushing only, NOT steering. We have another that I love and I was trying to buy one for preschool use bUT this one was immediately returned. Make sure you read everything to ensure that the parent handle steers the front wheel or you will be stuck going what ever direction your toddler decides!
1.0	Cute but cheaply made. I guess you certainly get what you pay for.
1.0	This toy was defective,  and it was sent back...It was supposed to be new, but it obviously was not.  Very disappointing!!!
1.0	This is the first doll of this brand that I have purchased, it was supposed to be apart of an intricate doll house that I made to be given to my daughter for Christmas. I should have read word for word better because I was thinking I was purchasing the whole family but only received the baby which is super tiny. I am really bummed out I paid almost 20 dollars for this item especially since our budget was extremely limited this year.
1.0	Played with my 6 and 8 yeast olds, two rounds of ties, everyone can easily get every piece out without skill. Had this when I was a kid, you needed to practice to get things out.  Bummer, wish I would have read the reviews first.
1.0	This toy did not work. It did not swim. If you want your child to have a hard floating Elmo, please purchase this toy. If you want a swimming Elmo, please do not waste your money.
1.0	Batteries were not included. No smoke. One light in front only. Not worth $150.00 made in China it's more like $45 to $65.
1.0	I was so hoping to love this however, the doll falls out.  As a previous poster noted the harness only goes up to the pelvis of the dolly and it falls out frontwards.  Although I could add another chest strap, I really don't have the desire to do so.  It will go back, sadly.
1.0	Not good. I thought the product would come with everything but it did not. I got a quarter of what was supposed to be there. Yet they claim to have sent it all. Not happy.
1.0	In the 4 years that I have owned this product, the motor died twice in less than 4 years. The first time the motor died, Maytronics replaced it. Now the second time Robostar/Maytronics (Israeli company) won't fix it. WARNING: THE 3 YEAR WARRANTEE STARTS FROM THE DATE OF PURCHASE AND DOES NOT EXTEND IF THEY REPLACE THE MOTOR. They replaced the motor in 2007 and it died in 2008. They will not replace it. They want $900 for a replacement. I said no way. They won't ship it back to me unless I pay a $100 diagnostic fee. So now I have a $1200 paperweight. Scary huh? Avoid this unit.    Jack Mahon  Marlborough, MA
1.0	I purchased this product to play with my dog, but unfortunately within 10 minutes both hands broke off. It is an easy enough fix because you can re-sew them back on, but I shouldn't have to.  I bought a few different varieties of this toy from various sellers  and this is the only one I had issues with.  The others are still going strong.
1.0	Product was heavily used, dirty and covered in stickers that cant be removed. Missing the fob to play back recording too. Very disappointed.
1.0	Tail rotor not working. Have to return and pay shipping for something that does not work properly.
1.0	The beyblades have a new design that i think sucks. It has this weird thing in which instead of a fusion wheel and enrgy ring, it has a fusion wheel and this weird plastic thing under. Also every fusion wheel is colored.Here's something else: 2 metal thingies are so op(maybe).the only bey in my arsenal could beat a 2 metal thing bey was meteo l drago. Im trying to think of another. Maybe phantom orion? Go metal fury! Boo shogun steel!By the way this review is by the kid.
1.0	They leak from the filler plug and the barrel. Not worth a quarter. Must be better ones somewhere or are they banned like a kids fingers!
1.0	These balls arrive deflated and that is not mentioned in the description. What am I suppose to do with these as I live in a condo and don't have a pump. I would send these back but because of the postage I won't  and I think they count on that. They are going in the trash . Don't waste your money. By balls that are inflated and ready to play with.
1.0	received this for my daughter for Christmas...not impressed.Everytime you want to turn it back on you have to hit the reset button or won't turn on. All you have to do is move Dora back and forth to get items for her backpack and avoid Swiper...you can move a few steps left and right anyways...that's it...nothing else...not worth the money and very boring.
1.0	Tiny.  I mean TINY.  Was hoping to fill with helium and have for the b-day party.  To small to even fill, if you did fill them they wouldn't float...sad.
1.0	I purchased this intex water slide for my grandaughter who wieghe 100 lb and slide says up to 165 lbs. she had used it for about 2 weeks after i inflated it and as she was sliding down it friday 7/8/12 the whole left side split half way down and is beyound patching i would not purchase this item if i was you bought it threw amazon .com
1.0	Bought this ball for my daughter, too heavy, too big and the limitations.  Basically use it on a carpeted floor with nothing around.  My Italian Coffee table can attest to this, luckily only the glass broke and the marble remained in tack.  What they show on TV is people outside having a blast... can't have on grass, not sure you should have in the sun.  I'm amazed this is marketable on TV without them at least saying something about the time necessary to use this ball or if you have small hands forget it.  I suppose dishonesty has become the norm for the American advertisement community!!!
1.0	cheap.  these things break way too easy.  Not worth whatever you shell out to buy.  Its all fun and games until the landing and then pitch in the trash.  Like flying eggshells.
1.0	Played this game and I am no prude but it is pretty bad.  Some of the cards just wrong.  Jokes about the holocaust and child molesters are not funny.  Will not play again.
1.0	The pin immediately fell out of the green cymbal section, releasing the metal cymbals and subsequently I found the actual pin. I felt this was a potential hazard since the baby could have found, and swallowed, this pin had I not discovered it first! Please check this before allowing baby to play. Perhaps put an extra dab of glue in that area to prevent.
1.0	Very disappointed when I received this product. The design is cute, but the reason I decided on this kitchen was because of its color scheme. It's cute and soft without being overly girly. The kitchen I received is done in bold yellow, blue, and fushia colors. Not what I wanted at all.
1.0	Spent 4 hours putting decals on and putting together. When I tried to close it I had to take it apart in order to close it. Very disappointed.
1.0	This costume was a waste of money. The head piece was lopped sided. We tried blow drying it so we can molded back didn't work. Because of this my son couldn't really see..and The head piece was cut very sloppy it wasn't even in the back. This costume was like 40.00 at the spirit store. So we decided to get this on here instead for 25. Not worth it.
1.0	"I ordered upper and lower replacement blades for the Scout CX on Feb. 14. A few days ago I emailed a question, \\""Where's my stuff\\""? They replied, \\"" It's been shipped, It's on the way.\\"" So I placed my order again this time with a different vendor. I received the blades promptly and have installed them. Still no blades from my original order. It's March 6. Where's my stuff. I've paid for ito"
1.0	This product is cheaply made and is breaking the entire time my nephew is trying to play with it. He hardly moves the ladder and it keeps falling off. I REALLY wish I hadn't bought this. He was sooo excited when he first saw it but lost interest in it fast because it is junk and falling apart. It is made of extremely cheap plastic and not worth the money we paid.
1.0	This item also cracked!  Even tried wood glue but gave up after awhile and threw it out.  Was sad to see that it was a waste of money.
1.0	I am truly suprised that this chair has such high reviews, we just returned it and bought a Graco. First of all the shoulder harness has two overlapping belts which are a pain to adjust. Second, the release lever for the restraints is conviniently located on the side, but of course you have to wrestle with it and put your whole body weight on it for it to click and release the belts. Was mine a faulty one? I don't think so.
1.0	"This was such a disappointment!  It is so flimsy- shifts all over the place and will not sit upright.  When no one is in it, it is forever lopsided.  Will update with another suggestion after I get in the next one we're trying!<br /><br />Ordered \\""The Cottage Playhouse\\"" from Walmart.  A little more money, but SO WORTH IT!  Super sturdy- came with 16 color coded poles for a strong structure and easy setup! I would highly recommend it- sturdy, super cute, easy to put together, and more room!!!"
1.0	Burnt out when I first plugged it in.
1.0	This helmet is not what you think, not shiny, not metal, purple inside, not what i thought. You can make your own decision.
1.0	Although, I agree with other reviews about the abysmal material quality of this product but my major complaint is a bit different.<br /><br />The design of this globe brazenly flouts the norms of ethical cartography and accepted current world maps to perpetuate China's political views. It has shown many regions in it's neighboring areas as a part of China including 2 of states from India which are globally and historically accepted as integral parts of sovereign India, while no such attempt has been made of other disputed regions in the rest of the world.<br /><br />I am returning this. Any self respecting person of Indian origin WILL NOT BUY this product.<br />And others should not buy this if they want correct world map, anyway.<br /><br />Amazon should not get played by such unethical manufacturers and help them propagate false information.<br />Will you get some quality checks in place, Amazon?!
1.0	The helicopter developed multiple issues within 3 months of normal use (no bad crashes or any kind of abuse):<br />One of the rotors stopped working. The swashplate control stopped working.<br />A call with Horizon support looked like this:<br /><br />I: &#34;It stopped working after 3 months&#34;<br />Horizon: You have to troubleshoot it and we will sell you replacement parts.&#34;<br />I: &#34;What about warranty?&#34;<br />Horizon: &#34;There is no warranty&#34;<br />I: &#34;Are not you going to fix or replace a helicopter that failed after 3 months?&#34;<br />Horizon: &#34;No.&#34;
1.0	Was not 24x36 like it said online. Turned out to be 22x34. Even though I did have a frame for it, I was still disappointed  with the order
1.0	The stickers a so small you can't get them off the roll.  Not worth the money as cheap as the price is.
1.0	Even though it's not too big my boyfriend was critical about this paint scratch on the helmet right at the end of the beak of the bird, it is nice but I just want it to be nice and crisp. with Seahawks stuff you definitely need to be a bit critical with it especially if the logo is affected, It is absolutely adorable but
1.0	I purchased this on a Sunday.  My son loved it.  On Monday evening the spring that launched the plane broke.  He was so disappointed and so am I.<br /><br />Junk.
1.0	"My 5 year old wanted this toy so bad that he cut a picture of it out of an ad in the paper and put it in his hat.  This way he would have it with him and could show it to everyone.  <br />Yippee, His Uncle bought it for him for Christmas and then 3 of his Uncle's and his father spent an hour or so putting it together.  Once it was put together my son played with it for a couple of hours, it does nothing, no bells or whistles, and it is difficult to transform into a sphere.  I, his mother, get the \\""lovely\\"" task of transforming it, Yeah....<br />My son uses it to slam his other transformers in to, so it gets a few additional minutes of play from time to time.  I would not recommend this to anyone, it is NOT worth the money."
1.0	Did not send what I asked for and I got ripped off I asked for a booster box 1st edition and got a special edition box I paid $47 for a freaking $30 item
1.0	I have been searching for a fishbowl crib toy for my daughter for a while now. I came across this particular one, and the seller 100% GUARANTEED my satisfaction! BULL! Seller claimed that all toys were tested prior to shipping, guess they forgot this one?? The entire right side has no working bubbles, the big fish in the middle does not move at all. Seller also claimed there were no scratches or marks, yet theres a scratch on the bottom, and what looks like yellow and pink marker on it. I am so disappointed its unreal!!!
1.0	This plush chair is way to small. I thought it would be bigger but it's like a doll size pillow. Never expected it till I saw it out the box :( very disappointed
1.0	Came broken.  Very disappointed.
1.0	"I had a great leak in the top of this pool about 5 minutes after inflating....it was leaking air and therefore could not stay inflated and do the whole spraying thing. Once again proving my \\""Made in China\\"" -made like crap."
1.0	Poor quality.  Ripped before wearing for an hour
1.0	The doll was cute. It was a birthday gift for my girlfriend. But they sent me the wrong SIZE!!!<br />It was supposed to be the 8 inch plush.I got a 5 1/2 beenie. If that's 8 inches? Then my ruler is a liar. I was highly disapointed. Luck would have it, my girl thought it was a cute gag gift, but that was not what I was shooting for.
1.0	It can barely stand upright, very poor design. Very flimsy for the hefty price tag. I would definitely not recommend this at all.
1.0	It was really cheap plastic and not well made.  Corners are hard and it falls apart easily.  Not suited for much at all.
1.0	Our first problem occured Christmas morning. We plugged it in and then we smelled smoke and it had two places where it got so hot it was melting. Also, the battery is too big. Will definetely return and get something else. Toys R Us should do more research before they sell something like this.
1.0	The title says set of 3 but ITS NOT A SET OF 3!, ITS JUST 1!
1.0	All crinkled and bent
1.0	This product came apart the first time it was used. I know it should come apart where one link fits into another, but this time the linking part came out of the link and could not be put back in. To appease the child, we had to remove two links and attempt to glue the white part that came out back into the link. Very disappointed!
1.0	The box this item came in was  torn in a few places but i was hopeful , however when my son opened his present on christmas morning he ended up being very disapointed in seeing his new trailer and dozer set broken in a few places . The truck's rear axle is broke in two only being held together by the &#34; drive shaft &#34; , the trailer hitch had been snapped off of the trailer so it wont hook up to the truck and most of the plastic chrome pieces had broken loose. Real dissapointment spending this amount on this item just to have it broken in various places.
1.0	I thought my 4 year old would love this.  I decided to take it out and put it together prior to Christmas because I knew he would want to play with it right away.  It took me at least 45 minutes to put the little cards into the slots.  Good luck trying to get them to stand up, and if you do, hope that the peices don't fall out.  If you try to play the game, the slots don't stay down.  What a piece of junk....better off with the regular guess who.
1.0	Left ear is covered in a hard green substance. Looks like candy. Attempted to process a return, but I would receive a refund and then I would have to reorder and pay for shipping. This was on Prime when I bought it. Very disappointed!
1.0	"I got this \\""Justin Bieber Wig\\"" for my 12 year old daughter for Halloween. She couldn't wait for it to finally come. Today she got it and tried it on. It is literally like a mushroom. It looks nothing like the picture does. It is very puffy and doesn't look anything like Justin Bieber hair. She tried to put a hat over it to make it look smaller, but the hat does not fit on top of the wig. We tried cutting it but it didn't really help. If you want to look like Justin Bieber then definitely don't get this wig!"
1.0	I bought this toy thinking it was of a higher quality than similar toys priced at $19.99 elsewhere. Turns out, same exact toy for more than twice the price!! What kind of idiots fall for this? I guess I did. I call this deceptive selling. I returned it for a refund, but warn you to not pay 150% more than this toy is worth. Get it at Toys R Us and save yourself the hassle and keep your dignity intact.
1.0	I am not happy with the product; it falls apart when you move it, nothing stays together & its hard for little hands to push goblin down & reconnect the track. I would really like my money back.
1.0	Previous purchase of  rainbow colors stamp pads was a disappointment....won't buy another.  The ink was dry in 3 out of 6 ink pads, and a disappointment to the children.w
1.0	Terrible product. I bought it 2 times. The first christmas I got it for my son at 3 1/2 years old and threw in garbage 2 days later. He saw it in a magazine 6 months later and cried for it again. Bought it a second time knowing how bad it was. It's 100 little pieces stay in a ziplock bag collecting dust. I hate hate hate this toy. It does not close once put together, you need to take it apart to turn city back into firetruck. Then put whole thing back together again when they want a city. Terrible execution for what could have been a great toy.
1.0	This wig was horrible. It didn't even come close to covering my hair and was definitely nothing like the picture. The styling was awful and the only head it would fit is a toddler's.
1.0	Does not work  Bought three and not one worth a dime.
1.0	This came with absolutely no instructions.Was told by the seller its not suppose to,though that wasn't mentioned in the ad.I went online to a couple forums to figure out how to get the instruction manual and downloaded it myself.Just not a good experience when I had to wait weeks for it to get here from Hong Kong.
1.0	Doesn't stick to the wall well at all! The cheaper stuff from over seas works better than this better quality! Disappointing.
1.0	Just to name a few: I pulled 17 leonin bola cards in a row, 12 kruphix's insight in a row, 6 zap in a row, 9 scryb sprites in a row.<br /><br />The cards arrived in two boxes labeled 400 count.. so I'm not sure I even got the 1000 cards. I did get a decent amount of variety, but it seemed like they just unloaded a TON of Nyx into the lot. Every 40 cards there was a grouping of Nyx commons. Nothing good either, just supply line cranes over and over and over. I pulled 10+ copies of ~30-40 different cards. About a 4th of each of the boxes were Nyx commons. I was very dissatisfied with the purchase and will not be buying from them again.
1.0	They suck they always fall off.
1.0	Description says, &#34;Dance along with Mickey as he swings his arms and sings.&#34;<br />Mickey only spins while you press his belly.  The song starts and Mickey does not continue to swing his arms as I expected.  The pictures also make it look like Mickey can stand up.  He cannot.  He actually cannot even sit up on his own.  I am returning this product.
1.0	We opened the package, put the cars on the track, and started to race the cars.  Once around and the pegs broke.  Junk
1.0	I was so excited when I found this horse at such a reasonable price to give as a gift. Unfortunately, I just received the package and the horse has clearly been used; the feet are all dirty and there are scuff marks on the sides of it.  In addition, there is NO pump and no receipt.  Just a dirty, deflated horse.  There is no way I would give this to anyone. I am very disappointed.
1.0	She thought she would like it as she likes puzzles, mystery stories, and New Orleans.  Story was trivial and she didn't like the puzzle.
1.0	1of the 4 blades doesn't work on arrival= 1 very dissappointed child.
1.0	Bad Product ever seen ...  even in dark it  is not glowing.. NOT NOT NOT NOT recommend to buy. Don't waste your money on this product
1.0	"I ordered these spinny tops for party favors for my son's birthday. The tops that I received were holiday tops with Santa and snowmen and \\""happy holidays\\"" on them. Now I will be sending them back, there is no way I will be putting holiday tops in my my son's birthday party bags."
1.0	Terrible instructions<br />Missing pieces
1.0	Wasn't real gold worth about 54 cents
1.0	This is aweful. I can't believe I spent $5 on it. It's worth a quarter. It's so cheap it should be at the dollar store and even that would be overpaying. That's how terrible it is. Don't buy it!
1.0	The toy that was on the picture was NOT the toy I received. It was not 8 inches and it was a knock off and the color wasn't even right.  I will never order from B&B collectibles because of how dissappointed I am with the product I received.
1.0	Like other reviewers said, the tent poles are made of cheap cheap cheap wood, the wood in pencils is stronger than the wood they used here...not kidding. Mine snapped 2 hours after setting up, tore up a little hole on to roof mesh. Also, unlike the descriptions say here, you Need 2 people to set up, that's because one person has to tie knots to hold the tent poles on the inside while the other person holds the tent... which by the way, its not very portable if you have to untie and tie again knots when taking it somewhere else.<br /><br />On the plus side, the tent is beautiful! The tube is really sturdy (maybe they should've used the same wire on the tend instead of those wooden poles) tent material feels more durable than those small disney princess tents that are nothing more than a hamper. If you can find some better quality replacement tent poles get this tent for your girl, if not then don't bother buying this one, it'll just break after you set it up.
1.0	this is not the original net.  Stitching was inconsistent along the edge, broken in places.  And this does not have the button hole closure along the bottom!  Very poor craftsmanship.  I have asked for a return but I am told I will have a 20% restocking fee for shipping.  But this thing is defective, why should I have to owe anything?
1.0	Much smaller than I expected. Disappointed with the price and size as portrayed on the site .
1.0	I bought this backpack for my son and it broke after two months. He was at school and all his books just fell on the floor. It tore on the bottom of the backpack. Very bad quality and durability for this price.
1.0	The strap broke of gone of them the day after we received it.  Very disappointed.
1.0	this toy is cheap. this doesn't float. it is a complete waste of money. it comes apart. don't buy it.
1.0	Well, I've read all the reviews before buying these bracelets. I cant explain why my experience differs greately from all above...<br /> It was sold by: SocalDailyDeals (if it matters). The first three of them didn't work at all, the next one worked from time to time, and I didn't manage to check all the rest as I felt really bad of this TERRIBLE chemical smell. Then I understood that I feel sick and light headed. I threw them away at once. And now the only question I have is- HOW CAN SUCH SORT OF HARMFUL THING BE SOLD OFFICIALLY???
1.0	This is almost a joke. It is a mask on cardstock like paper. Flat, without any bends for the facial features. I doubt it last for one wearing. I would never buy this again.
1.0	It is cute, but the paper fringe around the edge was a nightmare.
1.0	If the spinning wheels are attached to the board at all times, how do you move each piece?  My daughter just got this as a birthday gift, and we tried to play the night of her party, but could not quite figure out how to move~! I read the directions over and over...and it seems to me that if the circles are on each corner of the board, then how do you know where to move?  Thanks...any advice on how this aspect of the game works, is mucvh appreciated.
1.0	N for Nanny Goat?<br />X for X-ray fish?<br />U for Urchin instead of Sea Urchin.... or simply umbrella?<br />G for Giraffe..... most G words are Goat.... Gate.... Game.... and make a G sound unlike Giraffe which is a J sound...<br /><br />Awful ....<br />DO NOT BUY!
1.0	Bought for my Grandson's 4th Birthday. He was so excited. However this one one of the most poorly built toys ever. It is so top heavy that to be able to play with it, you have to hold on to it. The slide falls apart everytime you use it. It's in 3 pieces. What a pain. I tried super gluing the slide together which did not work. I do not recommend this at all until they do some improvements.
1.0	the whistle did not work at all... is was a cute idea but I would not buy another product like this one. This does not mean I wouldn't buy from this company again, the company does not know it didn't work because I did not tell them... I am sure they would have replaced it.
1.0	The cord that you pull does not make the boat 'zoom'. It barely does anything - my son and I spent an hour trying to research what we were doing wrong. But reading the other reviews, I see that it is just its poor design. We are very dissapointed - although my son's love of thomas is eclipsing his disappointment for the moment. Still, this toy would be great if it actually worked.
1.0	I've had multiple problems with the plane from left to right.<br />While it's great to have a plane you barely need to assemble and all you need to do is fuel and fly, it's not exactly all that simple.<br /><br />1.) I had a problem where the servo to the flaps were unresponsive. It wasn't until aprox 20 minutes later till they worked. That's only happened once so far and the problem still eludes me hence nothing was changed to the linkage.<br />2.) The engine always died at half throttle. Changed fuel, plugs, tuned the needles and yet my efforts (and money) went to waste.<br />3.) Engine would start in reverse. While this is a known problem for 2-stroke engines, I've never had it quite this frequent in other engines (They were OS and Tiger engines)<br />4.) The spinner-backplate broke<br /><br />Maybe I'm just having bad luck with this plane? Probably. But it's still far from RTF for me.<br /><br />Background: Built and flown Rc nitro airplanes&helicopters for 2 years.
1.0	"Bought the wagon as a gift for my son for X-mas. The wagon in the picture is not the wagon you receive! The front steering apperatus is not the same! All the hardware was made by the lowest bidder, the caps on the acorn nuts for the side rails broke into pieces, there were big \\""Northern Tool\\"" stickers on the sides and front/back, the box it was shipped in was destroyed with some of the parts hanging out when it was dropped off at my house, multiple pings/dents to tub section, the wood slats on the sides don't match up to the rear slats (large gap on one end and touching on the other) and the front turning apperatus might as well be made of tin foil- (not very rigid) So... If you want a junky wagon for moving landscaping materials or somethinng you want to replace in a year because of the cheap rusty hardware or if you don't mind making a trip or two to the local hardware store for some new hardware (nuts/bolts) then feel free to buy this wagon.  I will say it was easy to put together- once I purchased better quality hardware, and the tires are nice- Other than that I WOULD NOT SUGGEST THIS WAGON FOR PURCHASE! Buy a RADIO FLYER!!! You will thank yourself later.    28yr old male-  Advanced mechanical skills/knowledge.  All the tools you could imagine in garage."
1.0	"[[ASIN:B000068FCA Take Along Thomas & Friends - Work & Play Roundhouse]]If you plan on putting this train up and never using it as intended, ie: \\""Take Along\\"", then a child may enjoy it. First, the tracks do not fit into the top roof storage as they should. Our first guess, should have been, when we unpacked it for the first time, the 6\\"" pieces were not all in the storage area. Some tracks were attached to the bottom of the box, under the round house.   Next, we called CS for Thomas Train. A guy tried to tell my husband how to fit the tracks. Now if a grown man can't force the tracks into the storage, how do they think a child age 4 (for which the toy is intended) would be able to stow and go with this train set?   They told us to take it back to the store. This is not an option as I don't have the box or receipt, and our son loves the set and got addtional train cars that don't work on his wood tracks.   CS said we could send the Roundhouse and the one train car that came with it to them at our expense. They would \\""take alook at it\\"".   Of course, we are not the only family with this product and issue, yet they acted as if this was the first they heard of it. I am very disappointed. We will not be purchasing any other thomas items. If we all it these irresponsible companies in the pockets, perhaps they will do better."
1.0	Bad Product!!<br />after a few months the whole mechanism is broken.  I expect Amazon to send me a new one or credit my account for the price i paid for this terrible product!!!
1.0	I Remembered this game from my childhood - back when thing were built halfway decent.  I bought this game online for my 5 year old and the timer didn't work - would click down to about 30 seconds and stop.  You have to bang on the thing to keep the timer going.  Then I bought one from a local store.... Same thing - timer sticks.  This is not a fluke - this is just a poorly made toy.  Too bad - it could be a great game if they fixed the timer!
1.0	Though I did not by this from Amazon. I cam across the reviews while trying to replace a pole for ours<br />And found that everyone had the sam issues we did.<br /> Th metal wire poked through on the tunnel and one of the poles kinked the 1st time we set it up making it pretty useless.<br />we used duct tape to fix the wire and thank you to the earlier post about the pen inside the tent pole it worked like a charm!!!! .<br /> Our son loves the tent and I was sad that it might just be junk.<br />I do not think it will take a lot of wear and tear but am thrilled that  we can use it a few more times now.<br />If you have not bought it DON'T- look for better quality<br />If you have get a box of pens and a roll of duct tape- you will need it
1.0	Not well made.  It was already not broker (not repairable) within a day of playing.
1.0	I ordered this toy as a gift for my nephew and he was so excited when he opened it. That is until he realized that it didn't come with any piggies (or vader or storm troopers). How are you supposed to play angry birds without piggies? If I had noticed it didn't come with them I would have ordered a more expensive game that actually has all the game pieces.
1.0	Bought as a Christmas gift and we couldn't even wrap it as it fell apart in my hand.<br />Tried to repair because we knew our son would love it, but it just kept falling apart.<br />Don't waste your time.  Pun fully intended.
1.0	PVC is the most poisonous plastic.  Please do not take my word for it, do a simple google search and find the evidence for yourself. It is full of phthalates that are hormone disruptors and are linked to the nastiest health conditions.<br /><br />How incredibly IRRESPONSIBLE of the company to state on the bag that it is &#34;PVC free&#34; - maybe the BAG is but the blocks are not.  This is clearly done to mislead.  Shame on you Mega Bloks<br /><br />buy solid wood blocks instead (do not buy MDF or particle board, those offgas formaldehyde)
1.0	frankly, your better off getting a real cosplay outfit then this.it looks homemade and im surely never gonna buy from this company for outfits anymore..
1.0	VTech Inno Tab 2 Problem:<br />My grandson, age 6, dropped the VTech InnoTab 2 and the inner screen cracked.  Not the outer screen.  It no longer responds to touch screen actions, but does turn on.  I do not know if my daughter filed the paper work sent with the VTech Inno Tab2 as a Christmas gift, but as you can see from the captured screen  below from my Amazon account, I did purchase it in mid December 2012.<br />Will it be repaired or replaced under warranty?<br /><br />VTech Answer:<br />Thank you for your inquiry. Unfortunately, the screen is a molded part of the unit and cannot be replaced, The warranty covers defects within materials and or workmanship. If the unit is dropped resulting in the screen cracking, this is not covered under the warranty as it is voided. We apologize for the inconvenience.<br />Best regards,<br />Consumer Services<br />VTech Electronics NA, LLC<br /><br />SHOULD HAVE BOUGHT A KINDLE FIRE - Product and Apps are great and Service is Outstanding!!!<br /><br />Kindle Fire Review: Dec 8, 2012 (from someone else, but it keeps customers happy and shopping)<br />We purchased a Kindle Fire for our grandson last year for Christmas. He accidentally knocked it on the floor and the screen shattered. I called the Warranty Company and they immediately sent out another Kindle Fire to replace his. All we had to do was send the broken one back to them in 30 days. This was the easiest transaction I have ever had with a company regarding their warranty. Would definitely recommend this warranty for anyone! So glad we had it and well worth the money!!
1.0	This toy is not suitable for a baby over 9 months. It doesn't talk or anything and the only noise is makes is the vibration of the tongue when you pull it. I was shocked to see the grammar error on the back of the packaging, covered by a sticker with the correct grammar (which is still wrong bc they didn't cover the word &#34;is&#34;) but anyway I was expecting something MUCH more considering the package says 9months-3yrs. Returning
1.0	In addition to being extremely small. This toy broke within hours of my son playing with it. It no longer will transform and is quite a disappointment.
1.0	Poor quality that will not last.  Way overpriced . Too much trouble to bother to return, I bought it because my  local Train Storehouse  was unable  to get one and it looked impressive in the Model Train Mag.
1.0	We went to Disney World and our daughter loved the monorail, so we bought this toy for her birthday.  Upon getting it, we discovered that it was impossible to open the battery compartment, as the screw holding it in place stripped.  There's therefore no way to insert batteries into the device.  I'm amazed they used such cheap screws to hold in the battery compartment, as the user must unscrew it to put in the batteries!  Now we have a very expensive push toy.
1.0	Not worth opening.  :(..  figure is tough to pose. Stand recommended... can really play with him.. arms and legs suck... unsure if he can even hold the lightsaber they gave him.. will need mcquarrie style lightsaber for this figure.they treid to copy the vintage one and designed very weak.. arms and legs don't bend. They swivel... cheap. Worst type of figure.. special for 12 to 22 dollars.. very not worth much more 8.00.. the cards suck.. and get the original on saga card. Better figure. Better package...
1.0	Boat runs fine, however if you buy 2 boats to race them as in the picture it won't work because they both are on the same frequency.
1.0	Great while it lasted. .... briefly.
1.0	My wife got this for me as she knew I wanted an RC Airplane.  Put it together and took it outside where I had to take it off in the street.  The few pieces of dead winter grass we had in our yard were too big for it.  When taking off it it a twig (tiny twig) and tipped over.  Propeller went flying and back of place cracked in half.  I am glad my wife got this for me and not my son, he would have been really upset.  I couldn't believe it when she told me what she paid for this, I thought it was worth about $15.  I had no steering capabilities other than to change it's elevator.  You can't make it go left or right.  And you pretty much need to fly it on the stick and string that is included if you don't want it only going in a straight line.  The packaging is probably worth more than the plane is.
1.0	Crap. Waste of money. This is a really fun quad to fly when it works but after about one flight one of the motors burn out.
1.0	Not happy at all the box was opened the mask had been squished since it's made out of material that can be bent it seemed as if the post office stacked heavier boxes ontop of the box the helmet came in there was no protection for it inside so obviously the mask was really deformed in the front view. Plus the colors are WAY off.<br />As soon as a submitted my review I was still looking at the mask and noticed it was broken at the bottom park oh well so I added that picture too
1.0	..... .. .. .. . . . . . .. . it really does. It REALLY does... You'll use it and laugh for few days, and it'll just be at the storage just like many other stuff you do like so.
1.0	I bought this game for my daughters, ages 8 and 9, who know next to nothing about U.S. geography, hoping they'd learn some of the basics. The questions in this game are WAY too difficult for geography beginners in terms of the content, and the convoluted way the questions are phrased makes it taxing just to listen and get the gist of the question. The game might be educational, but if it's no fun for young players, they are not going to play it and learn anything.
1.0	I purchased this bat and ball set for my 5 year old grandson who was visiting us. He had never batted before. The first time the bat and ball met the ball was dented. The second time, the bat indented where the ball had met it. Terrible products. Did not last even 15 minutes!
1.0	I have placed the order as a Christmas gift for my daughter, I tried to contact the seller twice before and after christmas and received no reply. Bottomline is that I did not receive the order and the seller would not even apologize nor send a replacement.
1.0	It came without enough stuffing in the inside so it's not round. It's soft though.
1.0	Wasn't what I had thought, was going to use it on a birthday cake for my Stepson and they were so small they would have been lost on it
1.0	The helicopter will not fly higher than 11/2 feet off the floor. The flight controlls are not responsive. It is nice to look at.
1.0	On the package and the machine it's self it says no spill &#62; Yes it does.  I wish it didn't leak or spill.
1.0	My son received this as a Christmas present when he was about 8 months old.  As long as it was turned off he seemed somewhat interested in it but once we turned it on the toy terrified him.  We decided to put it away and perhaps try it again at about 10 months.  Big mistake.  The jerky motion of the ball and the noise combined with the fact it repeatedly hits him in the face still terrifies him.  Perhaps he will like it in a couple years.
1.0	SO I GOT THIS COPTER BECAUSE I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE AWESOME SO FLY BUT WHEN I TRIED TO PUSH THE ACCELORATOR TO TAKE OFF IT WOULD GET STUCK AND FLY HIGH AND COULDNT CONTROL IT. I WISH IT WAS CONTROLLABLE BUT ITS NOT AND CAUSE OF THAT IT SUCKS!!!
1.0	does not work with my brushless set up
1.0	We purchased this item as a gift from Santa for our 3.5 year old daughter. She had played with it about 10 times when in February it broke. We have tried to contact the company several times since February and they did not respond until now...April! They offered no help...not even an exchange. After this has happened, I went online to research the problem. It is evidently typically and so is their awful customer service. This is so upsetting as my child doesn't understand why her toy that Santa brought is broken and we are out what we paid for the item plus the games...almost $200!  Take time to go online and read the reviews. I wish I had before i ever bought anything made by them.
1.0	The box itself seems to be okay built. The top lid does not fasten down, we had grasshoppers jumping around the house. The screen mash was destroyed after about three days. Spend a little more money and get a better product.
1.0	The shell does not fit all keys types, as stated. I brought this because I broke my original shell. I tried to replace it with this shell, as well as being cheap.
1.0	"My 4 year old picked out this toy...I never expected it to be such a nightmare!!!  It must have been designed by people who either do not have kids, a brain or a house they don't want covered in water (or all of the above).  The \\""wash\\"" part is so shallow it floods all over and the majority of the toy is useless.  My son pretty much lost interest in the main toy (thank you God) for the most part and just plays with the cars in the bath tub (I give him a bowl of cold water), but the paint is quickly chipping away on the cars.  What a waste of money!"
1.0	I was disapointed in this product. They didn't glow. They didn't work.
1.0	"IF YOU WANT A BEAUTIFUL ASIAN DOLL, I JUST FOUND A COUPLE IN EBAY UNDER \\"" ASIAN BERENGUER GIRL DOLL \\"".  THE ONE I GOT ON EBAY WAS GORGEROUS!!!  MY DAUGHTER LOVES IT AND WON'T LEAVE HOME WITHOUT IT."
1.0	A gift for my grandson.  A very clever concept.  Great choice for no mess gift.  A huge thumbs up!  Fun for all!
1.0	It said m(13) for size, I assumed that it was just mens 13's because the kids sizes said kids and these just said M, which is men's style, but they came came as 13 kids, I had to return them.
1.0	This product is terrible. Unless your room is the size of a closet and you hold it about a foot from the ceiling you will only see shadowy black lines and cannot read any of the names of the constellations. We got this as a gift and will be returning it for something else.
1.0	Have it more then 2 months. Haven't seen anything different and I don't think it works.
1.0	I bought this doll on December for my daughter.  The doll delivered had the same outfit but the face was different.  Then when my daughter changed the outfit, we found out that the legs are stained with several purple spots.  We were not able to remove the spots.
1.0	We bought this seat as a back-up seat to my husband's car.  We hardly ever use it.  This past weekend I went to use it and noticed we needed to make adjustments to the strap height - this ended up being a nightmare.  I could not get one of the metal clips to snap in the way it says it should have.  I even used a hammer (which at that point I knew it was getting returned) and the piece would not go in.  This made me very disappointed and frustrated.  Very poor design.  Also, please note that the fabric also started fading after about 4 months and the cup holder would not stay on.
1.0	These My First Band drum sets are junk! They are practically cardboard wrapped with paper. Have had one less than a month and already had to put new attachment holes in both top drums, one has had the cardboard tear off where it attaches, and 4 out of 5 are already ripped across the whole drum surface. This is from regular use and not destructive kid play.<br /><br />Please do not waste your money!!!
1.0	The most fun I had with this Helicopter, is when I finally took a hammer and beat it into pieces LOL. It wasn't very much money so to me it just wouldn't be worth the aggravation of trying to buy parts or return it. When I got it out of the box I had to tighten all the loose screws and the trim controllers freeze and you are unable to get it to trim out at all.... so for me it was much more fun to just relieve the frustration and have a hammer time. I find it hard to believe it has gotten as many good feedbacks as it has. Maybe I just got the one peace of junk that came off of that particular China sweat shop assembly line that day. I fly large nitro helicopters and also have several little electric helicopters. This is by far the worst I have seen. Very, Poor assembly.
1.0	"Received this as a gift, otherwise I'd return it! The \\""paint\\"" has a slime consistency; it seems like there is too much water in the receipe. I thought maybe the product had expired, like many other reviewers, but I think that is just the produt itself. I gave 5 stars for fun because what child doesn't like to explore with his hands? Overall, however, it was a great disappointment. We plan to try Crayola Washable Finger Paints next; they received great reviews."
1.0	We purchased this for our son this past Christmas. When Christmas morning came, the thing barely worked.  There seemed to be a short in the connection at the guitar.  It did work once, but then failed completely.  Prospective buyers should be aware that Mattel discontinued this product after one year. ([...])  That should tell you something.  If you decide to purchase anyway, check the vendors return policy.  We had great customer service through Kazizuri, so we were able to return it.  Still, it's not worth the disappointment and hassle.
1.0	Used this once. When it was working, it was great! However, my 2 year old son was able to knock it free from the hose multiple times and all of the hoses inside of the ball disconnected and it is no longer able to be used. Too bad, it was fun for a little while.
1.0	This product is awful and does not work at all. The paint gun sprayed air but no paint ever came out no matter which marker we put into it.
1.0	Title is misleading, I received a child pair not a adult women size.
1.0	I couldn't even use it once because as soon as i opened it one of the 2 fell down and it is so small that i haven't managed to find it ever since.But if you are looking for something that small then maybe this is for you, jus be careful with it or keep it in a safe place.
1.0	My daughter had the original 25 years ago and played for hours and hours so I bought it for my grandson.  wow what a difference, so cheap!~!  The screen is very little, doesn't hardly light up and very cheap thin plastic.  The worst is my 7 year old grandson could not pull the pegs back out.  They went in easy but I tried myself and really had to tug very hard to get them out that I almost broke it.  They whole toy is so light weight and cheap that it comes towards you when you try to take a peg out.  Took very long time to get them all out and he only wrote his name!  I remember how easy and study the original my daughter had.  Shame on you Hasbro Bros!!!!  Do not waste your money on this.  I even tried to go on line thinking I bought a cheap version and could find a better one even if I had to pay more money. NO SUCH LUCK... this is all Hasbro makes as a screen..  They have a cube but it looks cheap too and I am sure they are the same pegs.  I wish I would have saved my daughters!
1.0	We purchased a metal swing set for my daughter and bought these to anchor it.  These claim to work with all types of sets.  However, you get the anchors and the directions state in writing that it is only to be used with metal sets.  Problem is that the installation picture and the hardware they send is only useful for WOOD sets - it shows wood in the drawing!  Very contradicting.  We didn't use them, the box was destroyed in transit so they are sitting in our basement....  Oh well.  If anyone wants them for cheap, let me know.
1.0	If I could give this thing no stars, I would. Bought this at target for my three kids to play with in the pool. Used an air compressor instead of what came with the Wubble Bubble Ball since we did not have any D batteries. Ball was blown up within seconds. Did the measuring to make sure it was done correctly and then the kids went to town. It was a big hit. The kids were playing with it in the pool and tossing it all around. We were pretty happy with it. Then just 2 hours later, my 60 pound 7 year went to lay on it (It shows people doing this on the commercial and SAYS its unpopable) and you guessed it....POP!!! This ball/bubble looked shredded! The kids were so disappointed. The kicker was everything you had to do in order to send it back. Just pay a 6.95 Processing and handling fee and you might get another ball in 6 to 8 weeks. Please save your money.
1.0	These broke every time we tried to open them. Not a good spending of money. Very disappointed as it was supposed to be fun for the kids and adults at a party.
1.0	I can't believe a company like that lives off this micro hobby stuff hasn't done this yet. Heres what to do. Buy the motors for a different coptor, they are ones that will fit this one too. The motors and the copter are called v595's you can search and buy them on the web here, just google the v 959 and there available . They are cheaper buy the whole set be done with the stock ones, like 5 bucks each and they work great. They will last for many many flights into the hundreds. The only thing is you have to change the plug to that wich is on your original latrax captor. keep that, cut it off the old motors with aplenty of slack, switch it out to the new motor wich you will have to cut the plug off as well. reconnect to new motors black to black.  just wrap em together solder em if you can. keep the black wire the same the colored wires might be different it doesn't matter as long as the black wire stays black from motor to plug. These guys are just remiss here. i can't believe the stupidity it makes you wonder. never had a problem since. it'll fly like a new coptor.
1.0	This is a soft-plastic frog &#34;habitat&#34; that leaks water all over the place when used correctly (full of water).  Yech.
1.0	Unfortunately, the reason I don't like this toy is mostly my fault.  We bought my daughter a play kitchen for her birthday, and then I was searching for kitchen accessories, so this came up with all of the play sized kitchen accessories...the title of the toy does not say DOLL HOUSE, and I didn't read the specifics as carefully as I should have.  Needless to say, I wanted play accessories, not dollhouse accesories, so was annoyed I didn't read it closely, but also annoyed that the toy title doesn't say DOLL HOUSE on it!  Then it wouldn't have showed up with all of the other kitchen accessories that are kid-sized!
1.0	Complete piece of junk. Don't waste your money.
1.0	the sound never worked right
1.0	Horrible. And stink bombs were broken when i opened the package. I wouldnt recomend buying them from here at all!!
1.0	Defective but never got around to returning it.
1.0	Description does not reflect the actual product primarily because of the metal bar (which most customers would not be unaware of)(and unrealistic aircraft wheels) across the rear wheels which would not qualify product to be a die cast model. If there is no metal bar on the rear wheels, it would be more realistic!<br /><br />Both wheels (front and rear) does not appear to be realistic! Product should have a more detailed description. Pictures can be very deceptive!
1.0	My son is having a Toy Story themed party and I wanted these for party favors, but they are horrible.  They don't look anything like what is pictured.  I'll be going to the toy store to get new toy soldiers as I cannot give these to kids.  They lack definition and most of them look as if the soldier was run over in the middle.  Plus the plastic is surprisingly cheap for plastic.  I would return them, but it will cost almost as much in shipping to return as they cost me originally.
1.0	The ring was in a package. It looked like it was something you would by loose in a jar. Did not seem worth what was spent. It arrived in really good time.
1.0	I ordered for my 8 year old gandaughter  for Christmas. .I was surprised at the complicated process for making even one bracelet. We had to go line to follow other people's directions. Was not pleased with the cost vs product ratio.
1.0	We could not figure out how to put anything on it except music. Pictures weren't formatted correctly although it said it accepted jpg & bmp. Videos wouldnt play.
1.0	It doesn't hold a charge and the quality of this product is terrible. The product would not even work. The remote works but the car did not. Waste of money.
1.0	After waiting for 3 weeks for my sons andoer to come in, we wanted to play with it , record some flight footage and just spend some time playing. Needless to say, after completely charging it and ready for take off ....It doesn't lift off the ground. Very disappointed.. Sending it back...
1.0	Would not buy again. Fragile is not something you should use to describe a childs toy. I understand it's a tea set but our previous one (different brand) lasted almost 4 years before it chipped and only chipped, it did not crack in half as this one did. Upset kid and disappointed parent.<br /><br />The storage case was a disappointment as well, not great for storing china ( even with the plastic inserts kept).
1.0	The case was broken when I received it and there were only a few stickers and a very small box of crayons in there.  If I saw it in a store, I NEVER would have bought it.  The product is a huge rip off for $19.99 plus tax!!!  I guess the big price was for the Caillou sticker on the front of the case.  Very disappointing!!!!!  I returned it.  Would not recommend this to anyone!
1.0	We didn't read the small print, you have to assemble
1.0	Most of theses never work!
1.0	I very reluctantly let my daughter order this.  They were annoying when they first came out, and they are even more annoying now.  My daughter didn't do something right and the creepy thing started talking in a weird voice resulting in a frustrated little girl.  We finally got it back to the sweet voice but then couldn't turn it off.  I had to go online to find out how to turn the thing off and keep it off.  Parents, if you want peace in your home DON'T get one of these creepy things.
1.0	This was a Birthday present for my active 10 year old Grandson. He loved them the first few days but then has pretty much put them aside. Does not seem that they have enough bounce to make it exciting for him to put them back on.
1.0	I was excited for this broom to arrive as my toddlers love cleaning. However, the broom came damaged. The blue handle was bent. It was not due to shipping as it was in a large box with sufficient packing material.
1.0	"If everyone you know has this it would be half way decent.  But most people don't even know what it is so you end up just having this thing that really isn't very stimulating.  Bandai toys are pretty dumb for the most part anyway and probably like every other \\""new\\"" product they put out, it will be off the market within a year."
1.0	don't order please... this is from china.  you cann't retune it. everthing is not working...<br />절대 사지 마세요.  그림 보다 더 조잡하게 옵니다. 다 불량...
1.0	The hook that we received bent backwards on the first attempt to use it, rendering useless.  Horrible customer service that was willing to rectify the problem only if you gave it 5 star review FIRST!  They essentially try to blackmail you in giving them a 5 star rating.  Why would I give a 5 star review when before me is a defective product?  Why will they only give me a replacement AFTER I submit a 5 star review?  I don't usually give bad reviews.  And I usually only give very good reviews on a product that I think merits this.  However, this company beats anything I have ever experienced!  The only think that I can conclude is this is a desperate company with something to hide!  Don't buy this product.  There are so many other looms on the market.  Don't take your chance with this one!
1.0	mine came broken it tale was jammed and its head was broken dont buy it was a very cheap plastic and then i cant put it in the box dont buy!!!!!!!!!!!
1.0	No smell! Wasn't costly but a complete fake! Disappointed! I've heard they are great for pranks but my experience was different.
1.0	As with most of the reviews, our solar panel never worked. Taped wires to battery and had the most fun we could with the motor. If you want to learn about motors run on battery cool. If you want to see solar power in action, forget it.
1.0	Although the compass looks nice in the wood setting the bottom piece of wood has a large crack in it. I am not sure if this is supposed to make it look antique and weathered or if it is truly a flaw. To me it makes it look cheaply crafted.
1.0	Yikes, this is awful, the face looks horrifying, my mom screamed when she saw it and said it looked demonic. Don't buy from this seller.
1.0	Seller is violating Wizards of the Coast Trademark by selling proxies. Seller did NOT even come up with proxy art,  stole that too.

1.0	"We ordered this bike over the other balance bikes because the specifications listed the seat height was adjustable from 12.5\\"". This is incorrect. When we received the bike. The lowest setting is actually 14\\"" and our son was devasted that we had to put it back in the box and return it. Our neighbor has a different brand that our son can fit on. We will be ordering that bike instead. This bike is very big and our son will be ready for this by next summer. However, by then, he will have a bike with pedals."
1.0	Boots came defective. The zipper fell off because of loose thread. When returned I was charged $1.19 restocking fee!!  You're restocking a defective item??  And charging me for your error?  I know it's only a dollar, but it's really the point. This will be my last purchase from Sophia's. AWFUL CUSTOMER SERVICE.  Oh...boots were just ok...for $6...decent enough. Just hope they don't send you my defects!
1.0	Don't even waste your money.  I hate writing reviews but wanted to save someone the headache...it was broken right out of the box.
1.0	Bought this along with explorers kit from the same manufacturer.  We threw both in the trash rather than give them as a gift. It's literally nothing more than some empty cardboard boxes - which is both puzzling and super unimpressive. Disappointing especially for the price.
1.0	This toy is way undersized,I didn't know 7 inchs was from tip to tip of fingers.Compare it to beanie baby toys.
1.0	The manufacture must have been drunk when they descrided this product. The functions as discribed do not exist. It just makes the young girl sad since it doesn't do anything as stated. The materials it comes with are a big joke they are not even worth a penny. This product should be taken off the market. The price should be a $1.00 not $49.00. Take it from me do not buy.
1.0	I was disappointed in these wooden racks.  The quality was poor as the wood had splintered edges.  I returned them.
1.0	Poor product. I couldn't get the thing to fly any higher than an inch off the ground, and it would only spin around, never stabilised, no matter how much I played with the stabiliser controls.  Completely useless.
1.0	Don't waste your money. This never worked and your kid will be upset. If I could right a negative number I would.
1.0	They have made everything so wide that unless you are a bull in a china shop, or maybe blindfolded (might have to try that) it is so easy it is boring. My 5 year old likes it but no one else does. Especially since the youngest goes first and there are only 11 pieces. I will feel guilty even giving it to the Goodwill, so it will probably be put on the curb for free.  Don't waste your time or money with this game.<br /><br />Hasbro - bring back the classic game where you didn't always get a piece every time, but had a sense of accomplishment when you did get one.
1.0	Not satisfied. Remote was cheap and the batteries did not fit nor stay connected and when they were connected the control did not work properly. Directions did not match with parts nor were they clear. I would not recommend this to others. Waste of good money. I had to give the Christmas present to my grandson to just pull around with a string.
1.0	I purchased this product as a gift for my son. My problem is actually with two of them, so I am beginning to suspect that the item is simply advertised falsely as an airplane that will fly.  It is a good thing that it comes with a display stand, because that is the only thing that will keep this airplane off the ground.  Both of the airplanes behave exactly the same way--That is the engines rev up and the plane launches to a crash landing about 25 feet from its departure point.  I have tried numerous rounds of fresh batteries to no avail.  We have been attempting to fly in windless conditions as recommended by Megatech.  We have tried to see if the propellor rpms will stay sustained indoors.  The transmitter signal is not received after 25-30 feet and the engines decelerate and the plane crash lands.  This is extremely disappointing for my ten year old son.  I am disgusted with Megatech's false advertising and I can assure you that no other Megatech products will ever darken my door.  I am out over $150 for the two planes.
1.0	Terrible... it is thin chinese plastic! my daughter handed me a piece of cardboard with a curtain it happens to be the window.. really cardboard????<br />come on, you charge about $100 retail. It does not roll and plastic that bends. Terrible :((( product.
1.0	My 3 year old put on this costume and twirled around the living room and in a matter of 30 minutes both seams under the arms at ripped, one of the buttons that holds on the cape came off, and the headband snapped in half. I was very disappointed in the poor quality of this costume. If I had paid $10 it would have been one thing, but $40 for it to fall apart like that after barely being used?!  Disappointing.
1.0	We ordered these to give out as trick-or-treat items. Almost exactly half didn't work. Several lights were on when package arrived, so they must have turned on when jostled in shipping, but the vast majority simply didn't work. I took several apart to see if it was a battery or bulb problem, but it turned out to be a workmanship problem, as the batteries and bulbs worked fine when taken apart. As you have to break them to take them apart, the item is a disappointing waste.
1.0	I bought this for a 4 year old and perhaps I should have read the description a little closer. 9.5&#34; x 9.5&#34; is really tiny. Seems like it was good quality but way too small for the price.
1.0	Not enough suction. It won't even hold a tissue !
1.0	"Prima Products, basically it robbed me.  They offer a 6 pack servo and they just sent me one. The real price for each one is $12.00 dollaras. Don´t buy to these \\""company\\""."
1.0	The chair had 2 left arms,So i had to drill thre right one an make a new sticker for it. It was a christman present so there was no time to rerurn it. I was very dissapointed in the product!
1.0	"My 8 year old son has and loves other Spy Gear toys, so we thought this one would be great too, but were disappointed when the safe would not ever lock. We checked the directions and weren't doing anything wrong, it is supposed to \\""automatically\\"" lock, but did not. The plastic was thin and probably would have been broken in not too long anyway. Amazon was great about the return, refunded my money before the product even made it back to them. Will not purchase again."
1.0	Bought this for our 3 year old great grandson.  He was thrilled with it and didn't want to get off it.  However after several weeks it started to make a grinding noise and you need to push it to get it going.  When he comes to see us he still sits on it everyday but it is a huge disappointment to him and to us.
1.0	Didnt last long and the air came out of it as soon as it was filled up..the next day was on it's way to being flat! Would not buy again.
1.0	These are my sons favorite toys, at the moment. He is 4 years old and I was happy because you can find great offers on the different mashers. He has almost all of them but unfortunately they break it is a recurrent problem and I am afraid the reason why these toys are affordable and almost always on sale. :( sad because otherwise the toys are great for imagination and motor skills development.
1.0	As stated in the other review the directions are a pain but I figured it out.  The big problem is you can't have any fun with this toy.  You can only pull about half way down on the trigger, any harder and the cars fly off of the track, so forget about using the turbo option.  Great idea but too much power not enough track.
1.0	As other reviews mention, this game is frustrating and disappointing,  The problem, I believe, is a poorly designed version by Hasbro as opposed to the original Parker Bros. version.  The original used 4 D batteries and had a 4 foot trunk, while the hasbro version runs on C batteries with only a 3 foot trunk  (It also comes with fewer butterflies and nets).  Seems as if they've cut the manufacturing cost of this down so far that they've squeezed the fun out of it.<br /><br />Avoid this and find a Parker Bros. version on Ebay, your kids will have much more fun.
1.0	The picture projected is too small. I can't believe how loud the motor is when it turns the disk. Unless you can find the disks in a store locally, the selection is very small. You can use the viewmaster disks without sound but those are hard to find too. I bought some off Amazon but the shipping cost twice as much as the product.
1.0	The buttons holding the top closed are missing
1.0	Product arrived unuseable with a hole in it.
1.0	You can throw these in the trash as soon as they arrive. They (2) worked for approx 3 weeks. Nice idea, lousy product. DON'T BUY!
1.0	This is easily the worst item i've gotten through amazon. it's not beanbag filler, it's little round packing peanuts. they don't roll around like they should, they just compress. it's impossible to return so i have to start over. do not buy these. i would give zero stars if i could but they force you to give at least one!
1.0	"I don't usually write reviews on anything, but this Leapster2 is not as good as I thought it would be.  The graphics are horrible- grainy like they were 15 years ago, and the games are NOT worth the money.  I got them on sale for $10 and still felt like I had been robbed.  I'm honestly surprised that more people haven't complained.  If I had to grade it, I would give it a \\""D\\"".  It could be worse, but only if it didn't work at all.  :("
1.0	I am sorry but this is a box, that's it , you could prob build one for less then the shipping! (165), little particle board, paint, hinges, and some clear plastic bowls, viola i kids washer and dryer set.
1.0	Garbage. You get what you pay for and that isn't much. The net keeps falling off. The back board doesn't stay still. Just not worth it.
1.0	Very cheep. It broke within a week. It was put on a small clutch like bag that did have a lot of weight on it. I don't recomend buying this item.
1.0	The S&H was was 10.00 dollars for a 5.99 purchase-this was a very small item and weighed next to nothing.  It could of been sent thru the regular snail mail. I picked the e-z pick and could not back out of it or cancel it. When ordered it did not say it was not part of Amazon-it was an external merchant.
1.0	Too small!  Did not fit. Very disappointing.
1.0	This is a paperback folder that was way too expensive.<br />Ripped very fast. NOt worth the money.<br />regular folder like this cost average $1.50<br /><br />not satisfied.
1.0	Wow, I'm astonished that this has any positive reviews at all.<br /><br />I've been a huge fan of Fluxx the card game over the years.  I remember playing it back in 2001, and rarely does a game night party at my house go down without breaking out one of our multiple copies of the game, from 1st edition, all the way through 4.0.  I was really excited to bring home Fluxx the Board Game, until I played it.<br /><br />I won this game in 3 turns.  OK, I thought, as in Fluxx the card game can be won on turn one if you get lucky (good old &#34;all you need is love&#34;).  Maybe I just got lucky.<br /><br />Well, my wife called going first in the second game, and she won on turn 3.<br /><br />I went first when we invited our friends over, and won on turn 3.  My wife won the next game on turn 3, and then did it again on turn three in the next game, each time managing to distract everyone enough to ensure that she could go first.<br /><br />Then, in one very out of the ordinary game, our best friend's girlfriend went first, and she won the game on the start of her fourth turn.<br /><br />Then I listed this game for sale on Amazon.<br /><br />You see, the goal in Fluxx the Board Game are too easy to attain.  They are so easy to attain that you don't need to manipulate the rules, with the possible exception of the move and draw limits, to attain a goal on each and every one of your turns.  Each turn, just make sure you play a goal, and move your pieces into place.  Instant victory with rarely a hiccup, as we like to make sure that our &#34;free rule changes&#34; to start the game involve the move and draw limits since those inspire strategy.  Thus, he who goes first wins every time.  I'd love for there to be something more to this game, as the card game offers the perfect blend of strategy and randomness, but there isn't.  Too bad.
1.0	got this brand new, factory sealed from amazon. there are barely any pieces to the thing to begin with, yet somehow the jerks at Hasbro managed to not put in the little rubber/plastic feet that make the thing slide across the board. job well down folks...classy...<br /><br />this is of course in no way, shape or form amazon's fault, it's Hasbro's fault.
1.0	These fake scratch off tickets didn't look remotely convincing. Upon seeing it, my mom asked if I had gotten it out of a cereal box...Very disappointed.
1.0	I bought this for my grandson because he is just starting his train  <br />collection. It was a cute idea but after it was put together, it did <br />not light up and make any sound. Yes,we did put in batteries. Very disappointing and I'm out the money. <br />
1.0	No I did not like the Very Merry Ornaments that I ordered.  They were not at all what I expected! They do not even come close to looking as bright and beautiful as the picture on the box.  My daughter loves to do crafts, but she only made 2 of these and then threw them to the side.  She did not like them either.  Too complicated!
1.0	These balloons are very little.  When fully blown up, they are just a little larger than apples and no fun.  Even my two-year-old had no interest.
1.0	My 3 month old son loves to watch the bubbles and move around with the music/noises.  However when i take him out he throws a fit and i cant get him calmed down for like a half an hour.  And if i leave him in it till he wants out he will throw a fit in the chair after about 20 minutes.  I feel that it is too much activity for him and wears him out.  He also hates the vibrating part of it...it seems to scare him!!  Now i have removed the display from the chair and just let him sit in it as is.  He seems to like this just as much and he is much more attentative to thing going on around him instead of sitting blankly looking at the bubbles.  He will also sit in it for an hour totally content...and no more hissy fits!!!  I have heard so many good thing about this chair, so i wouldn't not recommend it but i also wouldn't recommend it at the same time!
1.0	the balloon had holes when i got it. was not even able to use it.
1.0	I thought this was going to be closer in size to the 'real thing' we played with growing up in the 70s and 80s.  Its TINY!!!!  And one of them arrived less than half filled with water - the rest of the water was all over the rest of my Amazon order.  I am definately returning these.....
1.0	item was damaged during shipping and very dirty definitely not the good quality im used to from amazon very disappointed
1.0	Very disappointed in this game. It is a non board game and only a card game which is a ripoff of Apples to Apples.<br />Only using Princess Bride name to sell this very cheesy game. Received as Christmas gift never played after reading rules.
1.0	Ripped within a month
1.0	I received only one shopkins in a basket.! The add clearly says 2..very disappointed child!!
1.0	U can't play teams, you shoot one and all go.off
1.0	This toy sucks. The voice is ridiculously annoying and I don't know why the toy-makers felt the need to make Elmo a baby or give him a cold. I'm hoping that my 17-month old son will forget about this toy soon and I can &#34;disappear&#34; it as it's one of three Elmo toys that he received from various relatives over Christmas, and by far the most annoying and least educational.
1.0	PRODUCT IS POORLY MADE, WHAT DO YOU EXPECT FROM A FOREIGN COUNTRY, TOOK A LONG TIME TO ARRIVE FOR SOMETHING I FELT I WOULD BE SATISFIED WITH, IT'S OBVIOUS GOOD THINGS DO NOT COME FOR THOSE WHO WAIT, VERY  UNHAPPY.
1.0	My title says it all.  A total P.O.C.  It's too hard and extremely frustrating. I'm the parent and my 10 and 13 year old just frustrated and came to me.  I'm supposed to be the adult and I wanted to throw it out the window.
1.0	I was absolutely disgusted with this product. The board was advertised as wooden so I was expecting something far more substantial.  The packaging would have cost more than the product.
1.0	This is the worst thing i have ever bought for my baby, the colorful round may hurt baby's head and seat does not recline.
1.0	Cheap piece of brittle plastic that was not even correct for the F-100. It went to the garbage and will cross Squadron Vac form from my never buy again. Thank you very much...NOT !!
1.0	came scratched and didjn't seem as nice in quality as the previous set (exact same I was hoping to replace)
1.0	Unfortunately, I discovered the magic of Harry Potter!  It's to make someone wealthy on an illusion.  For almost $30 bucks, I got a 5&#34; x 5&#34; x 1/2&#34; plastic envelope (see photo) containing a very small handful of plastic pieces from the UK.  I guess that &#34;Mini Figure Set&#34; were the keywords in this magic act making my money disappear.  I've seen better prizes in a cereal box for FREE and I could have purchased larger and better Lego sets in the stores.  My grandson is going to be very disappointed with Lego, Harry and Amazon.<br />*** In my opinion, not a good value! ***
1.0	We never really wanted to play these zapped games.  We prefer good old board games, I guess, even though we have two IPADs.  We returned this.
1.0	My 4 years old likes this game. However, i am not sure if everyone who owns one, notice the boxes and board actually stinks. The bad stench could be due to the recycle made box but it does smell like an un-flush toilet bowl. Maybe it is the recycle stuff but it does affect our playtime. I have to put the retail boxes far away each time we play but still the board itself smells really bad. I hope to hear from anyone that have the same experience.
1.0	I'm still wating for the cards
1.0	These are very small. I didn't read the details but thought that for $10 it would be larger. What a joke!
1.0	Very poor quality , pieces don't snap in very well. Get all put together then it starts falling apart, probably because the pieces has to be forced together. Very frustrating for my 7 year old grandson and myself. Going to get some expoxy and gluing clamps to keep the main frame together, so it can be played with.
1.0	Very disappointed in item.  Was not what I thought.  Too small, and too dangerous.  The quantity, the way it was advertised was tvery confusing.  Therefore, received an item I did not like in an abundance.  Tried to return, but it almost cost as much as the item to return it.  I ate this one.  Delivery of course was immediate on a very disappointing purchase.
1.0	Well i was hoping when i bought this that it was going to be a bit bigger than what it is which is around 10 by 10 inches. Well that isn't the main problem i had with this the chess pieces are mediocre and or s*** pardon my language the black things under them are easy to remove and some are even out of place by a little making it look weird if you were to look at it also let me emphasize on the poor quality of the chess pieces do not buy this you can find better i'm sure if you don't care about the quality then go ahead and buy this but its very lame i could go on ranting but yeah please just know that its small and poor quality
1.0	WARNING: This heli is a piece of crap. Why? Two days out of the box the motors overheat enough to actually melt and bend the main frame. After this happens the main gears start stripping out due to the motors not being able to mesh with the gears. My son was so disappointed. We just threw it in the trash. Yes we could have a new frame sent to us but the hot running motors would just melt it again, so we just gave up on it. Just don't want anyone else to get burned for $100 on this piece of junk the way we did
1.0	"I originally purchased this car seat because it got high ratings from Consumer Reports on safety, and was cheaper than the Britax Roundabout also reccomended by Consumer Reports.  First of all, it is EXTREMELY difficult to get to the strap adjustment knobs when this seat is rear facing because the knob is jammed up against the bucket seat in my Yukon.  I literally had to loosen the entire car seat from the LATCH so I could get to the knob.  I thought it may get easier when we turned the seat around forward facing.  WRONG!  The yellow button that you push to loosen the straps constantly \\""jams\\"" and even my husband had trouble loosening the straps (which you have to do often depending upon the bulkiness of your baby's clothing).  Also, the shoulder straps are doubled across the shoulders, making it a little harder to get a wiggling baby's arms tucked in.  It also causes my son to slouch because there is not much more room to loosen the straps.  (He only weighs 22 lbs., don't think he could possibly fit in it until he's 40 lbs.)  I finally got fed up and returned it to Babies R Us because if you spend 139.99 on a car seat it should be easy to operate!  I upgraded to the BRITAX ROUNDABOUT and it is soooo much easier to adjust the straps, and was very easy to install in my car.  I LOVE it!  It is high quality, safer, and nice looking.  It was more expensive but my son's safety, and my sanity are well worth every penny!"
1.0	$125??? Seriously?  talk about greedy.  I understand supply and demand but this is ridiculous!
1.0	Top of easel was cracked and other spots wood was splintered ...too much troble to disassemble and return and it was Christmas Eve..one of the major gifts for our Granddaughter..We repaired with some glue and black sharpie marker...see what happens
1.0	"I have tried a few of these \\""Amazing toys\\"" and they are cheap and boring. This is the second I have tried and the kids were bored to tears with this. One kid said where did you get this?<br /><br />Bad start-skip!"
1.0	I purchased this Heli and broke main rotor in 25 seconds, My fault ... Returned and got second one lasted about 3 flights than rear rotor quit workin sill flys but no foward or reverse just up and down... No fun flying it anymore. I would not suggest this product to anyone!!! VERY FRAGILE.
1.0	"Do yourself a favor and RUN from this Dollhouse and ANYTHING else from Feenix. Any store that sells this product should be ASHAMED of themselves. This FIBERBOARD Doll House arrived in hundreds, yes hundreds, of broken pieces.  It also arrived with a window for a front door that doesn't open. After trying to get replacements parts for a month, I called Feenix directly to be told \\""I would get called back\\"" it never happened.  After REFUSING to hang up, I finally got a supervisor, Amy, who said she had to follow proceedure and write \\""upstairs\\"" and wait for a reply to find out if the house is replacable and what happened to the door? Then she said she would call me back with an answer the next day.  Didn't happen, but what did happen (after 6 phone calls by me) was she said \\""upstairs will not help you - they said call the internet company you purchased with\\"".  Well, that was \\""Little Wonders\\"" who was given the same false photo and description (by the manufacturer Feenix) that all internet stores offering this product got.  In the end no store could answer for the Fiberboard, Lack of a Front Door, or replacement parts. When I explained to Amy, \\""upstairs\\"" is the only entity who can answer if there IS or IS NOT a door to this house, her reply was \\""upstairs said we can't talk to you. You need to call Little Wonders\\"" Me: \\""I just did and they don't know the answer...\\"" Amy: \\""Okay then, if you have anymore questions you can contact Little Wonders...\\"" Me: \\""But...but...\\""    Little Wonders did send replaement parts - but they were the wrong ones and defective with poor attempts (read, unmatching paint color and finish) to cover gauges and scratches.    Sigh, Happy Birthday to my little girl... a $300.00 piece of incomplete junk."
1.0	I own RealFlight 3.5 and as it's so old now I figured it was time to get the most recent version figuring there must have been massive updates and added features.  What a joke.  It's pretty much the same software except prettier backgrounds and a few extra features.  For $200 I won't be upgrading again.  I hate companies that release upgrades that only do minor things and charge so much for them.  I won't be buying from Great Planes again.
1.0	The idea of this toy is wonderful, but the construction was cheap.  The framework is fragile and does not withstand the inevitable initial crashes as you learn to maneuver the gyrocopter.  It broke in the first use,  very very very poor quality.
1.0	I bought these in-store last Christmas so my son could use his LeapPad on the plane ride home.  They are useless!  The volume is SOOOOOO low that neither of us could hear anything from the tablet on the plane.  Waste of money.
1.0	Piece of Junk. It didn't work and  very  cheap construction .
1.0	Came without the wheel, that was the reason we bought it and there was no wheel in the box. We looked all over.
1.0	Ordered a 2t but received a size 6 so I was not able to return it since it was a gift. Not happy
1.0	The description clearly states that this item ships as a set of 12.  I receved one notepad with pen.  I called Amazon, the rep checked and stated that, yes, it is advertised as a set of 12 with 3 assorted colors. I was overnighted a replacement order for my daughter's birthday party. The service rep even sent the seller a note to check the package before shipping!  Again, I received just one notepad and pen.  So I've now paid $30 (which I will be refunded when I send the items back) for 2 (Two) tiny notepads and fuzzy pens.  My daughter's party is today and it is too late for me to get anything cuter than the generic pack of notepads without pens from Target.<br />Prepare to be disappointed if you order this item!
1.0	Open the box,  looks like it'd been removed from packaging and reboxed.  Stern of deck and hull has 4 screws to hold together, all 4 have been broken.  Returned  :(
1.0	"PLEASE BE AWARE!  Although the picture of this costume shows a blue shirt IT IS NOT BLUE.  It is black (and a different style as well).  My son is the \\""Blue Pilgrim\\"" in his schools' Thanksgiving Play - this costume (judging by the picture) was perfect!  We received the costume on time... it was black.  I figured it was a mistake in the warehouse and sent it back.  Second costume arrived... still black.<br />I purchased this costume ONLY because the picture is shown as blue.  Dress rehearsal is tomorrow and the Blue Pilgrim does not have a blue costume.<br />Wouldn't it be nice if the picture that advertises the product we are buying was actually a picture of what we receive?!  Thank you, CostumeHub, we're completely screwed now"
1.0	Alright...so i was taking a crap right? Well then i noticed i was out of toilet paper! *gasp* So I just saw that mace right?...well i considered my options........and i just wiped with that big boy. It did the job. It left a rash but....WORTH IT!!!
1.0	Well we bought it loved it and are now returning it. The swing is not swinging even with new batteries,even when we have it cranked up to 10 and it's only moving a little. My baby is only 11pounds and that is not the problem, because 2 days prior we could only set the speed at 4-5, because it will swing fast at the higher speeds, with that weight. Not anymore. Seems like the motor is giving out. We just started getting him to use his swing 2 weeks ago. Hope he's not attached,because it's going back.I am really disappointed, because I love this swing, but, looking cool, doesn't do the job.
1.0	Got this for my niece and was kind of embarrassed when it was opened and played with.  It doesn't do much of anything and looks a lot more exciting in the package than it actually is.  It was quickly put aside as a useless toy.
1.0	My daughter received this for Christmas last year.  It fell apart during the first use.  Also, the mix batter didn't fill the molds and the molds would not stay closed.  I would not recommend this to anyone.<br /><br />My recommendation:  Buy the cake pop oven pan and make some that way and have your kids help if they are that interested in cake pops.
1.0	I loved it at first but it didn't last long.  I did use it a lot and may have shortened it's life.
1.0	This item arrived in New With Tags as promised but it was also really dirty and the seller refused to fix the problem.  Good thing it was purchased for a 2 year old....
1.0	They sent me a dog collar as LARGE that wouldn't go aroung my one year old lad's neck...told me to return it for a larger collar, but never returned anything. I lost around twenty bucks for nothing.Stay away from this seller.
1.0	It chipped really bad and looks really beat up after normal use. disappointed in the finish.
1.0	I was given the task (by the little man himself) of looking for a set of lego brink. when I placed the order this set was the best one I could find for my price range. When I received, I was disappointed because it's not what I expected. my niece said to me and I quote &#34; you bough the bootleg lego&#34;  Sorry but I had to return it, did not wanted to be thought of buying illicit goods
1.0	I bought these balloons because they were biodegradable. I still planned on picking up the pieces afterwards, but I thought this was a nice touch.<br /><br />I was very disappointed in this product because the balloons broke very easily and did not hold much water. (It seemed like every third or fourth balloon that was pulled out of the bag broke at some point during the filling and tying process.) I wish I had listened to other people that were saying these same exact things in their reviews. Once all 100 balloons are gone, I will take my water-balloon purchases elsewhere.
1.0	My 9 year old got this from Santa, put on the glove and the magnet broke into 2 pieces when the &#34;glove&#34; was lifting it (magnet inside the glove). The magnet that broke had a plastic piece on it that broke into 2 pieces. Save your money, your Star Wars fan will be very disappointed with this item.
1.0	Bad,bad,bad only received one big baby was supposed to be two the one that was received had a hole in it very disappointed i wanted it for my twin baby shower
1.0	This was one of my 3 year olds christmas gifts.  He was so excited until the arm broke after 3 minutes of use.  He would not stop crying, cried literally for days because it wouldn't work.  We would re-attach it, and it would never last more than 1 minute.  This is really poorly made - don't buy it.
1.0	TRIPOD broke the first day.  cheaply made.  Should have sent it back but my grandson loved that he had a telescope
1.0	this toy fell apart so fast it was rediculous!!! Within 1 month fridgerator and microwave doors fell off, then the oven then the freezer door! Glad it was a gift. I would NEVER buy another one! particle board for 2 year olds really????
1.0	"I've never written a review of a product before and honestly, I haven't really been displeased with any toy I've bought before - different things appeal to different children and just because a toy doesn't appeal to one of my children doesn't necessarily mean it wouldn't appeal to many others. That being said, this toy is just plain silly. My youngest daughter LOVES baby dolls and pretend play - she will push a stroller around for hours... she still plays daily with a kitchen, stroller, 2 dolls, bassinet, diaper bag set and grocery cart that she recieved over a year ago. I was so sure this toy would be a hit! We couldn't pull her away from nursery centers on display at the toy store but they seemed flimsy so when I saw Step 2 had just released one I scooped it up for Christmas right away. I don't know how else to describe it but, \\""that's it?\\"" Those are the words I said when I first saw it put together. Those are the words our 19 year old daughter used, our 16 year old daughter used and our 14 year old daughter used when they each walked into the room Christmas Eve after my husband finished assembling it. I love simple toys that encourage a child to use their imagination but this one goes a bit too far in the direction of simple - especially since it is $80. My daughter has played with this nursery center maybe 4 or 5 times since Christmas and every time it has been to use the high chair part to feed her new baby all gone. We should have just bought her a high chair. Ironically, we still can't pull her away from the flimsy nursery centers in the toy store and she spent an entire visit at a family friend's house playing with a nursery center their daughter had. My advice? Either buy a less durable (and less expensive) version of this nursery center or choose a different toy entirely."
1.0	I tried for three days to get just one L.E.D. to work! the only thing that worked were the motors, and one of them fell apart when taking it out of the package. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS KIT!!!!
1.0	Very disappointed with this item. Card sizes and lines did not match when you put together.
1.0	Don't be fooled by the pic with the toddler girl in the chair (blue shirt yellow pants), she is not a normal sized child or the chair in the picture is much larger then the chair you receive, which by the way they also shipped to me in the wrong color. Sooo disappointed.
1.0	My daughter who loves dogs has never played with this. She could never get into the x-rays, the case, any of it. JUST JUNK.
1.0	I cannot believe you ever wrote the reviews saying this item was just as good quality as American Girl - so after reading that review, I purchased this outfit and the bunny slippers for my neice for xmas.  It is a piece of scrap material.  There is a letter 'K' sewn on the pocket - what girl wants the letter 'K' on her American Girl pajames until her dolls name starts with the letter K or her name starts with the letter K. The bunny slippers have different shaped eyes and ears - it's pathetic.  I would gladly pay the extra $10 for a high quality, long lasting outfit rather than this manufacturers products - I will never order from this manufacturer again.
1.0	I have ordered Snap products before.  This particular product has been outside on my patio in the sun for approximately 6months in an attempt to bake the smell out of it.  The foam, the case, the plastic of the circuits smell so badly as to preclude usage.  Worse than throwing away the money is the disappointment of the 9year old boy who received this as a birthday gift and cannot use it.
1.0	If your looking for a cheap party favor- don't bother.  If you're looking to pull your hair out or like a challenge, then this product will take you hours to unsuccessfully unknot.  It is complete unusable.
1.0	did not work as expected.  frustrating for kids who normally love this stuff.  no one will even try to play with it
1.0	The table and chairs are cute but NOT at all easy to put together.  My Mom has arthritis in her hands and is completely incapable of getting it together.  I'm trying to help her but it is a real pain (literally).  I would not recommend this product at all.  This is our first and last  purchase from Sophia's.<br />Couldn't be more disappointed.
1.0	Comes only with the character figure. There is no actual screen part!!!!! I would not have ordered if they advertised it correctly.
1.0	Defective Product - DAMAGED. Two adults followed the directions on two different Glow Sand Balls. The product does not glow - at all. Disappointing - we purchased 5.
1.0	I bought this Quad and I must say its really cheap and flimsy. The day I bought it and crashed it from 6Ft in grass the landing gear's screws came off and I lost one of the landing gears. I returned it and bought the Blade QX 350 and I can say it just feels like a better quality quad right out of the box. I would say avoid the Ethos and spend the money to get a blade
1.0	I ordered this card and I got a different version of this card with a different picture and it was an ultra rare version. This is not the picture of the card that the seller is selling.
1.0	This item's title, photo and description were stolen from my eBay store, &#34;Kerbey Lane Miniatures&#34;.  I sell this item for $9.98.  Susie lacyhome4boys on eBay.
1.0	I purchased this camera as a Christmas present for my neice. My sister tells me that the pictures are so dark, you can't see the images. They were all taken indoors and she thinks maybe better suited for outdoor use to get sunlight.
1.0	This is a terrible, very small, low quality, obvious fake
1.0	I thought it was make up for kids not for a Barbie thing.  My fault again!  I would like to return.
1.0	Very poor quality.<br />Not good design, not good info on installation
1.0	"I bought these for an alien themed book fair and just used the kind of helium you can buy in a tank from Wal-Mart....  and tied them with a piece of curling ribbon.  First, it's a little hard to tell but the balloons are only about 6 or 7\\"" big, so whatever kind of string you use is going to be heavy ballast for it.  We filled them up in the morning each day and they were starting to drag by about noon or 1:00.<br /><br />If you have the money and can have them professionally filled, it probably would be better.  They are very cute.  I had they \\""bouqueted\\"" with a big purple balloon, and they were great that way.  We did end up having to kind of \\""tape and drape\\"" to keep things up for each day.."
1.0	This was a dress my daughter wanted for her birthday. When she received it, she loved it but I must say it is NOTHING like the picture. It is more of a peacock blue and is poorly made. She will get some wear out of it but I do see having to buy another one soon.  --We have had the dress for 6 days and after the first night in it, the side seam on the bodice is coming apart and the skirt is coming apart at the back and the snow flake has fallen off (it was barely attached when we received it). After 4 days of having the dress, it is now coming apart at the front of the skirt! DO NOT BUY THIS DRESS! Her best friend got an Elsa dress that is beautiful from Amazon for $20 and I will be finding out who her best friend's mom bought it from because it has held up so well and seriously looks so perfect. Great enough that I decided to buy the dress rather than make it myself. I can't believe how horribly made this dress is.
1.0	did not come with the stampers. I bought for a gift and did not realize it right away so I figured it would be too late to try to return once I started wrapping it.
1.0	The bed frame is assembled with dowels and glue.  I put it together assuming the pieces connected with the dowels should be flush so the dowels would not show. Once assembled, the bed was too narrow for the drawer to fit, so I attempted to pull the pieces apart to accomodate the drawer.  This resulted in two of the dowels breaking.  Not to mention the preassembled bedrails coming apart as well. Amazon has sent another, so we'll give it another chance. Had I seen the other reviews before we returned the bed, I would not have asked for a new one.
1.0	I got these for my 3 year old son and could not get them on his hands. The material does not stretch. Had to return to Amazon.
1.0	Final Update-<br /><br />I have had to update this review now for the third time! When I reviewed this product, the picture the seller included was stolen from Disney's official Cinderella dress. The seller here used that exact picture and the title said they were selling the Cinderella live action dress. I had the official, beautiful Cinderella dress made from Disney so I made a review of it and included a picture so people could see how beautiful the official disney Cinderella dress is. However, I later saw from other reviews that the dress sent to customers was not the official disney Cinderella dress but a cheap knockoff probably from China. However, the seller kept the photos of the official Disney Cinderella dress up with the product, confusing customers. I guess enough people complained about false advertising because  finally the seller has pictures of the knockoff dress they are selling. In my opinion the photos of this knockoff dress look nothing like the official Disney Cinderella wedding dress. Do yourself a favor and buy the real official Disney Cinderella wedding dress because it is so beautiful and well made. You can find it on the Disney store website.<br /><br />Update- review changed to one star<br />The first two pictures posted for this product are from the actual Disney Cinderella wedding dress, which is shown in the picture I included. When I reviewed the item this only picture for the product was of the Cinderella Disney store dress so I wanted to show how beautiful it is. We have that Disney store dress and love the quality as you can see in my photo. However, I just checked this review today and saw the seller put other pictures of a knock off dress up. This knockoff dress is not the same as the first two pictures the seller has up which are of the official Disney store dress (which you see in my photo). So, I am changing my review to one star. Go to the Disney store to get the real dress.<br /><br />----------------Original Review 5 stars (for the product I thought was the official Disney Cinderella dress)------------------------------------------------<br /><br />This dress is super pretty in person. I don't even think the photos do it justice!! It looks well made and expensive. The details on the bottom of the dress are really pretty and the shimmery arms and top of the bodice makes it look really elegant. Here it is on a four year old that wears 5T top and the 5/6 fit perfectly. She has received a lot of compliments on it! She is also wearing the cute Cinderella butterfly slippers that you can also find on amazon (note that the necklace doesn't come with the dress though). Overall, it is darling and great for little fans that are in love with the new Cinderella movie!official Disney Cinderella dress)------------------------------------------------  This dress is super pretty in person.

1.0	Very disappointed, reviews were good so bought these for my son and nephew, you only see out of one eye and your field of vision is horrible, if someone is standing about 8 ft in front of you you can barely fit just their face in your field of view
1.0	these bugs didn't climb in the black hole play set!
1.0	I didn't get what is pictured. I received the movie avengers not comic avengers... also it's a lot smaller than I was thinking it would be. More for notes rather than a journal.
1.0	Much smaller than thought to be for the price. sitting on my small 15 in. laptop son was disappointed because he just came home from the hospital and wanted these items, when they were received he was unhappy because of the size - the sun flower especially we thought was the wrong size.
1.0	I saw this toy and thought my son would love it and he did but the lid kept falling off. Also when the lid is opened on the ship it is so heavy it tips it over. Needless to say this item went back to the store the same day!
1.0	Was vary cheap and quite small
1.0	Fell apart within hours of wear.
1.0	this 1 do not work plus miss codes and cable
1.0	Board too long, too much for young ones to catch on to. Didn't keep grkid's, or my attention. The object to win was boring.
1.0	Its not even a real ventriloquist dummy. It has a sting coming out of the back of its head to make its mouth move. That's it,  nothing else moves.
1.0	They take the items Lego pays big $ for, and knock off the item.<br />Pictures look great, but you cant tell the quality by the pics.<br /><br />For anyone who wants Lego items, these are not them. These are Chinese knock offs, so FYI.<br />The Quality of these items are poor at best, and some even have messed up faces and hair and parts. The items usually dont fit right, and have many other imperfections. I have seen them without faces, or with the printing messed up on faces, torsos, etc.<br /><br />This is a license infringement at the very least. Lego pays to be able to use these items and then creates their lines of products, but the Chinese co's just steal the idea and create a knock off.
1.0	Ummmmmmm, I'm trying to be nice because I was taught that way so just listen to me and save your money and don't buy it... :\
1.0	Bought for Christmas present and had to return both of them. One was broken in box and other would not work.
1.0	The rings were as advertised but much more cheap looking than what I expected. Also, the flat shapes atop each ring were not smoothed out or sanded properly. Some of these flat pieces of hard plastic had borders as sharp as razor blades. Two of the students who got them cut themselves or others. I took back the ones I had given out and threw the whole thing in the trash. I would definitely not buy this item again.
1.0	I've always been a fan of Syma, but this one was a fail.  It's much harder to control than any of the other Syma's I've owned and the copter itself doesn't like to keep a steady connection to the remote control so it just drops out of the air at random.
1.0	This toy had problems. The only time I was able to hear the bell ring is when I put the batteries in it.<br />That is about it.<br />It never worked after that. I got this for my kid's birthday and was very displeased.<br />Yes, the toy was inexpensive  and I could have returned it, but it wasn't worth it when you had a crying child who wanted the toy to work &#34;right now!&#34;
1.0	Worked one time and then was broken
1.0	We bought this camera for my son( in grey) for Christmas 2013. He loves it, and my kids have a blast with it, so much so, that we ordered this pink and purple model for his twin sister. I have purchased 2, and now returned them both because they are completely broken. I have put multiple sets of new batteries in, and still won't power up. My 4 yr old daughter is so upset. I just did the return process on the second and a 3rd is coming. I am going to keep my fingers crossed that it has just been bad luck.
1.0	Critters don't sit while on furniture, can't position the critters to sit , very disappointed in this purchase, flowers don't hold up.
1.0	"Beware future buyers This product  is not \\""wet products\\"" water balloons, they are selling an off brand of little quality."
1.0	They do not provide enough 'goo' to make even ONE uni-colored web.  The kids can't help with it b/c you have to use boiling water.  It takes forever.  I have listened to my 4yo whine nonstop for 45 minutes over the lack of web, how longit takes, how he can't helpmake it.
1.0	We bought these cars at Target and within 10 minutes half of the stickers came off leaving a nasty residue. We took them back the next day. They are very poor quality toys and are not safe for kids.  DO NOT BUY THESE!
1.0	It's too small. It seems bigger in the picture.
1.0	This Air Blaster arrived non working, I tried to return it to where it was purchased, Target, they would not take it back, said they had clearanced them all because they are no longer carried. Due to high number of returns. I then called the 800 number on box and was told she was aware that these were sent out missing a vital part. She mailed me the missing part, however, it is impossible to install without destroying the gun. It was glued together in the factory. I called her and she said that is all she can do for me. My first and last experience with Buzz Bee Toys. I am astonished at the lack of customer service. Now I have a very dissapointed child who cannot use his birthday present.
1.0	The helicopter failed to work out of the box.  Would never buy again.  It might be unbreakable because it doesn't fly.
1.0	We followed the directions and absolutely no crystals formed on the rocks provided nor on our own rocks.  Don't buy this product.  My chidren were very disappointed.  the pictures on the box do NOT tell the story.
1.0	I bought this for my kids' collection at Christmas 2009, and thought it would be a cool-looking way to store the little buggers. Holds cards, too! UNFORTUNATELY, THE TWO HALVES DO NOT FIT TOGETHER. NO WAY, NO HOW. You cannot store anything in a tippy container with no top. WE WERE NOT THE ONLY ONES. OUR FRIENDS WHO GOT THIS ALL HAD THE SAME EXPERIENCE. BAH-kugan HUMBUG!
1.0	I opened the pack and the ears came out completely broken diamonds chipped off ears broken off couldn't be fixed even if I tried... I didn't even bother open the clear plastic rap I just chucked it in the trash... Worst product I've bought off of amazon.... don't even bother getting this...
1.0	I bought this as a gift but could not use it because eeyore was missing his front leg.
1.0	The Hiss game was used, the inside of the box was broken and the game cards are not flat, they are all bent. Was expecting better.
1.0	this balloon had a hole, what a surprises, when im getting ready to go to a graduation and this item has a hole!! im so upset! what a way to ruin a little girl gift!
1.0	EACH OF THE FOUR PUZZLES HAD MANY PIECES MISSING.....ENDED UP IN THE TRASH!!! I AM SO VERY DISAPPOINTED.<br />THOUGHT IT WOULD BE FUN TO PUT TOGETHER SUCH BEAUTIFUL SCENES.....DIDN'T HAPPEN...
1.0	I bought this toy based on the review that it was durable and for heavy chewers. My dog who is a one year old miniature schnauzer loved the toy and the crinkle at first sight and touch. five minutes later she has chewed apart the velcro and the top of the bottle was sticking out. I forced it back in and rezipped the velcro. 20 Minutes later the same thing happens and on top of that, she has chewed off one and a half of the cow's leg!!! This was an expensive toy for 30 minutes play time!!!! My husband makes better crinkle toys!
1.0	Bought this item for a boy and it looks like a purse. Charged huge fee for shipping and when I returned item I paid for shipping back to vendor at half the price and then they charged me a restocking fee even though the product was perfectly intact. Have to say it was shipped promptly.
1.0	I'm returning this.  It looks absolutely nothing like the picture. It's cheaply made.  I can't believe they're selling this an original.
1.0	Every time I move this toy there is a sheet of mold underneath it.  I try to hang it upside down when not in use.  My son is almost three and we've had it for several months. It doesn't do much and I constantly have to bleach it.  It's also very small.  Save your money on this one.
1.0	INSTANT LANDFILL.  Never worked.  Does not connect to MP3 Player.  I put this in the trash and did not go through the hastle of returning on Amazon. (forgot)  My kids were disappointed.  Terrible product....Ouch...
1.0	The order came in a timely fashion, however the package that housed the binoculars itself had been opened before. It was cut all along the boarders and then flimsily put back together with one piece of tape at the top.  The product description described the item as new, but this one clearly was not. Very disappointing purchase and a waste of my time.
1.0	Bought this and just found out the APP is not available for download anymore.  This game is now useless.  Is there any possible way to get download of this app?
1.0	Cheap! Game pieces (plastic piece and magnet) fell apart. Definitely not safe for small children (may ingest magnet).
1.0	I started to order these and found out you can get them for a dollar a piece at the dollar store. I think it's kind of a rip off for what they are.
1.0	This clock was given to my 5 year old son as a birthday present. My son loves clocks, and loves gears. It was a very thoughtful gift!  Unfortunately, we were unable to put it completely together. There was no way the bell was securing inside the clock.  Also, the clock face did not line up with the body of the clock, so we could never get the face flush against the body.  Due to the horrible manufacturing of the parts, I think anyone who orders this is most likely wasting their money.
1.0	This does NOT charge the leappad. Instead it has to be plugged in to a wall outlet which is inconvenient!
1.0	i purchased the item for my grandson, it was missing a screw on the handle and the handle broke off when handled by my grandson.  it wasn't worth the money i spent for it and decided to throw away.  i decided not to spend anymore money on returning the product or deal with customer service.  the concept was there but the workmanship was poor.
1.0	This is a terrible product! Only one sword came in the package and it barely lit up. I will never buy it again.
1.0	I had ordered this item before doing any price research, yes, foolish. You can purchase the much better quality talking Buzz Lightyear from the Disney Store for $20! Needless to say, I canceled this order and bought from Disney.
1.0	My son LOVES transformers and for the second year in a row he wanted a transformer birthday cake.  Last year he had a Optimus Prime/Bumblebee topper on his cake as well.  The toppers pictured on this cake looked more detailed and more grown up than the ones he had last year, so this is why I ordered them.  But to my surprise, when I received them in the mail they are identical to the ones he had last year...... NOT what is pictured.  While they are very nice toys, I would have never ordered or paid to have the exact ones that I already have at my house.  So BEWARE that the picture displayed is not what you will actually receive.
1.0	I paid for Stompeez Growling Dragon (small), but they will NOT growl???? I feel that I paid for for this item to do what it advertises, but it does not, so what can I do to correct this????? This was a disappointing Christmas gift.
1.0	Yuck-  Did not work.  Nothing really came out.  You say chick or bunny-  I say glob of something funny
1.0	I should have read the length before I ordered these.They are half the length of regular ones. They arent very full either.
1.0	Came with a hole in it!! Do not buy this product!!
1.0	It makes a great paperwweight.  It is not good for what it's designed for.  The top part is sort of okay although I can't get the magnifying glass to focus on whatever is in the clips, but the biggest problem is the whole top drops side to side with no way to keep it steady.  I've tried tightening all the (hurts your hands) screws but no luck.  Don't bother.  Seriously, don't bother.  Spend a little more somewhere else and get a good one.  I'm going to go to Radio Shack and see what they have there.
1.0	Everything is as described.  Look for &#34;Play-Doh Marvel Super Hero Adventures Set&#34; and you'll understand my ratings  Is a nice set my kid loves it. Hope this can help folks to get it a a better price.
1.0	My son got this for his 3rd birthday last weekend and used it for the first time yesterday. Today, its completely out. the part that spins to coat the solution over the &#34;wand&#34; will not spin. My parents bought this because he's in love with the movie Cars and now I have a broken-hearted child because some people cannot make a proper to. I SUGGEST THAT NO ONE BUYS THIS TOY!
1.0	Very rude doll.  BFF as advertised?  Definitely not. After a day and a half my six year old has already shelved her.  The doll repeats the same questions every few minutes even though the box claims she knows 300 words/phrases.  It is a cute doll that had potential.  I would have been willing to purchase further accessories, downloads or friends for her if she was a fun little toy.  As it is, I. am regretting my purchase and am disappointed that a company that would retail a doll that models such a bad attitude.
1.0	I purchased two Meeps and these things are horrible. First of all they are slow, they do not play Netflix or any video for that matter, due to incompatibility with flash player which apparently is an Android problem.  I did find instructions on how to download flash player from someones comment on facebook. I downloaded flash player, but was unable to open flash player. The system is to confusing and I figured I would buy a kindle fire instead. The Meep parental site, was also slow or unable to get into site all Christmas day.  Games are boring and battery does not last long, camera quality is cheap. The one thing I liked was the texting ability for my kids, but a feature I would not use often.  I spent many hours researching ways to download systems and try to improve this product with no luck. Parents spend your money elsewhere.
1.0	The the box says includes an app bundle- it does not. You can only download two lite version of the apps from iTunes, the full versions cost you $1.99. The number Safari app has the same racer graphics as the letter app, no jungle or truck.<br />It does not even work just as a car play toy as I was hoping- it only works hooked up to an iPad/touch.<br />So no lights, sounds, nothing. Really how hard would it have been to include a little speaker and sound effects.<br />The final nail in the coffin is that it does not hold the iPad securely at all! Even with a case on the iPad it is super loose, expect it to slide/fall of a lot.
1.0	Pity no characters, pinyin only. My son used these once. Knowing how quickly children learn visually, they should really have put characters there.
1.0	This item did not come as described.  It was not in the box, but rather in a plastic bag and envelope and wasn't covered in some white substance.  I immediately returned it, very disappointing.
1.0	Terrible.......they didn't work at all.
1.0	didn't last long, only about 3 charges.  it won't even fly anymore, not enough battery power.  one of the motors stopped working after the 3rd flight too, not sure if its related to the battery problem.  not a good product, very disappointed.
1.0	I too may have bought a defective one.  Even after reading the directions I still can't get the dumb thing to stay together.  After a little creative thinking i got it to stay for a while but if i move it i comes undone.  My son doesn't really care for this toy.  Maybe when he is old enough to crawl he can enjoy it more but as of right now he isnt to interested.
1.0	THIS IS ANIMAL ABUSE. PLAIN AND SIMPLE<br />The frogs come alive stuffed into a tiny ziploc bag. There are videos on the internet showing the manufacturing plant where this product is made, it shows the frogs literally piled into filthy tanks where the frogs are eating corpses of other frogs, covered in their own feces. Buying this supports animal abuse.<br />These types of frogs are NOT MEANT TO LIVE IN A TINY CUBE
1.0	We were so excited to be able to give this to our son on Christmas morning. Unfortunately, the box was crushed and had clearly been opened prior to being shipped to us. The pieces were not the original items, and the X-Wing could not be assembled as it was supposed to be. We can only assume that the box had been opened, and pieces had been substituted from the original. The item is now unusable, and given where we live, returning the X-Wing is not an option. Such a disappointment - we will not be ordering from this supplier again.
1.0	Really made too cheap to work right
1.0	Just not what I expected
1.0	When I received it it was cracked when we pushed button it leaked not impressed at all
1.0	Too small. Expected something larger for the money.
1.0	The speaker wire for the under water speaker has broken off and the top speaker/radio no longer receives the signal clearly. This happened after using it 4-5 times only (within the first week)
1.0	Focus is impossible for an adult, much less a child. Too bad it was a gift and I cannot return it!
1.0	This is a total loss. Batteries cost more than the device. Instructions are poor. Can't get it to function at all. If possible will return.
1.0	This order was the wrong item. the picture shows a marble run and the item I recieved was definately not a marble run. It was a last minute Christmas gift idea for my 5 year old son. However, When I recieved it in the mail I was extremely disappointed to see that it was definately not the item pictured or described by other customers. Needless to say, by the time I recieved the item it was too late to replace it with a marble run before Christmas. I had planned on purchasing another one of these items for my Pre-K classroom, if it proved to be durable and easy to use. Oh well, I am still on the search for a good marble run.
1.0	The size would have been perfect if it wasn't total garbage.  The plastic is so cheap it wouldn't even close to latch. Returned.
1.0	Was not very cute smaller than I expected not very plush very dissappointed not very cute I would not purchase this again
1.0	I bought this for my daughter for Christmas who is 5. This is more for a 2yr d. It is very small and my daughter can't even sit in the chair
1.0	Bought two of these for our 10 and 8 year old grandchildren.  The plastic is anything but robust.  After the 1st one busted on Christmas day I decided the 2nd one would not be far behind.  We were lucky enough to be able to take them both back to Kohls and get our money back.  For the price I had expected a more robust frame/body design.  It is a shame, because the function seemed well designed.
1.0	My 3 daughters each received this particular loom kit and it's terrible. It's cheaply made and flimsy. The crochet needle is a joke and one has already bent to the point of no return. I had to order 3 new &#34;rainbow loom&#34; hooks to replace these. The bands that are supplied have broke in many of the bracelets that my daughters have made. I have already ordered new &#34;real rainbow looms&#34; for all three of them. The plastic pegs are always bending into each other while making a bracelet and it is a pain. There is a big difference. I ordered from the rainbow loom website because a lot of people have said the rainbow loom that is sold here is a knock off. You can definitely tell the difference between the two.
1.0	I bought this new as a collector and the package was opened.  I was going to display it with the package intact with the rest of my Batman collection.  Now its a open display because I do not want to put up with the hassle of returning it.  I could've saved some money by buying a use one!  Makes me think twice about buying from this place again!
1.0	Unsatisfied with what i received, it was smashed in the brim was slanted the hat itself was deformed, i had a gift card so that's why I'm not really upset with it.
1.0	Dud!  We opened the car for my grandson's 3rd birthday and after about 10 minutes of playtime, it would only work for about 20 seconds and then stop.  Batteries were all good, and for those 20 seconds it worked fine then just dead in the water.  After about 10 minutes, it would work again for 20 seconds.  I am waiting for Customer Service to open at Fisher Price.  Very disappointed 3 year old who was so excited to have his first RC car.  I am hoping I can update the review when Amazon and/or FP resolves the problem.
1.0	We only had this toy a day before returning it.  The remote broke immediately.  The gears are limited in how you can attach them.  However, my son really liked the light-up features.  It looks nice, but there isn't a lot that you can do with it.  Most of the gears are the same size, with only a couple of big gears and a couple of medium sized gears.  We went with the Quercetti set instead, and it has worked out much better than this one.
1.0	After reading the other review I baught this puzzle for my son. I have had this puzzle for about a week now, and prob. going to have to toss it. As if with the tightness mentioned in the other review isnt already frustrationg enough, The puzzle pieces are made with layerd wood and taking the puzzle apart made the peices crack&chip and now have little wood peices all over the floor, and some pictures started to peel off. With all this going on I dont think it is save now with the sharp corners and most likely splinters coming soon and if your child is still randomly putting stuff in his mouth still, then he might choke or cut himself. Short to say dont buy, waste of money and time.
1.0	Not a good but. Stopped working after two days.
1.0	My Sister bought this for my 2 1/2 year old daughter for Christmas thinking it would be great for all the trips we make to visit family.  The concept is adorable, but it continuously falls apart while she plays.  It is not made to withstand any play without totally disassembling.  It now stands in a corner of our Family Room totally closed up and never played with.  At least in this position it doesn't fall apart.
1.0	This was made very cheaply and fell apart often.<br />It had many little pieces that were eerily lost by a young child.
1.0	This set arrived with the box all taped on the top--and one piece (a dress) is missing! The space where the dress is supposed to be is blank, and once my daughter opened the damaged-looking box, the missing dress was still nowhere to be found (i.e., it had not fallen somewhere else in the box--it was just missing!) Very disappointed.
1.0	We loved the look of the Brinca Dada dollhouses and furniture, but we went through two sets of furniture and both broke pretty much as soon as we looked at them. The first set was replaced and we were told that they were using a new manufacturer. The second set broke almost as quickly and within a month or two of play, nearly every single piece of furniture was broken. Only buy this if you are planning to display, definitely not durable enough for play!
1.0	The junk they sent me was used with greasy finger prints and food on it. It looked like a return or USED not NEW.... It had scratches/dirt/fingerprints/box not sealed/box<br />tore and smashed USED
1.0	This tunnel is a great design and my kids love it, especially for the peekaboo screens, but we have to toss it because it has been made with flame retardants.  Flame retardants are TOXIC, especially for children.  Flame retardants were banned from children's pajamas in the 70s.  I have no idea why a manufacturer would make this product for children with toxic flame retardants.  It does not make any sense to me and is an incredible disappointment.  To the manufacturer: PLEASE get these toxic chemicals out of products for our children!
1.0	This item is supposed to be suitable for ages 3 and up the range top is 12.5 inches. I am not happy with the fact that Christmas is a week away and I'm stuck with this purchase definitely not worth 35.00. the plastic is flimsy.
1.0	I have received this game as a Christmas gift. Here is what I observed:<br />(1) The purpose of the game is ‘Global Domination’ – a ‘playful’ concept that in real world has been promoted by bloody warfare and atrocities as far back as the recorded history goes.<br />(2) The ‘playground’ (the game board) is the map of the world. The designers of the game have presented a simplistic yet relatively accurate view of the map of the U.S., Canada (no Quebec among its provinces -- sorry), the U.K., and Australia. Most of the non-Anglo-Saxon parts of the world are less fortunate: The numbers of countries on all the continents have been greatly reduced, primarily by presenting some countries as parts of others. Thus, Ecuador is part of Peru, Chile is part of Argentina, Colombia is part of Venezuela, Pakistan is part of India. Russia is truncated by half, however the remaining half includes some of its former colonies. The game board, it seems, seeks to rekindle at least a dozen of interethnic, territorial and political conflicts smoldering all over the world.<br />(3) Some of the geographic aberrations are perhaps less offensive but outright silly: Northern Europe is shown south of Scandinavia and includes most of Central Europe and a good part of Western Europe. Large parts of Eurasia bear cities’ names rather than regions’ or countries’ names.<br />(4) The game is targeted to ‘Ages 10+’. For school-age children, the middle school is expected to be the formative stage of learning about world geography. The game interferes with the cognitive process in confusing and politically corrosive ways.<br />(5) While we pay taxes to finance Homeland Security, somebody else in the U.S. designs, distributes, and sells a ‘game’ that pitches us against the world; shows how insensitive to the global agenda we as a nation are, and how easily we are ready to extend the ‘standard of ignorance’ to the generation of our kids and grandkids.<br />(6) Does Amazon want to sell a product that offends common sense and epitomizes ‘ugly Americanism’? Do we want to buy a game that treats the geographic image of the world like a doormat?<br />(7) If this product cannot be purged from the market, let’s at least be consistent and disfigure the U.S. map using the same simplification tools as applied to the rest of the world: The ‘Western United States’ (as on the current map) should be renamed to Wichita. New England should be ceded to Canada. The U.S. should take over Mexico. And Alaska should go to ‘Kamchatka’. The game is called ‘Risk’. So why don’t we create some for those who associate their reputation with this product?
1.0	I did not receive the item listed. Listing describes a gray adult sized hat. I got a toddler sized hat with toddler sized mittens, and it's brown. It fits on my head so will do for what I need it for (a scavenger hunt) but I would not order from this seller again.
1.0	When my tin arrived it was banged up in multiple places and not stirdy at all.
1.0	The product came bent and it is not made to handle heavier lollipops, like tootsie pops.  The image looks like it is more of a short tree with a wide base whereas the product I got is a taller tree with a smaller base.  Disappointed.
1.0	Even though it was sold with a particular product as an extra battery, it isn't, and it doesn't fit into that product. Conveniently, it's not returnable either.
1.0	Came broken, that star is not there there is minus one
1.0	Waste of money!! The bottles cute.. that's about it.  I should've followed others advice and not spent the $!!  Half the bottles leaked during shipment & are not usable, one was completely empty!  DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!  I also bought the wedding dress bottles which arrived in perfect condition buy them instead
1.0	After spending 80$ for ball to fill it, we have never been able to get the thing to hold air, let alone jump on it. My child is 15 months old, so its not like its been abused. found a hole on the seam of one ring and another on the center of the jumpy part.
1.0	When we got this balloon blown up, it came out all funky and it looked cheap. You could tell it wasn't the highest quality.
1.0	I purchased 2 ultras, 2 gel skins, 2 holders, and 12 games....that means I spent several hundred dollars on these.<br /><br />I opened one and right out of the box it didn't work. It had lines across the screen and had to be returned for another one. The other only worked for less than 2 weeks and then lines popped up across the screen. It had to be returned as well. I called leappad but were no help. I now have 2 replacements and don't know how long they will last.<br /><br />-The ultras are VERY slow. Therefore my children get frustrated very quickly with them.<br />It's a shame because my kids normally love and enjoy playing games. After 5-10 minutes they are tired of playing with them because the speed is slow<br />-Wifi is useless, see other people comments on that<br />-The extra apps aren't really extra apps. They are things young children don't use. For example: why does a 3 yr old need a calculator and calendar? They called that an app....seriously. An app should be a game or something fun<br />-camera is usually very blurry and most of the time useless...It's only taken a couple descent pictures<br /><br />I'm VERY disappointed and wish I had just purchased the leappad 2 instead or something else.. I would have saved a ton of money.<br />Leappad should be charged with false advertising.
1.0	This soes not look as cute as the picture. The one I received was not as white as the picture and also the fur looked a little worned!!
1.0	I bought this to use in my fifth grade classroom to teach a lesson about how some careers require great stability and accurateness to do their jobs.  A failure.  I could not get it to work.  Had to return it.  I was disappointed as I thought this was going to be a great creative way to teach about career requirements.
1.0	Thy were grey. The action figures looked like the colour of a dead soldier my son didn't want to play with it.
1.0	Picture is a lot brighter than what it really is. There are only 5 LEDs and are poorly placed .
1.0	this is toy is so cheap! takes forever to assemble, falls over with just a sneeze, and the track keeps falling off. Everytime my son tried to play with it, it breaks. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!! I would give it minus three stars!!!!
1.0	Seam broke within 5 minutes
1.0	Not what my granddaughter expected. Product was cheap. Granddaughter was shown product before Christmas by her mother. Granddaughter even said it was cheap. Product has Asian language on package.
1.0	It didn't come with a backer so I can't affix it to anything.  The tip of the arrow was bent due to poor packaging, so I went to bend it back and it broke off.  Don't waste your money!!!
1.0	My daughter wanted these exact Valentine cards pictured (the cartoon version) and we paid over $20 for her to have Harry Potter Valentine's cards and we got the kind that had the actual people on them, not the cartoon version.  She was disappointed, but we didn't have time to send them back, or inquire and get new ones in time.  She did use the ones we got, but the ones pictured were not the same.  It was unfortunate because she was very much looking forward to what was pictured.
1.0	Although this sidewinder falls is a lot of fun, it's almost guaranteed you will have a problem, I'm on my third in two years.  The most recent came with a small tear, and the mfg will not help.  Amazon.com did in fact help, but i have to ship it back.  Getting this into the original box is impossible, but yet i still have to ship this junk back.    It weighs 90lbs and is very difficult to handle.  A lot of fun, but be prepared to go through hell to manage this thing properly.
1.0	Ordered for family member for Christmas. Amazon shipping was awesome. The company that supplied the helicopter, not so much. Arrived missing parts and would not fly. Company asked for it to be sent back and they would ship a new one. The &#34;new&#34; one was the same old one with the parts added on and it still would not fly. Customer service with the company was terrible as we asked for help trouble shooting the problem. After weeks of dealing with this I gave up and took it to a local hobby store and they tell me it is likely a faulty controller. I don't trust the company to fix it properly so it is setting on a shelf, not flying.
1.0	I didn't realize they were paper, would have never bought them. I haven't even put them! don't know that I will....
1.0	The quality is horrible. Do NOT buy, repeat, don't buy. It will be a waste of your money. KEEP YOUR MONEY- it is NOT worth it. $5 for a crappy domo mechanical pencil that breaks when you touch it?
1.0	I am trying to figure out how many cans are in this order.  I also tried to get contact information for this seller.  Both are very difficult so at this stage I am giving a negative rating.
1.0	It was a plain yellow piñata with black construction paper taped on for eyes nose  and mouth.
1.0	Don't get me wrong,I LOVE The Mr.Men Show but this game is nothing more then a rip-off of the other famous game:Trouble. It may be fun after awhile but it's not as good as Trouble. I give this game a 1 out of 10.
1.0	Very poor construction!  My son received it for Christmas and really liked it, but it basically fell apart in his hands the next day when he tried to move it.  All of the fasteners along the hinge tore out of the plywood with very little provocation -- it's no wonder, since they're TINY and don't penetrate very far into the edge of the plywood.  Also, it's worth noting that the plywood is kind of splintery and is not painted along the edges like it is in the promotional photos.  Not sure what's going on here, as I usually have good luck with Melissa & Doug toys, but this was a pretty big fail.
1.0	If I could rate 0, I would. I was supposed to get these instead got a weird looking backscratcher.
1.0	This thing was tiny! A total let down but no fault of Amazon
1.0	THis toy was a piece of crap.  It was poorly made and broke after playing with it for one minute.  I would have returned it but needed it for my halloween costume so I didn't have time to order a new gun.  It was not worth the money.  I would not buy this gun even if it was just a penny.  Do not buy this cheap gun!
1.0	Has a large (watermelon sized) bubble/blister that popped out within the first 24 hours of inflating the tube.  It's not overinflated, in fact, the tube needs more air, but I'm afraid it will pop if I add more air given the deformity.
1.0	Nothing more than wide rubber bands, with imprinted words.  Absolute, complete junk.  Will be donated to charity, or thrown in the rubbish.  You get what you pay for, and, in this case, I paid $6 for rubber bands that are worth about 6 cents.  Don't waste your money.  (Oh, and to make matters even worse, EVERY SINGLE RUBBER BAND has some sort of identifying label glued on to it, so when you try to remove the label, it smears and tears the rubber!!  Absolutely unbelievable.  What a ripoff.)
1.0	"I was excited to buy these for my daughter, but thought I should check them out before putting them under the Xmas tree. Many glaring design flaws and the User Interface couldn't be much worse. Letters printed BELOW the buttons so they are covered while you are inputting text, of the old \\""press 3 times to get the letter C\\"" style input. A befuddlingly complex interface requiring multiple arcane button pushes to prepare the units for sending and receiving text. For example, after setting up and inputting data, you hit SEND. Does it send? No. The device cryptically asks you, \\""P/I?\\"" To this, you respond by finding the chicklet sized ICQ CALL key and pressing it. If the receiver has gone through the process of setting up their unit to receive, and if they're line of sight, and aimed at each other, the input text will send.<br /><br />Does it work? Yes. Should your kid be a computer programmer to get it to work? Yes again. Can you run the device without the manual? Not till you've got it memorized."
1.0	Not of good quality; for the price is should not be surprised, was going to include in stockings this year, but decided to just throw them out
1.0	I was so anxious to get this set of characters.  It SAID there were 24 puppets, and I thought that meant 24 DIFFERENT puppets.  I was going to put one in each day of our advent calendar.  WEll, bummer.  There were only 6 characters (like in the picture) and I got 4 sets of them.  What am I going to do with 4 baby Jesuses, 4 Marys...etc.  Wish they were more clear in description!!!  I would NOT have ordered this.
1.0	We returned this. Although it's cute and very cuddly, I can't give my kid a zebra with no stripes. That's just weird.
1.0	1.8.2011- Purchased today @ Toys r us. We did not even have it out of the package and the reins broke. Then not even an hr. later the doll has broken in 1/2. I can't believe that BREYER is selling products that are JUNK!! Especially for the $$! Stay away from this :( WE ARE VERY DISAPPOINTED
1.0	It was a gift for my husband wouldn't fly and pieces were missing. Some of the lights didn't work . Rear motor only worked some time . And a piece was missing. Expensive toy for such poor quality ..
1.0	Sebastian is shown twice on one of the boards and Aladdin is missing.  Seems like a pretty major oversight for a game like this.
1.0	Thought this was an update to the Magic Eight Ball I got as a kid.  Cheap piece of junk, can't read it most of the time.  When you can, responses are not funny.  Tossed it in the trash after about ten minutes.
1.0	I sent the Ideal Magic Shot Gallery directly to my grandson in Texas, so I never saw the product. Both my daughter and her husband were unable to get the gun to shoot. The magnet in the gun was very weak and the balls could not be picked up even with a strong external magnet. It simply didn't work at all. Once I learned they received the Gallery I destroyed the ordering document so I don't know how to get reimbursed or have a new one sent.
1.0	Cannot hear your voice even with the volumn turned all the way up... what's the point?
1.0	He loves it!! It's durable and great for a 3yr old. Thank you! Have a great day! What is up with all these word, I don't have that much to say about the toy....
1.0	This was kinda falling apart out of the bag. No matter how many time we used the lint brush, the fur just kept shedding all over the place and sticking to the red felt suit. Also it was too itchy and uncomfortable for my 6yo to handle. After about 10 min we finally gave up and returned it.
1.0	My son was so disappointed. Put fresh batteries in remote and charged for 1hr until LED light turned on signaling charging cycle was over.  It did not even spin up.  Returning for refund.
1.0	Just purchased for my boys for Easter after they have begged for this toy for weeks. The string got wrapped around inside after one of the first few times used. It was definitely a waste of money & very heartbreaking for my son that his toy broke on the first day. Save your money & disappointment of your children!
1.0	Horrible directions! Probably would have been better if they had not packed any directions, just like they didn't pack some important pieces - the axle spacers (little plastic cylinders that are placed on each side of the wheel so it doesn't wobble.)  Cool thing is I can see them when viewing the product online - right there when zooming in, between the spoke and the wheel. We had a smaller one for my son and wanted a bigger one so purchased this 'chopper'. As I'm putting it together right now, the night before his birthday, I'm pretty ticked off. I am cannibalizing his old bike and will hopefully have it working by tomorrow. I'll have to cut the axle spacers to fit this bike. Amazon Prime is usually great at getting my replacement parts, but not by tomorrow morning.  Back to the directions, or miss-directions... half a page, blurry and when they list all the parts they use the letter 'I' twice for two different parts. But that really didn't matter because I couldn't tell what part was what - poor drawings made worse by poor quality/pixelated sketches. Is that a washer, axle spacer, top hat..?  If you need help in creating directions for your product - call the Nest guys (now owned by Google) - they actually made an effort to create followable directions... and all the parts are shipped as well.
1.0	This product is absolutely useless.  Two of the three valves failed on first use.  The third valve failed soon thereafter. Since we had purchased the item for the use of renters we did not have time to get a replacement.  Don't waste your time with this product. Fortunately Amazon gave us a full refund.
1.0	These are crap! Do not work! Don't buy!
1.0	This is a not the real rainbow loom!!!! Wasted money should have purchased from their website! Don't be fooled!! Very Disappointed!
1.0	I just got mine delivered today  Only got one battery which is lame. I don't know how long it will last yet, until I have a chance to try to fly i Just test spinning it I can tell something is wrong with one of the rotors or blades. It's too windy to try it outside and my place is too small to fly inside so I will have to examine it further to find out if one of the blades is oriented backward like one of the other reviewer's issue  or if it is a problem with the rotor.  I will update this review if I end up returning it.<br /><br />Also whoever they have posting this Amazon AD is omitting fraud by lying about the product name. This is a WL Toys FUTURE BATTLESHIP model 4 channel 2.4 GHZ, my box says. The instructions were horrible, whoever wrote the manual should be fired. Hire an English-speaking person to do your English manual. What a thought!  No excuse for lack of quality control.
1.0	extremely unsatisfied. the product I received was NOT as in the description, to make matters even worse, these people are not responding to my return request and they do not answer the phone number that they have provided. I will never do business with these people again for as long as I live!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1.0	My son got this as a Christmas present, and loved it.  After putting it on the charger, it just wouldn't work.  We had several of amazon's toys do that to us this year.   It doesn't make for a fun Christmas, and I won't be ordering toys from them again.
1.0	First of all the screen on the brand new leappad keeps fading to the point you can't see it,then it will come back on several minutes later. Not the screen saver because it happens while playing. Also I just speant the past 2 hours downloading connect and the apps it is supposed to come with thinking there is some sort of update to solve the screen problem. Screen problem still exists.I am ready to take it back and just get the innotab. Also no phone number for support no web chat and the directions consist of  install the connect and insert batteries and register it.
1.0	This toy has barely been played with and her arm has fallen off!  It can't even be fixed!
1.0	Our daughter decided she wanted a xylophone for Christmas, so we chose this one. Bad mistake. It was in pieces when it arrived the other day, the red, dark blue and purple notes were just clanking around in the baggie it was in. We didn't pull it out of the package after seeing how damaged it was and we could see why it was in pieces...it is made SO cheaply. We should have known by looking at the price, I guess. Bottom line, this is a very cheaply made xylophone. Don't give it it a try, you WILL get what you pay for with this one! Disappointing.
1.0	There's a reason why this is one of the cheapest cowbells. You really get what you pay for. There isn't the resonance you'd expect and the bell's sounds like it is make of plastic with a very dull, low tone. I have previously bought cowbells on Amazon that costs twice as much and it is well worth spending the extra dollars for something that produces loud, clear sound the travels.
1.0	Ok so i got 23 remote revange 6 wattcannon 8 wolfs in sheeps clothing , 4 variable forms 2 widespread pads  well you get the drift so i ask WTF is this 23 of the same cards what the hell!
1.0	takes a long time to start and it doesn't work the way we expected it. bricks dont come out without bringing other bricks with it.. pain in the neck. kids lost interested before we even finished.
1.0	I purchased this badminton set for my grandson for his birthday recently.  The rackets & birdies are very cheap and one of the rackets broke almost immediately and the birdies tore very quickly.  I must note that this set was not abused, just simple hitting the birdie back and forth.  Also, although the birdies are very large, they are also heavier than normal birdies which makes it difficult to hit them back and forth.  I believe that a regular badminton set would work better for a young child.  I am very, very disappointed in this set.  I have seen rackets at the dollar store that held up better than this pretty expensive set.  I am hoping to be able to get my money back.
1.0	Should be sold at the dollar store. Poorly constructed lightweight plastic cars. Did not work properly without modification to the launcher. They should be ashamed to charge this price...
1.0	It is not good. I hate to put you down…. but if you are serious in speed cubing, don't waste your time with a cube that doest like to go fast! It is smooth and seems like it is a perfect fit, however, its not. The pieces come off to frequently.
1.0	The doll is Anna not Elsa as pictured.
1.0	These came damanged and completly un useable!!!!!!!! i cant use these for party favor boxes. such trash. i shouldnt of spent this money on them!!! DO NOT BUY THESE YOU WILL REGRET IT!
1.0	After only playing with it a couple of times, the net broke at the base within a month.  Great concept, very shoddy execution.  Would definitely not buy again.
1.0	When we got this it worked well for the first few uses. Now the light will turn on and off as you move the flashlight.  I would not recommend buying this even for a dollar.
1.0	Markers were dried out..tried to contact company and never answered. This set is junk...
1.0	My wife spent several hours in frustration with Lego over the marketing of these items with our experience echoing the other posts.  In reply, we received a nice form letter via email.  If you are upset, contact Lego and register a complaint and maybe they'll change their asinine policy of limiting sales and withholding from the market to drive up demand.
1.0	I was afraid but you delivered on time and correctly ! The price was the same from the market as a standard price. This product has several models on the market.
1.0	"I bought one of these birds for my daughter who was 4, while playing with it, it fell on the floor and broke opened.  One of the \\""weights\\"" fell out, before I knew it she picked it up and swallowed it.  Needless to say, I brought her to the hospital (along with the broken toy) the doctors discovered the other weight was lead, she ended up with lead poisening. Hopefully, the \\""weights\\"" on any type of these birds are not made with lead anymore."
1.0	My 5 year old son got this from his father who grew up on Thunder Cats. He loves it but is so frustrated within an hour he gave up. Every time he touches it something else falls off. While trying to put that piece back on something else will fall off. I think I will try to Super Glue the side leg / wheels back on to salvage the toy. They really just went VERY cheap on this thing. Looks cool but its just a flimsy piece of junk :(
1.0	"First I like to say that I am not frustrated with Amazon or Insect Lore company.  My daughter received the Butterfly Garden for her birthday after doing a project at school and she wanted this as her only birthday present.  She was so excited to receive and I thought it would be something fun to do as school was letting out for the Summer. Plus, it would still keep her interested in something educational.  At first my daughter was a little disappointed as she thought the caterpillars came with the garden, so I had to explain that we needed to order them and it would take a couple weeks for them to arrive.  So I ordered the live larvae on May 15th, using the certificate that came in the box with the garden.  The certificate mentioned that it would take 2 to 3 weeks for the order to come in.  After 3 weeks and my daugther asking me when will they get here, I emailed the customer service email that appeared on the certicate but after a couple of days, I had no response so I decided to use the email address which showed up on my paypal transaction.  I received a response the next day saying how sorry they were and how they \\""had a short delay with new hatches but now getting caught up and have scheduled the order to ship the week of 6/18/12.\\"" They mentioned they would send me a shipment notification when shipped.  So I waited and waited until June 25th when I contacted them again since I was concerned that I was going on vacation and the caterpillars would come in but no one would be there to receive.  Since finding out my order still wasn't ready to be sent out, I asked the company to hold up sending my order until I came back from vacation.  I received a shipment notification on July 10th, which was after my vacation.  So I waited again until July 18th and said that I still haven't received my order.  I received no response from the company.  I emailed them again stating that if I didn't receive my order within the next day or two that I was going to dispute the charge through my credit card company.  Still no response.  Then I finally received the caterpillars and my daughter was so excited that they finally arrived.  A small carton (3 inch cup) came in with a lid and what looked to be lumpy sand, but thought it's larvae so we really won't see anything right away.  The instructions that came with the cup said that if you don't see anything moving, gently open the lid and blow lightly in the cup and you should see something move.  The only thing we saw was a little thing that looked like a piece of string, but no movement. So we waited again for days and everyday my daughter would peek at the cup to see nothing. I seriously doubt that anything will miraculously appear at this point.  So now I have a very nice net (garden) with nothing in it.  Great idea but so not worth the aggravation!  Wish I could rate this zero stars but the system won't allow anything less than one. I just can't imagine that I am the only one who had an issue with this compnay.  I would just hate to see anyone else's child be so disappointed like my daughter and that's the real reason why I am writing this review to avoid others from frustration and disappointment.through my credit card company.  Still no response.  Then I finally received the caterpillars and my daughter was so excited that they finally arrived.

1.0	Fell apart with first use. I had a very sad little princess.
1.0	from packaging to product its essentially dollar store quality. Luckily I was giving it to a 4 year old girl but it was so so so cheap looking.
1.0	very poor quality control...stitching coming apart, threads hanging, not as expected. Afraid they will fall apart with play. Very disappointing.
1.0	I bought this for my little sister and when we went to make slurpees the first time we ended up with really cold juice. Figuring i messed something up because i read the extremely confusing instructions too fast we tried again. This time after cranking the toy for about 10 minutes we ended up with some more really cold juice with some frozen ice particles. So we tried again with some different juice. The result was just more extremely cold juice. This was a disappointing birthday present and I had to return it and find something else for the little one's birthday.<br />Do not buy this. Don't even buy it at a garage sale, or the good will. Dont even take it from someone as a hand me down. make someone pay you to take it off their hands!<br />What a sad disappointment on such a fun 4th birthday! Cant wait to get a Zoku shipped later this week! And for a lower price! Jeesh!

1.0	"I say don't buy this trike!  Oh yes, my daughter got one for Christmas and absolutely adores it, however, the tires are made of plastic and the tire split right down the middle!!!  She has used it for less than 2 years.  Then in order to replace the \\""part\\"" I have to pay $15.00 plus shipping so it turns out to be more than $25.00 just to replace a tire!  I am going to call to complain to the company but meanwhile buyers beware.  Until they change that front tire (that takes all the pressure) to rubber, don't buy!!!  :)"
1.0	The products were all defected. I was shocked when the person receiving the gift only got to enjoy the toys on Christmas day and then each product had a defect. Total disappointment.
1.0	My daughter receive this as a gift for Christmas and I finally set it up which took about a day, turned it on for the first time and it worked great for about a minute and then turned itself off and i turned it back on and it stayed on for about a minute and then it turned itself off again, can't seem to get it to work for more than a minute or two at a time, needless to say my daughter is very disappointed. I'm just glad I didn't spend any of my money on it, and I would recommend saving yours.
1.0	My children were excited when I told them I found this on sale and bought some. It seems like a cool idea. But in exchange for the 30 minutes of fun I spent over an HOUR cleaning it up. The dissolving solution did not work. The recommendation to add additional salt (what the dissolving mix was) did not work. I added over 2 cups of salt to no avail. My tub was clogged and I had to manually scoop out most of it. It is ridiculous. Wish I had read the reviews before I bought it; my family will NOT be using this product ever again.
1.0	I can't believe I paid for this item. This is a common Japanese beetle. My five-year-old knows the difference. Gyped.
1.0	"My son was so excited that Santa brought him the Shell Shocker toy ... he had been waiting for months.  We went across to the park and the toy hit a bump and now the fins won't come out.  So much for \\""all terrain\\"".  Problem is that we don't even qualify for the 90 day warranty period as we are in Australia and the warranty only applies to those in US.  For the money \\""Santa\\"" paid .... I really thought we would get more than 10 minutes of enjoyment out of it."
1.0	very disappointed!  I waited for a long period of time to get it.  It didn't work as it described.  No sound and not flying at all.....  terrible product.
1.0	I purchased this expecting that it was the gray one in the main photo.  The one I received was almost black looking, the front looks a bit different and it is not the same game that I had back in the day.  The music, sounds and graphics are also different.  Without it being what I expected makes this useless to me and a total waste of money.  This is a faults advertisement not to receive the item  pictured.
1.0	The picture is misleading -the item for sale is a braided headband and not the doll
1.0	This is HORRIBLE!!!! I ordered this, expecting a backpack. Of course, had I Read closer etc etc.. i would have seen it was junk. I am very disappointed, but hopefully the little girl I bought it for will like it. I can't believe how small this is! I wouldn't buy this if your looking for quality either.
1.0	Item had embroidered words (from the island it was purchase) which were not indicated in the picture or ad. Had to be removed by hand. Seller only offered apology.
1.0	Product is not the one pictured. The item number RMY9406 is on the UPC of the item I received, but this is a sheet of superman peel & stick decals. It is not the superman wrap.
1.0	Did not appear to be just various sized rolls of tape on order page.<br />Thought I was purchasing a &#34;how-to&#34; kit.<br />Very disappointed!! Could have purchased the tape from $5 Below or Michael's craft Store for less than half the price and also saved on outrageous delivery fees!!
1.0	If you are looking for a bottomless pit to throw money into, then this is the house for you!  Do not be fooled by the box!  The Luxury Townhome contains ONLY the house:  no furniture, no dolls, no wallpaper.  And each little piece of furniture will set you back $10.  It is a nice little house -- but not worth the money.
1.0	One of the slats was broken, the package and the wagon smelled so bad that it lingered in my house for 5 days until we boxed it back up to return it. Sorry but this does not live up to the Radio Flyer quality that I had grown up with.
1.0	I had heard wonderful things about the peaceful planet so when I looked for one this was what I found.  It barely interests my baby who might glace at it.  The music lasts such a short period and if you want lights and bubbles the pump is so loud it drowns out the music or water sounds.  The lights are very dim and the fish barely move.  I would not recommend this product at all.  If you have any interest try to get a chance to see it working in person first.
1.0	This is toy ADHD in the making. Press one button and every single part of the toy lights up and plays music. It doesn't even function that well as a walker either.
1.0	How disappointing to have the numbers fall off the thing with the first turn, worse than cheap. I didn't expect a lifetime warranty, but seriously, the first turn.
1.0	When I got this product it didnt work and Its crazy hard to learn. It broke the same day. Its not worth it at all.
1.0	I was so disappointed that the instructions are only in Japanese.  I guess I should have read description better.  It does say that.  I hope my grandson will like them anyway.
1.0	very cheaply made. only worked for a short time. do not waste your money
1.0	You do NOT get one Free.
1.0	Hard to transform for my daughter.
1.0	sent back to seller. too small and smelled very strong
1.0	This thing is about the size and quality of something you'd get out of a 25cent claw machine. Was embarassed to give it as a gift.
1.0	I bought 3 planes for my boys.  All three broke instantly. Two broke putting the planes together.  Not happy boys.
1.0	Very sad that when we opened these to use for the party only maybe 20 or so worked. Major waste of money.
1.0	Horrible. We inflated it with a compressor and it held air for a few hours then partially deflated after the first use!! My child was 13 months so its not like he's rough on it. We ended up finding five holes in it and there's no way we put those holes in it after one use. Very disappointing.
1.0	The quality is horrendous on this item.  Paint peels off, chips off even as you take it out of it's package.  Very unsafe for kids!
1.0	Not real happy although for the price it is ok just be super careful with hanging it is very thin and can tear
1.0	Piece of junk. I received what looked like a once returned product, contents scattered everywhere in the box, and IT DOES NOT FLY! Do not buy this, you are wasting your money. Very disappointed.
1.0	We bought the same company powder at the time we bought our carrom board it was good we had a very good impression and expecting the same we ordered this, but this is not at all good. Its equal to some kind of a white soft sand , which makes irritating noise when the striker slides on .
1.0	The concept of this is great but... this the second one of these we've had and neither of them have continued to operate.  The rotation either didn't work from the start of quit shortly after the first use.  The image is great and again the stars look good but for the price this is a terrible design.
1.0	I bought this heli to use as a moderately inexpensive transition from the double rotor indoor helicopters to a more expensive model single rotor model. After reading the reviews about how well-built this copter is, I felt relatively comfortable in buying the product.  Upon inspection, it does seem to be well built.  But that couldn't be further from the truth, in my experience.    Each time I tried to fly this helicopter, I had issues with the helicopter's response to my controller input.  Even after adjusting the trim settings, the helicopter did not want to fly in a forward direction.  So, during my first five minute attempt at flying the 9104, I had a couple of minor crashes into the side of a house.  To be fair, they were crashes but, by no means, were they hard full speed crashes.  This resulted in a broken rotor blade and a broken strut to the tail boom.  One the second attempt at flying this helicopter, again with control issues, a minor crash into a house resulted in a broken tail boom.  On the third attempt at flying the copter, this time in a more open area, I ended up with a broken landing skid.  Finally, on my last attempt to fly this bird, again not being able to fully control it's flight (particularly in the forward direction), the helicopter began drifting toward a street, so I quickly landed it.  At that point, smoke began to roll from beneath the canopy, emanating from the electronic control board.  A quite thick, acrid smoke, I might add.  It was really quite impressive.  Having just returned from that catastrophe, my clothes are still permeated with that very intense smell. My point is, four flights, broken helicopter every time.  I might point out, also, that each time I had to send for parts, the parts came from China; which meant waiting each time for at least 10 to 14 days.  This translates to: fly helicopter five minutes (or try to), wait two weeks, try to fly helicopter again, wait two weeks, etc.    I must say that this is the worst eightybucks I've ever spent.  In total, I might have had 10 minutes of flying time, most of which the helicopter did not respond properly.  Again, it did not want to fly in the forward direction.  And, as some of your other reviewers noted, you do not want to try to fly this helicopter in any wind whatsoever.  My only regret is that I cannot give this product less than one star.  I'm not going to spend one more dime repairing this helicopter or waste one more day waiting on parts.  This helicopter's last flight is going to be into the trash heap.  I'm going to spend the money to get a better one from Esky, TRex, or Walkera.
1.0	My parasol's handle fell off the first time trying to open it. The wooden shaft underneath it was cracked. The cloth used is so thin you can see the wood slats under it, the glue was over used and looked really bad. When fully open, the cloth was crooked and construction was sloppy and very unsightly. The top of the parasol has extra material that should be trimmed off. If you look at the picture of the parasol very closely you can see it. If the material left was even close to the amount pictured things would have been a little better. There was a huge amount on the parasol I received, it looked horrible. This extra material should have been trimmed, gathered, and the cap at the end put over it so the parasol had a finished look. The color sent, (white) is not one of the colors pictured. Overall I was super disappointed. Even the return policy was a disappointment. No replacement was offered (at this point that is probably a good thing) only returns.
1.0	I agree with many of the above reviews- although not an expensive toy - it's a waste.  It is impossible to cut the material into the detailed examples shown.  There is no instructions on how to make the examples shown in the guide book- which was frustrating.  My daughter was really<br />Excited about this but we became extremely frustrated and gave up.
1.0	I purchased this for my daughter's birthday. The package we received came with the wrong robe--the Gryffindor crest was screened, not embroidered as described, and the wrong wand. The tie? Well it's cheap, but even cheaper than I had expected it to be. I would not buy from this seller again.
1.0	It's not really a boat, its half a boat that you stick to the wall. Very misleading and disappointing. I would not purchase again.
1.0	Could not get this kits to fly even in high wind.  After two attempts this kite found itself in the trash.
1.0	Do not buy this product!!!  You think you are receiving 3, but you only receive Donkey. It is not worth $35, I can buy more at a store for this price.  A complete waste of money
1.0	This gun broke within the first hour - not worth the money.  I do have to say that I returned the product and received a full refund to my account.
1.0	If I could give this 0 stars, I would. I happened to be at a party where this was played, and at one point in time I had in my hand &#34;ethnic cleansing&#34;, &#34;vehicular manslaughter&#34;, and &#34;a black woman&#34;. I'm wondering what question &#34;a black woman&#34; would be an answer to that *would not* be racist. Now I know, people will say the point of the game is to be offensive, and it is not for people who are easily offended.<br /><br />However, saying &#34;I'm not easily offended&#34; is a luxury, and a perfect example of white privilege. What a game like this enables people to do, is say racist and/or derogatory things or laugh when other people are saying them, in a &#34;socially acceptable&#34;, guilty-pleasure kind of way. But that does not change the reality of what you are saying, or what you are laughing at. Being &#34;ironically&#34; racist is still being racist.<br /><br />But I guess this game is what it says it is: A party game for horrible people.
1.0	This is the one thing my 4 year old asked Santa to bring him for Christmas. It was broken within 2 hours.
1.0	If you crash the helicopter hard enough, which is bound to happen at some point, one of the little silver tips on the stabilizer (the bar rotating above the blades) will come off. Once this gets lost the helicopter is useless. It would be nice if they includes an extra one or two in the bag with the extra wings and tail rotor. The helicopter is lots of fun until this happens.
1.0	These two fellows from the south seem nice enough but this film plays like an overly long rock video with lots of grip and grin shots followed by benign, but incredibly dull discussions about how cool New Zealand is. Yes, you guys had a great trip and enjoyed using a video camera, but that doesn't mean it makes for a compelling film. Maybe next time you should just enjoy your trip and leave the video camera at home.
1.0	I spent hours walking around the house one quiet morning trying to figure out what the high pitch sound was coming from. it was almost like a loud ringing in your ears that would not stop. I could not concentrate. It turns out my daughter had plugged this &#34;innotab&#34; into the outlet next to my laptop. as soon as I unplugged her innotab the high pitch mind controlling ring stopped.<br />my complaint about it is that with the technology of today, & every phone has it, it wouldn't have been much for them to add a rechargeable battery via usb so that I do not break the bank with disposable batteries.....really? DISPOSABLE batteries? there is no reason every small electronic device couldn't have a usb recharge option just as cell phones do.<br />so it comes down to two options.<br />1. blow money on batteries or<br />2. use the short corded high pitched ringing drive you nuts AC adapter.... the choice is yours
1.0	I received the tablecover, and everything looked good...When I open the tablecover there was a hole! a huge hole in one corner of the cover. Just to check, I open the other package hoping this was just one mistake. But the same thing happen! There was another huge hole.<br />From now on I will try to never buy from this store again.
1.0	I pulled the tab out of the back with the message that says &#34;When you press Abigails ear... You wont hear this recording again after you remove the tab out of the battery compartment.&#34; I pulled the tab and it keeps saying the same thing over and over again. My mother bought the toy for my daughter so no receipt and of course I'm stuck with it now. Don't waste your money. Buy the Scout toy instead.
1.0	Im on my third one of these they are all junk dont waste your money  company really dropped the ball on this one, after buying the drum, I was buying all of this companies toys for my daughter this product put a screeching halt to that , blessing in disguise there are so many better companies out there check them out  I feel like this company continued to stock these long after they were aware of the problem which meant they didnt mind you waste your time and money which means they dont mind stealing from your child not to mention making them upset and frustrated when they cant play with it, they dont mind wasting your gas when you have to make a special trip to replace it, I will never buy from parents or battat again they dont care about my child and theyve made that clearly buy keeping this lemon in the marketplace
1.0	Says &#34;3 assorted styles&#34; and yet its only one puzzle...
1.0	We attempted to purchase 2 bonzai slides.  Neither had inflatable padding at the bottom of the slide.  These are a saftey hazard - our children cried and were hurt going down the slide.  We returned them both.  Terrible.
1.0	They are to expensive for the quality. I know it says it on the description but 3 of them won't move the legs; they don't even have legs, they look weird.
1.0	this was not the one that I actually ordered and it said it was supposed to be a lot bigger than what it actually turned out to be. you can barely see the men theyre soo tiny
1.0	I ordered this product just because amazon prime garanteed me 100% that it will come on Thursday knowing that I need it on Friday morning for my sons school. This isn't the first time this has happened but the times it did it wasn't really important, however this time it was. Then they started saying that it's the USPS fault. I don't care whose fault it is, if you promise something you have to accomplish it. I'm very disappointed in the service and I don't trust you anymore.
1.0	Low quality product.  My 5 year old could not even wear gloves because fingers were too tiny.
1.0	Wow if only I knew this before purchasing! My 3 year old grand daughter is heartbroken it no longer works and we tried new batteries twice just to make sure...and nothing!  This is just awful!
1.0	Did drive well BUT in about 30min my grandson brought it to me with a broken tie rod. Cheap plastic construcion. Guess for the money I expected more................................. Don't waste your money!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1.0	My 10 year old was so excited Christmas morning when she opened this Furby. However it worked for about 4 hours and quit, what a waste of 80 bucks and I cant get any response for a replacement, and no its not the F*****in batteries. You broke my daughters heart on Christmas day you second rate pile of crap for a company. Too bad there isn't a negative rating available or I would give you -5 stars. Your crooks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1.0	I got this for my daughter did not think it was worth the money it is just used for looks. I thought it was much larger than it really was.
1.0	A man must have measured this thing. It's only 6&#34;.  And only a man can turn 6&#34; into 10&#34;.
1.0	This is the only part that my son keep breaking. This was the last pair I purchased which only last a couple of days. I decided to spend more money and buy an update after market part from RPM. The RPM are more robust and after a couple of months they are still fine.
1.0	"I loved playing with this but it is not durable. After solving 2 \\""puzzles\\"" it became hard to twist the orb, then it just broke apart."
1.0	I'm now in possession of the 2nd of these toys, and I have to say i'm VERY disappointed. My 2 year old son opened the 1st one on XMAS morning, only to have it stop working entirely (despite changing the batteries) about 10 minutes after he opened it.  So, we had to return/exchange it for a 2nd one and now the 2nd one has STOPPED WORKING completely as well - after only 3 uses.  There's gotta be some faulty wiring or a design flaw, as we haven't had any issues with the Black & Decker Chainsaw or Leaf Blower - but the Weed Trimmer is FAULTY!  Not a happy camper, and neither is my poor son :(
1.0	If I could give it no stars I would, too small for my 3 year old daughter's head?! Are you kidding me, quality is awful, this wig is ugly.
1.0	it was very weak and flimsy had to return, not good quality
1.0	Pic looks a lot better than the actial outfit! Im going to ask for a refund!! Its a rip off! Shame you ruined a 4 yo boy birthday surprise!
1.0	I bought this camera for my son last christmas (he was 3).  He loved carrying it around and taking pictures of everything.  The picture quality is absolutely horrible and while I get that it is a toy, it isn't so cheap that the pictures couldn't be decent. I could overlook that fact since my son enjoyed the toy but it stopped working several months ago.  It will turn on and you can see images in the viewfinder but none of the other buttons work any more even after making sure there was a fresh set of batteries.  It definitely does not have the durability that it claims!!
1.0	I ordered from this guy and all I got was the other thing i ordered and not this I even emailed them about this and he did nothing about it.
1.0	Not everything would fit. Gave it to my sister. I wouldn't buy another one again this slim. Sorry to have wasted my money
1.0	We got the snake and put the batteries in (correctly) and the little red light came on but no movement happened with the remote control.  It didn't work at all and we ended up with a crying kid.  Thanks a lot.
1.0	The first time I ordered these the package was destroyed! I still haven't been credited! It clearly states in the description that these are adult size but they are tiny an the package says they are for kids. Very frustrating.
1.0	Much smaller than I expected.  It's about the size of a beany-baby.  Very expensive for what it is.  Would not recommend it.
1.0	I didn't even get one bubble out of it, my son was so excited to see the light but that's about it...
1.0	Inferior product, first throw it broke making a mess on the wall. My grandson was very disappointed and upset after it broke.
1.0	"Note to Spinmaster: You need more than a 1/8\\"" deep octagonal hole, or the weak plastic part that is supposed to fit into this shallow depression will quickly fail to fit properly, leading to rounded corners and an icee machine that will never work correctly. <br /> <br />This piece of junk is design to work about once, maybe."
1.0	Helo over-rotated from the beginning.  I was never able to correct it per instructions.  While some reviews claim 5 minutes of fun, I never had one second of use.  Hopefully I can take back.  I have a feeling the Salvation Army is going to get flooded with donated RC helos.
1.0	This is similar to a sand timer. It's the size of my hand. Literally from the palm to the top of my middle finger. Its clear with pink on one side of the timer and blue on the other. Nothing like the picture. When u flip it over the colors move to the other end. It's just something to have for my son while he's in time out I guess. It didn't really interest him. I had something similar but way cooler when I was a kid. This is like a dollar store toy. Doesn't look as cool as the picture.
1.0	you get what you pay for.
1.0	This table and chairs are a disaster. The fall apart every minute. I had to super glue all of the legs to the chairs and table. It's too small for even a baby starting to sit. The chairs do not go all the way in and it is soo un sturdy that my girls always are falling out of the chairs.
1.0	Total piece of junk. I bought one and returned it because it didn't work and bought another one and the second one doesn't work either, unfortunately we tried to make it work too long and missed the window to return it.<br /><br />Don't buy it....it is an expensive paper weight.
1.0	Awful is the only word I can use to describe this toy. My grandson received a package of the Micro Drifters cars as a gift and he loved them, so I started looking around for something to go with them.<br />I loved the idea of (2) tracks in one - he's 4 and can get bored easily.<br />I have never been more disappointed in a toy in my life... I will never buy anything again without reading the reviews first.  All of them are accurate ... no directions, it doesn't stay together, track flips over by it's self... very frustrating for a 4 year old as well as me.  All I keep hearing is &#34;Mema can you fix it ... mema can you fix it again ... mema I don't know why it won't stay ... mema this piece fell off&#34;  I am ready for it to disappear, however it is still too new to him.<br />MATTEL should be ashamed of themselves, and Disney should step in and do something about this product carrying their name.
1.0	I changed the batteries 3 times, followed all the instructions, but the pillow does not light.  Then, the zipper broke off.  It's simply junk.
1.0	"This is the most awful toy you can imagine.  The nightmarish, Christmas eve assembly with an item that broke faster than we could put it together.  Cheap wood that split as soon as it came out of the box.  One whole leg shattered into three separate sections and we watched in disbelief as that little girl's Christmas surprise disintegrated before our eyes.<br /><br />This was the only \\""big\\"" gift we got our granddaughter for Christmas, and at midnight on Christmas eve, it was far too late to go to the store and buy something else.  With the help of duct tape and wood glue, we managed to patch this piece of junk enough for her to have a Christmas morning surprise, but the thing was trash by the end of January.  Of course the toy store would not return our calls and emails.  If we had bought it on Amazon, we could have sent it back. As it was, we were stuck.<br /><br />Now our little granddaughter is asking for another easel for Christmas this year.  If this one had been durable and good quality, she would still have an art easel, and we could buy her something else.  Terrible, terrible experience."
1.0	What a piece of JUNK! Save your money or grab one at walmart for $1.99 This one is a thin piece of crap and was broken in under one day by my little girl... NOT a value at $9...did i say JUNK?!?!
1.0	this item arrived today. First, it arrived damaged. Second, I can see why- it is extremely poor quality material. Very disappointed.
1.0	very poor quality. the tutu is damage. very sad
1.0	"Purchased as a Christmas gift. It came ready to go. Sewed perfectly until it was time to change the bobbin, which was absolutely impossible. 5 adults tried (I sew, my husband is mechanical, my mom is a professional seamstress). I took it to our local Singer store and they could not figure out how to get the bobbin out. They finally pryed it open with a butter knife! It is a lovely little machine with a cute pink foot pedal. My mom actually chose this because she is an expert seamstress and thought it would be a good little starter for her grand daughter. It is light weight, portable and has similar working to an adult machine. What a bummer, it was returned promptly but I had to pay shipping both ways. Possibly we just got a defective machine, but I would highly recommend actually changing the bobbin on this and testing every function before you buy. We are now researching an inexpensive adult machine because all other kids machines did not pass the \\""grandmom test\\""."
1.0	After reading all the positive reviews I bought this for my daughters second birthday.  I guess I just don't get it.  It is like having a giant bowl cluttering up your house.  It has been a few months and I can honestly say she has never played with it.  I wish I didn't spend the money.
1.0	My daughter wanted a barbie dollhouse for Christmas. So when I found this dollhouse on here for $50, I thought I hit the jackpot. Christmas day, we open the box..and holy crap the entire thing needed to be put together. The 210 peice dollhouse, was 210 pieces of plastic peices and parts that you had to put together. NOT 8 rooms of furniture and dishes and chairs and little beds, ect..like it advertised. Well, after we got it put together and we tried to put it out of the way, THE DAMN THING FELL APART!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I was heated beyond words!! Whatever you do moms or dads who are looking to buy your daughter a dollhouse, DONT BUY THIS ONE!! GO BUY A LITTLE BIT MORE EXPENSIVE ONE! They say you get what you pay for..and this one wasnt worth the $50.
1.0	This is terrible. I bought it in No ember as a gift for my son and now it's too late to return it. It's junk and doesn't work.
1.0	This set should really be for older kids and collectors.  I purchased this for my 3 year olds birthday based on other reviews -Big Mistake.  I also thought that becuase the accessories were realistic and colorful, it would capture my 3 year old interest better than the wooden sets.<BR>  The accessories for the rooms are really small (think of the smallest Barbie accessories-ie perfume bottles) that YOU have to put stickers on.  I don't think any 3-4 year old has the dexterity to manipulate them. So I just put most of them away so we don't lose them.  Some of them also have stickers on the back for permanent placement, which for a 3 year old is not a plus.<BR> I also found it difficult to fit the furniture sets in the smaller rooms.  I still haven't found a room that holds all of the bathroom furniture. <BR>  My daughter does like the critters themselves and the nursery/bedroom/living room sets.  However she plays with this toy maybe once a month.  Better to invest in one of the wooden doll houses ( she always plays with them in the stores).
1.0	It is the exact size I wanted for traveling.
1.0	Received this yesterday,  very tightly rolled.  I layed out the sheets and weighted each end to keep it flat.  This morning the sheets were laying flat on their own, so I felt comfortable going ahead and putting them up.  It looked great for the first 20 minutes.  Then it all started peeling off the wall.  My daughter was so disappointed.  She has other wall decals that stay on her wall just fine.  The adhesive and vinyl quality on these just aren't very good.  But,  I guess I should have known that a wall sticker this size for $10 couldn't possibly be good quality.
1.0	The dogbones keep piping out, lost one on the first run. I had to order the parts. Not a bad car for a new driver( like a kid).
1.0	This runs small and the material is a VERY poor quality.  Even putting it on the first time I had trouble not tearing it.
1.0	got it out of the case, filled it up and my 5 years old started to have fun with it, but only lasted 5 minutes, it wouldn;t work anymore. Worst quality toy ever. DO NOT BUY THIS TOY.
1.0	"I bought this for my 5-year old for Christmas, and waited until spring to order our ants.  It took about 5 weeks or so to receive the ants, which was frustrating- but WOULD have been worth it had the ants had behaved as they claimed they would.  I, too, received about 25 ants- 8 were D.O.A.  That was a bummer since you alledgedly need a group of about 25 to live in the colony.  We weren't discouraged at that point, and followed all of the instructions to a T- INCLUDING not moving/touching the habitat, so that the ants wouldn't \\""feel\\"" harrassed!  The most disappointing part- even though the ants lived from 1-3 months (which isn't even that great), they NEVER EVEN TRIED AT ALL to tunnel on their own.  They lived miserably on top of the gel, playing with the dead ones and eventually piling them in a corner which became a grisly moldy scene."
1.0	all the props where out of balance. still broke at the hub, and out off three packs of props i never got off the ground. total wast of $26.00.
1.0	The Numbers are extremely hard to read when you push down. Great concept to help kids learn, but Would not recommend.
1.0	The magnets are so weak that you cannot put the knights down. Don't buy this your child will be very disappointed.
1.0	Had to send it back twice due to crooked engraving. The third one was crooked as well and the ballerina hangs up and stops spinning. Sad as it was a promising gift.
1.0	We got this scooter for our 4 year old daughter for her birthday.  No matter what she does with the scooter, the wheels will always turn and go right.  Every ten pushes she has to stop, pick up the scooter and start over.  Even when you try to manually straighten the wheels it starts going to the right within a few pushes.  We are now having to look for a new scooter for her and we have only been using this one for a month.
1.0	this plane looks nice on the web page but not in real life also it did not work had to return it  dont purchase this
1.0	solitaire hand held electronic arcade game<br /><br />I hate it.  the other one i had for 10 years and the buttons stopped working is still better.  this is smaller and really bad.
1.0	Junk didn't have any effect on the appearance of my eyes
1.0	Worst stuffed animal ever. Would've been better off getting one at the dollar store. Also, I paid $29 and only got $16 when returning it?!?!<br /><br />Awful!
1.0	Complete junk!  Didnt fit and was broke during shipment. Took about 4 weeks to get.
1.0	Worst hand buzzer i ever bought when i got and used it it never shocked anything or someone dont buy
1.0	Some of the items seem to have no purpose.  And Lego gave themselves credit for a ton of little &#34;hair accessories&#34; counting them as though they are building blocks.<br /><br />And they don't even coordinate with the doll clothing.<br /><br />I'm very disappointed.  This was a first Friends purchase and I don't think I will be buying more.
1.0	The description says &#34;Barbie size&#34;. These lamps are no where near Barbie size (too large). Buyer beware.
1.0	This broke in less than a minute, it is paper and the drum sticks went right through it on the first use. In addition the paper edges once splintered were very sharp and seemed dangerous! If I could give it less than one star I would!!
1.0	The cookies cutter come so late ...not good.<br />Disappointed.
1.0	Item was sold as New, recieved used and not working. Also had 25 dollar price tags on it from WalMart and I was charged 4 times that amount.
1.0	This ring did not work as soon as I got it out of the box. It was a waste to purchase because I needed it for a party and will not have in time if I sent it back. Should've listened to the reviews.
1.0	Paid for the TMX Tickle Me Elmo and got the wrong item.  Returned it and never heard back from the seller.  NOT HAPPY!  I want a refund!
1.0	Read the other reviews...sounded like item would be somewhat entertaining....for me it wasn't.  Wish I had not ordered it.  Guess you never know.  Didn't expect much, can say I wasn't disappointed.
1.0	"[[ASIN:B004JFMOGK Maisto Fresh Metal Tailwinds 1:97 Scale Die Cast United States Military Aircraft - US Air Force Medium Altitude, Long Endurance, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) RQ-1 Predator with Display Stand (Dimension: 6\\"" x 3-1/2\\"" x 1\\"")]]<br /><br />Every American child should own one of these. It's the perfect way for them to learn to murder unsuspecting human beings. We all know how fun it is to kill people with military drones. Maybe the Government could find a way to hide a fee in one of our bills (tax on our phones for the Obamaphone), so that every American child could own one of these. I highly recommend this toy for all psychopathic parents that want to teach their children how to murder human beings with a drone. It is never too early to start teaching them!"
1.0	cant put the pieces in there they will fall and go missing
1.0	i only ordered this for the relaxing colours shown in the picture but unfortunately received this dirty green and pink which do not mesh well together nor complement each other...such a disppoinment after being so excited to receive!
1.0	If you're wondering why I only gave it the one star, here's my reasoning:<br />I saw this and got extremely excited. I was hoping that I was actually going to get UNICORN Twilight Sparkle, as shown in the picture. What I got in the mail today though, was ALICORN PRINCESS Twilight Sparkle. I was gleefully looking forward to having the entire collection completed, since, the only on I have been missing was UNICORN Twilight Sparkle, I was extremely disappointed when I opened up the package and found myself with another ALICORN PRINCESS Twilight Sparkle.
1.0	The first one came broken - the dollar feeder would not accept bills. After they sent us a new one, the feeder broke after a month - any time a bill was entered it would reset the entire machine: date, time, amount in the bank, password, user name, etc. And, by then, the latch no longer worked so it wouldn't let us take any of the money out. What a shame. A great idea, poorly executed.
1.0	its ok - not great - i gave it a 1x b/c we are usually very happy with science explorer kits
1.0	This is nothing like I thought it would be especially for the price I paid. It's not worth it.
1.0	The is really low quality, it did not last even few hours
1.0	A waste of money the piano keys do not make noise all the places on the mat that make noise are misplaced its stupid
1.0	The keys do not work well, they require much much pressure to activate, and way too much pressure for a child. Even when you exert a lot of pressure, the some of the keys only work if you press on the edge. Could be a good product, but the membrane keypad makes it unusable for a kid.
1.0	Purchased in July 2014, kids love it, it's big and fast. But the hollow plastic wheels only last about 6 months then they split in half. Riding on concrete wheels only last 3 months. It's now May 2015 and I have replaced 7 wheels buyers beware.
1.0	Do NOT buy these - waste of money.  In the two packs we purchased, only 2 or 3 actually worked.  And the ones that did work, were barely visible at my daughter's blackout party.  We have no issue with the seller - shipping was expedient - but the product was simply inferior.
1.0	These were great idea and I am not sure if it's just the sparkle ones but they break  every time my kids play with them and that makes them a total waste of money! They do like them and can create cool things but are so disappointed when the ends crack or just fling off when trying to put them together. It's plastic so I am not sure why I expected them to last so they got them at Christmas and now they are garbage. P.S. my girls are not hard on toys.
1.0	All of the pieces come of easily with normal play- the arm with the plane, the microphone, and the slide.<br /><br />Figures get stuck where they arent supposed to and fall off where they should stay!<br /><br />When the microphone is pushed only half the trap door opens.<br /><br />With the &#34;toodles&#34; door opened the figures do not come through on their own when the trap door is pushed.<br /><br />Figures get stuck in the mouses head and you must pull them out through the Toodles door whether its opened or closed to get them on the slide.<br /><br />The figures fall out of the plane from the angle if you swing the arm around.
1.0	"I loved this game when I was a kid.  That is why I was so excited to buy this and play it with my daughter.  Where did this game end up?  In the trash.  The plastic \\""marbles\\"" are worthless, did not roll correctly and the heads of the hippos fell off constantly.  The whole thing was cheaply made.  Unfortunately I do not have the one I grew up with.  I agree with many of the other reviews.  Save your money on this one.  If you can find an original (not cheap plastic and plastic marbles) go for it."
1.0	I bought this guitar as a gift for my son.  While it looks nice for a toy guitar, the strings are absolutely terrible.  They won't remain tightened, so soon as you twist to tighten them they immediately become loose once again.  This means 90 percent of the time when the child picks up the guitar the strings are too loose to make a noise.  Wish I'd never bought this one. It causes more frustration than fun.
1.0	I expected a better quality stuffed animal.  It felt like one I would get from a claw machine. No worth the money!!
1.0	Note - we ordered this BOYS version of the puzzles, but received a 4 pack GIRLS (princesses) version instead.
1.0	After opening this gift on Christmas Day and setting it up according to the directions, we were very disappointed when the toy did not work!  We had brand new batteries and checked them for correct placement at least 3 times!  The remote control never worked.  The train was also supposed to let off &#34;steam&#34; but we could never get anything to work correctly.  We would like to return this product; however, we are not sure that we can because to get the product out of its box, we totally tore up the box.  I don't know what I'm going to do yet, but the bottom line is it did not work and we are going to have to try to find one that does work.  I was very dissatisfied.
1.0	ISN'T THE SAME HAT IN THE PICTURE.  I GOT A DIFFERENT HAT.  My hat was purple not black and didn't have the purple pretty feathers.  See my picture I attached. Isn't not about the size that I'm reviewing about, that is the only selections I had to choose from.  It wouldn't stay on at all.  No strap to go around neck so it kept falling off.  Plus by it being shipped it was all bent over and wrinkled.  Thank goodness I bought a back up so we only used this had for the silly bunco hat for our bunco party.  You had to hold it to take a picture. Price was cheap but it reflected that.
1.0	Meat Balls did not turn out well and the noodles. The kids were disappointed how it turned out
1.0	My beautiful daughter bounced when she got this toy - so excited.  Then tears and tantrums as we struggled to assemble it without glue (in my opinion a crucial tool).  Actually, the only tools you need are:  the patience of Job, the vocabulary of a sailor, your psychiatrist's phone number on speed dial, or a tank of wine to consume after pouring your attention into the assembly of this toy.  Hasbro, seriously?  If you had paid me to put this toy together and then give it to me, I would have given you your money back.  HIghlight, I am an average to generously patient person and I have enjoyed my daughter's fascination and love of all things My Little Pony.  I am too tired to make this any more fun that it already has been in designing this review.  If a rep from Hasbro would like to contact me to become a toy reviewer at a compensatory salaried rate, I would consider it (150-200K per year).  Your welcome!
1.0	Although the item arrived quickly the plastic that the figure is in is so scratched up is not worth anything. Actually arrived dusty and a corner of the plastic is cracked. Very disappointed... The figure seems OK, but with the outer plastic in the condition it is in it's not worth nearly what I paid for it
1.0	"This toy took \\""Santa\\""  hours to put together and it was falling apart within a 24hr. period.  We ended up throwing it away."
1.0	the entire crew at Big Bang Theory couldn't put this together...let alone a 15-year-old. I've assembled hundreds of toys, games, tools etc and the spacerail is the worst ever. the english translation from chinese would be comical if it wasn't so frustrating. it is shoddily constructed and takes far too much energy for what it is. the best part was burning it in the driveway.
1.0	i got this for a Christmas present for my kid, it worked 20 minutes ........ and it hasn't worked since.
1.0	Nice idea and cute, but every time my kids would touch it or try to move it it would come apart.
1.0	This was a cute idea that I thought would have been lots of fun at a game party I have every year with 12-16 ladies.  The grannies were hilarious, but it was so cheaply  made- that it was impossible to get one of the cars even halfway around the track, the other one went very slowly moving about 2 inches in a halting manner and managed to get partway around the track.<br />I only rated it one star on each question because it would not accept the review with all blank stars which is what it really deserved.<br />SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!
1.0	Difficult for adult let alone toddler. Leg broke off in a week.
1.0	dogs tore it up in a second
1.0	Received it as as used item....
1.0	the item was not specified as TINY MAHJONG SET ..... when I got the item ... IM surprised with this item ..
1.0	The product inside is not at all like the picture on the packaging. Different pattern (cheap) and completely different design (not garter pantyhose/stockings). This is egregious.
1.0	Made of plastic is very bad
1.0	I purchased this item thinking it would be fun,but every time my little one played with it,it would turn over and knock the food out leaving them upset.The cash register would be a blast.The food we just added to their kitchen set .
1.0	This toy is way too difficult to put together.  Once you've managed to get it it falls apart.  The back of the elevator constantly fell off and the air pump quit working after 5 minutes of play.  The only thing that works now is the searchlight.  This is after only about 10 minutes of play by a 3 year old!
1.0	I don` t know bakugan but my son does. This was the wrong item, missing a card, not new, opened and stapled shut. Very disappointed doesn't begin to describe how he feels.
1.0	"I have an 11 year old who loves things that are \\""epic\\"", and enjoys things like Animal Crossing City Folk, and different epic type Lego sets. I thought this would be right up her alley, but I honestly don't \\""get\\"" the game. I tried it with my 13 year old; we spent hours arranging cards, reading directions, and trying to play. It was SO frustrating, and not fun for us at all. I wanted to like it. I wanted my kids to like it, but it just wasn't meant to be.<br /><br />If you play other, similar games, this might be perfect for you. If you're like us, and don't play other games like this, I'd suggest starting with something a bit simpler. Like Go Fish. *lol* We did spend a lot of time trying to figure it out, and it may be us, but we just never really \\""got it\\""."
1.0	"The wide colored plastic rings that give the cart it's look of having \\""tires\\"" snap onto the interior axel wheel in a sloppy and loose manner.  These fall off the cart right away and will not stay on.  Sorry construction.[[ASIN:B002EQ9V1M Little Tikes Shopping Cart - Pink]]"
1.0	The grandchildren have only played with this toy only a few time.  This is due to the batteries running down in about 15 minutes.  It becomes very expensive when replacing the batteries every 15 minutes or so.  Seriously!  Even with new batteries, the red car cannot keep up with the blue car.  Would not recommend.
1.0	poor craftsmanship, too filmsy
1.0	Very poor shipping , glow sticks were all out if the package and half were already activated . Not happy
1.0	I ordered this for my 3 year old grandson and it did not fit at all. It was way too small for his little head. It also seemed to be cheaply made and I have doubts it would stand up long to rugged use.
1.0	So mad right now I can't see straight!! Ordered this for my 13 yr old as a birthday gift, he is a big star wars fan as are his 2 brothers, so there was a lot of excitement in the house when the item arrived. Overall impression was not the greatest quality but never even got to see what it could do. One of the metal seats for the right side battery compartment screw was just turning freely in the plastic so the screw would not come out, preventing us from being able to put batteries in the damn thing, so it was a HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT for all involved.
1.0	This vehicle is poorly/cheaply made. The remote is flimsy. The car is heavy because of the large tire, but the plastic is very thin. We opened it on Christmas morning and it worked for less than 5 minutes. I've switched out the batteries 4 times. Nothing. Will be returning this. Also, it states that it needs two 9V batteries when it really needs 6 AA and one 9V.
1.0	This toy is defective. The screws that hold it together will not seat, therfore the front roller falls off. We want to return this for credit.
1.0	two of the boat sails were broken off.  tried to glue but did not hold.
1.0	These are my sons favorite toys, at the moment. He is 4 years old and I was happy because you can find great offers on the different mashers. He has almost all of them but unfortunately they break it is a recurrent problem and I am afraid the reason why these toys are affordable and almost always on sale. :( sad because otherwise the toys are great for imagination and motor skills development.
1.0	Item came in pretty bad condition. The color appeared dirty and the quality of the paper was poor.
1.0	When I got, which was slowly, it was marred and broken. I don't believe it was from shipping because the<br />Box was not damaged nor the plastic packaging. The item had damage scratches all over it. The eye<br />Piece fell off when I took it out and the plastic lens, which looked worn and had visible excess glue had<br />Fallen out also. That lens was scratched and wasnt very see thru. It was expandable and one of those<br />sections had a little piece of the lip of the plastic Broken off. It would have been nice if not so messed up but still over priced. I pushed the pieces back together and Gave it to my 6 year old grandson anyway.  He was ecstatic still for 30 seconds till it fell apart again. Then he was upset which broke my heart. I shouldn't have given it to him. It wasn't worth the shipping Cost to return it. Torus had had a great jake and the neverland pirates telescope I got<br />Him instead.
1.0	HORRIBLE dont bother its crap
1.0	"My active 4 1/2 year old managed to accidentally bend several of the tubes within a few hours of playing. Completely flimsy, this is going back to the store where I bought it on Monday. The tent-pole design is poor, better to get \\""pop up\\"" structures which do not fall apart when sat on."
1.0	Well I paid $13.00 item had a sticker on it, so that's one thing. Then it was a plastic jar, it just wasn't worth it at all.money counter doesn't go off unless u take batteries out
1.0	This doll house is cheaply made.  The pieces arrived damage inside the box; even though the box was not damaged.  Plastic retainer fastening system is terrible.  Elevator shaft does not align properly without major force being applied to different areas of the house simultaneously.  The side wall fastening tabs are also extremely cheap and flimsy.  I would not purchase this product again, I would not return this product in hopes that it is a fluke.  I would not recommend this to a friend, stranger, or enemy.
1.0	The Item does not seem at all as the one described, it is described (and pictured) as an original Disney product and is clearly a fake, I feel robbed, all the characters have paint stains of different colors and even the box is different. I demand a refund of this, you should be ashamed!!!
1.0	One of the motors burned out before the battery died in the very first flight. After a full charge there is now no power what so ever. Junk!
1.0	im pretty sure this is a fake card a very good fake though, ive been collecting pokemon cards for a while and this ones larger than all my other cards and the print is smaller, it just doesnt look right...
1.0	"If I could rate this a ZERO I would.  Santa brought this little item off for my 5 year old daughter.  I actually thought that it would be a nice craft item for our daughter.  1st - EXTREMELY NOISEY - my daughter wanted me to turn it off because it scared her - 2nd - my 5 year old could cut these cheap sheets (that come with the cutter)with her scissors faster and better.  I actually tried to cut out the little Hannah Montana pictures with this \\""pen\\"" and it looked TERRIBLE - if I could return it - I WOULD - DO NOT WASTE YOUR $$$"
1.0	Do not buy this product it's cheap! I could find a better one at the dollar store. Had it for one day broke and the seller wouldn't exchange it. Don't buy this
1.0	A tiny led light is the only function. NO moving parts, no cleverness in design. Boring. I wanted some moving parts as the Doctors actually has. this is a waste of money.
1.0	Dont buy this peace of crap. I got 200 really  crappy commons, rares, super rares and a crappy secret. You wont EVER get your money back with this. All this is probably the left over common and bad cards that no one wants. And plus alot of the cards were from the set EXVC, and they felt fake! Also I never even got a parallel rare card. When I felt the cards, they felt fake. Robot City Games, if I ever go to New York, I will not ever go there. People only buy product if it is Konami sealed so that way what ever you get will be legit :). In conclusion I wouldnt even give this a one star probably less than half of a star.  So dont buy from them EVER!!!
1.0	Had holes in it when it came out of the box and could not be used
1.0	"I admit, we ordered this in a hurry after my son spilled his bubble solution immediately after taking it out of his Christmas stocking and then dissolved into heartbreaking tears.  So maybe if you aren't shopping in a rush with a 4-year-old sobbing in you ear, you wouldn't be fooled by the first product photo.  I realize that they're showing the colors, but it is still misleading in my opinion to show a number of bottles when in reality you are only getting one.  Also, it says \\""assorted colors\\"" as though you are actually getting assorted colors.  It should say \\""color of bottle will vary\\"" or something like that.  We scrolled down to \\""product description\\"" to confirm the quantity, and it has 24 in parentheses.  It was ridiculous for us to think that we could get 24 bottles for such a low price, but honestly, we didn't look at how many ounces and assumed they were small bottles.  I'm not sure what that 24 refers to, but you have to look at \\""product features\\"" to see that there is only one bottle.  That's not a feature, that's a quantity, and it should be in the product description for crying out loud.  I've heard of amazon switching quantities on things that people have ordered before--I sure hope no one is creating misleading product pages in order to make a higher profit.  This is a pretty high price for one bottle of bubble solution."
1.0	The kitty meow'd when pressed and did nothing else, completely broken.
1.0	"I didn't read the description.  That's my fault.  I read \\""Push Broom.\\""  I know what a push broom is so I just ordered it.  Imagine my surprise when I got a toy!  I didn't want to pay to return it so I took the head off and replaced the short handle with a long one.  It works okay in small areas so I will use it.<br /><br />Educational value?  Really?  Guess so if your child is going to be a custodian some day.  This comment is a joke!  NOT  to be taken seriously.  I was a teacher for over 35 years and I still can't see any other educational value in it.  Fun?  Only if your child likes to sweep (also said jokingly). Durable?  It certainly seems to be well made.  Rating as a toy?  Hum, as a kid I DON'T think I would enjoy this as a toy.  But I might like it to be included in helping my mom.<br /><br />NB. I edited this after finding that my attempts at humor had offended people."
1.0	I've got two boys into RC and have been a TRAXXAS family.  Got the wraith for Xmas 2011.  Wow no comparison in quality.  My son broke the lower link in less than 30 minutes.  Transmitter was missing spring in battery compartment.  I have a TRAXXAS revo 1/16, a TRAXXAS stampede and a summit.  Each of them blows away the wraith in quality.
1.0	The unit is cheaply made and didn't hold my grandson's attention for very long.  We paid $100 for  it.  Toys-R-Us told our son in law that it had been $7 on Black Friday!  At $7 it would have been a good value.
1.0	2 words.. It's horriblr
1.0	stones tooo smalllllll
1.0	I have to say this is a very cheap toy. My 2 year only was throwing it and it broke with in 5 min of opening it.  Pretty bad when a 2 year old can enjoy it.
1.0	Seriously, get a grip!  Shame on you Amazon!  When I saw all the low reviews I decided to read them, the first stated something about price in which I never looked at as I knew I would purchase this if it was a bit over priced.  Then as I continued down the reviews I wanted to see what all the fuss was about.  Honestly, you are simply out of you A$$ greedy people.  It's not the fact that I can't afford to purchase this game, it's the point.  I will not support something so ridiculous.  You obviously are trying to capitalize on your 15 seconds of &#34;fb&#34; fame.  Good luck with that!  Hopefully you will learn but in the true minds of greedy folks, probably not!
1.0	Run away.....quickly.  Please. Don't even let your child/children see this and what would APPEAR to be a very cool toy.  It's not.  So much promise such a HUGE letdown.  I've read the reviews here and how I wish I would've heeded the advice.  They are spot on. These things get stuck ALL THE TIME...in the track, up a track climb, and with each other. Very aggravating.  Run away....quickly.
1.0	This toy stopped working after about 2 months. My son (6) loved it while it did work, so he was very upset when it broke.
1.0	I reviewed another item from this company, which resulted in the same waste of time and money. I will shorten my review here. NEVER, EVER buy anything from NKOK, for they not only make a toy which will immediately break upon completing setup of it, but will NEVER respond to any inquiry about replacing it. I sent them two emails about this toy and they have never responded to my inquiry.<br /><br />Please do not waste your time and hard-earned money on garbage. Go somewhere else, do your homework, and purchase a toy from a reputable company that will stand behind the product they make. NKOK does not care about you or your children. They only care about taking your money and giving you a piece of trash in return.<br /><br />Be warned!
1.0	PLEASE do not buy this pump.  Ours died after a couple of weeks of use.  And we did not even use it every day.  What was worse was the customer service at AquaLeisure, the company who makes Simpleset pools and pumps.  I think they only had one phone line, because it was busy every time I called.  I litterally called 50-100 times with my redial button over several days.  We ended up buying another brand of pump that is stronger, the Intex 1000, which has a much better rating.  Think twice before you buy Simpleset.  It's not worth the trouble.
1.0	Would probably be a great gift if I ever received it.  Of course I was charged for it, but it never came and was a pain to get fixed.
1.0	Too much big in the face. I return that
1.0	My 4 year old son played with this toy for about 10 minutes before the bag got a whole in the bottom and it started leaking.  The bag is not durable at all.  My son was not even being rough, just a few punches and all of a sudden the bottom ripped.  Don't waste your money.  The problem is I have yet to find a punching bag that is durable.
1.0	We've had different versions of rocket balloons and they've all worked pretty well, especially for the price.  These ones however, are pretty lousy.  Several of them had holes in them, so we couldn't even use them once.  A few others popped upon first use as I was initially blowing them up.  In the end, only a handful lasted more than 3 or 4 uses.  I didn't have high expectations given the price, but I would think that they should all last for several flights before they wear out.
1.0	I might have been interested in this version of Green Arrow over the Wave 9 released figure from 2009 if Mattel had made slight paint modifications and included a bow that did not have the arrow molded to the bow.      Seriously, why is the arrow molded to the bow... If there was a child safety law, why included 4 extra arrows?  The bow can't be displayed at his side and the bow looks silly allowing no freedom what so ever to display the bow how I see fit...     Mattel has graciously taken that freedom away from owners of this figure by displaying the arrow forever in one position with 4 extra arrows that can't be placed on the bow... and there is no quiver/backpack to store the extra bows.... But I like how Mattel thinks out of the box as many archers carry around their extra arrows willy-nilly... and have one arrow glued to their bow permanently...
1.0	I purchased these even after reading the poor reviews. I was thinking that for the price, you get what you pay for and I was willing to risk it for my daughter that isn't really swimming yet.  These cheap things broke BEFORE my daughter even had the chance to wear them. They're not even worth buying if you find them at the dollar store.  Don't waste your money.
1.0	Too dangerous to give to my six year old handicapped grandson.  He is fed with a G-tube.  I was very much afraid to give it to him for fear he could bite through one of the extending green arms to the Clackerz, so I did not give it to him at all.  It is still packaged up.  I had expected it to be made more sturdidly.  Sorry.  Cute idea; just not for him.
1.0	Didn't like it at all. Wouldn't stick to the skin. Had to do a last minute change of costume because of that.
1.0	Not for a 1/16 traxxas
1.0	The spoiler fell off as soon as I opened the box.
1.0	it wont work well goes to the side, one of the motors is not working
1.0	This is HUGE! It is very back heavy as the front is high. More important...It is BLACK. In the hot sun, the orca turns into a dangerous animal, scalding to the touch and completely unusable. It is very well made however!
1.0	These are not what I thought they were.  There are no pictures of what you are actually getting, which is a sheet of miniature body parts.  Some people might love that idea and want to create their own figures, but not me.  &#34;Some assembly&#34; to me means I have to attach the figure to the base, or the top half fits onto the bottom half with some sort of peg.  That is what I was expecting, and I would have been fine with that.  These arms and legs and heads and everything are perfectly smooth at the point where they're supposed to connect.  I am not a Swiss watchmaker with the skills and steady hands to piece all these together.  Each figure appears to be in about 6-8 pieces.  An inch tall, in 7 pieces.  Aint nobody got time fo dat!<br />I'm not sure if this kind of work is commonplace among hardcore tabletop gamers, but that's not me and it should state CLEARLY in its description &#34;FULL non-snap assembly required, glue not included, x-type of glue recommended.&#34;<br />I will agree with the other reviews that the quality of the sculpts seems good, but I doubt they would still look good after I get glue all over them.
1.0	This helicopter broke with in 10 minutes of me unboxing it and playing with it. And that is the last time I'm buying from drift king
1.0	These cars are junk . Do not buy if you are collecting the Mattel version. These are Not the actual diecast cars by mattel. They are smaller versions of those. not worth the $10.00 + shipping .
1.0	Very disappointing! It broke within an hour of using it !
1.0	I ordered this cheap expecting it to be bad it, was far worse than I imagined.
1.0	Wish I had read the other reviews first.<br />Misleading marketing.<br />This EXPANSION PACK needs the original game or you cannot play!
1.0	This thing was fun for about 15 minutes, but its really hard to control and only hovers really. You have to add tape or something to the front to make it go forward. I played with it when I got it then it sat on my dresser for 2 days and today i tried to use it and it wont charge or hold a charge! what a pile... I bought 2 more (one for my dad and one for my grandpa for xmas) and we'll see how those ones work out, but right now i am very disappointed.    Also, If youre buying more than one, you'll be better off buying them from a store because they sent me 2 of the same one, which means they cant fly at the same time (there are 3 channels that arent selectable like it claims... the remote is selectable but the helicopter is programmed with one channel, so 2 of the same wont work together. LAME!)
1.0	I ordered two packages & its still not big enough in circumference. We washed it in soap and water and it still has a toxic smell. It was a waste of money to be honest.
1.0	it was cute but,the air wouldnt they in it.
1.0	What I'm really upset about is that title reads &#34;High Quality Plush&#34; and only in a small font in the description does it read &#34;not HQ, DX, and could not change topic&#34;. I had pored over this page countless times, reading every single word and getting more and more excited for mine to arrive and I don't remember reading that at all before ordering. Was it newly added? Now I'm bleakly looking forward to my not-HQ Eevee to arrive to Sg. I'm just disappointed that more precautionary measures weren't taken to make sure that people won't make mistakes. Write it in caps lock or anything, I'm sure no one will mind! I'm still confused about one thing. The question asked about this was pertaining to whether it was DX or HQ, and someone had answered that his/her plush read &#34;High Quality Stuffed Toy&#34;. So what's this all about?
1.0	This was pretty fun when it worked. I flew it a while. But then I crashed it (into grass). One of propellers came off. I put another one on exactly how the directions said, and now it won't fly straight. I've tried everything. I won't even take off right. 1 star for this product.
1.0	"The provided picture can be a little misleading. This  runner is probably designed for the look or as a prop, not necessarily for durability or to be used as runner for a high traffic event. While the description is accurate , it is \\""fabric\\"" however, it is a very thin fabric comparable to a major brand paper towel. I was hosting a cocktail event and wanted to add that Hollywood touch, after my first rush of guest in heels, the runner was shredded. It doesn't photo graph very well, in many (if not all) of my photos, you can see  through the  runner -brick underneath the carpet.<br /><br />I would recommend this product as a prop that will be lightly used."
1.0	I spent $15 of my limited budget on these and they are so tiny you can't see them<br />Do not buy for decorative purposes!!!!
1.0	this toy falls apart repeatedly while trying to play with it.  Annoying and hard to find the pieces.  Not being able to find the pieces means you can't play with the dang thing.
1.0	was smaller than I was led to believe- fits my toddler perfectly.
1.0	Very misleading. You only get one of the pictured dispensers. Read the fine print.
1.0	This doll is about 4 inches tall. In the description it looks like an average size doll, about 10 inches or so. It's not. AMAZON was cool about the return which was great. Glad I did not buy from an individual seller.
1.0	"This is a review for the bands from the seller AuthorizedStores for 1800 Mixed Color Bands with c and s Clips<br /><br />We received these bands last week, and from the time I opened the package I could tell I did not get what I ordered.<br /><br />The biggest problem is that the colors were no where near what is in the picture! We received only white, pink, light pink, red, orange, red orange, blue and purple - which made for a VERY unhappy little boy!<br /><br />Since I was so dissatisfied with the colors, I went about the arduous task of counting the bands (you could tell there were not 1800 bands in the packages). In total there were 1457 bands, which is roughly only 81% of 1800!!!<br /><br />Also, there were no C clips in the package like the listing stated. There were plenty of S clips.<br /><br />The only redeeming quality is the bands seem to be good quality. We haven't had a break yet.<br /><br />If you don't want to buy from AuthorizedSellers, click on \\""New and Used\\"" which is under where you add this item to your cart. There you can see other sellers. You can click on New and only see New items, and even filter prime eligible items.<br /><br />Just beware of AuthorizedStores if you want what is described and good luck!"
1.0	Disappointed with the product.  The liquid in the pen that is supposed to fake blood was almost gone.  Also each pen has a sticker on it.  So I'm now left taking off each and every one.  First I tried peeling them off and the sticker ripped.  Then I soaked the sticker end in warm water, was able to remove the sticker paper but not the gooey sticky part.  So now I have to get goo off and remove the sticky part.  And all on pens that have only 1/4 of the fake blood in each pen.  What a let down.<br />Can I get a replacement or a refund please?<br />  On a good note...The pen itself seems to work well and the shipping was super fast.
1.0	Terrible!  Most figures wouldn't stay on the stands, about the same quality as plastic army men!
1.0	"I was really looking forward to going back 20 years but these games just don't do it.  They are not really like the old Atari games were and the joystick really makes it hard to play some games.  Maybe I was expecting too much, but even my wife said, \\""this is awful\\"".  Oh for the days of Burger Time!!"
1.0	"We purchased this for our friend's birthday and the kids were so excited to try it out.  Well, the excitement lasted for 5 whole minutes as we tried every way to get it to work.  The ink dripped everywhere and stained our fingers and skin after being on our skin for not even 15 seconds.  It states that it is \\""washable\\"" but I wouldn't describe paint that stains as washable!  As the other reviewers mentioned...don't waste your money!"
1.0	Yah, these are junk. I had to perform open chicken surgery after the first shot. Silly rubber band came unhooked and head flew off. It takes opening the poor guy's chest cavity to fix, then it wouldn't stay fixed. Fun noise, poopy toy. We got a frog and have had multiple monkeys that were all good, maybe gawd hates chickens?
1.0	Why didn't I listen to the reviews? My son was begging for this. He'd saved his own money and this is the brand he could afford. After reading the reviews I went ahead and purchased this brand for him. Sadly, within 3 hours it was broken. I hope to be able to send it back. So So frustrating.
1.0	If I could I would have given this negative stars...I bought two of these for my daughters I got them fast one was broken and didn't work from the moment we opened it so I filed a complaint and they sent me a replacement but before the replacement came the second one broke the button would no longer push in...just the cheapest POS they second one arrived and it worked for about a day and broke the same way just so frustrated don't waste your money one these! Such a shame too cause they're so cute I really wanted these to work and be nice for my kids, they never even got a chance to play with them
1.0	This toy is fun while it worked, I will say that.  However, after a few uses, it fell apart - the rear wheel falls off the axle because of a crack inside the metal part that holds it (apparently only by friction) onto the axle.  The wheel will not stay put now, it just comes off while the car is moving and the car stops dead in its tracks.  Any toy that was designed with stunt driving in mind (the instructions encourage doing stunts, tricks and flips) should be built tougher than this.  How do you explain to a kid that they can't play with their new toy that they just got because it already fell apart??
1.0	Not the cheap ones like you get in the stores. The kids have not broken them yet and they should have some good life to them.<br />Tubes are getting harder to find so these saved a lot of shopping time
1.0	My grandson letter L split in the curve of it before it was completely fill with air. I was soooo upset because they was going to be used for center pieces for his party tables. The letter J was perfect!
1.0	First, I ordered white. I was sent blue. We just used these last night and more than half of my order were duds. So, no I'm not too happy about this purchase.
1.0	Got this for my sons birthday that was on the 27th inflated it the night before for him to see when he got up but it was deflated. Will not stay inflated more then 2 hours.
1.0	It broke after 2 days. Very dissatisfied.
1.0	Yes it moves its beak, eyes, and feet, and will talk to you.  Just handle it like a Ming Vase and you cant go wrong.  If you actually treat it like a toy, it will break quickly and all you will have left is a fur ball that gathers dust.
1.0	Nice to see but super loudly noise.
1.0	IT broke before I could get it assembled. I was so disappointed. This was supposed to be an intimate surprise gift for my husband because he is my king. I wasted my $$$.
1.0	The first one I tried to use broke in half and I got glow stick juice all over the place. I wouldn't say these are safe for children nor do they last long enough for anything. Maybe an hour. I was attempting to use them in my centerpieces for my wedding. But they just won't work.
1.0	The easel arrived with the sides broken and needing to be reglued.  Would have returned the items if it hadn't been so close to Christmas. The dry easrer markers had dryed up and also needed to be replaced.  Very disapponted with this product.
1.0	DO NOT, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, TURN ACT ON AND ATTEMPT TO USE THIS ITEM. YOU WILL DESTROY THE PLANE.    5 seconds after take off the engine cut out, thanks to the ACT, and it smashed to the ground irrevocably damaging the plane. Now the thing does not function at all.   Most expensive and poorly advised use of $180 ive ever seen, good thing it only last 5 seconds....      I plan to contact the company to see if they are willing to resolve this issue, but i dont hold out any hopes...        DO NOT, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, TURN ACT ON AND ATTEMPT TO USE THIS ITEM. YOU WILL DESTROY THE PLANE.    DO NOT, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, TURN ACT ON AND ATTEMPT TO USE THIS ITEM. YOU WILL DESTROY THE PLANE.    DO NOT, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, TURN ACT ON AND ATTEMPT TO USE THIS ITEM. YOU WILL DESTROY THE PLANE.
1.0	It fell apart with 3 days of my son playing with it. My son is 11 years old.
1.0	This playmat is paper and not worth the price. Should be called a poster.
1.0	I decided to give this a try despite the negative reviews.  They are right, don't do it.  The horses don't work.  The puzzle board does not stay flat, and once its all put together its not really convenient to take apart again.  There is no easy way to store it as is.  We will probably end up just throwing it away.
1.0	Extremely Dissatisfied.  Picture looks completely different from actual costume.  The dress is shaped like a rectangle and is not designed to flare at all.  The top of the dress where the bust is looks like it is a heart shape and has nice outlined stitching to define the top in the photo is nothing like that.  It goes straight across and has no jewel in the center.  The White fabric is about as thin as it comes and looks extremely low quality.  The hat is unwearable even if you put cardboard in it to support it.  It would have to be glued on to hold any sort of structure and the feather is not attached to the hat.
1.0	I read all the reviews before buying this. I knew what I was getting myself into. Quite of few of the people who received this seemed to get very decent, or even good lots. Unfortunately I didn't think that the cards I was going to get would be this bad.<br /><br />I did receive the intended 5 mythics and 25 rares. They were all junk rares and mythics, which doesn't surprise me too much. A few of the older cards are also in rough shape; one of which, from the Dark set, Inferno; is very worn out on all sides.<br /><br />I received 1048 cards in total, not counting the rares/ mythics. All of which were commons, not a single uncommon in the batch. Of those 1048 cards, I only received about 446 unique cards. My lot had an inredibly high amount of duplicates. I only received cards from Rise of the Eldrazi, M11, Mirrodin Besieged, New Phyrexia, Innistrad and Avacyn Restored. That's it, only six separate sets. My average duplicate count was somewhere between 3-5 of the same card. My highest amount of duplicates was seven, which happened with two different cards.<br /><br />I started relatively recent, around the time the most recent Mirrodin block was rotating out. I do own some M10 and Zendikar cards from the first deckbuilder's toolkit. I was seriously hoping for some older cards, as I hope to branch out into edh and modern, but that didn't happen. Of the cards I received, except for the Rise of Edlrazi cards, I own almost every single one of the cards I received. I know that I was bound to get cards I already owned, especially with something like this, however I was not expecting it to happen on such a grand scale.<br /><br />With something like this you have to get lucky, which I unfortunately was not. I ordered mine from MP COLLECT LLC if that makes any difference. Just remember what you're ordering if you get this. You may get some really great cards, or you may not.
1.0	I am disappointed! I ordered this specifically because it was &#34;under the sea&#34; animals and I need it for my classroom.It has lions and camels and other non-sea creatures.
1.0	"Putting the toy together with my son was part of the fun but after doing it \\""correctly\\"" the fingers would not move..........NEXT!"
1.0	not what expected wouldn't even give it as a Christmas gift couldn't return so it's thrown in the back of the closet.
1.0	I really wasn't sure what a Moshi Monster was but it was what my granddaughter wanted for Christmas. I should have tried to see the item at a store before purchasing it. The quality of the item is poor. I guess I thought since it was as expensive as it was that it would be a better quality. The online code tag is opened so I hope it is something that she'll be able to use after she opens it, on the computer. It actually looks like a toy that you could get from one of those Claw amusement machines that they have at arcades. I have never allowed any of my kids to try the claw because it all looks like junk. I sent an e-mail to the vendor about it but they didn't have the courtesy to respond to me.
1.0	I bought this for my dorm room and wasn't expecting much. However, even with my low expectations I was still very disappointed. This chair is too small for a normal sized adult and maybe anyone over the age of ten. The chair did not last a week without getting a hole from very light usage. Also the name of the product implied I would get a blue chair, but I got a clear one instead. I've seen better quality from the 99 cent store.
1.0	I ordered this monkey for my 8 year old daughter for Christmas. I read reviews and it was rated a top toy in parents magazine, so I felt confident. I even watched the video. I could hardly wait to see the monkey come to life. My daughter opened it for Christmas and the monkey was super cute. We put batteries in......nothing.  Ok, maybe they are in wrong, try again...nothing....wait...did you hear that???  oooh  ahhh.........then nothing again.  Push the sensors again and again, try to feed the monkey with the bottle...nothing.  swing the monkey, pet the monkey.........NOTHING.<br />Ok, so I break it to my daughter that the monkey doesn't work.  I show her the video of what the monkey is supposed to do, and she agrees....it needs to go back and I'll order another one.  So 4 days later her new monkey arrives, we break into the  box get the batteries in, and..........NOTHING!!!!!  oh, wait, there was an 'oooh  ahhh&#34;  and that was it.  No movement, no sucking the  bottle only the one noise.  batteries changed.  monkey rocked.  sensors pressed. turned on and off.......ugh.  I tried to call Hasbro, but there is no working # (on the directions or the web).  I called amazon, and they said I would have to just return the monkey and write a review.
1.0	Do not waste your money! Its so garbage and weak. I don't know why I even order it after reading reviews. We got it fast but item is terrible. SAVE YOUR FIVE DOLLARS! Go buy yogurt or something.
1.0	You get what you pay for...<br /><br />A very cheaply-made, version of the popular, metal cane. Tends to unravel and bend easily, and can't be used with a handkerchief, without completely slowing the opening of the cane. If it can't be used with handkerchief, then the trick is essentially useless? Buy a metal one. It may cost a little more, but, it's worth it
1.0	nonfunctional...significant leakage
1.0	and a rip-off.  They made it look like such a big roll of ribbon on the screen, when I got it, it was no bigger then a spool of thread, they put it in a very large box, big enough for a pair of large mens combat boots, and charged me $3.90 P & S for a 25 cent spool of ribbon that wouldn't even curl.  I would never order from this company again.
1.0	This item was packed with other, heavier items. The box was crushed. Since this was a gift and meant to be a collectible, it was a disappointment.
1.0	I wish I could give this no stars. After we opened the box, we saw that we only got the doll, not the skateboard. You can't see everything inside the box, only the doll. So now we can't even send it back and get a refund. Don't buy this product, you don't know if you'll get ripped off or not.
1.0	Pieces very small not only 4-5 different items and nothing fun to play with. Good I put some candy ti Pinata...
1.0	colors are stated incorrectly and the exit hole on the bottom of the toy is small.
1.0	This doll was beautiful out of the box.  We purchased it March 11, 2014.  With in a few months the hair was coarse and dry and fell out. The right upper eye lash fell out.  We have been so disappointed.  The doll was purchased for my 86 year old mother who has dementia.  She holds the doll all day and is so sad that the hair is so coarse and that the eye lashes are gone.  She is aware enough to know that the doll did not hold up  and is heart broken.  We would buy another one to replace it, but it is no longer available...even if the new one suffered the same fate...just to calm mom down...we would tell her her doll to a trip to the hospital.  We had other Adora dolls for my daughter that did not deteriorate like this one did.  Very sad.
1.0	Flew well, but the batter literally lasted the two days before it wouldn't hold a charge.
1.0	Leaked right away. Half the balls float at the top of the water. This is a total waste of money.
1.0	Arrived scraped and beat up
1.0	This charger comes with the UDI RC U816A UFO Quadcopter 2.4Ghz with 6 Axis Gryo, along with a custom USB cable.  I purchased a second charger hoping to keep batteries charging while flying, but this charger does not come with the USB cable.
1.0	Not sure if it is just me, but when using these the air just slowly leaked out of the balloon.  It was a real shame because I was hoping to avoid tying each balloon.
1.0	I thought the moon dough a couple of years ago was a bad toy, but this is much much worse!  When we tried to fill the trays my 7 and 5-year old kids couldn't even press the lever down, and when I did the entire lid came off and the liquid went everywhere. This happened twice.  WHAT A MESS!  This is honestly the worst gift my kids have ever received and it will be going back.  I just wish the relative that purchased this would have read the reviews before buying it and saved us all a lot of disappointment and headache!
1.0	Disappointed! Pre-ordered in early December. Just received it today and was expecting it to dance to music, as it was originally advertised! It's just a regular bobble head. Went back to check to double check the description and it has been changed! It's cute, but not what I ordered.
1.0	I did not receive the rippin' rider, but instead a ninja turtle skateboard.  Didn't want to deal with returning it so we just kept the skateboard, but I think he would have liked the motorcycle a lot better.
1.0	Seriously?!?! You will get $75 for this game?!?!?!?!? C'mon. Rip. Off. Good luck to the sucker who will actually pay that much for it.
1.0	I purchased three of the Leap Pad Explorers for my nephews and son. Originally at the $99.00 price. I also purchased the Ac adapter assuming that this would charge the unit.(just like every other toy they have DS/Leapster/Etc..) I actually bought this because I thought it would be an overall better buy...boy was I WRONG!!!!!!!  I should have went with the iPad or Kindle Fire.  Thoughts:  1. It is educational...but most of the content is similar to games or videos I can find on the web for free or apps I can find in the apple/droid app store  Most of the videos come on TV anyway.  2. The AC adapter doesn't charge the unit...it only powers the unit....How many of us have 3 or 4 year olds willing to use this while they sit within 3 or 4 ft of an outlet? Where was the thought process in this design? THERE IN NO OBVIOUS MENTION OF THIS ON THE PACKAGING!!!  3. It eats batteries like candy...Don't plan on using disposable. Two to three days is a best case scenario if the child uses it no more than 30 minutes a day. We've been changing batteries EVERY OTHER DAY! With about 2 hours of use a day. Buy two sets of rechargable batteries at least with disposables as backups.  4. Expect frustration and tantrums when this product shuts off due to #3 above.  5. The games, ebooks, videos, expansions, etc... are very expensive. I purchased two games, two ultra ebooks, two videos, and two regular ebooks for my nephews and son in addition to the free app that downloaded. Total cost for those were  $315.00 (you can't share downloaded apps)  I guess all-in-all I am not impressed at all with the Leap Pad Explorer--after the fact. I suppose if money is not a factor for you, then it really doesn't matter that much. I am just really disappointed with the product overall. I suppose I feel *suckered* in some ways. They have my money for the device and now to get any useful content I don't have any other options for apps other than to pay the bloated prices.  I'm considering cutting my losses and researching the iPads further or the Kindle Fires.
1.0	I have followed the instructions as per guidance, but it is not working at all!! what should i do now?
1.0	The app should be down loaded before it arrives because it is impossible to do it yourself! Its very annoying as well.
1.0	The center piece of this water table did not properly attach.
1.0	We purchased these bead necklaces for a Masquerade party and we were shocked to see that the beads are really tiny. The colors are dull and unnoticeable when worn. I do not recommend this product.
1.0	This tiara is so small it won't fit on an adult's head. Looks like it was made for a child. Tried pulling it open, but afraid it would break.
1.0	This is crap, bought 2 for Christmas presents and one came WITHOUT THE BALL that's kind of necessary to solve the maze and open it up!  Also, way too easy, not even remotely a challenge!  Save your money, this is crap!
1.0	"Ordered this bike for my 3-year old for Christmas. To keep hidden, kept in the box until nap time on the afternoon of Christmas Eve. The box contained instructions for a different bike. The bike itself had one broken training wheel, paint scraped off the frame down to the metal (1/2 inch wide and 2-inch long gash near the seat), and was missing the bolt that connects the seat to the frame. What a disappointment. Now my son is still napping and I have to decide to either go find a replacement, or just wait and get him his big present from \\""Santa\\"" after Christmas. Love Amazon. Hate Toys R Us. This is not my first bad experience with their bigger ticket products."
1.0	Bought this to replace a Hayward Navigator. Thus far, it works well. One problem, it gets stuck on the pool drain. I just ordered a drain cover from Polaris to resolve this problem. I'm a little ticked that I had to spend another 60 bucks for the drain cover, since, from what I've been reading on the web, this is a very common problem with this cleaner. My Navigator did not have this problem.  UPDATE: Well after a year of service, I cannot recommend this product. It consistently gets stuck on the drain cover. I bought the cover for the drain provided by Polaris. It's just a circular piece of plastic. When it stays on the drain, the system works. Unfortunately, after only a few hours, the cover moves and no longer covers the pool drain. So now I'm stuck with a system that I have to check on several times a day to make sure the cover is on the drain so the sweep doesn't get stuck. Bad design. I don't have an unusual drain cover, so I'd bet this happens to others. I just bought the tune-up kit for my old navigator, which never had these problems.
1.0	These are TINY!  They are like key-chain size, maybe 3&#34;.  Not 5&#34;.  Definitely not what I was hoping for.  Will probably have to return for a larger size.
1.0	My son had this for 10 minutes before the arms broke off. Thankfully he wanted to play with it as a road.<br /><br />The arm wood is very thin weak wood.
1.0	"After days of thinking I was crazy, my husband had an opportunity to look at it.  Apparently we received the same pieces rather than \\""left and right\\"".  My husband had to use the wood and make our own table and chairs.  I think seller needs to recheck what is packed."
1.0	This doll is worth 10 bucks at the most.  The material it is made of is cheap like felt.  Mine didnt  work so I returned it and amazon  processed my refund quickly.  I think a boy would get bored of this toy quickly.
1.0	DOA! The headlights come on but nothing else happens. We've tried swapping batteries, checked all connectors, etc. It is dead on arrival. This was the biggest toy my 7 year old son got for Christmas. He was so excited. The main battery is charged as I charged it all night so it was ready for him to play with Christmas morning. Now I get to fight the return lines at Toys R Us Monday morning. :(
1.0	Was really excited to give this gift to my nephew for Christmas. When we opened it, it 1. did not light up, even after we changed batteries and 2. When we opened it up to see the guts, the battery had melted the insides so it will no longer work without returning it.
1.0	Pretty cheaply made.  Would not recommend.
1.0	Very flimsy board, will not even lay flat to play. Checkers also don't stack well.
1.0	I received a damaged item.
1.0	Indie would not like his name on this product!  The holster is flimsy and the belt would fit around an adult but can be cut.  However, to get it to stay buckled is another problem.  Indie would never have a colored gun either.
1.0	The diary that is shown in the picture is not the diary that will be sent to you. I fell in love with hello Kitty holding an apple and the pink background which shows the silhouette of her face all over the diary; however, when I got the diary mail to me, there was a picture of hello Kitty holding an apple and the background is polkadots!!! I DID NOT ORDER A DIARY W/POLKADOTS!!!! This is a Christmas gift, and it's too late to return it back to the seller
1.0	Please do not purchase these notebooks. They were a total waste of money! They are not even close to the size Steve/Joe use in the show. Also one thing my son loved to do was to stick the crayon in the top spiral part like they do in the show. The crayon barely even fits!!! My son would just get very frustrated with them and wouldn't use them at all. I was so excited to give these to him since it's his favorite show, and was sooooooo very disappointed when I got them in the mail. Once again please don't waste your money on such a misleading object. You can spend a dollar at Target for a notebook that serves it's purpose much better.....
1.0	I bought these props for my Phantom 2 as an upgrade.  What was thought to be a wise decision ended up costing me hundreds of dollars.  After attaching the blades to my quadcopter, I took it out to fly.  After hovering a bit wobbly for a few seconds, one of the propellers detached from the nut that screws into the motor, making the copter spiral out of control and crash.  The crash completely bent and destroyed my $300+ gimbal, and did significant damage to the attached GoPro Hero 3 as well.  When asked to compensate me for the damages caused by their product, the owner of the shop took no liability.  Now I'm left with hundreds of dollars of damage because of a defective product that should be taken down.  DO NOT BUY THESE!  They WILL break!  Don't give OK Shop your business, as they do not care about their customers, and will sell you a defective product to make a quick buck.
1.0	Bought this thinking it would be a fun gag-gift to mess around with. I was interested in the secret to it, but like most magic tricks you're usually instantly disappointed. Unfortunately the key is not a solid key. The teeth at the end of the key are a separate part which is glued on to the stem....and no this isn't part of the effect so I am not revealing anything about the trick. In the description of the trick you're told you can give this key to your audience members for inspection and they will not be able to move the teeth...well all I did was try to move the glued on teeth and those suckers popped right off. I didn't use excessive force, just the same level of manipulation I would expect any curious onlooker to attempt to duplicate the magic trick.<br /><br />It's a piece of overpriced garbage, save your money for the real deal if you come across one in a magic shop. Test before you buy, but do not buy this piece of crap.
1.0	"As an avid baker I can tell you that there is NO WAY to cool bake anything.  The product that comes out of this oven is disgusting.  As many reviews have alluded to....goop going in, goop coming out.  My 4 and 6 year old were so excited to make the cakes.  First you have to do everything \\""very quickly\\"" or the batter (if you can call it that) starts congealing......as for the cool bake part.....nothing happens in that oven.  We have tried it 3 or 4 times and I even tried it on my own so I could \\""stir the batter quickly\\"" and get it into the oven ASAP and still......YUCK!!!!!    Buy some muffin mix at the grocery store, let your kids help you with the eggs, measuring and mixing...have an adult put it in and take it out of the oven.......your kids will be just as happy and the rest of the family can enjoy it too!"
1.0	The blue light went out after the second day.  Bummer.  In spite of that the ants dugs their tunnels.  My grandson enjoyed watching the activity.
1.0	This is a product I don't understand. I wanted a '7' balloon for a birthday. This came, and amused and baffled all.<br /><br />It's very small (my bad - 35&#34; would be more like it, it turns out).<br /><br />But YOU CAN'T FILL IT WITH HELIUM. What the heck is it FOR? I found somewhere to tape it, but don't you buy it.
1.0	Okay, so having kids, I am used to taking lots of toys out of their packaging, and this was one of the worst. But hey, it's for the kids, so I get over it. Out she comes, both shoulders are cracked, but my daughter does not care. She begins to try and brush the doll's hair, which is so wavy/curly it is impossible to brush. Since that is kind of the point, I am returning it for a Barbie head. Save your hard-earned money on this; eventually, your child will give up trying to style this mangy mess.
1.0	my 3 year old cant manage this although she can figure out regular cameras.  The photos are so grainy and the view box so small, its not worth it
1.0	Bought this for my son who is always taking Daddy's tools. He LOVED IT, and continues to play with it all the time. The product is great and the quality is excellent. I would happily give it a Five Star rating, except that one of the wheels was missing when we opened the box. Unfortunately we bought this for my son's birthday and the return window expired a week before we were able to open the product and view the contents.
1.0	I brought this stroller home on Tuesday, and by Saturday, a seam on the seat had ripped, exposing the blunt end of a metal pole underneath.  Too bad, because my daughter LOVED it.  Kids will love this item; just make sure you don't purchase this brand.  My mother picked one up at Wal-Mart that has lasted, so far, through three months of toddler use (including the toddler sitting in it many, many times; she never really had the chance to try to sit in this one because it broke first).<br /><br />The good out of all this?  I still had the box it came in (since it broke so quickly) and Amazon has a great return policy if you're reasonably quick.
1.0	I never had the correct product, I got a backpack from some othe personnage but was not manny ones. I tried to send it back but that was some difficult, because I am living in France and I send it to my sisters in USA, so she can bring it to my son. I'ill try to send it back, but ofcourse my son did not have the Manny Backpack for chrsitmas!!!!!!
1.0	Broke in about 5 minutes.  Flimsy and cheap.  Not worth it.  I will try something else next time.  The end.
1.0	The inflatable was missing a strap to keep the post upright... We used a string from the net. But pretty disappointing to open it and not have all pieces attached.
1.0	Absolutely the most ridiculously overpriced, over promoted item I've ever seen...
1.0	why did yall put zack for 55.99 and its an old elite and thats not the real price
1.0	"Product description says: \\""Now featuring headlight and metalic finishes!\\""<br />Not mine. The place where was suppose to be the real headlight is just covered with white colour. I'm so dissappointed! My daughter's birthday is on Monday and I can't give it to her because of the missing headlights. Not enough time to get the new one."
1.0	I GAT ALL 7 OF THE CREW OF THE SAME TYPE OF THESE FORM STAR TREK FOR A LOT LESS.
1.0	My sister bought this item for my daughter.  I don't know why the battery pack has to be attached to the toy.  It is not connecting tight enough and therefore not working.  I attached it to the crib and actually had to stand there holding the battery pack so my daughter can enjoy the lights and music.   <br />I am throwing it out.  I am going to hook up the one my older daughter used two years ago that didn't require a separate battery pack.
1.0	This fire truck is loud and fun for kids BUT it looks like complete junk. I am curious how long it will last at my house. It looks like an $8 toy. I got an email from the company before I even got the product saying if I did not like it to please contact the company and not post a negative review. I have mixed feelings about the product. It really looks terrible....not a $30 firetruck. I do not know where it is made but it appears to be junk. The photo really does not even come close to the product. The lights do not look anything like that at all.
1.0	Not what I expected, it was a Christmas present for my daughter came open without even a box instructions nothing. Disappointed in this order so was my daughter!
1.0	Could never get this to work, every time I hooked it up to the computer to configure (which is necessary prior to being able to use Wi-Fi), it kept trying to download and update the 'firmware' - which never completed successfully and just kept looping. Support resources (online) was completely unhelpful. I tried for almost a week and then returned. I would NOT recommend this to anyone - and I've been in IT for over 20 years so I'm not new to configuring devices...<br />For almost the same cost, consider the Kindle for Kids..
1.0	Cheap product, works fine just poor quality. Maybe worth 5 bucks
1.0	This item overheated and popped on first discharge n charge at .5....amp charge rTe
1.0	I thought this looked like a rather entertaining car for a young kid.  Spent a couple days trying to charge the thing and get it to work, but no luck.  Has a rather cheap feel to everything, wouldn't be supprised if this is a common problem.
1.0	My globe also broke within minutes of normal use.  I played with one years ago that was excellent quality.  The reviews on Amazon for all these types of products are poor.  Does anyone know where to get a good quality golf ball water globe?
1.0	A great idea, but no kid was ever able to use it.  It's almost impossible to get on it. If you try to tip it to the side so one foot pad is resting on the ground, the first foot you put on slides off before you can get the other foot on the other side.  I'm 44 and I could get on it, but the kids couldn't and it just sat in the toy bin for a year with no use. I'm going to try a real pogo stick this year, because it seems like a great activity.  This style just is too hard to get on.
1.0	My 3 yr old received this as a gift...within a few minutes we realized something wasn't right. More liquid leaked out of the gun than actually produced bubbles, the bubbles, while pretty, made a horrible mess!! Washable...I think not. Everything that the bubbles touched was ruined including several people's clothing and shoes. Some of the bubbles floated thru an open window and popped on my car's seats as of now I have yet to get the color out of either the clothing or the seats. I grew up thinking that Crayola made quality products, I may have to rethink that thought.
1.0	These simply don't work. the quality is very poor and it is almost impossible to make it go around your arm. not fun at all for kids
1.0	We bought this for our son who had outgrown his toddler tricycle. Thinking it could handle an active 4 year old, we purchased it and put it under the Christmas tree. The plastic is so thin the seat already broke. Don't buy this, buy one made of sturdier metal!
1.0	After seeing my 2 year old nephews face light up when he opened his Rody on his birthday, we thought that our 19 month old son would also enjoy taking a ride on Rody.<br /><br />Shipping was fast, we got the item we ordered...but only one issue...<br /><br />When we inflated Mr. Rody, he was lopsided.  He could barely stand on all fours.  So we took the air straight out of his belly and tried again.  Same results!<br /><br />So after contemplating how to explain to my son that Rody wasn't going to work out...we decided to pack Rody back in his &#34;home&#34; and send him back for a &#34;paint job&#34;.  We'll be ordering another Rody in a different color in hopes that he has lived a balanced life.<br /><br />Perhaps I'll review again after Rody #2 has been taken for a few test rides around the track!
1.0	This ink was horrible, out of a 24 pack only one little bottle was still blue.  The rest had turned clear (old bottles I think) and didn't show up as &#34;ink&#34; but just a wet spot, so much for my illustration!
1.0	This overpriced item is simply just silhouttes on pages.  No stickers, no decorations, nothing!  If your child isn't able to draw faces, this is not an item you would want him/her to have.
1.0	I was very disappointed with this figure.  The body is ugly she has a very huge breasts.  The face is not a female soft face, on the other side her face seems like a man with makeup.  The joints for an exposed body are just awful she looks like an old tech doll from 1950's.  Furthermore, the waist is very wide the legs are extremely thin and the head is so static that you cannot move it at all in addition to that when I was trying to move the head it got broke.   The costume though is nice and well designed including her tiara.  What a horrible figure compared with the other deluxe figures from DC Direct.    I am keeping it since its part of my personal collection but it is damn expensive for the type of product received.  David Gaviria.
1.0	Purchased for use as a ball pit for my 1 year old.  After only a few weeks the top tube will not stay inflated...Very disappointed would not recommend.
1.0	Very poorly made. The ends were already coming un done when it arrived and after one days wear the whole thing started to unravel. Not worth it, even for the cheap price.
1.0	I though there'd be more stretchy animals. Not enough animals and too much other stuff that my kids did not enjoy.
1.0	it does not work, I bought 2 neither work.  Save your money!  I know I'll be more careful next time.  Oh by the way there isn't a place for a battery
1.0	My son was so excited, even though he got a lot of other things, to get home from Grandma's on Christmas and put up his tent. A pole bent when I was setting it up and the second one bent worse when he moved it two feet. Even so, he brought his pillow, blankets, and stuffed animals in, through the little tunnel, to try having a 'camp out.' Then he sat dejectedly inside the wrinkled tent and asked me why the tent wouldn't work. It was very disappointing for us both.  The tent and tunnel material is cheap but would probably work for awhile. If the tent poles worked liked they were supposed to I would have given it about 3 stars.
1.0	"My daughter just received the Gak Mixer for Christmas and upon opening, we found that all the enclosed Gak was dried up.  Apparently this is a known issue (the manufacturer suggests to add a few drops of water and I've seen the other reviewers citing the same issue) and I can't imagine why the manufacturer doesn't do something about this flaw.  How about enclosing coupons for Gak?  What about redesigning the packaging to ensure the Gak consistency remains constant?  In any case, like the other reviewers, I am disappointed in the quality of this product.  What is worse is that even after adding a few drops of water and waiting the prescribed \\""few hours\\"" - our Gak is still unusable.<br /><br />Rather than buy more Gak (who can say I won't have the same issue???) I will likely return this toy citing its defect.  If you want a better toy to teach your children about mixing colors - I would suggest the Sesame Street bath soaps (comes in a pack containing the three primary colors.)  Not only were these fun for my daughter to play with, she actually got clean during the process as well!"
1.0	Waste of money.  Cheap plastic tuners broke the first 15 minutes.  You get what you pay for.
1.0	I return very few things to Amazon. This was returned. Poor quality.Looks like a black smudgy mess. I had the original fashion plates and just wanted something a little like them. The plates are nice. You can't get an impression without making a mess and holding the paper down for the child.
1.0	Ordered 2 and 1 stopped working after 2 times of being used to play
1.0	i received zoomer from santa played with it for 15 minutes charged it and it did not charge. Even with this toy being what I would consider expensive it is not a good deal. You would be better off not buying it, after we had it not work I started looking at the reviews and it seems like there are tons of people with this issue. Buyer beware. Merry Christmas to all, especially the makers of this toy who crush children and make them cry.  :(
1.0	It broke, just after take her out of the box
1.0	Looked cool but never worked. I will have to be more careful of the stores I buy from. Not well made!
1.0	This wig was so disappointing, it looks adorable in the photo but in person it is terrible. There is NO WAY the woman in the photo is actually wearing the wig that is packaged.  It is a very weird shape and looks like a cross between a mullet and a mohawk.  I ordered this for a last minute party and it took A LOT of time, bobby pins, and a scarf to make it presentable.
1.0	Lousy! Too small, it barely exists and it is very cheap. Too bad. Shouldn't even be sellng thath on internet. Doesn't look any like Rapunzel, it is a bad copy of a poly pocket doll with semi long hair.
1.0	Was very disapointed in this train. Does not hold extra car or dinos.Also get caught up at turns. The hole in feet are too small to stand dino up. Cute idea but bad set. Dont waste your money!
1.0	This copy of Pictionary is defective (I imagine) due to a problem on the assembly line and a lack of quality control!<br /><br />This copy is a mixture of the regular version (newer reprint) and the 25th Anniversary Edition.  The box, game board and instructions are from the regular version while the cards and playing pieces are from the 25th Anniversary Edition.<br /><br />Product was immediately returned!  Thankfully that was easy due to Amazon's return system.  I just printed the label and dropped it off at the UPS store.
1.0	Was disappointed in the amount of tape that you got for the money.
1.0	I have fond memories of the wooden pounding bench that I had as a child and of another that my children used to play with. This bench is a poor imitation of those.  The pegs are supposed to remain in the bench and be pounded from one side to the other.  The pegs in this bench don't fit tightly, fall out and end up scattered around the house.
1.0	I have a huge piece of waste to go in a landfill.  I recommend you don't buy this.  I am still wasting time on finding how to get rid of this thing.
1.0	i wanted a lighted solitaire game to play in the dark, but this does not do that.  I am quite disappointed.  I would not recommend this to anybody.
1.0	This mummy has a hard head, arms and feet. It was to be for my grandson which currently has a mummy love but I couldn't have given this to her as I thought it was unsuitable and I was very disappointed.
1.0	Ordered this book and 2 platform sets, the book was out of stock and they canceled the whole order.....yes the whole order ....yes even though the other sets were in stock, they still canceled the order, wow! So be careful if you order multiple items, if you order 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 items and one thing is out of stock....your out of luck
1.0	THis is worthless. The instruction manual has awful English-interpretation, grammar, and spelling through the entire document make it impossible to read. The remote just beeps at us. Since the manual is worthless, it's going back. Ridiculous. If you are going to ship things to the US, be sure the instructions are READABLE!
1.0	Gave to my granddaughter as a Christmas gift. When she opened it, the &#34;Floam&#34; was very slimy and gooey and even mixed and kneaded according to instructions, it still remained sticky and gooey and clung to anything it touched.
1.0	Blew them up and hung them outside - popped within 15 minutes - right before my daughter's party. Wasn't thrilled to say the least.
1.0	Fast delivery but the toys are very small.  My niece does not like it.  Stitching is falling out already, and the characters look very mean.
1.0	The markers were dried out and would not work even after multiple attempts of soaking them in warm water.
1.0	Pretty much just junk. Save your money.
1.0	Purple and yellow color ink dried out.<br />I was going to return but I can't find this stamp pad in local store and I need this stamp pad by this weekend.<br />So now I have to keep this with 2 inks dries out. I tried add some water but it did not work. Too bad!
1.0	The kite would get up in the air, but would take a nose dive and crash. I've flown other inexpensive kites just fine and never had this problem. It also doesn't show where to hang the tail thing that won't uncurl. I kept trying it different spots hoping it would work, but none did. I think the head is too heavy for the kite. The strings also should go side to side, but they go up and down. Buy something else.
1.0	This pinata arrived completely broken and very tiny, very tiny! I had to run out to Party City and buy a pinata. This was a huge dissapointment! Do not buy from here. I notified the company but havent heard back ro received my money back. Garbage!
1.0	These were junk I did not like them at all. They just kind of fell apart very easily. Very low quality/
1.0	I got this in the mail. And about a day later I tried to prank my friend, and he said that nothing happened I try it myself and It didn't work. I try a day later, nothing. It broke a day after I got it. I do not recommend it.
1.0	Not only is this fake, but it's poorly designed.  It looks totally fake.  It's so rigid that it slipped down into the toilet and was flushed, thus ruining the gag altogether.  Maybe if your bathroom is not well-lit, you can get away with it, but you'll have to duct-tape this thing to the seat.  Not funny and a waste of money.
1.0	I came broken. Can't say anymore
1.0	Had corroded battery. Didn't work.  Returned for refund.
1.0	I bought this bike for my son for his 5th birthday, and I am returning it. The assembly directions are complicated and impossible to decipher. I have assembled countless toys properly and effectively so it is not me - it is definitely the product and the sub-English instructions. Pieces broke during assembly. It is not worth your money. Trust me, you will be disappointed.
1.0	With our first try with a Bath Blizzard, it spat out a few bubbles and then no more.  Made my daughter cry.  I was not happy.<br /><br />Returned it, got another.  This one worked better but the performance still fell far short of the picture on the box.<br /><br />It's worth buying for the novelty factor if you can get it on deep discount ($15 or less), but this product won't hold your children's interest for long.
1.0	My parents got my daughter of these Fisher price dvd players, and right off the bat it stopped working. The button to press play never works. Now they don't charge or keep a charge so you have to keep plugged in. Seriously these things are a waste of money. Plus the screen is smaller than my iphone screen. Give me a break fisher price!
1.0	Basket was small. Not as pictured.  There is no kazoo in the basket.  Items not worth the money.  Junk at a high price.  Don't be fooled.
1.0	broke first day.  I bought 4 for Christmas for the kids.  They all broke within two days.
1.0	Be careful when purchasing this item.  I purchased it solely for the fact that it had C3PO for one or our sons and Bobba Fett & Luke Skywalker for our other sons.  However, we received the item from the seller and they mailed us a totally different pack.  They sent the Darth Vader, Yoda, Chewbacca & R2D2 pack.  This was going to be a Christmas/stocking stuffer for our boys and it was very disappointing that they did no send the right pack.  Totally not right!
1.0	It's already begun leaking. I never even got it to really work, you have to squeeze it pretty hard in just the right way for the inner color to pop up right. The mesh is too loose and the plastic ball that holds it together gets in the way. Not worth $4.
1.0	The Zoomer was all my daughter wanted for Christmas. It worked for 10 min (which she was loving!) but then died and will no longer work. It will not charge and is completely dead. What a waste of money!
1.0	I was so disappointed, I put one of these on top of each of my grandchildrens Christmas gifts, and the very first child to try it out cried because a paw ripped off, first time!!! FAIL!
1.0	Cheap! Poorly made! Broke within 2 weeks!
1.0	totally failed. wouldn't shoot. after 30 or more pumps one might come out then start again but after 10 minutes of fighting with this thing to work I say see ya, it is going back!!
1.0	Second day we threw it out while our daughter was sleeping.  Unbearable static sound. You can barely hear the voice. Cannot understand what the other person is saying. The talk button is too stiff for a five year old to hold down.  BUYS SOMETHING ELSE!!  Try these instead:  [[ASIN:B00097E820 Hello Kitty FRS Family Radio Service Communicators]]  [[ASIN:B002L6I9ZY LEGO Walkie Talkies]]  Or better yet the real thing:  [[ASIN:B001UE6MIO Motorola MH230R 23-Mile Range 22-Channel FRS/GMRS Two-Way Radio (Pair)]]
1.0	They didn't look at all like bootcover,, and are also huge for a child!! These boot covers are not for toddlers
1.0	Bought one from this seller he sent me the nerf secret strike i tried to contact him but he did not email me back.
1.0	These cards are just some scenes from the show and on the back are descriptions about the scene...don't waste your money like I stupidly did.
1.0	bought this train as a christmas present for our son and we opened it up and put the battery in it doesnt work at all.. our son is very disapointed as this was something he was very excited about
1.0	I received this item quickly after ordering in time for Christmas. However, upon opening the box, the first thing I noticed was that it was filthy dirty and dusty. I cleaned it up so I could put it together, only to discover that the item is defective. I don't know how long this game sat around in somebody's attic or garage, but it was obviously a very long time. I would consider keeping it, but it is unusable/defective. I am going to return it. I am very disappointed.
1.0	Terrible purchase. The ad implies a set of many characters. With shipping it cist just under $10 for a tiny individual Lego SRT of just Bart Simpson. My child was very disappointed and I felt ripped off
1.0	CHARGER WORKS GOOD, THE BATTERIES I GOT WERE CRAP, FLAKY CONNECTORS, AND 1 ONLY HELD A CHARGE THRU 2 CYCLES.......THEN IT'S DOWN TO A 20 SECOND FLIGHT.
1.0	Very thin, poorly made. The handles tore after first use. Don't recommend.
1.0	"\\""Santa\\"" got this for my daughter(3) a year ago.  I hope they've improved since, but like other reviews, we too had the problem with Dora not finishing what she was saying/singing.  My biggest turn-off was when she'd say, \\""Can you find my friend who is yellow?\\""  And when we'd give her the yellow star, she'd reply, \\""That's my friend who chirps,\\"" then repeat the question again.  And sometimes we could give her (for example) the butterfly, in response to her question, and it would be correct.  My daughter actually had fun laughing and telling her that she was wrong.  Needless to say, it's already packed up for charity."
1.0	didnt have an antenna in the controller wheels fell off as soon as we took it out of box wouldnt recommened this to anyone it was crap
1.0	So, I just ordered this as a Gold Box deal that was all of $2.50 off of the price.  Then I did a bit more research, and ordered TWO sets from another site for about the same price.  This tin is a joke for what you get.
1.0	I am so frustrated with this STUPID thing!!! Santa brought this for my son. I have changed the batteries about six times now. It will make sounds until it goes into &#34;Sleep Mode&#34; then it will not &#34;Wake Up&#34;. My child is very disappointed and so am I!!!
1.0	Very cute, but break very easy!  We've had them for a little over a week and half of them have broken off their stands!
1.0	You are NOT to leave a child unattended in this chair, however, I immediately returned this to the store, in lieu of its rewards, when I observed how my baby would arch her back and lift out of the chair.<br />If you are considering this maybe try the one with the tray which would prohibit such movement and possible injury.
1.0	The product description says that these are 3&#34; across and 1&#34; vertically from the top to bottom of the eyeball. In fact these are about 1 1/4&#34; across and 1/2&#34; from the top to the bottom of the eyeball. I bought these as  stocking stuffers and it's too late to replace them. Very disappointed and absolutely would not recommend.
1.0	I ordered all the characters, and all the others were plush and fluffy and soft.  This one is scratchy, with cardboard in the ears and no embroidered logo on the foot.  The quality is horrible and his hands have dirt smudges on them.  I need to reorder a new mickey to go with the gang, but I don't even know which to order since they are all using the same photos... So disgusted with this purchase!
1.0	Only works under a strong Halogen light. Tried it under sunlight, florescent light, colored light, incandescent light, a CFL, in front of the TV... only works within 8 inches of the bulb on a Halogen shop light.
1.0	My son was so excited to get this yo-yo and within 1 hour of playing with it- it broke. The 2 parts came apart and the screw on the inside wasn't long enough to screw back together. Very disappointing!
1.0	My son received this toy as a gift and I thought it was really cute. It worked fine until we put it into the water - it stopped playing the music immediately and would only squirt water once. I returned the first one to Amazon and they replaced it immediately; however the replacement also doesn't work. It plays music until placed in the water then it stops immediately. The replacement doesn't squirt any water at all.  What a waste of plastic - I hate to think of all these useless toys sitting in a landfill. I'm returning this one right away and will exchange it for another toy.
1.0	this has to be the worst 2 speed on the planet..not only is it poorly designed and looks hideous it doesnt last long it will shift one or two times then self destruct. if you do decide to purchase this be ready to fork out alot of dough to replace this piece of garbage. if you want your car to be slow buy this 2 speed.only people named JEFF buy this crap.
1.0	Bought two and they broke immediately. Not recommended!!!
1.0	The blades are not labeled A/B like the OEM blades. Tried various configurations but gave up trying to get these to work. Quality of the blades is actually vey good, and they have a nice snug fit, but no labels mean no go.
1.0	This would be a good potty seat for a girl, but it is useless for a boy. The guard falls off everytime my son moves. Also he has learned to take it off since it's so easy. It ALWAYS falls into the potty so if you use the top on a regular toilet, you will have to get it out of it too. I liked the idea of basically 3 products in one but overall, unless you have a girl, don't bother!
1.0	I bought two of these pocket doodle sketch boards for my daughters for Christmas.  Poor quality!  I am very disappointed in this product.
1.0	Tiny is not the word -- the head of this toy is smaller than a penny.  I'm very disappointed and preparing to send it back.
1.0	This seemed like an ok toy to buy since my son is crazy about trains... the track doesn't stay together and the train gets stuck on every turn it tries to make.  My son is 18 months and is already bored since the train doesn't continue to move, instead it gets stuck and he loses interest.  Would not buy this toy again...
1.0	Bad product.  Very static.
1.0	But READ CAREFULLY it says in the description that it is a paper mask not rubber.<br />So I was dissapointed.
1.0	It's not worthy of any star. What a rip off.
1.0	My son received this toy Christmas morning. It stopped working after 15 minutes. We received a replacement, which broke after one day. My son is still dissappointed!!!
1.0	My 2 yr old son received this as Christmas present and it is really lame. The cars only sometimes come out of the garage. We thought we were missing something, but my mechanic and engineer relatives tried and did no better. So, we put it on the coffee table and just watch the cars fall off the table.<br />With so many better toys this one was a waste of money.
1.0	I'm sitting here with my mouth hanging open...how dare a toy company price gauge like this??? Or is it Amazon? Over 300 dollars for a plastic toy are you kidding me??? My little girl wants this and I so badly want her to walk out Christmas morning to all of the things she asked for under the tree...and it's not that I couldn't afford it with my Christmas savings...I just cannot bring myself to do it..spend this sort of money!!!?? It's ludicrous!! Am I not the only one freaking out about this???
1.0	Since the pictures all show packs of multiple miniatures I thought that was what I was ordering, but no, it is one crummy tiny figurine.  Very disappointing.
1.0	My 5 year old loved the thing for the first 30 minutes until the ruber track in the wheels broke in too.  Nothing on the box to try and get parts and a bit expensive just to write off.  The excavator is so realistic in looks and operation but just doesn't look like it is made to hold up under even mild indoor conditions.  ??? what is the intent if it won't hold up on carpet??? <br />
1.0	This toy came to us with missing pieces. My son is pretty upset that he can't finish making Batcycle. The missing pieces are rare ones so we can't find them anywhere. I am surprised the seller would send an incomplete set. I will have to find a way to send it back to Amazon. How much trouble this is. I don't even know how to contact the seller to be honest.[[ASIN:B001R6IML0 Batcycle - LEGO Batman Vehicle (No Stickers)]]
1.0	i cant even get d battery off. good thing i check it b4 giving my goddaughter. i cant even get it on now i have to by an adapter:(
1.0	I have ordered on Amazon for years and this is the most disappointed I have ever been with a perchase. I have three boys who like to play with Legos.  I was hopping for just some extra pieces that they could actually BUILD something with at a good price. What I got was a bunch of tiny PINK Lego pieces. Most were flowers and decorative pieces. Almost no bricks. My boys actually asked if we could throw them away!
1.0	Was not good I got 3 orders mess up box and smashed and dog was diffant all the other puzzles
1.0	I wish i never bought it. My kids didnt like it. They are ages 5 years and 8 years old. They wont even touch it! Waist of money!!!!!!!
1.0	dont buy this gun unless you want it for looks. it shoots about 10fps and shoots about 20ft. it comes with a flashlight. but it mine didnt work even with new batteries.
1.0	After only two weeks and one five year-old, 40 lb. girl, we have several rips in the seams.  Don't waste you time or your money.
1.0	Doesn't work at all. Our daughter has been asking for a robot that &#34;dances and sings when I press a button&#34;. This robot is really the only toy robot that fit the description. We bought it in spite of mixed reviews. Well it almost worked for about 5 minutes. Meaning it did introduce itself, told a story and did a little song and dance. It did not ever respond to the remote control or voice command. We turned it off to open other presents and the next time we turned it on it had a muffled broken sound and doesn't do anything. Very disappointing. Not really sure how to return something broken as this is our first amazon purchase (out of many) that we have been unhappy with. We are navigating the return policy now.
1.0	Parts are very small and hard to manage.
1.0	I purchased this for the educational content which is actually okay - for instance, whilst not using standard educational font, pet pad gets them to trace a letter correctly three times before the animal will do a trick starting with that letter(some of which are quite funny) and it is very encouraging for my normally unenthused four year old who will sit there for some time trying to write on his Leap.  The minor downsides of the Leap include the lack of chargeable battery, delays in responsiveness, cost of each game, very poor picture quality on camera, gallery pics etc created on one child's user profile can be deleted whilst in other user's profiles etc.  Few other hassles, but some big issues have dominated my opinion of the device...  VERY significantly is the difficulty with the Leap Connect software (and many unhelpful staff).  There seems to be a lot of good reviews for Leaps out there, but many seem to be by those who received pre-loaded ones to review and not using Connect software...  This was time consuming to set up (despite being very familiar with computers and great with new software), but I planned for this by buying purchasing this a couple months before Christmas, but this still wasn't sorted out by Christmas.  On TWO separate occassions, a downloadable app has gone MISSING entirely from both the LeapPad and the Connect software and unable to be resolved.  Support staff can see the apps were purchased/downloaded but have been unable to find a solution to getting them back to the user despite about three weeks each time of backwards and forwards emails (many of them identical repeats of past suggestions).  Firewalls fine, only one parental account, etc etc.  There is no way of backing these up yourself or getting them back.  A lot of time wasted and stress (and the parents out there know how sad kids can get if a toy/game gets taken away).  Despite only having had the LeapPad in use for a couple of months, I have seen weeks of delays with LeapWorld (and this is where you need to log in to get food for 'your pet').  Whilst it apparently gives you one lot of food every three days if you don't log in, this still doesn't allow your kids to feed their pet each day (and in the case of my kids had them worrying it would die if not fed).  If you're looking at this I would suggest you buy an iPad - the initial higher difference won't be as big a gap as it seems when you consider cost of each extra Leap game, and your time...  I'm sure there will be decent educational apps.
1.0	This is a fake card. If a God Card has &#34;1st Edition&#34; on it, it is fake. There is no such thing as a &#34;1st Edition&#34; god card.
1.0	I ordered this for my daughter for Christmas and the picture shown is not what I received. There was only a hair brush, hair dryer, curling iron, and straightener there were no other accessories at all. Items are very small and I would have been better off going to the dollar tree and buying something instead of this it would have been better! I have never disappointed before with an order and never given a bad review.
1.0	We bought this for our son, who is five years old, thinking it would be a great toy to build with and play with.  We have been very disappointed.  The major problem with this toy is that the screws and nuts do not hold.  If you manage to tighten the screws extremely tightly, which for many of the part combinations is only possible using both the wrench and the screwdriver at the same time, the screws will hold for a just a few minutes of play. If you tighten the screws to a normal tightness, they will hold only for a few seconds.<br /><br />This problem arises because the parts are made of plastic, so the screw/nut combination simply won't hold. Another issue is that some of the designs are bad - for instance, the last step of the forklift is not possible, as the bolt section of the wheel attachments is not quite long enough to go through two other pieces and then be secured by a nut.<br /><br />You may be interested in this product because you had an erector set as a kid.  Be warned, this modern version bears little resemblance to the older versions.  Stay away.
1.0	This item lasted 3 hours...don't waste your money!
1.0	first of all it was only 750 pieces and the matalic color is terrible  I only put about 100 pices in al put it away it was bad.
1.0	Robe is not similar to the picture posted. There is nothing to tie robe
1.0	We bought this for our 18 month old because he loves ride toys.  We were sooooo disappointed.  The stickers looked awful, like my 4 year old did them.  The plastic was thin and that all it was, thin cheap plastic.  It looked like it would last for maybe two days.  Crap!  Beware!!
1.0	It's a cheap, flimsy mask that won't hold up to scant use. My previous Rubie's collector's edition mask was well worth the money.
1.0	Broken pieces sent to me , plastic parts missing not at all what is pictured. This was an extremely disappointing purchase!
1.0	Great songs, big size but no matter what I use it does not produce bubbles it just drips, so disappointing.
1.0	Overpriced for size of toy. Within an hour of opening, front wheel (arm once transformed) had fallen off. Not worth half the price in Walmart.
1.0	I beleve i ordered a black shengshou as the description says it is but instead receved a barly functional whit intelect puzzle
1.0	very disappointed it is garbage
1.0	This item is nothing compared to the ex's in this set. If you are wanting a full art card then get blastoise ex full art from xy.
1.0	I followed the instructions and nothing about the product worked the way they said it did.  Ended up throwing it in the trash.
1.0	Don't make significant sound.
1.0	The stuffed cat I received looked far different than the picture. More like a porcupine. It will be going back.
1.0	We ordered these for my sons Graduation . We had young children over for his party and the balls where just too small to be any fun . They are not 7 inches !  They did ship and arrived on time .
1.0	We received this product as a birthday present.  My husband made it for our two girls and his vote is to put the entire contraption in the trash.  Product does not work as advertised, and everything tastes yucky and is sickly sweet.  Cake is powder mixed with water that needs to be put in the fridge to harden. The girls were terribly disappointed.  Add to that the large number of small plastic pieces that will undoubtedly end up all over the house, and this is not a keeper.  I am annoyed to be filling up a landfill with a brand new, non-degradable, plastic toy.
1.0	there was a price sticker $2 less under the price I paid.
1.0	Purchased toy as a gift. The price for this toy was six times more than what it was going for in the stores. Even though it may have been discontinued in some stores making a little profit is ok. However this mark up was outrageous. I will think very hard about buying from this merchant again. In addition i found the delivery to be slow.
1.0	The product was either expired or the exp date was rubbed away. So I had to throw it all out!
1.0	This is NOT the Rarity you will be getting. My husband ordered this for me and we got the &#34;rainbowfied&#34; Rarity with pink and blue in her mane and the texture was not the same. When my husband tried to exchange it we were told since the description says &#34;Plush Rarity&#34; that we &#34;technically&#34; got what we ordered.<br /><br />The &#34;rainbowfied&#34; Rarity can be found at most Target, Walmart and Toys R Us for $10-$12. DON'T BE FOOLED.
1.0	Horrible product! Washes off the clothes! Do not recommend!
1.0	Cute, but after single use, it snapped in two!  Not the best quality obviously.
1.0	Inside lining tore after one use. Outside has been fine, but overall cheaply made. Not worth the money; spent more to get a quality one.
1.0	We're used to buying Thomas the Train stuff which is very sturdy, durable and long-lasting. I was expecting similar quality in this Brio set and was sorely disappointed. The tracks were made with rough wood, i.e., not well sanded and smooth like other wooden tracks. The bridge was made out of cheap plastic. My child who said that all he wanted for Christmas was a Polar Express train barely paid any attention to this toy - he did carry the train around. We're keeping the train/tender/passenger car and donating the rest.
1.0	We bought this for our 13 year old son for Christmas.  It was great for a week and then wouldn't keep a charge for more than a second or two.  Very disappointing as the helicopter was great fun and not too hard to fly. We returned  it for a refund and did receive a prompt refund from Amazon.  We bought a similar helicopter from another retailer and it has been doing great.
1.0	Poorly made! A couple of the animals my husband I can not even begin to know what animal they could be.
1.0	No directions inside the box i got.  So we didn't play
1.0	This toy is way too hard for small children (4 years of age).  The magnet will not connect with the fish!
1.0	My mother has an older version of this, and it's held up well, although it now processes the right stack faster than the left.  Mine does them evenly, but the cards tend to fly out of the machine when only a few are left to shuffle.  The cards don't bounce in my mother's machine, but they do in mine.  Might have something to do with the slick and light cards.  The nine volt battery isn't good new$, although it lasts quite a while.<br />If I were a serious card player, I think I'd opt for the metal, manual model.
1.0	This is NOT 1:64 scale and is tiny compared to my kids fleet of 1:64 scale toys.  It is a standard matchbox size.  I only ordered this item because it was specifically listed as 1:64 scale and was willing to pay for what I thought was a special matchbox product line made at a larger scale.  This was way too expensive for just a standard matchbox toy.  Very disappointed.
1.0	This Elmo toy has put the fear of God into my daughter who avoids like it's a minion from Hell. The first few times she activated him she watched curiously and a little apprehensively. After that she just cowered behind my leg and cried until he was out of sight. Every so often I bring him back out to see if things have changed for her but they haven't. Now she sees him and cries instantly with a cry that's not just that of complaint but actual fear. I hate seeing my daughter like this so this toy is gone.  Strangely she likes Elmo on TV and watches him gladly, but this doll to her represents fear.    Also, after the first few tries the doll started behaving erratically and would get stuck in certain positions (or just freeze mid sentence) or just activate on its own without anyone touching it.    Not good.
1.0	These batteries would only hold charge for approx 30 seconds not just one ALL 5 in process of returning
1.0	It was not what I expected.  The doll made too much noise and you could hardly hear the music.  It would not always play the entire song.  My 18 month old granddaughter loved it, but I was very disappointed in the product.
1.0	Did not hold closed form..
1.0	this is nothing compared to rubic cube.  It streches out like a snake and then kids don't know what to do with it.??
1.0	I thought this would be a fun item for Christmas with the family, but to our great disappointment, we were not able to read any messages in the ball even using a flashlight.  It is such a rip-off!  I should have read the reviews before purchasing one myself.
5.0	He had Lego Star Wars I and wanted II. My sister-in-law says he hasn't changed games since he got it.
5.0	Apparently a child was let in and rated a game that isn't even out yet a 2 stars, It amazes me how many trolls are here, probably worse than youtube. I'm only rating it higher to not let people get the wrong idea about this Sonic game. Don't let the appearance fool you, it actually looks really good, watch the latest gameplay uploaded by IGN today.<br />[...]
5.0	I've played off and on for 25 years and thought this just &#34;looked neat&#34;. It was on sale so I bought it. That was a year ago. I'm buying another for my friend that is just learning guitar because this &#34;game&#34; sucks you into practicing for hours and hours.<br /><br />I don't really use the game as a trainer. I play along with all the downloads of the original artists. It is much cheaper than other play along packs like Jammit and allows multiple profiles so my children can create accounts. Also, instead of having to pre-choose whether you want to play rhythm, lead, or bass, this lets you choose by profile for no additional fee.<br /><br />As I said before, if you already play, don't even think about trying to use this as a trainer in my opinion. But if you don't play- BUY IT. Or, if you do play and want to jam around with original artists, with a modeled tone to match the original release, then buy it for fun!<br /><br />I really think this is a cool offering and only complain about Steam and its endless advertising to me. (the program runs in the steam engine)
5.0	My girls are in love with this game. Not only it is familiar to them (Because of the Disney characters customs)we can play all four at the same time.<br />It's awesome and very funny. Best of all, everyone can have a piece of the action.<br />Levels are full of enemies and lots of puzzles so my kids are always looking for clues and new goals. It really makes them think.<br />I highly recommend it if you want to have a very god time with the whole family.
5.0	Worked just like the original item.
5.0	Exellent Game. A Must Have For Devil May Cry Fans Or Fans Of CAPCOM Games.  Another Great Game By CAPCOM. Exellent Story And Characters.
5.0	ok ive seen some of the reviews on this and some say it works some say they don't for me it works great i put it in worked right away i copyed some data of my previous memory card and it worked get it if u need one works perfect
5.0	its in great condition when it came in and its what I wanted. I love the product,  and nobody recommended it
5.0	i dont care that this thing is white my other memory card had 251 blocks on it i moved everything from my black memory card to this one and i still had 900 blocks of memory left it arrived in perfect condition this is the best gaming purchase ive ever made
5.0	If your into strategy games then this game is for you. It has a great campaign game with a great story and you can also play online with god knows who. Plus, if you buy this game with the Asian Dynasties expansion pack the game gets even better. I don't own the Asian Dynasties expansion pack but I downloaded the trail software and it was great. I plan to purchase it.
5.0	This game is so much fun! It's great for multiple players and a good Family Fun choice. You will have endless fun and laughter! Enjoy!
5.0	This mat is great.  Some people recommend duct tapping plywood on the bottom of the mat some it responds better, but if you get a mat anywhere, I STRONGLY RECOMMEND getting one on eBay.  Usually, they are brand new and factory sealed.  They usually come in a sets of two (one for you and a friend) and sell for about $8.50 like this one (either in XBox or PS2) and $15.95 for shipping (The Buy It Now price on eBay is usually $8.50 but you can still bid on it to save a couple of bucks).  Shipping for these mats on amazon.com are $4.49 for 3-5 day shipping and $8.98 for two day shipping so you still come out ahead on eBay.  I got a mat that retails for $130 (its sort of like this mat) for $20 and $25 shipping.  For hardcore fans who really got some moves and play the DDR games a lot, eBay has the metal dance mats with the bar (looks exactly like the one in the arcades) for about $150 (not including shipping).  Otherwise, this is an awesome mat but if you want to save money and get one for when a friend comes over, get one on eBay (if you get one on eBay, search ddr or search ddr extreme). <br />
5.0	Just finished the easy level.  It wasn't as easy as I thought but it did keep my attention.  Very much fun!  Highly recommended!
5.0	This game is the sequal to the very popular game THE 7TH GUEST. This game contained decent graphics and much fun play. But the 2nd game is very very good....It has great graphics, amazing story line, and is very unique as  the first one. I would suggets this game to players of the age 15 and up.  This story is about your friend was kidnaped by the evil spirt known and  Stauf. You must go back into the haunted house and save her and finally  defeat Stauf...it has wonderful puzzles and is very realistic...I loved  this game...and for the price it is now its certainly and a must have...
5.0	This is funny.. I just like the different features offered on this game. I can't wait to really have a whole day to play.
5.0	I have a PS4 now and don't use my xbox much, so when my old charger broke I almost didn't buy a new one. But I use an xbox controller for my PC so I went ahead and bought this.
5.0	This is the funnest college football game ive ever played. Im more of a madden kinda guy but i find that i cant stop playin it to this day. If you still have a ps2 go out and buy this game if your a sports fan.
5.0	This was my favorite show and it always will be so I saw this game but I didn't buy it here. I got it 6 dollars at a store. So I have a wii and I have a GameCube controller so I decided to buy it. I must say that the game itself is pretty fun. Has the same humor of the show. So ignore the bad reviews. Just buy this game I'm sure you won't regret it. :)
5.0	I bought this expansion so that I could download third age: total war, which requires this game. I highly recommend doing because if you are a lord of the rings buff like me you will absolutely love this game! Third age is a mod for kingdoms that transforms the game into middle earth where you can play as good or evil, it is epic!!!
5.0	"If you wanted to know if this game works with modern systems since it was made in 2001 here's your answer. Yes. My computer laptop is a Toshiba Satellite AMD Athlon 64   Turion X2 Dual-Core Mobile Processor RM-70, 3 GB DDR2 SDRAM, 250 GB HDD. The game works perfect on my system but I only played it a short time and I don't forsee any problems. My OS is Vista Home Premium. The disks say OS is 95/98/2000/Me. It should work on XP since it works on Vista. I know there is a review out there saying that this guy has a computer with specs that tower over what this game calls for but he might have his hard drive like 85% or more full and have a big fragmentation problem that causes his computer to run slow and the game to hesitate and maybe get total system failure like he claims happened. This game has great graphics, of couse not as good as Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, but a step or 2 below but is still good! I had one problem. I kept getting a message \\""Problem downloading cres.dll file\\"". I tried downloading the game 3 separate times the same day and the game wouldn't work. I use a defragmenter in the background (Diskeeper). It must of been moving this file when I was trying to download the game. The game must use this file from the operating system instead of it being on the disk. I thought the disk was corrupted since I tried 3 times. 1 week later I downloaded the game and no problems. So if you get any message like this and run a defragmenter in the background, give it a few days then try again. I gave it a week. I hoped this helped you out!   Jack (IMMORTAL1)"
5.0	having fun playing with my friends
5.0	My son absolutely love this game....
5.0	my son plays several Mario Party games all the time over and over, they seem to never get old
5.0	Bought as a gift for my daughter. She seems to love it. Good deal.
5.0	After not being able to locate the light and dark trap teams for several months my son was ecstatic with both of them when the Easter bunny did find them. Totally enjoys both of them!
5.0	One of the best Video Games Console. Only U$49.99.
5.0	I love and want this figure but it is sad you cant get it anywhere for regular price<br />DO NOT BUY THIS FOR THE MONEY STATED ITS NOT WORTH IT
5.0	I am so glad they offer this protection, so many things break so  quickly. I think this should be included with purchase.
5.0	The Fallout series is very enjoyable to play.  I like sneaking around and shooting the bad guys and varmints from places they can't find me easily, and booby trapping any access.  I spend a lot of time in these Fallout games doing all the various quests that I can.  It's a lot of fun.
5.0	Works well...No complaints. Quick delivery. 100% satisfied.
5.0	I put this on my ps4, pushed it physically, moved the table, it would wobble a bit but it was firm, it was gone fall down would recommend this to anyone who wants a cheap version of the vertical stand, and its good material well worth the money.
5.0	I bought this 3ds as a gift for my boyfriend. He loves it. I liked it so much that I even ended up getting one. It is a lot of fun.
5.0	This product is great. You can exercise without having to have any extra equipment. You can select your music, backgrounds, and time duration for the exercises. I love it.
5.0	it is very amazing and awesome. if you do not own it then you most likely do not enjoy awesome things that are amazing.
5.0	This bag has a place to store the 3DS, the charger, extra styli, and has lots of game storage. I would recommend this to anyone who needs storage for their 3DS gear.
5.0	I bought the Microsoft Xbox 360 wired controller for complete compatibility with my Xbox 360.  Having just the buttons, thumbsticks, triggers and pad... straight forward design.
5.0	First things first;  Kirby megalomaniacs waited too long for this game.  Now, for the review.  This is an overall great game that shouldn't be pushed aside by gamers who think they are too cool to play with the lil'  Pink Guy.  Young people can simply play the game through and have fun,  while older gamers can get the hidden crystal shards on their quest.  Included is 3 fun four player mini-games that can keep you busy, a card  collecting sytem thet has the games baddies on them, and a lush &quot;two  and a half d&quot; environment.  The main part of the one player mode is  kirby's transformations.  Mixing bomb,  fire, spike, ice, spark, cutter,  and stone, there is more than 30 different kirbys to be, and also vehicle  rides too.  Anyone can find something to enjoy in this game.
5.0	I love this game. The tables are all real world tables, as opposed to those custom made ones. It is great getting the history of the tables as well. Lots of fun, highly recommend this.
5.0	I bought this game for my 10 yr old nephew and he loves playing it. its a very fun game.
5.0	Awesome, has great distance and the bass.... BOOM !!!!
5.0	If I had to pick one game as my all time favorite it would be this one. It was a strange time in my life and this video game was truly an escape. The world is so deep with poster artwork and just all the environments in general. w/ fps you really notice graphics and these are marvelous sure its no killzone 3...<br /><br />You cannot go wrong w/ this game, and you will not beat it in less than 15 hours, ive spent countless hours enjoying this game exploring, delving into the post apocalyptic las vegas :).<br /><br />Its so much fun, a little hint get your luck all the way so you can clean the casinos
5.0	So I happen to love the color red. This chrome red controller is awesome. The only thing I am a little ticked about is that the bottom half of the shell is black and not the same red crome as the top half. Thats ok because I will be swapping out some pieces to make myself an iron man controller real soon. Red Chrome and gold with blue guide button lights. I can't wait to get all my parts. This thing looks great as is out of the box but and has a wonderful smooth feel on the top half of the controller shell. It linked up to xbox quickly and works like a charm.
5.0	Speechless *** I love it
5.0	Super Mario Bros for the older consoles was great, even when played on the Wii's Virtual Console. The New Super Mario Bros. for Wii is even better. It allows you the classic type game play, 1 player, with the new features. It also has the multiplayer feature which is the best. This is a game even a 6 year old can play with no problem after a quick showing of the controls. I would recommend this game to anyone who wants to spend a little fun time together. Nintendo really hit this one good.
5.0	The game was in absolute perfect condition and was cheap compared to gamestop. Gotta love it
5.0	perfect replacement for the original looks exact and has the same color as the system, I woud recommend this  cover
5.0	I bought the package for the headset and am very happy with it.  Works perfect, sits outside the ear, very comfortable.  Tried the triggers but didn't care for them.  Haven't tried the HDMI cable or USB hub but they look very nice.
5.0	I think it is the best way to control your spending, making prepaid so fearlessly to register your credit cards in Microsoft (not going to be that no matter what happened with the same platform Sony).
5.0	Injustice: Gods Among Us is a hot game to have in your collection. To me....it's DC's answer to marvel's Ultimate Alliance.
5.0	It is awesome there are so many things to do. You can play in tournaments, or play the pros to earn money, or play many other games. You get sponsered by companies like Ping, Nike, Adidas, Callaway, and Clevland. I highly recomend this game.
5.0	Easy way to connect your Wii with HDMI, with no headache. I would recommend this if you want to get rid of the composite wires, or need those connections for an older gaming console.
5.0	Grand theif auto 5 is an excellent addition to the series. Rock Star hit it on the head with the story lines and graphics nor to mention the sound tracks. Love the hidden content you can fall into on the adult side of things. I have and will recommend this to friends.
5.0	Kids think this game is hilarious!
5.0	Exactly what I was expecting!
5.0	Packaged perfectly, and it was a lot of fun.
5.0	short, sweet, simple, and to the point....the RCA hooks are fine, but this HDMI converter turns the picture on the Wii into a nice crisp quality, that turns Mario world into a true fantasy world!
5.0	Kids loved it!!  Better quality than I expected!
5.0	I have been playing the fifa series since 2001. In recent years there has been small changes in the game play annually, resulting in more difficult gameplay for some, faster or slower gameplay, different a.i techniques, and so on. Furthermore, each new release always feels bad and unplayable at first. But after playing the game for a bit, you start to get the feel of the new gameplay. And it starts to become fun again (;
5.0	I originally had the extended case with a hump to accommodate the larger battery.This case is much sleeker and looks and works great
5.0	Having played Virtua Fighter since the very first one, I looked forward to this next installment.  VF 2 brought us texture mapping, VF 3 brought the addition of a fourth button (Evade) as well as uneven terrain which  played a factor in damage/blocking, and 4 brings us back to level playing areas and takes away the evade button bringing us back to the familar 3 button set up.  It's as if they wanted to make VF appeal more to the masses as with 3 it started to become a little too complex/hardcore.<br />The graphics are amazing, easily topping even the XBox's Dead or Alive 3.  Those who nitpick will notice the differences between the PS2 and the arcade, however most will not even notice.  They are that good.  Control is spot on, music and sound effects are excellent, and the game retains it's polished feel.  The animation is as fluid as ever with the characters performing moves as if they were real martial arts masters performing their moves in an exhibition.  The game seems easier to play than 3, as the game was tweaked for  moves being easier to do and perform.  VF4 brings two new characters to the mix , Vanessa Lewis, and Lei Fei,  while Takarashi is absent leaving us with 13 fighters.<br />Many extras abound with numerous training modes and extra costumes and accessories waiting to be unlocked.  Virtua Fighter has always been in the shadow of Tekken in the US when it should be on top.  Try it and see why it is the number one fighting series in Japan.  This should not be missed.
5.0	i just played the demo disc and i already love the concept, wish i could really play this
5.0	This is the best MLB yet!  The analog batting (which I had some trouble with in the previous version) has been made better.  The graphics are the best yet (I am not sure how they improved on last years graphics, but they did!)
5.0	Not as many levels as Lego Marvel but the kids think it's hilarious. They say it's better than all the other Lego games. (With 3 boys we have them all). We will see how it does against Lego The Hobbit which they're saving for now. (Please stop making Lego video games!)
5.0	First off i only play fps but then i herd everyone raving about this game and decided to investigate.  My findings where that third person shooters can be immensely fun and intuitive just like a fps.  As we all know all games are not created equal, some fizzle out half way through the campaign while others lag and have terrible online game play.  Uncharted will never disappoint or let up, its balls to the wall the entire game.
5.0	With the price of hand held game systems and how small they are becoming a $14 (or roughly) item that physically adds protection to the item is great. Priceless in my mind. As a mother of two boy who are not gentle but not overly rough with there electronics this just adds a piece of mind and when it just gets tossed on the couch and takes a bounce to the floor I know its likely ok. Or when it honestly just falls from my youngest hands because he is trying to be like his older brother I know it too is likely ok.
5.0	Th homerun derby where you get to break stuff and hit targets for points just never gets old.  great game an great seller.
5.0	"After hours of searching through the refuse that is the world of PSP-2000 protection I finally found a \\""system skin case\\"" that suited my needs.  There are a lot of storage/travel cases, one of which I will eventually purchase because the big, beautiful screen is not covered, but I was looking for protection while gaming.  Most of those either weren't made for the slim PSP or had major flaws, like not being able to comfortably use the analog nub.  It came down between a sure-grip silicone skin from eforcity and the PSP Slim & Lite from Nuri Tech.     I ultimately went with the Slim & Lite because it is completely clear, so I can actually see the Kratos glare I paid for.  It is a very nice-looking little case that doesn't get in the way of a single button or port and protects your investment from everyday scratches.  It's so thin that there is absolutely no button-pressing interference and everything just feels right.  The Slim & Lite attaches easily, but be careful of the back cover, which has very tiny hooks. You will need a separate storage case    Check out the Nuri Tech Amazon storefront for more color choices: red (ooh) and silver chrome, and red and black leather.  They also have some equally pretty PSP-1000 and DS cases.  Don't forget to get a screen protector and maybe a micro fiber pouch, too.  You can also order from NuriTech.us and there you'll find more pics and product descriptions.      Let's move on to the most important part of any buying decision, which you usually don't know the answer to until you've already entered into a relationship with the company: Customer Service.  Sometimes you find a new company that's the only one that has what you want and, of course, you can't find enough reviews about the company itself.  Well, you don't have to be wary about giving your money to Nuri Tech.  I ordered my products on a Thursday morning, with free 5-7 day shipping.  My order was packed and shipped that night and arrived on Saturday.     Now, that's not the part that impressed me.  I found a problem when I put everything together: one of the hooks on the UMD cover was smaller than the others, so was loose, and the filter was inexplicably scratched near the middle of the screen.  I emailed them about it that afternoon and they responded just over an hour later (on a Saturday!) that they were sorry to hear I got a defective/damaged product and sent out replacements, personally test fitting the UMD cover first.  I have never experienced better service.  It was, frankly, amazing."
5.0	This works very well.  I'm sure that a Harmony remote would do what this does and more but this was less than $20.
5.0	My 7 year old has been having a ball!  I have as well with this sure to keep you sweating and having fun game! Love it!
5.0	I needed a second controller for my PS3 and I bought this one so I could have another player on my game. It worked out fine and is a real good controller.
5.0	Came in no time at all, product was as advertised, well worth the money
5.0	So maybe FF8 has better graphics...so what? The storyline and gameplay if much better. I think the charachters had well more charachter. The histories were beautifully woven and interesting. The movie sequences and  side games were alot of fun. Sephiroth the bad guy had real style and  wasn't stupid like most bad guys. I got caught up in the whole plot for a  month and it became like my life. It did get alot of hype but it deserved  it. Although it may not be the best game in the world, now or ever, it will  always be in my opinion be the best and my favorite. I'll be like one of  those old Atari die hards or something. LOL. The plot touched me and many  others around the world who gave their time to actually sit and play it and  to those people you have a many kindred spirits out there who share your  opinion... play this game if you don't mind sparing the time or energy...  the graphis are abit old now but the story and gameplay is still  challenging and fun!
5.0	Got here in time and worked
5.0	Grew up on transformers in the 80s.  This is the sequel to war for cybertron and doesn't disappoint.  Story mode is decent but multiplayer is where the real fun is.  This game and war for cybertron are a must for any fan, they are the best transformers games.
5.0	I have been playing the Demo for over a month, and I can't get enough!  I  have always played a demo for about 2 or 3 days before I get tired of it,  and this is the first I have ever lost count of how many times I have  played it.  I stopped at 50.  This game should be in the number one seed  for game of the year. I preordered it before the demo was even released,  and I have not EVER reconsidered ordering the Collector's Edition. When I  recieve it, I will be on IV food for a couple of weeks, and then, maybe, I  will go back to work and school.
5.0	It was awesome daughter  loved it!!!!! Hope you get it very soon!!! Nice and easy to use! Please use !!
5.0	Excellent quality...children loved the game and are ready for next one.
5.0	But I'm a huge nerd and this game is entirely too fun. I've only made it to Moria and I'm having the time of my life... well my week, I guess but seriously, so much fun. It's not crazy hard, which is good because I suck so badly at most video games, unless it's Mario or Tetris. And the 3D is actually kind of gorgeous. The only thing I can possibly complain about are the loading screens. They are ridiculously long and annoying. Other than that, amazing.
5.0	Amazing! I receive x1 in 3 days after ordered it. You know, i'm in China, out of U.S.<br />and the games are so interesting, we enjoy that!
5.0	Halo 2 is one of my favorite games of all time for the original Xbox. The story line and the game play are like no other game I've played. I recomend it to anyone who hasn't played the Halo series yet (which who hasn't?!) if they can find a copy. Enjoy!
5.0	I have to be honest, I was a little leery of this product since it was considerably cheaper than any of the competition.  But for $35 it has been EXCELLENT.  I have mostly used it for playing X3: Terran Conflict, and it makes that game so much more immersive.  I've also tried my hand at Flight Simulator X and it's a huge improvement over my 1999 Gravis joystick that I was still using.  Plenty of buttons, great sensitivity, enough axis choices to assign pitch/roll/yaw however you like.<br /><br />My only complaint is on the throttle there is a detent at 50%.  While in Flight Sim this may be useful to hold the throttle at 50%, a smooth transition would suit my needs much better, especially in X3.
5.0	these are Christmas gifts for my 3 grandsons.  I know they are going to love it.  They have been asking for it since it came out.
5.0	It's just like GTA only with hacking that's all
5.0	I chose this rating because my 12 year old grandson loves this system.<br />The PROS:you can play gameboy games as well as D S games it's also wifi enabled and there are a WHOLE LOT of games for this.<br />CONS: about the only accessories you can find for this are the chargers, stylus, and I think thats about it.. I have asked at game stores and walmart and best buy  about cases and nerf  cases and they all told me you can't find things like that for the D S anymore.<br /><br />$50.00 is a bit much for an item you can't find protective cases or any cases for that matter. D S lite  cases are a tad small the D S barely fits and there is no place for the cord but it serves it's purpose.
5.0	Do a good job on time. I well buy something?
5.0	<br />SSX is a great game.  The controls are perfect, the course designs are challenging, the graphics are astounding and most importantly, the game is fun.  The formula of fast racing, wild tricks, and creative tracks makes for a game that is both challenging and a blast to play.            <br />SSX is a very deep game.  The game has 8 borders: each has 4 costumes and 11 boards.  There are eight different courses plus a tutorial course.  This may seem like too few tracks, but every course is so well done that it doesn't matter.  Dozens of shortcuts and secret areas in each course willl have expert SSXers playing through each many times.  The courses are also long; some take up to 6 minutes.            <br />The graphics of SSX are truly beautiful.  Character models are smooth, and the courses are widely detailed.  Each course has a very different look to it.  The sky, the snow, and the backrounds of each course are unique.  From a real mountain side to a snowed-in urban wonderland to an iceberg, the courses are refreshingly creative.  So creative are these courses that you can spot trees that look like they're straight out of a Dr. Suess book.  SSX is a real treat for eyes bored of PSone graphics.            <br />The controls of the game are very well-tuned.  Pressing up will accelerate, down will brake; both do flip tricks.  Left and right performs turns and spins.  Holding X will get ready for a jump, releasing will perfor the jump.  Pressing a directional button while holding x will prewind (increasing the speed of flips and spins).  Square is the adreniline button (a turbo that is recieved after doing tricks).  Triangle changes camera angles, and O looks backwards.  The shoulder buttons, in any combination, will perform grabs.            <br />The music is pretty good overall.  Effects are solid, and commentary is usually funny.  The songs, however are a mixed bag.  Some are great, but a few are just simply annoying.  The title screen music is pretty poor too.  This doesn't effect the game much, but is still noteworthy.            <br />Gameplay wise, SSX delivers.  The three types of races are:  freeride (no time limits or opponents), race (you vs. other racers trying to get first place), and showoff (trying to get as many points as possilbe).  During world circut mode, your character competes in race and showoff.  Earning medals gains experiance points which build up the character's skills, new courses, and sometimes new ranks and boards.  There is also a single event mode, where you take one event at a time.  This mode is also where two players can board together.              <br />Most importantly, SSX is fun.  The courses are so well designed and have so many secrets and shortcuts that I keep playing each one over and over.  After you've mastered the courses, perfecting your run is a joy (deciding which shortcuts to take and which to cut, finding the fastest snow, etc).  The eight characters are different enough that you'll want to win everything with each, a task that requires over 50 hours.  And just when you think the courses can't get better, you'll find you've unlocked a whole mountain to board down.            <br />I can't recommend SSX enough.  This is THE Playstation 2 game to buy.  It's fun, beautiful, fun, deep, fun, challenging, and a whole lot of fun.  Although there are some flaws (no game is perfect), this game is amazingly fun.  This game has the best course design in any game, some great graphics, is incredibly fun, and is easily one of the best games I've ever played.  Do yourself a favor and buy it.
5.0	We bought this game about a month ago..........and we have a lot of fun, every peripheral is essential; it gives you the real feel.      The Frisbee, I love the design, it matches to a beach look and its foam so it feels very comfortable in hands and also environmental friendly    The Wakeboard attachment is the right size and does the job, Bow attachment is really cool, and with this attachment my kids learn how to aim. - Row boat paddle, Ping Pong, Golf Attachment, and the Sword, I have one without the M+, no comparison, much more fun with the M+, it pays the upgrade.     In conclusion,   Pros: Increases Fun, Great Quality, Good Price,   Cons: The remote is strong in the attachment
5.0	I got the silver controller to replace the original black, and absolutely love it. The look is very unique, and the feel is different from all the other DualShock 3 due to the finish; I didn't see many reviews that discuss this, but the surface is a matte finish instead of the standard glossy finish that all PS1/PS2/PS3 controllers come with, which is actually very cool. The slightly-textured finish provides a better feel and better grip during long gaming sessions. I had been looking for a sleeve or something to improve the grip but with this finish, the grip is just perfect. Another observation - this controller seems just a touch lighter in weight as compared to the standard black controller.     I highly recommend the silver version of this excellent controller!
5.0	Wipeout XL is one of the best racing game ever created. Whether you're a racing fan or not, the game is a must have.
5.0	We love our new/ used wii. We just found out from a friends kid we can play u tube on it. Great movies and things.
5.0	My daughter loves it & it's a great family game.  We play it all the time.  It's like playing the real game.
5.0	let me start off by saying that this game had one problem and that was you were limited to one city and its outskirts and thats kind of a let down when compared to the previous game. but then you realize that the story is all about your character going from poverty to making it big in the city and that makes it better. besides there is plenty to do, not to mention good graphics, action and a pretty good story. may not surpass the previous title but its definatly not in its shadow, its more equal than what most people said, definatly recomend it
5.0	This was also purchased for my fifteen year old son who loves cars.  Exciting and fast paced fun.  Excellent choice.
5.0	The game was still sealed when i recieved it, it wasn't the american edition though, it was the uk version, which isn't a big deal but besides that it was a good buy.
5.0	Although I've only made it through 2% of the game I'm amazed at the graphics and physics they built into this game. I enjoy just driving around and checking out the city. Check out Time Square for instance. At some point I'll play the game seriously but for now I'm just in awe of what they've done. Check out the Cinematic view. It's very much like they've programmed a camera in a helicopter hovering above your car as you drive around the city. Highly recommended.
5.0	Fast shipment and product was just as described.
5.0	When you are playing any Contra you know you've got a good one! Contra 3 for the SNES is no different. This is the game that made me want a Super Nintendo.
5.0	This is a great blast from the past.  This game is like Yoshi meets Tetris.  I prefer it on the Super Nintendo though, I can challenge people on that system.
5.0	My son initially bought the Wii and Guitar Hero for his room but the whole family enjoyed it so much that we purchased a 2nd Wii and guitar for our family TV.   So much fun!!!   Even my husband and I (late 50's) have fun with it.  Totally recommend it!!
5.0	Note that this game might not be a good choice if you haven't played the previous Suikoden. But for anyone who have played and knew what previous Suikoden were like, this is a must have of the year.<br />The game's strong point lies on its well written script and storyline. You will have to think, guess, and use your own skill to fully enjoy the story the game provides and to accomplish missions. Same thing applies to any Suikoden in the serie. Suikoden 3, too, make my tear drops when I played it. You will become heartfully into the character, a feeling FF series can NEVER give you.<br />The drawback is, in the saddest part of the game you will NEED to know the character to fully got into the game and get the feeling. Anyone who has never played any Suikoden might not find it too enjoyable.<br />The 3D isn't a super realistic modelling like FF. Instead it got a Japanese style comic quality to it and the model itself represent the character's exactly the way they were drawn. Very nice in my poit of view. The movement and the emotions the characters express are GREAT.  You should note that Japanese style comic drawing is a LOT difference from US comic drawing style. And this game really has the japanese feel of comic to it.<br />There are not much CG movies, animations, or any cut scenes. If you are looking for only eye candies like FF I'm sorry this isn't the game for you. Even the Ending of the game is simply in-game models but very very impressive story and conversation in it.
5.0	This game has it all, graphics, action and just plain fun. once you started playing it was hard to stop. You always wanted to see what was around the next turn.The challenges were always coming at you and got progessively harder.keeping on track and haveing the right wepons at the right time kept you on your best game.The only disapointment was that after the tower and Eldrith were defeated there wasn't MORE! Please give me MORE?
5.0	I bought Brain Challenge for my 10 year old grandson and he loves it.  He plays with it a lot and the nice thing about it is that he is learning and having fun doing it!  The program tells him how much of his brain he is using to solve problems and play the different games  - he always likes to inform me how much of his brain he is currently using (which I do enjoy hearing).  I believe that this program will help him tremendiously with math!
5.0	These fit Gameboy Advance games perfectly. I got exactly what was pictured. I can read the label through the case. They are probably about as hard to open as the original Gameboy cases were back in the day.
5.0	9 year old granddaughter loved it.  They have a WII and play with it alot.  The girls think it's great
5.0	One thing that i dislike about most games nowadays is them not having much replay value.This isn't really the case with this game,Ive played it through and through and still find it fun
5.0	I think the Batteries work great. I charged them up and can easily get 40+ hours of game play. They seem to last extremely longer than regular throw away batteries; and they even out perform  AA rechargeable batteries.<br />Just be sure you have a charging base for them. This item is just the battery packs. You will need the actual Xbox charging tower. A regular rechargeable battery station will not work.
5.0	My son loves the Lego games, and I like him playing them.  They are fun action games, without all of the blood and gore.  This is a very fun game.
5.0	protect your goods. this ish protects my 3DS XL like it's no one's business. and it holds up to 3 games and some other junk if you want to hold the other junk. it's hard case is like a turtle butt softer to absorb impact. hell yeah that's what we're talking about. so get this shizz for your 3ds and your 3ds will thank you
5.0	I bought this to hook the Wii to my Sharp Aquos HD TV and it worked just as we expected.
5.0	Borderlands is only the sixth game I have played on my PS3.  Although COD4 Modern Warfare is my favorite game so far, this is a close second.  I like the RPG elements of the game (it reminds me of playing Knights of the Old Republic on my old Xbox) combined with the first person shooter.  I haven't hooked up the PS3 to high speed yet (trying to decide which provider to choose) but I'm sure it is a blast in online play!  I've had the game for a month now and I've only played through single player with two of the four player classes.  There is good replay value, even if you do play the same missions each time you change characters.  I can't wait to get online and see what else Borderlands has to offer!
5.0	It functions properly in my son thinks it looks really cool.
5.0	Well I plugged it in and it works, but I think it made my old flashdrive think itself was empty. There wasn't anything I couldn't redownload on it so I'm sure I just didn't read something correctly. (Or read at all for that matter.))
5.0	Very good game and fast shipping as well
5.0	These are FANTASTIC and are being sold for a great price! They are very easy to put on and take off and are extremely comfortable. I love having these skins on my controllers rather than not! There is more grip on your controller when you use these. Of course, the colors looks better when on a black or white controller. But there's a red skin for your red controller if you have one. I put it on my dad's and it looks great, it's the same shade of red as the controller so it doesn't look weird.    I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THESE!
5.0	Great package. Greater fun.
5.0	I hurd about this game from one of my friends. So when i went in to turn in my ps1 i got THE BOUNCER!!<br />And let me tell you this game is so much funn the replay value is very high. The only problem is as you go it goes from incredably hard to childish easy. <br />The video modes can and do get very boring. But you can skip though them!? And the vs mode is fun as well
5.0	For the Old school players who enjoyed Zelda, Phantasy Star, Wilow, any RPG from Nintendo and Sega times, worth every cent.
5.0	What needs to be said other than: this is one of the best, if not the best, Metroid games ever and I'm really glad to have it once again.
5.0	First of all I have to start with the fact that this is not for an average rock band player. The Fender Mustang Pro is for the rock band player who has done well on hard or expert.<br /><br />With that said I can't believe how well this product works, the strings feel natural and holding the guitar feels just like the original rock band guitar ( with the exception of the frets of course). I bought this guitar because I want to learn how to play a real guitar, rock band 3 has really great tutorials and with time I am sure I will master the game just like I did with the two previous games. If you are thinking of buying this as a gift and you don't know the skill level of the person you are giving it to, I would advise not to buy it. For me it is working great and I now have a great guitar teacher built into my ps3 :)
5.0	I purchased this for my son for his birthday and he loves it. The bigger screen is great and makes it easier on his eyes, which I really like. Highly recommend!!!
5.0	I accidently put my retail cd thru the paper shredder and i needed a replacement.  This game is fantastic, i have been playing since 2003 and love every aspect of it.    For more information visit us at [...]
5.0	This game, looks great, and plays great! I never played any of the other Max Payne games before. I didn't need to, because this game explains what happened to Max Payne before and what his current situation is like. The action is fast, but the bullets are faster you'll have fun with this game for hours. The story line is so good that as it goes on it'll be hard to put the controller down.
5.0	Nothing fancy but it gets the job done perfectly. This is exactly what i needed and the price made it even better. Despite it not being a hard case so far its survived two long trips and a very long chewing session with my dog(your experience may differ) and my disks have been perfectly fine definitely recommend this product.
5.0	Great game my son like it great saller two got here supper fast so im happy I bought this game I really recommend two any one that has kids....
5.0	Good accesories for Xbox One controlls.
5.0	"Etrian Odyssey 3 is yet another game in the Etrian Odyssey series, and they've done nothing but improve with each iteration.  The most notable improvements from the previous game involve the FOEs.  They're a lot more sensible, and more like the first Etrian Odyssey than the second.  While in Etrian Odyssey 2, the normal FOEs were almost impossible to defeat until you had leveled enough to reach the next two or three floors, and you'd want to wait until the next STRATUM before you went back to face a red FOE.  Now it's at least possible to beat a normal FOE the first time you see it (...if you have a massive number of items to help you) and red FOEs can normally be taken down without too much extra leveling.  They also give you experience again, which is a plus.<br /><br />The difficulty overall seems to have been scaled back just a touch.  That's a good thing, because in Etrian Odyssey 2 it felt like the developers had a personal grudge against you.  It's still very hard and challenging, but it doesn't feel cheap.  Except against certain FOEs, and then you're at least expecting it when they whip out some massive party-devastating skill.<br /><br />Additionally, there's the sailing you can do.  It's a great way to get some extra money, and blow off some steam if your party just got destroyed by the Labyrinth.<br /><br />Another thing I like is that the developers have been incorporating more of a plot into each successive game.  This one apparently has three different endings (and the requisite \\""New Game+\\"" option that comes with multiple endings).<br /><br />I've only just beaten the second stratum, but already this game has shown itself to be a definite improvement on the previous games.  If you liked the previous games, you'll really like this one, as will anyone unfamiliar to the series but looking for a challenge."
5.0	I found this game on Amazon for a really good price and ordered two of them! So far only one has been used as the other is a birthday present, but the kids LOVE it! I love the convenience of the FREE SHIPPING, although it tends to have me shopping on Amazon way too much...LoL
5.0	The protection plans are greadt i have used Square Trade before and never had a problem with them and pricing for there product is always fair.
5.0	I love having a classic remote when I watch a Blu-ray.  Using a controller is okay, but this is easier when watching a movie.
5.0	I have been having issues with picking the Ps3 eye in place when I play my move games. But with this device, its now so beautiful. It sits perfectly on the top of my Hdtv. Its a wonderful piece of device.
5.0	If your child has a Game Boy Advance this is a must to make life easier.  Along with the Carrying Case, Ear Phones (a must), Game Protector, Lite Shield, Rechargeable Battery Pak (saves money), a Car Adaptor, and an AC Adaptor...all very useable.  What else could they (or you) need.  Good price.  Have seen the AC Adaptor alone sell for $20 and the Car Adaptor for $15.
5.0	I bought this along with the Zumba core after using the original one. The graphics are excellent, quite an effective upgrade.
5.0	Awesome Christmas gift.
5.0	Works fine and better condition than the one I got back in the day over a decade ago
5.0	My love this game for Christmas also it came early than said love it. Thanks a lot
5.0	The game works very good no issues at all.<br /><br />The thing I liked when I put the game in though was I see there was a file that was new no accomplishments or anything done but good to know he actually tested the game before actually sending it to me
5.0	Where can I buy a new set of this tetris?  We love this game!  I have a set that is going out, need a new one!  Help
5.0	Great game in the Skylander realm!
5.0	Aesthetically tasteful and effective design, adjustable weights and quick dpi control via easy access buttons, excellent performance.  A hard-to-beat value at this price point.  Buy it.
5.0	Received on a timely basis and got exactly what I expected.
5.0	Both kids loved them.  Smiles were a mile wide.  Got on the net with no issues, taking pics, playing games
5.0	Excelect product thanks alot
5.0	I bought the Zapper because I liked the way it looked and wanted to have something to shoot with.  But the game that comes with it was worth twice the price.  A WII game for $20?  The game is one of my favorites.
5.0	I did not regret this purchase, good deal and wonderful product
5.0	its so nice and better than to buy battery more like cost over 5dollars or 10 dollars forget it.. that quick battery is pretty easy and save money
5.0	I am in love with this game . It really is the perfect simulation of a modern day bureaucracy because as mayor not only do i not have a clue what is going on.<br />But I cant even get anything done if i tried. Some of these reviews are positively inaccurate.They decry the wait just to play but I say that is a perfect representation of how things are done today. Have you been to the DMV? the wait is quite similar.<br /><br />I believe this factor makes it the best city simulation and anybody Else's opinion is just JIVE talk.
5.0	"Loved this game!  I like simple action-adventure, \\""Mario-like\\"" games and puzzles.  There is nothing new in this game, but it was fun to play.  Graphics are good.  Music is not annoying.  Levels get progressively more challenging.  Plus, it's Garfield!  Who doesn't love Garfield?    I also played \\""Garfield's Fun Fest\\"" and found Nightmare to be much more entertaining.  If you are trying to decide between the two, go with Nightmare."
5.0	I have no complaints.  It saves my games, and it fits in my Wii.  What more could I ask for?
5.0	Christmas present this title never disappoints always a good choice in sports gaming
5.0	"If you like flight sims as I do, especially study flight sims that is the most realistic as possible, you will love this game.  I have and played Falcon 4.0 and this is what that game should've been.  It's a quick install and ready to fly without having to patch or troubleshoot it.  For some, just the dynamic campaign is worth it. This game is scalable to novices so you can \\""grow into it\\"" if desired.  I haven't played multiplayer on this, but it is available for those interested.  Read the review on [...] and see for yourself. At $30, it is $10 cheaper that most new games.  This is a must own for any hard core flight simmer, and probably soft core flight simmer.  I would guess that those who want an arcade style shooting game look elsewhere.  Just my $0.02:-)"
5.0	I bought this game hoping to enjoy it with my brother.  I was greatly pleased when I started to learn the different themes that are presented in this game.  I love the Star Wars series that Lego had made (along with T games) and I was greatly pleased with them.  So in comparison, this game has even more elements incorporated into the gameplay which makes it a very real and awesome experience.  Lego really did a great job with real voice actors which adds to the story/comedy of the Lego games.  My brother and I both love the Lord of the Rings story that they followed with accuracy and I am extremely pleased with it.  If you enjoy or have enjoyed the basic and first Lego games than this one truly is a great game to buy.  It has the same simplistic feel but with many many more elements and even places to go.  The whole style and level build is somewhat different and very exciting.  I recommend this to...lets just say anyone a fan of either Lego games or Lord of the Rings, for this game was fantastic.
5.0	I got this game for Christmas. It's really easy to use and a lot of fun. The Kinect responds to your movements accurately, and will keep you entertained for hours. I enjoyed playing with my young nephew, and my Dad even jumped in on the fun. Definitely worth the money and an awesome change from the typical remote control gaming systems.
5.0	Great game.  Time well wasted.
5.0	"I loved the original games in the series and I'm so glad to finally see the first one re-released for the Nintendo Wii. It's just as great as the original and I really like the new Nico storyline.<br /><br />There's just one problem, I want more! I hope they will re-release the rest of the games in the \\""Broken Sword\\"" series. Be aware of the Nintendo DS version though, since it doesn't have any voice acting.<br /><br />I would love the game re-released for the Playstation 3 too, in high definition, since the Nintendo Wii isn't known for good looking graphics."
5.0	i love it i use this cord to charge my 3ds when im  by my computer or i plug it into a wall charger adapter.
5.0	There are plenty of comprehensive reviews about Burnout Paradise already, so I'll cut to the chase: Burnout Paradise is a great game.<br /><br />Look, I'm long past my teen years. I grew up slamming the single red button on my Atari 2600 joystick and winning free ships in games that rewarded fast reflexes. This means I'm not too good at doing complex button combos (that means YOU, Heavenly Sword) and I don't have much patience for configuring a racecar with 500 separate components (sorry, Gran Turismo).<br /><br />Burnout Paradise is, at its heart, an arcade racer. People like me can get started and slam through a few races without much hassle. If you are looking for a Totally Realistic Race Car Simulation, this isn't it.  As for me, I like how it's possible to play without having to earn licenses or pass skill tests.  All too often, driving games force players to go through a lengthy training period and wade through screen after screen of configuration options. I just wanna drive like a maniac, man!<br /><br />Additional thoughts:<br />*Great graphics--Paradise City contains lots of areas to explore, all in stunning physical settings.<br />*Online play is fully featured and well-designed, with lots of different challenges and activities for both individual and group play.<br />*Fans of the two previous games in the Burnout series will miss the awesome (and awesomely fun) destruction of Crash Mode.<br />*Something that is frustrating at the beginning is that it is incredibly easy to get lost. When you're in the middle of a race, especially on a big TV, it is impossible to drive and watch the radar/map display at the same time.<br />*Something that is frustrating throughout the game is that the race finish lines are often in the middle of nowhere. That means a lengthy drive to get back to the start of a race. This becomes really tiresome when you're close to finishing the game and need to win just one or two more races.<br />*The narrator's voice, attitude, and script is incredibly annoying. I wish there was a way to shut him up entirely.<br />*What pushes Burnout Paradise from a four-star to a five-star game is the incredible amount of FREE updates Criterion has made available. If only more game studios and publishers realized that giving some decent content away makes players more likely to pony up for the paid stuff! Thank you, Criterion, for continually updating the game and for not nickeling-and-diming your customers to death.to shut him up entirely.  *What pushes Burnout Paradise from a four-star to a five-star game is the incredible amount of FREE updates Criterion has made available.

5.0	me encanta este juego soy fanático a hitman es un juego en lo que lo vi uff lo recomiendo y lo compre soy de venezuela y lo recomiendo para todo el mundo gracias y me llego en perfecto estado
5.0	This is a very fun game.  For the $$$ it came with the entire band.  The only thing I wish they would change would be more songs.  There is only about 15 songs on this game.  The guitar and drums are fun!!
5.0	The original Gothic blew me away and remains one of my favorite games.  Yet somehow Gothic 2 is even better.  Both are spectacular 3D RPGs where you are able to wander around the vast, beautiful environment doing whatever you wish.  That freedom alone is 1/2 the game.  Where most RPGs force you to tromp from point A to point B for various tasks, Gothic 2 lets you decide what you want to do.  Exploring is not only fun, it's rewarding as well.  Sure, you'll probably encounter beasts that will tear you to shreds..if they catch you.. but you may well also find hidden treasures, underground caverns, and hidden valleys.  By literally stepping off the beaten path, you never know what you're going to find.  In the first hour of playing Gothic 2, I had discovered a hidden stash of potions, a spot where someone had fallen off a cliff and died, consisting of a half-buried skeleton with a rusty sword and silver ring I could take, been chased up and down a path in the woods by a very hungry young wolf, and hidden in a flock of grazing sheep while a nearby shepherd killed off some giant insects that were after me.  Great stuff.<br />Gothic 2 is nearly identical to Gothic, but simply is much larger in scale.  The somewhat clumsy combat interface combined with the strength of most monsters means it's often wiser to talk to people and otherwise work on your diplomacy skills rather than just kill everything for the experience.  This isn't nearly as tedious as it sounds, because the voice-over quality is very high and you'll often gain EXP or items by cleverly interacting with other NPCs.<br />Gothic and Gothic 2 are those rarest of games, ones where not only does the time just fly by while you're playing them, but that you always find yourself wondering what's over the next hill.  Train your magic skills, tiptoe around on rooftops to steal people's items, or become a devout paladin.. whatever you do, you'll just end up coming back for more.
5.0	"After years of enduring one add-on package after another for the first Sims -- which really didn't add much more and cost a tidy sum -- I wasn't expecting too many bells and whistles with Sims2. In fact I was hesitant to even buy it. <br /> <br />Boy am I glad I did. <br /> <br />They have completely revamped the game -- the mechanics of it are comfortably familiar, but the additions and the tweaks make it a whole new, uh, (ball)game. <br /> <br />Get your Sim fit enough and suddenly he or she can do Yoga to exercise, instead of mundanely lifting weights. Watch the \\""food\\"" channel and your Sim both adds to his fun meter, but also learns a cooking skill point. <br /> <br />Make your Sim happy doing activities he or she wants and you get \\""bonus\\"" points that you can use to unlock special prizes -- some of them good, some of them bad, but you have to experiment and use them and find out. <br /> <br />Your personal interactions with other Sims have changed dynamically as well. You can flirt and tell jokes, like the old version of The Sims, but keep flirting and suddenly you can burst out laughing as you watch your Sims disappear under the covers of the bed to \\""woo-hoo!\\"" ... after which they typically pass out and sleep forever. Ha! <br /> <br />There are far too many additions to this game to list here. From specifically designing how your Sim looks -- high forehead? big eyes? full lips? -- to determining what aspiration they'd like or what clothes make them (literally) squeal with delight. You can even make a Sim that looks like you -- with your own attributes and personality quirks. Then let \\""you\\"" loose and see how you interact. <br /> <br />The final great thing I'll say about the game is that you no longer have to babysit your Sim. The artificial intelligence in this game allows your sim to function without having to be told exactly what to do. Sometimes it's neat to sit back and watch the fishbowl. <br /> <br />The only negative thing I would say about the game is that I'm not overly fond of how quickly these Sims age. Yes I said age. Your Sim can go from a child, to a teenager, to an adult, to an elderly person. I wanted to hold on to the \\""youth\\"" of some of my Sims a little longer than was allowed. <br /> <br />But if you are like me, debating on whether it's even worth buying a copy of this game -- do. You'll lose days of your life, but you'll be fascinated by the process."
5.0	The most impressive thing about NWN is that there are 7 races and 11 classes to choose from. Each race has different skills and abilities, also the classes have different skills and abilities.  Think of all the endless possibilities that you can have just selecting your own character. The races are: Human, Dwarf, Elf, Gnome, Half-elf (a mixture of a human and elf), Half-orc(a mixture of a human and orc), hafling.<br />I am not done even telling you about the classes.  Some races have a favored class like a Half-orcs favored class is a barbarian.  But most of the races do not have a favored class.<BR>The classes are: barbarian, bard, cleric, druid, fighter, monk, paladin, ranger, rogue, sorcerer, and wizard.<br />There are 77 ways to select your character. Well make that like 57 ways because you dont want a Half-orc being a wizard but if you want to it will be very original. If you want more information about NWN I suggest you go to nwn.bioware.com.<br />I hope you like my review and will be waiting to see you on multiplayer.
5.0	I bought this controller 3 months ago when i got my dreamcast, and it is working very well. The buttons work, it just has a different feel. It is a little bigger than the normal dreamcast controller, but is just as good. I would recommend this controller to anyone
5.0	I received my cable and hooked them up to my ps3 and they work great. I haven't had any problems and would recommend them to anyone.
5.0	These games run together
5.0	Very fast shipping, nice. Installed on Windows 7, no drivers needed to be downloaded. Works perfectly, no lag that I can detect... there is a tiny bit, but I'm pretty sure that's my tv and not the adapter.
5.0	I recently purchased Chuzzle for my daughter and son-in-law.  Both work as attorneys in what used to be the fast paced world of corporate real estate. I wanted a stress buster for them. Chuzzle is just that.  It is by far one of the most addictive games on the market. Although it is an effortless game, one never becomes bored. You will quickly find yourself forgetting the cares of the day and instead, concentrating on trying to move and match those multi-colored fuzzballs. Bet you can't play just once!
5.0	When I was a little boy, I always wished for batteries, but never got them. Now, WOWparts has delivered to me, on time, the most wonderful battery gift of all. Ones that recharged and let me kill more foes on Blops II.
5.0	OMG the best flight sim yet, first i would like to point out that i went from 98 to 04. It is a very good game...  IFR is the SH!@ it's like awsome. Vor gives you much more room and space to do what you want and not have the ATC screaming at you.<BR>The space and control you have in 04 is the best yet.<BR>You can actually land on the rnwy of your choice for example it's like &quot;MS fly straight in for rnwy 35R&quot; you can say &quot;Can MS get 35L?&quot; then if it is open the ATC actually gives it to you. And with the intelligance to deny pilot landings at some IFR airports. For example once I tried landing at LAX and it said and I quote &quot;landing denyed airport only accepting IFR clearences and landings&quot; It is the best. And the weather system is great you can download real weather from Jeppesen and actually fly in that exact weather. Imagine your town being rainy and in flight sim it does that and when it stops almost instantly the weather adaptes to the weather in real life.<BR>The wright flyer is almost unflyable but still flyable for like 5 min only. The glider is for experiance pilots only. The livery's for the boeings is the best yet. the lear jet has really improved over 02'.<BR>But i must caution you that you must have a good computer to enjoy this game to the fullest.<BR>I have an AMD Athlon XP 2100+ with an Nvidea g-force fx 5200 ultra with 256 mb ram and it runs great but on medium high and the global aircraft quality on medium low.<BR>Get this game only if you are interested in flying and pursue a career in it.<BR>THIS IS NOT A GAME!!! It is a Flight Sim.<BR>But if you are interested in flying get this game.
5.0	It is exactly as it's described.<br />It's fits perfectly with my Vita and I've been looking for something like this for a long time where I do not want a bulky case, but something to cover my Vita and still protect it.<br />If you are in the same situation I was in then get this<br /><br />Worth it!!!
5.0	good game among the few ones we got for this system<br />i hope more games like this comes out in the future
5.0	The game arrived within the given ETA. And i was very pleased with the product. Thanks Amazon    The game itself is a great FPS co-op game. I've actually enjoyed playing this product more on PC due to easier controls, better graphics, more experienced players. However, the 360 version is not too bad as well. Definitely a must have game of the 2008 collection.
5.0	Our family has had a lot of fun with all the Just Dance games. I'm a bit biased (cos I'm a huge MJ fan), but this one tops all of them. This has everything a King of Pop fan could want. Great music, amazing dancing. Definitely a must own for any fan.
5.0	I bought two of these cases for my sons who have a DS and now a DSi.  The cases hold all of thier game gear and games in a very organized manner.  Well worth the price.
5.0	I'm liking it still learning this game if you like subs then you'll love this one a fun game for sure.<br />Even the training is fun but the missions is you really get your game going you have to use your head in this one!!
5.0	In there i forgot to mention that the drow elf will soon be a playable character.
5.0	Baldur's Gate is one of the most immersive and enjoyable RPGs that I've played. The plot is very interesting, the characters are wonderful, and I can't put my finger on exactly what does it, but somehow this portrait of the Forgotten Realms draws me into the game world like nothing else I've played before. The first time I fired up this game led to a 24-hour gaming marathon with no food or sleep; that's how engaging it is.<br />You play a young man (or woman -- you create your own character) forced to leave his home under suspicious circumstances early in the game, and you find yourself out in a hostile world seeking answers about yourself. The story in this game is more personal than the traditional task of stopping the madman who wants to destroy the world, though it still becomes epic in scale, and is very well done.<br />Along the way you'll meet a number of NPCs (non-player characters), up to five of whom you can take with you and control. Since there are a number of character classes available, and each class has a vast array of special abilities, managing your party requires a good deal of thought, and engaging in battle requires a sound strategy. A well-balanced party is essential. The game itself is very well-balanced, so there are always numerous ways to attack any given situation.<br />The game is very large, and spans five CDs (six if you include the expansion). You can stick to the main story arc if you want, but there are dozens upon dozens of optional side-quests that you can attack as well. This is part of what makes the game so immersive, I think -- the fact that you so often have very significant interaction with all the minor characters in the game, rather than having them just spit out the same line of dialogue every time you meet.<br />There are only two drawbacks I can think of to this game, and they are minor gripes indeed. The first is that the game is based on the D&amp;D 2nd Edition rules, which are outdated now, but the game still plays extremely well. You just don't have access to the additional options that 3rd Edition presents.<br />The second drawback is that it may be difficult to get into this for someone who's already played Baldur's Gate 2. As good as this game is, the sequel surpassed it in every possible way, and so it does feel like a significant step backwards. Don't let that dissuade you, though. Especially at the low price you can now get the game and its expansion for, it is well worth the money. Be sure to check out the sequel when you're done.xtremely well.

5.0	The PS3 is fast and very quiet. The camera and motion control is very good. Target sent the package in perfect condition at the time agreed.
5.0	This is a dumb little game that I can play for hours upon hours.  Is faithful to the on-line version.
5.0	This game was my favorite game for maybe a year when I was younger. The graphics are about average for a n64, but it is way more fun than the average n64 game.    You have about 5 or 6 different fun/funny levels, and you can unlock different beetle's(including the tye dye alien bug).    I spent more hours on this than I would normally admit to, and would recomend it to any racing genre fan.
5.0	Do I need Internet to play this ?
5.0	It looks great! Thank you so much for the great work!
5.0	It doesn't beat out the first game, but it's good. I bought it as a gift and a little bit for myself, and don't regret it
5.0	My son loves this! It's very responsive and still has all the characters that makes Mario, Mario. All of our old friends are back - the Princess, Luigi, Wario and even a couple new characters from Super Mario Galaxy. It's a little pricey, but the graphics are worth it.  Alex's Mom
5.0	With Sony's new PS3 v1.80 System Software, you can now do what everyone here complained it did not do. You can copy those copy-protected files over to your PS3, and now you can even copy files back from your PS3 to your Memory Cards. So be sure to get the adapter before people raise their prices!
5.0	Even though the art book doesn't contain anything that can't be found in the art of the trilogy release, the patches are still cool and so is the steelbook. Clearly you shouldn't get this unless you're a big fan, but any big fan will surely enjoy it.
5.0	Great controller; after a few days of breaking in, it feels just like a SNES controller.  Wish the cord was a little longer but oh well.
5.0	It's a pretty easy game and if you get stuck there are many hints to help you. Unlike most games, hints help you figure out a game rather than skip it, which was quite appreciated. But you can choose to skip a mini game if you choose, so you aren't stuck playing a mini game you dislike. There's a large variety of puzzles and some hidden object scenes with a detailed story of a woman with special powers that falls in love. I really enjoyed the game :-)<br />  Unfortunately, I can't say this about part 2. But the ending to part 1 was satisfying enough, that I am not annoyed choosing to not finished part 2. I just wish it was like part 1 ! ;-)
5.0	This game is one of the best game ever!! The story, the graphics!! You can even play 3D with the glasses on a regular TV!!! We are so happy with this game!!!
5.0	I can find NO way to get these other than Amazon.<br /><br />Im very thankful for this and will cherish it. Great job but I wish it had more content.
5.0	this game talk about what happened to Poe...along the game you pick up the raven.  each raven you pick allows you to get hints...eerie...talk to ghost...help them..visted several places and rooms..solve the mystery and help the ghost you meet...absolutely a game to have...another good one to play at night....good graphics and story line...loved it...<br />seemss midnight mystery series have great people working to make their game interesting with great graphics...another msut have...
5.0	great item - works well. goods arrived exacltly on time . . . . . . . . . . .
5.0	There is much to like about the game, even if it does have its faults scattered throughout.  Even when it gets into a weird section that you need to power through there are enough interesting side quests that change enough throughout time to keep it just interesting enough. The speeding up battle mechanic made it interesting as well.
5.0	I figured skipping out on the 3d wouldn't be a big deal for him and though I sometimes reconsider whether or not it was the right decision I don't consider whether or not the 2ds is worth it in and of itself.  It functions well and does what I expected and I suppose that's all you can ask for.
5.0	This game is great for any fan of DC comics.  The character creation is surprisingly deep, there are tons of items, what seems like an endless number missions, and notable superheroes throughout the game.  There are many hours of gameplay to be had in this DCUO, and the game never gets old.
5.0	Fun and Very useful to use for my school purpose as well as private use and I will recommend it to my friends.
5.0	I have owned every GTA game ever made, i still remember GTA1 where the graphics were so crap but every game they made was a major improvement and GTAV is no exception. GTAV is the best game ever made period. Just buy it if your debating weather to get it based off the reviews. And i have much more appreciation for the game because i live in LA so i can cruise through some streets on the game and notice certain areas where i have been in real life, so thats pretty cool. Recommended game of the year!
5.0	I simply love this game, the solo play is amazing, story-lines are well written and engaging.  First MMORPG I play where its actually fun to level your character.  People have to play it to find out. You cannot go wrong with this game, even if the MMO part is not appealing to you, it has 8 amazing story-lines that are each an RPG on its own.  Yes there is room for improvement but I have faith in Bioware and the potential that they will develop this game to be one of the best in the genre.
5.0	I had played the demo version on my PS2 back in 2004 and loved it but never purchased the full game until now for my 3DS. The game is really fun and had my heart beating whenever a guard would get suspicious and check out an area Snake was in. Plays well on my 3DS but I'm not fond of the 3D effect so I turn it off when playing.
5.0	In the pictures I thought this controller looked great and when I got it in person it was even better!! I am extremely satisfied with it and have no complaints.
5.0	This product has worked excellent.  It was easy to connect and set-up.  I have had no problems with it.
5.0	They guy I bought this for would play day and night if he didn't have to work and sleep. It is a brilliantly fun game.
5.0	Really laid out great and really addicting<br />Fun to play<br />Great Story line and amazing characters<br />love graphics and awesome
5.0	This is by far the best couch co-op game I've played so far and my husband and I have played our fair share. The only games have come close to this fun are Resident evil 5 and beat'em ups like warriors, metal slug and ghost busters (wii). This game was built for co-op play and wouldn't be nearly as fun playing solo.
5.0	Seriously it works great and has the solid feel to it of any other official ps3 item. dont buy knockoff controllers.
5.0	A GoTh iNJected, maTHEeMaticaLy MoRPpheiWooRFFY deCENT into fUn.  Grin and chew... CHOMP CHOMP CHOMP.
5.0	LEGO & Rockband. What more can I say? Oh yeah... EVERYTHING IS AWESOME!!! Everything is cool when you're part of a team!
5.0	bought this for my grandkids - they like it
5.0	I love the this condition. reallly night cover page and booklet.<br />Disk condition is great than I thought. it works well
5.0	Look, this is a reveiw:  I currently live in Japan which means I've had acces to this game way before the release date in the U.S.  This game for the GBA is just the same as and just as exciting as the original for SNES.  The sounds and gfx are outstanding and, even on the small screen, things are easy to see.  The controls are basic and there are multiple spaces to save your games in progress.  Child or adult, i recommend this game to any fan of Mario games.
5.0	The Nintendo 64 is a old, but still fun system to play. It does not have as many games as the Playstation, but it does have alot more 4 player games. The graphics are fairly good on most of its games, but it still takes cartriges. I've had one for a while and it is still fun to play. The N64 has awsome titles like Super Smash Bros., Kirby Crystal Shards, Zelda, 007 Goldeneye and more. The controllers are a little on the chunky side, but after a while you get used to them. If you are looking for a system with good graphics, great titles and not a huge price to pay then go for a Nintendo 64.
5.0	This is just an all around fun game for the family. Easy to learn and play. The Wii makes this even more fun than previous versions. if you have played previous versions then expect the same with the added fun of the Wii controller.
5.0	I've been a loyal Playstation fan since the PS1 and every console has been just as awesome this one is not any different.
5.0	Este es un juego obligatorio que debe tener todos los amantes del tenis de mesa. los movimientos son muy realistico e intenso. los golpes son rapidos y variados. la lista de jugadores esta muy balanceado y cada uno tiene su virtud y defecto. no se como no se me ocurrio comprar el juego desde hace tiempo. tal vez me deje llevar por los videos de youtube en que lo muestra lento y tosco, pero cuando estas en el juego la accion es muy rapida, debes tener reflejos muy rapidos para ver en que direccion va la pelota y el tipo de efecto que lleva la pelota para responder adecuadamente.  graficos: 5/5  realismo: 5/5  jugabilidad: 5/5  en linea: no lo he probado todavia    solo desearia que tuviera mas jugadores y que los torneos fueran un poco mas largo, pero en general es un juego altamente recomendable.
5.0	Its cool.hard too find
5.0	AWESOME...this game is unique in its format and also allows ease of character movement.  The story line is superb as well
5.0	Gave this to my grandson for Christmas. He asked for this game on his Christmas list and can't seem to get enough.<br />Hours of fun.
5.0	This is mainly a review for the Collector's Edition. This is the first collector's edition I have ever got for a game, and luckily when I did Amazon had good price on it. I usually avoid collector editions unless the price is good, and this one at the time was. In this edition, you get Fallout 3 the game in a basic case, a lunchbox, Vault Boy bobble head, art book, and making of the game DVD. The highlight of the edition is the lunchbox and bobble head. Surprisingly, I have been able to make good use out of the items in the decision. In particularly I love the bobble head. I am not a stickler for statues that comes with games. I love video games, but I am one to have statue of dragon or spartan soldiers sitting on my desk. However the bobble head is different. Its just a quirky little bobble head. Not some big paper weight statue. It complements my bobble heads of various athletes and Dr. Evil nicely. Next is the lunch box which is decorated with sweet artwork from the game. Which is this retro 1950s style. On the sides of the box have various vault boys and the fronts and backs depict ads for the Vaults. I don't use the box for my lunch but it has been great for storing items. I have yet to watch the DVD, but the art book is very nice. Its hard cover which I like and is filled interesting concept art.  I like going through it to see where the devs started with creating this wonderful world in Fallout 3. This is a good little collector's edition!
5.0	Great gaming headset.  Polk represents itself and its products well too.  I had no issues whatsoever with my headset, but I have seen posts of others having problems with sounding tinny or muffled through their mics during gamechat.  I received a microphone in the mail yesterday from Polk that im assuming got sent to everyone who purchased one.  Customer support and service, not to mention a company willing to stand behind its product 100%.  I'll be buying more Polk products in the future just because of this experience.  Thanks guys.
5.0	It's FIFA.  Can there be anything not to rave about?  The gathering is at my house.  Usual great quality and entertainment.
5.0	The chance to own a game that will affect how you look at video games and how you feel about them come few and far between.  I am a fan of the series and please beat all the other games unless you won't get all the flashbacks in the game.  It has amazing visuals and once again the story is so envolved that it seems to evolve as you reach the climatic ending to what is probably the best series ever in a video game.
5.0	This box set contains a key code that will unlock a free permanent Cisco car and a account wide gun of your choice like the Scoped N-tech, Whisper, NVR-Scout  or a shotgun. Plus it gives your 500 G1 points and 30 days of premium. This is the best deal I have seen yet and a real bang for your buck purchase.<br /><br />I love this game so much I purchased 4 box sets and will buy another just so I can complete my account wide gun collection and get another 30 days of premium.<br /><br />Thanks again!<br />Reapfire Gaming<br />gg
5.0	Excellente juego, es una verdadera simulacion de manejo, los graficos son de lo mejor, y las pistas parecen reales. <br />Es un juego al que hay que dedicarle muchas horas si se quiere avanzar.
5.0	Love it, when the CPU doesn't cheat to come back late in the game to win, but this is a 2K thing, other games from them, same thing. Computer doesn't like to lose!
5.0	Smoother than PS 4 version.
5.0	A very good case to protect PSP.  Looks and feels sturdy at a reasonable price.
5.0	The game is fun. The new game flow feature works well and if you don't care for it don't use it. This game always is a catch 22. If they change anything people get mad and if EA doesn't people complain it's just a roster update. I like it a lot and look forward to playing with people I know online. If you aren't sure you can try the demo off PSN or XBLA. If you like that you'll like the game.     Who Dat! Two Dat!
5.0	Potential is apparent right from the start. Battlefield has almost ironed out network code but Forza is stunning, Kinect is finally what it should be, and the machine itself is very well built. Worth every penny the extra 100 clams over PS4.
5.0	Kid loved it now wants the movie
5.0	Fun game, but nothing that special.  For price though (under 10), good deal, well worth it.
5.0	my newphew<br />loves it
5.0	I purchased this game, not expecting much, but, WOW! This was outstanding! A must-get for ANY PSP owner who is into fast-paced third-person shooters.  Pros: Graphics: 10/10 (STUNNING graphics. BEST PSP graphics in my opinion!) Controls: 10/10 (Very easy-to-learn controls!) Sound: 10/10 (GREAT sound, even with the volume low!) Storyline: 9/10 (AWESOME storyline!) Weapons: MANY, MANY weapons, as well as unlockable weapons, and weapons you can take from your enemies. Yu also get a tazer, fists, and a K-BAR combat knife.  You know what? Don't think, just click Buy, you WILL be satisfied, guaranteed!!!
5.0	As a fan of the James Bond games, I cant recommend more this game to lovers of action games (especially bond games). I totally recommend it!
5.0	It has four games, but we only play golf and bowling.  They are both very much fun and well worth the $15.
5.0	I hadn't got to use my spare controller much because most of the game we have right now are just single player, offline, but its identical to the original which works great.
5.0	Great price for the game
5.0	This is a great zombie survival game.  The graphics are nice and the gameplay is eerie.  It takes a little bit of getting used to the features of the Wii U gamepad in relation to the game, but after that it's easy to understand.  At around $20-$25, this game is a steal!!
5.0	I love it had it for two months and nothing wrong with it . Worth the money you won't regret it
5.0	Great game! Blizzard has really outdone themselves with this one.
5.0	This is a must have for the Skylanders collectors. A 5 star seller, thank you.
5.0	best entertainment system around
5.0	I bought this for my kids (aged 6 and 8) and it's a great way to get them moving and have a good time.
5.0	buy this game if your a fan of the classic james bond actor sean conery and the movie you wont be sorry
5.0	If you're anything like me, you squirmed in your seat and grumbled aloud as Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman affected onscreen romance during the last cloned movie. Maybe you muttered oaths about George Lucas and reached into your box of beloved jujyfruits for solace--only to find that greens were all you had left. Like me, you'd been duped into giving up your cash for something just because they slapped the Star Wars tag on it. You weak-minded fool.   <br />But a la Han Solo in the first Death Star assault, Knights of the Old Republic has emerged to give us...a new hope.  Actually, to say the game came out of nowhere is a definite exaggeration; Bioware has long been known for making outstanding and deep role-playing games, but they have outdone themselves with this first console effort. The first element that separates this game from not only other RPGs but Bioware's previous efforts is that every line of well-crafted dialogue is spoken, and voiced by outstanding actors. Interaction with the many characters who join your party is important and every party member has an interesting back-story that you can draw out of them as the game progresses. Your party members also interact with each other in interesting and somewhat unpredictable ways. In addition, some of the back stories of party characters involve quests and intersect with the game's main quest. <br />The RPG elements are incredibly deep and balanced. You can customize your character in nearly every conceivable way and develop him/her as you see fit. The feats development tree was one of my favorite elements. Also, you almost always have a number of choices as to how you want to handle a potential quest. You can be the darthest of the darth or Gandhi in a Jedi robe or walk a path somewhere in between. These choices have an impact on experience, money, items and can open or close other quest branches and affect the way people in the world interact with you. For example if you win a swoop bike tournament, everyone in the respective city will be buzzing about it. I am anxious to see how things are different if I play the game as an evil dark lord pawn instead of as a morally ambivalent Jedi. <br />The combat is also fantastic and stays fresh and involves the perfect level of difficulty. As with the other great Bioware RPGs, there is an important tactical element to the combat. If you simply let your characters rush into battle without guidance, they will not survive the difficult encounters. While combat is turn-based and can be frozen at any moment to allow you time to give numerous commands to your party members, the actions are carried out in the most convincing real-time execution I've ever seen. <br />While I've only had an XBOX for a couple of months, I found the graphics to be outstanding. Every world felt unique and had terrific detail, including ambient audio and visual effects like water lapping the shore, trees swaying in the breeze, wandering around, etc. The character models looked terrific (I found Bastila to be particularly...ahem, saucy) and the light saber and blaster fire seemed straight out of the movies. <br />There have been a few minor gripes made about the game, only one of which I found to be legitimate. The first gripe is that the frame rate takes a nose dive in hectic battles and other random sequences. I never noticed this--or perhaps I was so possessed by the force that everything seemed to move in slow motion for me--so I didn't notice. Another gripe has been that the Jedi characters are far too powerful for non-Jedi. I didn't find this to be the case except possibly at the very end of the game when high-level Jedis have so many powers its tough to keep them out of your party. The one legitimate gripe is that you cannot equip characters while on your ship. This is an annoyance since it's your starting point for every new world you explore. <br />These smallest of flaws do not affect your overall enjoyment of the game. It is a rewarding,balanced and well-crafted game the folks at Bioware have put together and it would be a shame if any XBOX owner missed it. Go on and buy it, meatbags.
5.0	Works great. No issues. Reminded me of when I was a kid. NOw our kids love to play it. :)
5.0	I'm glad it works, it's a generic brand, so if you want to play the old Xbox games off of this hard drive. You can't. I didn't know that until after I ordered it
5.0	This was the first game I played on N64, so this game brought back lots of great memories.  The game was just as I remembered and I really enjoyed playing it again.  It was just as fun as I remembered as well.
5.0	I got this for my step son because he is rough on headphone,, So I ran across this one and the price was right,, So far its holding up very well and he is very happy with it..
5.0	"\\""L4D2\\"" nails the zombie genre on the head. The game plays as if you're in a movie. It keeps things simple. There are no complex puzzles, but you still have to think your way through levels and develop strategy, and in the end it's still a blaster. The numerous game modes, such as scavenge and survival, give you the best elements of zombie movies in game format for endless fun. All told, it will take you a long time to play through and conquer every part of this game, and you'll enjoy every adrenaline-drenched minute of it, with creepy surround sounds, cinematic environments, endless action, zombies that really scare you, and fun cinematic moments and dialogue. And multiplayer will keep you gaming for a long time after that. This is probably the most fun you'll have with zombies and is arguably the best game in a genre where there really aren't that many games, at least not stand-outs. You have your \\""Resident Evils,\\"" but those are more involved puzzlers with darker, more complex stories. \\""L4D2's\\"" focus is putting you in the center of a pop cinematic zombie apocalypse, keeping it very accessible and fun to come back to again and again. And it's as close as you can get right now to starring in your own zombie movie. Slap on the low Amazon price, and you have a can't-miss PC game."
5.0	I played it for 5 minutes, and quit. not the game was bad, just I was not ready for it. Did not want to play yet. maybe later
5.0	Battlefield Vietnam is as stunning as was the original Battlefield 1942 when it came out. It makes leaps beyond the original battlefield however, and therefore requires a more powerful computer to run effectively. If you have the equiptment you are in the position to enter a simulation of the vietnam war unlike any ever made. This game blows the original Battlefield, and its mods, away. The terrain -- whether it be in jungle or city -- is more complicated and realistic, offering endless strategic possibilities. The weapons are sick, from the heavy machine guns to the helicopters and jet airplanes. The action is just more realistic all around, from the graphics, to the sounds, to the gameplay. <BR>I bought this game expecting a mod of the original game -- something on par with Secret Weapons of WWII. But this game goes waaaay beyond a mod. It is, in short, state of the art. There is a bit of bugginess that can cause it to be a heavy load on some servers, producing lag. And, again, it does have high demands in terms of your computer, but if you have the right equiptment these problems will seem trivial in light of the greatness of the game. <br />My computer has an AMD Athlon 64 3k+ processor with a radeon 9800 pro video card, 1 gig ram.
5.0	This is by far the best update for the sf4 series, it comes with all the previusly released dlc's and is still the best fighting game out there.
5.0	My daughters had the original Skylanders game and wanted the Giants for Christmas. I purchased this starter pack for them and am very pleased. It was shipped fast and was in time for Christmas. My daughters love the game!!
5.0	they work pretty well and were delivered quickly
5.0	Super Mario Galaxy is, without a doubt, one of my favorite games of all time, surpassing Super Mario 64, the likes of which are modeled after in this magnificent game. The graphics are outstanding and magical, and without the typical &#34;good for Wii&#34; comment. The soundtrack and music are astronomically amazing, as they are performed by orchestra. Gameplay is simple yet addicting, and very easy and fun to take part in. If you're considering getting something to remind yourself of the glory days in Super Mario 64 or even Super Mario Sunshine, I would DEFINITELY recommend this game. The game is a magnificent work of art that should NOT be missed by anybody, gamers or not.
5.0	This product worked fine for me, and It's much cheaper than in-store or through XBOX.  I would buy again anytime.
5.0	This is the craziest game in the world, you fight monsters and zebras with ultra powers.. you skate board acts as a ray gun when you type in &quot;totllydiffgme&quot;....... and if you press x 3 times fast bob burnwuest comes up to you with a hammer and says he is working on the railroad all the live long day. Outsatnding graphics the alligaters look life like. When i saw the lightning effects i almost peede my pants. <br />This game is a must but because not only is it a boarding game its a fight, action, adventure, beat em' up, racing , car combat, sports, First person shooter and more<br />Get this game this instant
5.0	He loves it. He loves the older games and the visuals.He loves that he can download and carry his games to go.
5.0	Sweeeeet buy!!! Very very immersive and interactive. So much unlockables. I love using Superman. Punching Batman to space is one of my lifelong dreams as a fan.
5.0	These are amazing games, I highly recommend!<br />Great or good enough story and even better game play!<br />If you like Greek mythology you will most likely love this game.<br />If you like hack and slash 'em games.....you WILL love this game!<br />There is also some puzzles and stuff that are enjoyable.<br />These are a bit more difficult than god of war 3 fyi, if you have played that before playing these.
5.0	This game is perfect to play with your friends. Horde mode is better and extremely challenging.  One of my groups favorite games to play when we are all hanging out
5.0	Naughty Dog rarely if ever disappoints. The game's characters are extremely well done and it really draws you into the drama. There really is nothing I can complain about, its a masterpiece.
5.0	I highly recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of Hideo Kojima. This game is a work of art and magic. Great graphics. Killer soundtrack. Every aspect of battle is fine tuned. All in all a great game. Looking forward to Kojima's new silent hill with Guillermo Del Toro. I'd give it a pretty good/7 but I mean 5 stars will have to do. ;)
5.0	Really great a ton of fun upgrades come from packs so you never know what your going to get
5.0	Overall I must say that I am impressed- but not quite floored. I orginally got into the Flight Sim thing around FSIM 1998. Back then I found the system enjoyable and relatively fun but limited in nature. I tried the 2000, skipped the 2002 version and waited for the 2004. I must say that it was worth the wait. They added much more ground school info which goes a LOT more in detail that the previous versions. The graphics and sounds are scalable and gameplay is interactive. Most importantly, at least to me, the Simulation is detailed and gets into complex flight planning and radio/VOR/IFR operations.  You can do flight planning and the radio chatter is excellent and creates a great realistic effect. Gameplay is a vast improvement. The sole glitch so far is that the system tends to minimize itself virtually everytime you switch from the Ground School info to Flying Lessions or into the game play-I haven't figured out if it was a bug in the system or the programming. Although the min sys requirements tends to suggest this Program could run on a slower system, I don't think I would recommend it on anything lower than a Ghz -- with a mid to high end vid card. I have no personal knowledge of a glitch, but in my experience with gameing and sims over the years (I'm mid thirties) I believe the gameplay would be severely diminished on a slower system. The force feedback on my sidewinder 2 could be a bit more intense, but is otherwise quite enjoyable.  Graphics are scalable - but at the usual expense in processing speed. With  P4 2.4ghz 64mb vid card, I haven't had any other problems. Graphic renderings have improved both on the ground and in the air; although it isn't stunning they are pleasing. Ground cover is vastly improved as you approach the ground (e.g. trees, buildings, clouds, etc.) The true improvement lies in traffic situations or taxiing at airports. They have added additional &quot;real life&quot; sounds that you might hear in some situations - jackhammers in the background and other planes in patterns.  Radio Chatter is the biggest improvement and  Overall I'm impressed.
5.0	As described. Works well. Great price. I find the Anker as a compact hub is a with great portability and effective use.
5.0	This is a great game for novice's and/or beginners! I downloaded it about a year ago, before I new a flush from a straight. since then..I've won the millon $ multiple times. <br />Best of all, I like kickin' the pro's butt!   <br />I highly recommend this one.
5.0	Works great and is a great place to store the controllers too.
5.0	very fun game very easy achevment pts i havent tryed out the 3d yet but im shure its awesome  add me on xbox ---> ItsFaSho
5.0	My grandson loved the game which arrived very promptly.  We ordered a wii version and received an x box but he has both so no big deal.
5.0	This was worth the money I invested. I'm happy I made the purchase. Buy with confidence, friends. You won't regret it.
5.0	I used to have a playstation when I was younger and now my kids are little and love video games. I always thought playstation 2 was the best! Especially Super Mario Brothers! I started looking around trying to find one and I buy almost everything on Amazon so I started here! I saw that this company, Pella Dvd's was selling playstation 2 video game consoles, a bit pricey, but the games we already had from years ago still worked, and none of them are violent like so many are today. The first one they sent me stopped working after 2 days, so I contacted Brian at Pella DVD and he had me send it back, he even reimbursed my postage! He shipped another one out to me and we got it in just a couple of days. This one works great, the people are nice and easy to deal with, and responded to every email I sent within just minutes, it seemed. I will definitely do business with this company again. My kids love this game system!
5.0	Rayman is getting some excellent reviews from professional reviewers and for good reasons. This is one of the smoothest looking and most polished platformers ever on a Nintendo systems. The controls are excellent and the game length was fine for the price. I did have the game lock up a couple of times which was surprising in a modern game but besides that I have no complaints.
5.0	Definitely worth buying if you want to make screens last longer and look sharp! Probably get more later on.
5.0	Legos are the&#34; IN&#34; thing right now and my 5yr old loves it! There are so many things they can do and explore with several different characters. Mine has finished the game but continues to play it-there are a lot of things he had no idea about the first time, so he gets into the game more, each time he plays it.
5.0	Awesome game system and the controllers are a lot better, its very quiet even when playing games on it and the monthly updates bring more and more features that make it even better. Can't wait for Halo: Master Chief Collection and Destiny to come out!
5.0	I have played rock band and am impressed but when guitar hero 4 came out i was blown away. I have loved guitar hero for a long time the guitar is much more challeging making for a much more fun game than rock band. YOU CAN MAKE YOUR OWN SONGS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Have you heard of rock band being able to do that at all? I thought not. plus the songs are waaay better even if some are live. as a veteran of both i recommend guitar hero ALWAYS over rock band.
5.0	I baught this udes Nitendo Wii Console with Mario Kart Wii Bundle for a nice price. It is as good as new. Working just fine. Enjoying playing the games.
5.0	This game is amazing and anyone with a Wii U must own it. Those considering a Wii U, consider this game to a be a perfect welcoming intro to the console.<br /><br />Bayonetta 2 took what made the first game fun and exciting, and ups them to the max. The mechanics from Witch Time, switching weapons instantly, crafting items, collectables, and Bayonetta's badass, thrill-seeking, and sexy charm are enough to make this game wonderful.<br /><br />They also added other great elements from new characters, new levels, enemies, weapons, techniques, and the new Umbran Climax. The dialouge between Bayonetta and all the characters is well-written and sometimes funny. The battles are well paced and you won't feel too overwhelmed with the well furnished pacing. The weapons are fun, and being able to pick up enemy weapons adds to the fun. One of my favorite features is the difficulty curves. There is a mode for those who want to experience the story and embrace the exciting gameplay without being too hard, a mode for those looking to get in and be challenged right away to make the game more fun, and a challenging mode for more experienced players where your combos and witch timing skills will be put to the test. You will love using Witch Time and Umbran Climax. The bosses are also epic.<br /><br />I wish this game could sell more because great games these days dont sell like Mario and COD, and that causes potentially great franchises to die. Buy this game and you won't regret it.
5.0	Another smooth and easy transaction..Highly recommend..Thanks Again! A+++++
5.0	so, i got these turtle beaches from my nearest gaming store and i have had them for about a month or two now and the sound quality is great. there is indeed a slight hissing noise but it is barley audible when playing any type of game, and as said in other reviews can only be heard when at a quiet part in the game or at the xbox dashboard         for MW2 players out there, the greatest part about this headset is hearing other player's foot steps but i would also reccomend swithing your joystick sensitivity to a higher level so you can rreact to the foot steps you hear. from my own experience. even when the enemy is using ninja and only knifing people, you can still hear the blade bieng pulled out and can react to that noise      would reccomend to any serious gamer for the xbox 360 console :)
5.0	Great awesome innovative idea from Nintendo as always. But you can find these at gamestop or Walmart for about ten dollars cheaper.
5.0	This certainly doesn't look like it would be a good controller, but it actually is!  The people in my life who've used it haven't complained once.  It's a good controller that you should pick up and buy.  Your Xbox will thank you.
5.0	I think this is the best Slugfest game yet.I loved the others but, they got boring because they werent realistic enough.I love how they now allow trades,free agent signings,lineup changes,and best of all,u now have a complete pitching lineup and bullpen.It definitly is better than the ESPN Baseball,Allstar Baseball,MVP Baseball,and MLB series.It truly is THE BEST BASEBALL GAME EVER!!!
5.0	"The game stars a young teenager, Neku, a kid sick and tired of the world and the people in it, who wakes up in a strange version of his hometown with all his memories gone. It turns out to be a game organized by a strange group that calls themselves \\""Reapers\\"" where he has to work with this strange preppy stalker girl, Shiki, to win the game in 7 days or face \\""erasure\\""!    The game play takes a little time to get use to, but feels extremely satisfying when you do get good at it. You control Neku at the bottom screen with the stylus and control Shiki at the top with the buttons, at the same time. This sounds a little confusing, at first but you quickly do get the hang of it, the game also features many ways to adjust the difficulty to your liking. You equip pins to modify Neku's psychic powers, most pins also have brands that get enhancements depending on the trends in your location. In fact, even the clothing that your characters equip get bonuses based off of the trends.    The game even takes the ideas of trends and fashions and applies it to the art and music. It's soundtrack features a trendy mix of Hip-hop, Rock, Techno and JPop reminding some of other artistic games with trendy music such as Jet Set Radio. The art as well is hard and edgy, with many sharp edges and strange proportions, it definitely takes style and cranks it past 11.    The only thing I can say where it lacks is the lack of a multiple player battle mode or co-op, (It features multiple player in the forum of a fun mini-game) and that it has only one save file. However with the intriguing story (with it's surprising plot twists), addictive gameplay, quantity of things to explore, collect, and customize, and killer sound track and art, The World Ends With You is a game you do not want to miss! (And with the game being hard to find you should check back as often as possible to see when it is available)    A WARNING TO PARENTS: This game is rated T for Teen. Some games rated T are more okay for children than others, (with content matching what is often in children's cartoon shows despite being rated T) . This game however, is not the case, despite the kid-friendly design of the characters this game this game features a lot of STRONG LANGUAGE and ADULT CONTENT, and I strongly suggest this for ONLY AGES 13 AND UP."
5.0	"It's no secret that Killzone 2 is one on the most hyped games of the current generation of consoles. Since it's first appearance as a teaser trailer years ago the game has garnered a lot of attention - both good and bad. I'll admit that I was a bit skeptical only because games that receive so much pre-release hype rarely live up to promises or expectations. Having beaten the single player campaign and spent a reasonable amount of time online I can safely say that Killzone 2 is one of the finest console First Person Shooters I've played.<br /><br />Graphically the game pushes the PS3's hardware to new highs. Arguably K2 is the best looking game on the PS3. Character models, the environment around you, heck even the load screens are impressive. What's even more pleasing is that the game is absolutely intense. Battles occur on a large and breathtaking scale with dozens of ISA (friendly) and Helghast (enemy) forces battling it out. Another nice touch is that the environment features destructible areas. Shooting at enemy hiding behind a pillar for instance will start blowing pieces of the pillar away.<br /><br />The storyline is probably K2's biggest shortfall though given the genre it's not surprising or unprecedented. For anyone who played the first game you'll know immediately what's going on. For everyone else, expect a standard story with they typical plot twists. Though K2 doesn't really explore anything new with it's storyline it does entertain and provide reasonable motivation to press on.<br /><br />Next up the controls. After reading some other reviews I was surprised by how many people cited the controls as lacking. Or more specifically it seems that most people are comparing the controls in KZ2 to Call of Duty 4. So let me knock this out right now. Killzone 2 is not Call of Duty 4. It is an entirely different game with it's own unique configuration and learning curve. If you go in expecting Call of Duty 4 you're only fooling yourself. That said the controls present no problem to me. Thankfully Guerrilla included several unique customization options. So tailor them to your liking and get in the game and learn the controls. Why people go in expecting other game developers to essentially copy games they've already played is beyond my understanding. Embrace the new experience and if you can't get over it, go and play Call of Duty 4!<br /><br />The online portion of Killzone 2 is just as well polished as the rest of the game. It's difficult to describe just how deep the customization system truly is but I'll try. First, the game features the ranks Private through General. Killing enemies is only one way of earning points. There are many other game modes including \\""Seek and Destroy\\"", \\""Assassination\\"", \\""Body Count\\"" and more. Each of these present unique ways to score points. Additionally the game rewards players with ribbons upon completing certain criteria. Ribbons add up and eventually unlock medals. Medals grant your player with certain abilities. For example the \\""Kill Count\\"" ribbon is awarded for killing 10 enemy players during a match. Collect 8 Kill Count ribbons to unlock the \\""Natural Born Killer\\"" medal which grants you the ability to carry more grenades. Simple, rewarding and addicting.<br /><br />If you have any doubts left about the quality of this game forget them. Go and buy it!e.

5.0	loved it , but 3 days later it is not working??
5.0	This is a great game that teaches you the fundamentals of Texas Hold'em and helps you develop winning strategies.  The game is easy to work with and very user friendly with challenging computer opponents.  I strongly recommend it.
5.0	"SpongeBob SquarePants: The Battle for Bikini Bottom is a great game for all ages. It is especially fun for adults who are \\""video game challenged\\"". It is lots of fun and the graphics are great. This game is not for the serious gamer."
5.0	I loved this game! It's scary at first but you get used to the jumps. Also the gameplay is very different and very very fun! The story line is amazingly fun and creepy. I suggest you get this game if you enjoy puzzle/shooter.
5.0	Love this game.  You will spend hours upon hours playing this game.  Large open world.  Multiple levels and bad guys.  Love the artistic and graphic ideas for the game.  Different from all other games in terms of graphics.  Great game, I definitely recommend it.
5.0	Was actually looking for the OEM gray thumb sticks but got theses instead and the only difference is the color.
5.0	I received the case yesterdy and I think I am going to like it. I can play my games while it is in the case which I like because trying to hold the GBA with my adult hands they get stiff.I don't think I will be wearing it around my neck so that is not a problem.It is really cute.
5.0	My grandson is in love with spongebob. I purchased this for a birthday gift so he hasn't used it yet.  He has other spongebob games and they are his favorites as I am sure this one will be, too.
5.0	Backyard baseball teams up with Major League Baseball and The  Major League Baseball Players Association to bring real-life  baseball pros to the neighborhood baseball diamond...as kids!  They have players from Mark McGwire to A-Rod,Ivan  Rodriguez,Randy Johnson,Larry Walker,Chipper Jones,Barry Bonds,  Sammy Sosa,Ken Griffey Jr.,and much,much more! As well as all major league teams. And you can play people on the internet. Theres game modes like season,single game,and batting practice. Plus you not only get the game but you get baseball cards with the game and its a whole lot of fun for anyone.Enjoy!
5.0	Absolutely fantastic for the price.    The general idea is this -- it can hook to PS3, Pc, or XBOX 360 (including mic in all cases) and/or a cellular phone. It comes with a sound mixer as well to facilitate this.    In the Box:   -- Mixer with plug for one of two headset cables and another for the xbox cable on one end, and two cords coming out the other. These are a short 4-pin connector for your phone, and then the usb 2.0/3.5mm combo for powering the whole system and the sound via the 3.5mm with the mic being usb powered.  -- HEadphones (obviously)  -- Cord to connect to the xbox controller for mic functionality  -- Both a standard headset mic and an in-line (one-button) mic -- either of which can plug directly into a phone if desired. (NOTE: These cords plug into the headset directly, for what it is worth, there is no none-mic option as far as I figure, but I could be wrong. . .I don't really want one anyway).    Sound:    I had some driver issues at first -- update yours and you should be set though. That said, the sound is perfectly 'fine'. I've had better phones for the price, but not headsets, and never had any kind of mixer at all in the price-range so I think it was a good compromise all in all. A few basic sound-tests and it seems they are quite reliable, and have plenty of range for most people. Audiophiles and just snobs in general will have plenty to say about the flaws here I'm sure -- all I can really say though, as I am not of that ilk, is that the sound is fine, but it doesn't compare to any of those beautiful BOSE headphones I've demo'd at the shop I keep telling myself I'll get one of these days. IF that makes any sense.    I really love the mixer though, so let's move on to that.    Mixer:    --- Big radial dial on the outside -- this is main sound (also has an 'off' position).  --- Two small sliders on either side of the paddle button in the middle, these set the balance of the levels of whichever of the two sound sources you have it set to.* Paddle button switches from game-chat + game to phone + game. I haven't actually been able to test the sound balancer of the game-chat + game on PC, but everything else on every other system I did test and it works just as fine as you'd like.  --  At the bottom of the circle, a 'phone' button ( can answer a call if its ringing, pause/play songs, double-tap just right and it'll skip songs like a single-button in-line mic and prolly other stuff I haven't even thought of)  -- An 'equalizer' button beside that. . .it has three settings, all of which are pretty 'meh', though I do have reason to change occasionally. Really tho. . .just a bit of bonus you can basically ignore. Oh, and it beeps (once, twice, or thrice) to let you know which of the three settings you just switched to.    The mics are both pretty clear, the mixer is convenient as all hell (no more fiddling with sound by any other means really) and the fact it comes with an in-line mic cord for your phone. . .as well as being able to pair with your phone WHILE connected to the tele is pretty dang neat.    OVer-all, that's what it really comes down to tho. This is -neat-. A couple conveniences, a fair price, but not at all the best of anything -- but headsets have always been a compromise between cost, mic and sound quality -- tossing in the mixer didn't fudge the balance on the other three in the least, and the mixer IS neat. So, well done.    I'd definitely recommend it if you need a -headset- for 120-ish USD or whatever it costs as you look at it. . . . if you just want headphones (since, really, phones have mics good enough you don't need an in-line at all anymore -- and not everyone does game chats) then go somewhere else --- and if you can/want to pay more -- there are better things at higher price points (with or without mics/gimmicks/bla blah blah).    EDIT: By the by, these broke (snapped just over the left phone) after about 5 or 6 months. Dunno why, just noticed the plastic had worn really thin there one day (they were bending out too far) and then a few days later it snapped.
5.0	Item arrived quickly, and was exactly what I had expected
5.0	This is our 3rd pair, our sons friend bought these after using ours. We have a pair for our son and my husband has a pair for the RV, they work great. Would highly recommend.
5.0	Just what my 8 year old grandson was wanting...
5.0	Super Mario 64 for DS is even better than the original for Nintendo 64. There are three new characters to play as: Luigi, Wario, and Yoshi. Each character has their own special abilities. With a power flower(new) Mario can be a blimp, Luigi invisible, Wario metal and Yoshi breathes fire! The controls are a little difficult to master at first, but you will get the hang of it as you continue through the game. This game is an excellent addition to your DS collection!
5.0	What can I say he was so excited to have this 70.00 game that he thought this was the best Christmas ever yah ofcoarse until next Christmas...
5.0	This game is a blast.  Fast pace with great graphics and lots of speed.  Be the cop or be the speeder or both it's just so much fun causing havoc at high speeds.
5.0	i truly love all dream day games.  they keep me on my toes.  I will be 77 years old.  working these puzzles keeps my mind in good shape.
5.0	Received the product fast and in great condition.  No issues and perfect for what it is designed for.  Have not tried it in a vehicle yet but sure it will work great along with protecting the unit.
5.0	Very good game and looks amazing
5.0	Just as described. My daughter's love ut
5.0	Works great.  Holds charge for a long time.  Surround is great.  My first wireless headset, and I love it.. .
5.0	This game has caught my grip and just as the same goes when the wind waker came out for GameCube.
5.0	Item received is exactly as described on the website
5.0	a great mouse for the money it would be hard to beat it
5.0	Has jaded me from other games greatest game play and story line
5.0	Great grips. Best I've had so far. Make for much more accurate movements. Comes with 2 pairs, but one blue and one black. Just something to think about.
5.0	Everything was perfect
5.0	With almost a week of playing this game under my belt I would have to say I am not disappointed in this game. I have owned every version of Mario Kart and have loved them all. I like the new tracks (though there are a couple of them that I have a hard time staying on the tracks at the 150cc level) and I like the inclusion of some of the older tracks that I have come to know and love. The graphics are terrific, the sounds are good and the music isn't annoying like it has been in some of the past versions. I love being able to race using my own Mii. It is so much fun to see yourself put into a game. It really gives the game so much more of a personal feeling. Online play is great and there is very little waiting time to find a group of people to play with. People dropping out of a race is no longer a problem as they are usually replaced with new people looking to join in on a game or two. Racing Ghosts online is fun as it gives you on opportunity to see how people compare to you. The first online tournament is fun so far and it's neat how they have changed the track just a little bit (Chain Chomp is running loose instead of being tied to his pole). I see a lot of play coming out of this game as even after I get all the gold cups, there's still lots to do and always people to race online.
5.0	Better than any remote control I'll got.
5.0	For myself I grew up playing this game with my cousins and was thrilled to find it on Amazon. Poy Poy will give you endless hours of fun and laughs. Not only is this kid friendly but depending on who you play with, it can also be very competitive at the same time! The controls are in depth enough to make for a engaging experience even for the older audience. Though the graphics may be outdated and cubic now it only adds to the funny experience. Each character has special abilities and are good at certain things. Throwing rockets,logs,boulders,  and giant statues at your friends or family on Poy Poy is pure fun.
5.0	If you've never played this you should check it out. It is definatley one of the most realistic military simulators out there.
5.0	A late review for my Marth amiibo, but what can I say? I love his amiibo a lot like my other ones. The face looks better than I imagined, his cape is very amazing to look at. It's so FABULOUS~!
5.0	if you are looking to get an open world superhero game look no further I like to play on easy so I don't die repeatedly and I can actually feel like a superhero this is one of my favorite game ever it is a little dar so I wouldn't recomend this game to people under 10 or so
5.0	Ever since I played the demo I bought the game and have fought back the alien invasion as best that I can and my kids root for me to kick &#34;the bad guys&#34; butt. They can't wait for me to get the 3rd one.
5.0	i got this game when the psp first came out and i was amazed by the graphics,sound and gameplay.sure most people wont like it as much as pro evo or fifa and thats fine because those games are realistic and have crisp graphics but world tour is a great game to play on the bus or in the car .world tour is one of the greatist games for unlockibles out on any console you can platy as pele or maradonna in there primes.If your not looking for realistic soccer go out and buy this sucker because its a highly addictive arcade soccer game and really is one of the best psp has to offer in launch titles.
5.0	I bought this game a long time ago. (when it just came out)<br />but my computer was too slow for it.<br />Few years later gt a new one.... the game is awesome and so was the price when i got it on Amazon.<br />Thanks so much for the game.<br />5 out of 5 here.!
5.0	I was a little nervous about ordering this charger based on all the reviews here claiming to have received a cheap knock-off.  I couldn't believe that Amazon would let that continue to happen, so I took a chance.  I'm glad I did.  The charger arrived quickly and is a new-in-box official Nintendo 3DS charger (which is compatible with the DSi I need it for and the DSi XL).  The charger matches the pictures of the official charger left by another user on the product description page.  Since it's a stocking stuffer for my daughter, I haven't plugged it in yet, but I don't expect problems.  I'll update the review if my experience is anything other that satisfactory.
5.0	I love this game. Thank you.
5.0	Very happy with this product.  It is the perfect size for a starting out child with their DS.  I have a six year old that will pack of stuff in her video game bags and then not have room for the intended.  This is a very nice quality as well and the price is a steal.  I have seen crappier versions at walmart for twice the price!
5.0	"The Xbox just got a lot better!! My son can be playing on his Xbox and txt me where ever I am. Great little device that took very little effort to attach to the controller. It was a PERFECT fit!! There is no need to take it on and off because it's not in your way while playing at all!<br />My 13 year old son give this product... \\""1 billion\\"" stars lol"
5.0	My kids and now my grandkids have experienced Jazz and Spazz! Great game fast action and skill required to compete !
5.0	If you never grew up with an original playstation after the nintendo VS Sega days, brother you haven't lived. Robo pit is a great game to start with. A bit repetitive, but also addicting. Give it a try.
5.0	Madden 64 is a fun game being outdated 2 years.  I have never been a real big fan of the Madden football games but this one made me change my mind.  This is a suprisingly good game being for the price.
5.0	The graphics are astounding. The game, however, is short; my wife beat it in about 4-5 days. None-the-less she loved it, and still plays it from time to time.
5.0	thank you so much for this game and those of you who are looking to buy this game do so it is an amazing game and the graphics are pretty good thanks amazon
5.0	I would say it is a medium length game. After you complete the story there is a lot of bonus levels. We are Mario fans and we loved it.
5.0	this remote control is good enough to play games. it came on time. the price was right. the color is perfect.
5.0	This is a great add on for the Blitzkrieg series. I wish there were more. The expansion pack includes more battles, types of armor and troops, and advanced AI. If you are a true Blitzkrieg fan you will eat this expansion up. No doubt.
5.0	Pros:<br />MUCH cheaper than the first party Microsoft drive.<br />Works perfectly, with no flaws of any kind in operation<br /><br />Cons:<br />None<br /><br />Overall, if you need an HDD for your Xbox 360, you need to buy this drive. It's a great deal, and you can save money buying the cheaper Arcade version of the 360 and then adding this hard drive!
5.0	I thought when I buyed this game,it was going to be some kind of racing game or something.But it wasn't.I like it very much and it is very entertaining.But sometimes you have to restart a lot because some missions are difficult.Still,you should have in your collection.
5.0	I love this game! Would tell everyone who loves zelda to buy it
5.0	This is platforming gaming at it's best. If you've played the past games, you know what to expect, but it's also a perfect jump on point for people new to the series. If you can figure out a controller, you can play this game and it's enjoyable for any age of gamer.
5.0	Good but not appropriate for kids lots of swearing!!!!! Great graphics and great locations. wii zapper acessory isnt that good. but great game overall. lots of gore to so watch out for your kids!!!
5.0	Fast shipping, easy to install. Thanks!
5.0	This game is the best game I own!  If you thought that Mario Kart was the best game ever made, keep your pants on when you see Mickey's Speedway USA.  The graphics are absolutely amazing with the clarity and color being absolutely perfect.  The graphics depict the true scenery of each city that the characters race through.  The voices of all the characters match the ones you've heard on tv and as a child and you'll melt when you see how adorable they are.  This game also needs skill for the harder level.  It's not an easy game where it's an obvious &quot;beat&quot;.  You must work towards saving Pluto, and it's not as easy as you think it will be.  This game will give you loads of fun and pleasure for the whole family.  It's a great gift, whether for someone you love, a friend, or for yourself.  Enjoy the game!
5.0	I already own all three versions of the game, such as, ME1, ME2 and ME3.  I purchased this product for one of my sons, so he can play the MP portion of ME3 with me.  I have great admiration for the whole series. I created four characters in ME1, and I took all four characters all the way through the series to the end of ME3. I played in the insane mode throughout and I had a blast. I still play ME3 MP from time to time.
5.0	Excellent product exactly what I expected. Its still going to take me many months to master this but it is much more enjoyable than trying to work through a learning guitar book. What's more it allows me to learn on my schedule when it's convenient.
5.0	Best buy ever for ps4. love it.
5.0	My son absolutely loves this game. It is perfect for his age range. He is 8 and loves it. I would recommend parents that are looking for child appropriate games for the Xbox that this is the one to get.
5.0	The Wolf Among Us - for PlayStation 4 plays more like a fantasy game than a mere video game.  The Wolf Among Us is not a shooter or even a strict werewolf themed game.  Yes The Wolf Among Us is a werewolf themed game but it feels more like a hard bitten detective themed game that just has a werewolf as lawbringer in chief.  The werewolf is also the peacekeeper in a subculture of unique beings hiding in plain sight among the humans.  It falls to the The Wolf Among Us main character to keep the peace among strange beings while also doing what is needed to keep this weird group hidden from humanities prying eyes.<br /><br />The Wolf Among Us has a weird controller mapping but once you master it the game plays well with few if any glitches. The Wolf Among Us has five very basic installments that are interesting.  As the Wolf you are presented with law and order and other situations in the enclave of odd beings.  The decisions you make as Werewolf lawgiver shape the unfolding story.  Yes you are the main character a werewolf and a bit of a brute.  You are a physically imposing creature with the power to back it up.<br /><br />The game play is weird by not following typical gaming button assigment conventions but it is nice.  The graphics are mostly dark brooding  browns and grays.  The game play and graphics don't make best use of the PS4 power.  The graphics are ok but they are first generation PS3 quality or best possible PS2 graphics quality.  Personally I enjoyed The Wolf Among Us because; it offers an odd unexpected take on life as a werewolf among the humans.
5.0	Its very responsive it took me a couple of hours to get used to but i am glad that i bought it. I have tried about ten different fight pads and this is the best one that i have found.
5.0	If you like God of war 1 and you liked God of War 2.... well thats what this is, but it's still insanely fun. As Kratos you travel through two epic jouneys of redemption and revenge. Tight gameplay and Crisp re-worked graphics make the expirence that much better this time around. If you're looking for that action game to hold you off unitil God of War III, pick this up!
5.0	I'm super happy with this product, and I've already lost about twenty pounds by playing this game for a few hours two days a week. So far I love it, and I continue to use it whenever I have the time. Also, with the balance board game and board, I also received the biggest loser game which I also use as a warm up for the custom routine (it's mostly the cardio that I do on both games)
5.0	Because there is no Metal Gear Solid X for XBOX it's just a FAKE!!! <br />I have played Demo, it's one of the best game I have ever played and the graphic is the  best of all games( DoA 3 maybe as good as this one) if you have $50 get this one, if you have another $50 go take a look about devil may cry, you can find that one on amazon too.
5.0	I've had this game for years, and always go back a play through from time to time .  :)
5.0	This is the best flight sim you could buy(Except for IL-2 Forgotten Battles), I run Win XP with a GeForce 4 video card and have had no problems. I like others just stared in awe at the graphics when I first loaded the game. The amount of detail just cant be found in any other sim. If you are going to get 1 Flight sim this is the one to get. Unless you want 2 then get its sister game IL-2 Forgotten battles and fly even more planes.
5.0	I have a 9yr old daughter, and 5 and 8 yr old sons.  They have a ball playing this game and setting up their teams.
5.0	Graphics are great, sounds are incredible, user friendly to boot.  Just make sure you have a upper class computer because the graphic card will be working harder than usable.  But other than than that, everything else is easy.  Buying new aircraft's are a walk in the park too.  Play online or off, I'm sure you will have a great time in the not so friendly skies.
5.0	lookin for a rpg? this is the game for you. filled with many hours of gameplay to find all the hidden items. casual gameplay, unless you try to collect everything, then it's hardcore. good controls and challenging puzzels give this game its rateing.
5.0	They finally got the chemistry right again. Going back to its basics is what makes Mortal Kombat so much fun to play again. The visuals are amazing, gameplay is great and it has a good story. My friends and I are enjoying it more than our young brothers who haven't experienced the game during the time they were so popular in the arcades and at home for the Super Nintendo system. It's like being a kid again, having you and your friends play side by side again, kicking each others ***, exchanging insults and taunting one another. Great fun and for many years to come.    *Side Note*  There is only one issue I have with the game and that is the audio. Don't get me wrong, the audio quality is great. The problem is that the audio level for cut-scenes and gameplay audio are totally different levels. I would have to turn up the volume to a great deal during the cut-scenes, to hear whats going on and immediately turn it down when it gets to gameplay. Maybe I over looked a setting for it but regardless this game is very much worth getting and is still extremely enjoyable.    Graphics: 10/10  Gameplay: 9/10  Story: 9/10  Sound: 8/10
5.0	The mouse has arrived, comes with adjustable DPI button (4 settings), as well as 2 buttons on the side that can be used to navigate back and fourth on the web browser. Scroll wheel is nice, snappy, and overall this mouse is a good mouse to have. Amazing for its price :D
5.0	Great tool, does the jub perfectly and very secure, even to the point where the Kinect &#34;clips&#34; onto the stang, excellent product well worth the few bucks
5.0	item is as described, the five pieces come in little zip bag ,excellent for their price :)
5.0	Now I know what all the hype is about. Classic RPG at its best.You will not regret buying this game for the Vita.
5.0	If this is still the same one it has the on/off clicky that your 1st head set came with. where you get the extra button at the top of your controller. Very Nice. Also this unit is lasting longer than those buy and throw away head sets we all have bought at some point. So I recommend this product. (if they didn't change it)
5.0	Excellent game for those who like playing fps/multiplayer arcadey shooters. Playing alone is not that fun but playing with friends is ridiculous! If you have a friend to play with GET THIS GAME!
5.0	If you  like playing modern war time games with update ships and aircraft this is game would be a challenge in the higher levels that you go.
5.0	I've just recently got back to playin my old GameCube. All I had was the cords and the system so I had to buy all the accessories and games. I'm happy with HDE and their 128mb memory card. It works great without any errors and holds more than enough memory for the little bit of games I have.
5.0	I bought this game for the heck of it.  I watched a preview of it on the Nintendo site and thought it was very cute and looked like fun.  I am way too old to be playing this, but I love it and it keeps me entertained. So I guess what I am saying, is it is fun for everyone at any age.  Go on the Wii Nintendo site and play it for five minutes before buying.  You'll see for yourself.
5.0	Loved the game, although I wish they wouldn't have taken out the part where Nancy writes her letter & the ending is different. But overall, Nancy rocks as usual!
5.0	great price. nice gift for any gamer.
5.0	This card makes a great gift for anyone! I bought one for myself and was able to choose from 1000 games to use it on. The card arrived at my house quickly, and the code worked. It was extremely easy to use and I am definitely going back to buy these for all of my friends for Christmas.
5.0	it's a really bad-ass game, i strongly recommend this purchase, it's absolutely worth it! even though the user need a very well computer in order tu run this game, it could be executed by a simple one, like a intel core 2 duo, for example
5.0	The xbox 360 is a great upgrade from the older xbox. It has alot of good games and the graphics are wonderful. My kids really have fun playing on it. I didn't have a problem with the set up, it was easy. I haven't had a problem with it freezing up either. All togather, Ithink it was a good buy.
5.0	I just moved from 360 to ps3 and went to buy this game only to found out that its $10 more for ps3.<br /><br />Are the xbox 360 games on sale or are they always cheaper then ps3 games?
5.0	We bought our 4 year old the DSIXL for Christmas but could not find this case or any case in the stores.  Ordered this one and it fits perfect and he loves it.
5.0	Son loves the game, easy to use, graphics are great, game play flows well. No issues on this end and a user.
5.0	My son ordered these to repair his Nintendo 3DS.  The first one broke while installing it but the second worked great.  My son is happy again.<br />They are cheap enough that I would  recommend ordering two.
5.0	Great price and value! Keep it up!!
5.0	Great deal!! Im from Costa Rica, I received it without any problems!!!
5.0	This has been my favorite gaming purchase i've ever made.  The construction is top notch.  To me this is the only way to have the driving experience the way racing game developers intended.
5.0	The main problem that has plagued the Delta Force series are the cheaters in the Multiplayer portion of the game.  Novalogic has proposed plans to place a $5/month fee to stop cheaters from playing on Novalogics new server, NovaWorld2.  I would gladly pay that small amount per month to have so much fun which I have already enjoyed in DF1 and DF2.  About the Demo, it runs smooth on my p3 500, 32meg 3d card at 800X600, both on the large desert fields and inside the vast and highly detailed Pyramid (not a difference in frame-rate on my computer, major plus).  If this demo is an indication of the final product, it should be great!
5.0	Nice Retro unit, good design, no problems, plays all NES and SNES games, Holds carts securely, can even use the Genie Unit for NES.
5.0	I first found the triggers at a wally world a few years ago and haven't been  able to find them ever sense. That is... until now! These things are great and the silicone caps a big bonus I wasn't really expecting to like them, but really make a difference when trying to use the joysticks. Great control! Super buy!
5.0	got it 1 day earlier than I planned.. and its just what I was looking for.. thank you very much!!
5.0	This is a popular game on the atari. It is one of my favorites too. The purpose is to shoot all of the asteroids and alieen space ships that come and try not to get hit buy bullets or asteroids. The music and sound is catchy and fun to listen too. The graphics r not that good but is is the atari. It is hard to control the ship sometimes but the joystick makes it easy sometimes. It is really fun on multiplayer but u have to take turns like most atari games. This is a fun old popular game.
5.0	just like I remember it!!!! Love this game as a kid and I still do today.
5.0	This is a great game system. I play the included wii sports with family and friends. Its a great way to spend family time when I'm 18 and don't really want to. Wii gives the family a chance to stay in and play some games and have some family fun.    Great System
5.0	For the ratchet and clank fans out there: <br />If you think ratchet and clank 3 is going to be better than jak 3, don't say that here. It makes no sense, and your bacially just reviewing R&C 3. put that in the R&C 3 reviews, not these ones. I think **Personally** that J&D 3 is going to be better, because R&C is bacially just wopping stuff with tools. and Daxter is at least FUNNY. So, like it says: <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Tell us what you think. Write a review of this item and share your opinions with others. Please be sure to focus your comments on the product. Read our review guidelines for more information. <br />  <br />  <br />
5.0	Ahhh CCP you crazy guys you. I love the product and the bonus extras that came with it.
5.0	"I have played PlayStation for many years, but I have to say that I got sold to Xbox Kinect the minute I saw the Project Natal video. After purchasing the new xbox system and Kinect I feel it's the money well spend for the holidays :D    I love the game and all the excitement that it brings.    The \\""Party Play\\"" mode for sports game is even more fun as it does not require the selection of user/member profile's and let's any family or friend to just play the party games without the need of going through the entire profile setup.    I'm Loving It :)"
5.0	As soon as the game is replaced (rec. a defective one) I will review how the game play is in comparison to the Wii.  Can't compare it to xBox or PS(any #).
5.0	Personal Fitness Women for Nintendo DS is the best nintendo ds fitness video game in the whole wide world cool.
5.0	I had my doubts but this works great. After some tweaking with the settings, I hardly notice that I'm not playing on a pc. It has allowed me to play COD Black OPS online and not get slaughtered, because I'm horrible with the analog sticks. I return items that I'm not happy with and I'm keeping this. Buy it. You won't regret it.
5.0	As an avid videogamer and movie buff, I knew Doom 3 would definitely be one hell of game, but I never knew how much a game could seem so visceral and lifelike. Utilizing state of the art hardware and technology of the modern computing world, Doom 3 is the most immensely detailed, award winning game I have ever played in my life. The game is brilliantly choreographed as the player advances throughout the levels. Horrifying cinematics and gruesome, frightening enemies literally surprise the hell out of the gamer as one advances through the epic story line. Basically, the synopsis of the plot is based on the Mars-alien sci-fi correlation mixed with opening the gates of Hell on Mars. Dr. Petruger, the ghastly sadistic scientist, has found a way to open the gates of Hell through the extensive help of a massive scientific conglomerate that is stationed on Mars. You play an amateur marine that starts off in a standard, serine environment of the Mars Marine Command, but quickly you are put in pathway Dr. Petruger's sadistic agenda, serving commands from your superiors, and deciding the fate of Earth (ultimately stop the spread of hell pouring over to Earth). Overall, I would NOT recommend this game for children! When I first played this videogame my adrenaline was pumping so hard I literally had to take periodic brakes because the game was so real. If you play this game at full, high graphics the game becomes extremely real. Now with my disclaimer already stated, get out there and pick up this game!
5.0	This game is sooo addicting! I first had this game about a year ago, and then got it taken away because i played it too much. I was literally on it for at least 5 hours daily. I just recently got it again for Christmas, and play it just as much. If you want a game to play, then this is definitely the best around. I am looking forward to what Blizzard Entertainment will put out next!
5.0	Yes I love it! The price was great. It was a replacement for my grandson. He lost his orignal one. But what mattered most was the price. Amazonis the place to shop!
5.0	This game is very good, although it is confusing at times.  I enjoyed it and so did all of my friends.
5.0	"I was looking for a new gamepad or keyboard for COD : Black Ops when I came across all the negative ratings.  I bought this game for one reason only, multiplayer.  And it does a great job of it.      The pace is insane.  The weapons are fun to customize.  And you can even customize your \\""perks\\"".  There are tons of games to join 24/7.  I really like that in ranked server games you can earn points to customize your weapons, unlock new weapons, customize your character (face paint, character emblem, gun camo, etc), and even choose perks that can be upgraded by completing missions.    The only game lag I have seen is when the server hosting the map is lagged.    My specs:  Nvidia 260GT 896MB GDDR3  i7 920 @ 2.67 ghz  12 GB ram  3M DSL connection  Windows 7 Professional    My system is not new, although it is not outdated either.  It's unfortunate, but minimum specs are often barely playable or require turning down graphics to a point where they detract from the game.  If you do get the game, or any new game, make sure you download the latest graphics drivers from Nvidia or ATI depending on your card chipset.  If you are into fast paced first person shooter games, this game is a ton of fun."
5.0	Very good. Thanks Amazon!
5.0	A great addition to our existing Xbox one system, really nice design and self-explanatory layout.
5.0	I had this game on the Xbox 360 and wanted the ps3 version, exactly what I wanted
5.0	My Daughter loves this game! Great fun and exercise!
5.0	this was a gift but my son loves it
5.0	300 VR Missions may seem a bit daunting at first glance, but when you're dying for more Metal Gear Solid action and completing the original game for the ninth time doesn't appeal much to you this weekend, you don't pass up a  chance like this. Experience with Metal Gear Solid isn't necessary, but  definitely recommended, there are a few elements from it that a player  would be better off with when going into VR Missions. The Ninja levels are  particularly sharp, but there are only three very short ones to choose  from, so they get old fast. The photo shoots aren't much of an incentive at  all, especially during some of the more frustrating missions. If anything,  do it for personal pride, but by all means, do it.
5.0	The hard drive works, not too much to say about it.  Slightly under the 20 GB rated space, but all hard drives are slightly under sized due to formatting.
5.0	Product advertised as shown on the display, I would recommend this to everyone. Thanks alot! There no better triggers than these, enhances game play by alot -- Thank you!
5.0	Arrived in perfect condition. Very pleased with the purchase.
5.0	This was a Xmas gift and recipient enjoyed playing it. However after a few times, the kids were over the songs available. The karaoke option was a plus and put our microphone to great use!
5.0	Arrived quickly. Price was a big selling point, especially for the amount of memory. Not much else to say, works as intended.
5.0	For $35, buying a brand new GCN controller is insane.  Well worth the money if you plan on playing some games on Gamecube.  This thing is indestructible (I miss the days of Nintendium) and if you are considering buying a knockoff controller, DON'T.  The knockoffs have really bad C-sticks and Thumb Sticks with huge deadzones.  You'll end up buying one of these anyway so do yourself a favor and save some money.
5.0	This charger so far is working great. It's easy to install the batteries and it's simple enough my kids can use it. The visual charge indicators are nice and bright, so you know the status at a glance. Sometimes the controller doesn't line up right, so I just wiggle it until it snaps into place.
5.0	My 12 year old son loves it!!
5.0	I ordered this and what an awesome product.  How nice to have 4 battery packs charging at the same time and to be able to swap them out as your battery dies!!! It came very quickly and just as ordered!  Very smooth transaction!!!
5.0	happy with the item, My son enjoys it
5.0	Perfect for what we needed! Excellent price also!
5.0	My boys love skylanders swapforce.  I was happy to find it brand new and save a few bucks
5.0	LOVE THE QUALITY OF THE GAME
5.0	Very fun game still never finished!
5.0	My 2 year old and 4 year old love it.  You can play with the wii fit board or without!  It is easy for the kids to do by themselves and it keeps them moving.  I great addition to our rainy day toys.
5.0	Works great thus far. I haven't put it to extreme use since I only play my unit a few times a year, and because this is a technical product, it's mechanics have not been assessed or pushed to its limits. Hence, a future review is advantageous as well as necessary for both the manufacturer and the customer. Cheers, Mohsen (Visionary People - Global Management Consulting).
5.0	This is awesome. I had a Nintendo DS that was low on battery, plugged it up to the wall w/ this charger, and a few hours later... the DS worked and I could continue refining my skills and strategy for Nintendogs.
5.0	My heart has stolen by the merc with a mouth and this game is beyond amazing.
5.0	Excelente juego. Además de su precio muy bajo. Llegó a tiempo sin ninguna complicación. Recomiendo este producto al 100%. Soy de Maracaibo. Saludos!!!
5.0	My favorite game to play I got addictive to all of the Sims.
5.0	"Pokemon XD: Gale of Darkness is the sequel to Pokemon Colosseum.  (I think the \\""XD\\"" stands for \\""Extra Dimension\\"".)  It's not a \\""Pokemon Stadium\\""-type game; it's like Story Mode in Pokemon Colosseum.  The plot involves the unexpected return of Cipher, five years after its defeat in Colosseum.  Cipher has returned with a vengeance, as is evidenced by its suddenly showing up with a massive Shadow Lugia.  The Lugia steals a ship transporting Pokmon one night, causing numerous news reports, and when it turns out that Cipher is involved, a young boy with great Pokemon Trainer skills sets out to save the day from the bad guys.    Here are the pros:    1. You can now save wherever you want, like in the Game Boy Advance games! WAHOO!    2. The graphics have been improved since Colosseum.  There are a lot of really nicely done \\""cutscenes\\"", and the trainers react to what's happening in the battle--  i. e. the trainers act triumphant if they win, frustrated and/or anguished if they lose, etc.    3. The music and sound effects are quite good, as is the writing.    4. There is a lot to this game--I like games with a lot in them (unless I'm really anxious to find out what happens at the end).    5. Not terribly violent--if a character is defeated in battle, they just faint (they never die or anything like that.  Actually, this holds true for all Pokemon games, and I think it's a really nice touch).      Cons:    1. Like with Colosseum, you can't play as a girl.  But I really like the character you get to play as, so it's not really that much of a problem.  (He looks like Lan Hikari from MegaMan Battle Network.)  I also imagine it would be really hard to have to animate the entire game twice over--once with the girl character and once with the guy character--so it's sort of understandable.    2. You can't revisit cutscenes.  Really, though, this is true for almost all video games, but still, I'd like to be able to see them again.    3. If you want to start a new game, it erases everything you did.  I can't stand this, and it unfortunately holds true for all Pokemon games.  They should let you start a new game and keep the one you have in progress at the same time.  (AAAAAAAARRRRGGGGGHHHHH!!!!!!)      In conclusion, Pokemon XD: Gale Of Darkness is a must-have for any Pokemon fan, and the expense is well worth it."
5.0	This was given as a gift, but my niece let me played it, and I loved it.  A lot of fun.
5.0	Awesome stuff. Buy one for all your controllers. A must buy for any good gamer who needs an edge on the competition.
5.0	This product is AWESOME!!  My son dropped his DS and it stopped working.  We ordered this to prevent that from happening again.  Yes, of course it has been dropped again by accident and it was fine!  He also loves that it is easy for him to hold on to.  He is six and this is his first 'video game'.  I highly recommend this for any child!!  My son is careful with his toys but things happen.  Great idea!
5.0	"Princess Peach has been kidnapped yet again by the evil Bowser in a flying doom ship as he has his seven Kooplings all across 8 lands in the Mushroom kingdom as they spread terror and chaos, turning kings into animals and seeking control of the lands. Mario and his brother Luigi must as always has to save the day.<br /><br />In 1988 in Japan, Nintendo has created a highly acclaimed sequel to the legendary \\""Super Mario Brothers\\"" and was one of the biggest selling games in Japan ever. In 1989 when they announced that SM 3 will be coming to the US/Canada in 1990, gamers were excited including myself after reading about it in Nintendo power and i was anticipating for this game as i loved the first 2 despite part 2 not actually being a REAL Mario game as any Mario fan would know, during that year in December of 1989 many kids of the 80s including me when i was 8 saw The Wizard in theaters which was produced by Nintendo and at the climax of that filmed showed the awesome sneak preview footage of this game during the challenge which had every kid drooling for the game. On Feburary of 1990 after 2 months of anticipation the game finally came and it delivered. I remembered getting this for my 9th birthday back in June that year and i was playing it nearly all summer for it became my fave NES game ever and even had the merchandise to eating the food products and watching the toon.<br /><br />After \\""Super Mario Brothers 2\\"" which was great but very different from the first game since SMB 2 was the REAL SMB 2 but actually just another game with Mario characters, SMB 3 returned to the classic formula and with new improvements so far. Not only did this game became a best-seller since then but also a game that defined childhoods including mine! this game offered new stuff like power-ups, new moves, new features and 8 rich worlds with many levels to explore. It pushed the limits of 8-bit games at the time as it boosted enough chips to power it, it even introduced the map system with mini-games thrown in. In this game you get a new thing called silly suits ranging from a Raccoon which when you touch the magic leaf you turn into a half raccoon person and can fly which has became famous since then to the Hammer Brothers suit which you can throw hammers at enemies to even hide in the shell.<br /><br />The graphics and sound are very good but the All-Stars remake and Gameboy Advanced versions are even better despite this game does have it's charms with the chunky pixel 8-bit look and the controls are excellent as well. Despite there is no saving feature, this game is an addictive and masterful game that has stood the test of time and still a beloved game to this day that can still be enjoyed.mini-games thrown in.

5.0	I use the controller for playing COD Ghost. Favorite mode is 11, for drop shot + rapid fire. Once you sync it with your Xbox, it is straight forward to use. I highly recommend it.
5.0	Thanks, works great for my super nintendo.
5.0	Works perfectly as expected.  Has a super long cord, which is awesome.  :)
5.0	I got this for my 8 yr old grandson and he is over the moon...loves him some Zelda
5.0	I got this game and fell in love with it the second i got it. i highly recommend it for all pokemon fans.
5.0	Dishonored is a first person action adventure game similar to Deus Ex and Bioshock.  The atmosphere is fantastic and the game looks beautiful.  There are varieties of ways to complete each mission, giving it tons of replay value.  The only downside is that the story connecting the missions is dull and uninspired, despite the great characters and voice acting.
5.0	This interactive software is fantastic! My two sons (ages 4 &amp; 6)are addicted to it - I might be too! It's great fun calling plays and learning the strategy of football. My sons didn't know anything about football before playing this game and now they're playing like the pros. Ya gotta get it!
5.0	Giving it a 5 because it's a great product, great quality and feels even better to hold than just the 3ds XL. However, unless you're big on monster hunter or resident evil, it's not worth buying really
5.0	I got this game for my 6year old son but it is something the whole family is enjoying playing. Its fun to play by yourself as all as compete against each other
5.0	Prince of Persia the Forgotten Sands is definitely different from the past three games. The story line is supposed to  fit in between Sands of Time and Warrior Within. While I played the game I didn't notice any correlation to the original Prince; however, the game itself was so good, it can stay on its own.<br /><br /> 1st- The combat system is completely different from the preceding games. It focuses on massive mob fighting. There also are a bunch of sweet flip and slash techniques the Prince performs, which look amazing. Not to mention the skills the Prince earns, such as Ice, Blasts, Stone armor, and other cool spells.<br /><br /> 2nd- As I played the game, the controls felt very comfortable and it actually reminded me of playing World of Warcraft or another MMORPG game. The game runs very smoothly and the pace is just right. There is no long loading times, no replays after you fail a level. Just start from a recent checkpoint quickly and try again. Also, the Prince seems to have gained some more parkour skill and goes through obstacles faster than ever before!<br /><br /> 3rd- The obstacles and puzzles of the game are a masterpiece. None are way too hard, so one will always enjoy going through them. The graphics are truly eye-candy. Parkour was always the main motive I like about PoP games, and the Forgotten Sands just made me love it even more.<br /><br /> 4th- Bosses are all huge and epic looking, but quite easy to beat. Anyway, the game runs like an awesome action packed movie which you get to play.<br /><br />I recommend this game to every Prince of Persia fan. You will not be disappointed at all.
5.0	I noticed my DS4 controllers for my PS4 were tearing and I take care of my things so I did not want to risk them breaking I got these babies and they work perfectly and feel more grip now when I game I definitely would recommend to anyone that wants more comfort for your thumbs in hard core gaming sessions.
5.0	"Geez, what took so long to get this out.  I have loved SSX from PS1 days.  SSX tricky was my absolute favorite.<br />This is a more challenging game.  Some of the races require shooting down very narrow paths with little room for error.  The tricks are neat but my personal preference is for racing.  The wing suit allows you to fly from ledge to ledge and the physics are pretty good.  It does feel like I am floating over a mountain range.  I think that most people who complain that the tracks are too dangerous or unpredictable will change their tune once they get to know the courses better after a few runs.  I think the best part is when you have \\""gone through\\"" the game and you just pick which peaks to race.  There are a lot of adventures to be had and it looks cool.  A few good songs are included but you can always sync to your music list.<br />Thank You, EA sports<br />now for a Jet Moto sequal!!"
5.0	great product fast service
5.0	my grandchildren play this game alot.
5.0	"For anyone who's been longing for a real strategy game with diplomacy, research, and warfare which seems more a simulation than a click-fest, these games are what you were waiting for.  All are just tremendously fun, and have each proven even more addictive than legendary \\""digital crack\\"" games like Civ or Alpha Centauri.  When you add in that Paradox, the designing company, bends over backwards to suppport their products and designs them with moddability in mind, each game has a replayability far beyond what is initially apparent. <br /> <br />As has been mentioned, however, these games are quite complex, though after a bit you'll find the gameplay fairly intuitive.   If its at all overwhelming its simply because strategy gamers simply don't normally expect this level of depth and quality; as if after years of bad fast food we have to learn how to use silverware again when presented with a gorgeous steak.  The best way to overcome the learning curve is the paradoxplaza.com forum, where the folks are exceedingly helpful and knowledgeable.  Heck, they also seem to be among the best history forums on the internet, as I seem to get hits from them every time I google something historically obscure. :) <br /> <br />Either way, if you want a real gaming experience, pick up these games and try them for yourselves.  You won't be dissapointed.  Unless, of course, you wanted to maintain a social life, marriage, or career, as you'll probably kiss all of those goodbye.  Don't worry.  It's a fair trade-off. :p"
5.0	I bought this item as a gift... but I was told it was a hit.
5.0	Works just as well as the original, no problems so far.
5.0	I have played many a Harvest Moon game, be they on my Gamecube, my Playstation 2, my DS or my Wii. There have been many that I loved and some that I've been less enthusiastic about, but generally, I have thoroughly enjoyed these games. And I think this one is my favorite.<br /><br />The controls are easy and intuitive, the graphics are lovely and crisp, the characters are pleasant and the story is just adorable. Other games in the series have been a mix of all of these things: one may look lovely but not be engaging, one might have a great story but not play all that well, one might have perfect controls but a limited, unremarkable story. What makes this installment so enjoyable is that it seems to hit every point perfectly. One of my favorite installments in the past has been Magical Melody, but even with such a time-sink of a game, you eventually will plateau and tire of it. I found myself playing this game nearly indefinitely, and if I were trying to persuade someone to pick up a Harvest Moon game, I would direct them to this one.<br /><br />If you can get past not being able to move the camera (which you can't do in a lot of Harvest Moon games but the graphics in this game made me think I might be able to; you cannot), you'll enjoy one of the finest Harvest Moon games available.
5.0	"I was a little afraid because some people said \\""did not work\\"" but I only connected and ready to play. Good, good product and very cheap."
5.0	This version of Hitman has countless hours of replay value.  The Xbox 360 achievements alone will keep you coming back for more.  With an almost endless variety of ways to accomplish each hit, you will definitely find interesting combos.  The game is also packed full of little surprises (like the Rats Club in Curtains Down).  Play as a terrorist who kills all and doesn't care if he is seen or as the coveted silent assassin.  Both paths have their benefits.  This is a definite buy as even the non-gamer crowd will be drawn in to the world of Agent 47.
5.0	Good product- matched description. Fast shipping.
5.0	My granddaughter uses it every day.
5.0	Got this for my brother for chirsmas and he seems to really enjoy it, he works a lot and doesnt always have a lot of time to play but he states that whenever he does it is definately worth his time
5.0	Awesome game series and I approve of buying considering it's under 40 dollars. Would recommend to any fan of disgaea
5.0	Amazing Compared to the PS3 Version, I played for around 3 months the PS3 version of this game and it was good, however the PS4 version is a lot better. I´m not only talking about graphics which indeed are better, but also in the gameplay, which is like watch a real game on HD.<br /><br />The game menus moves really quick, no performance issues, gameplay is awesome, graphics are amazing and the sound is incredible.
5.0	This game has been one of my personal favorites for a very long time.  In the course of my game playing years, I have owned this particular game twice, and I have purchased every other Roller Coaster Tycoon version as well.  The gameplay for RCT3 is solid and the scenarios are challenging.    The only warning I will give is that this game was created and released back in November 2004 and I have personally had issues getting the game to function properly in Windows 7 (either 64-bit or 32-bit).  I would be playing normally, then suddenly the Video Driver would unload, then my system would Blue Screen and reboot itself.  After a lot of different trial and error, I found that the only solution to this issue was to Dual Boot my PC with Windows 7 and Windows XP so that I can switch at will.  Unless you are very knowledgeable in regards to computers and installing operating systems, I wouldn't recommend purchasing this game if your system is already running Windows 7.  I didn't try Windows Vista myself, but according to several websites, it should work acceptably.    Either way, this is still one of the most enjoyable and playable Roller Coaster Tycoon's in the series.
5.0	I purchases WII Active and More Active at the same time. I love them both. I am alternating the challenges because each one does exercises a little different. I would recommend them both to everybody who wants to work out or lose weight and doesn't know where to start.
5.0	Pretty entertainingly. Just started playing so I'm not all the way into the plot yet, but I really like the style of play that this has. It kind of reminds me of a version of Assassin's Creed, what with the sneaking and hiding that you do sometimes. I'm a big fan of Lord of the Rings but overall I find this pretty awesome.
5.0	It's a nice stick for play kof or street fighter,I love it!
5.0	This is a fantastic game. My wife and I play it several times a week. Kind of like playing chess with 250 pieces each. Great fun and easy to learn.
5.0	First off this is the best controller to get and it is very cheap. I had many questions and they were answered that night. This product is surpassed my expectations. I highly recommend buying from deals direct came fast!
5.0	I love all the new professions with this expansion pack! you can now be an architect, a firefighter, a ghost hunter, an inventor, a private investigator, a sculptor, a stylist, and a teacher. You can now also register as self employed. Another great feature is now you can purchase almost any public property and improve upon it to earn more money.
5.0	ok, xbox has alot going for it, for one Microsoft made it, you know its quality. you get a 733 MHZ system, 4 controller ports, a Broadband Adapter, a Built in Hard drive(bye bye memory cards)  and the ability to Rip your own Music, which'l be great When Raw 2 ships next March (get to have your own Theme Song!) The Xbox has yet to Let me Down In The Graphics Department,  Splinter Cell when you see that game in action, you'll be like WHOA! as well as Halo and DOA3. Xbox has a Ton of great Games Out and COming Out. and It Goes Online Nov 15th so That'll be awesome, Unreal Championship is gonna be amazing!  The Xbox is A Easy Format To Make Games For So That Means The easier To Program The Better They Can Make the Games!  so I say Give it a wirl, Its a Great System, With enough Games To Make You happy For a Long Time To Come, I Love It!
5.0	The Game pack is not just for kids but those who are kids at heart.  It brings back childhood memories of days gone by.  What a great game pack for those on the go.  I thought I was just getting the SD card but the pack comes with the SD card and a CD.  So I did not have to use PDA memory if I did not want to.  I liked the ability to play against the game or with friends.  I also like the ability to play either all opponents on my PDA or the ability to play with others who have a PDA.  A trial copy can be beamed to other PDAs so there is no need to worry about preloading the game.  This is a very versatile product.  I highly recommend purchasing this product over buying the individual games.
5.0	Let me start by saying that the first few times i played this game (my first SimCity game) i wasn't too happy. It seemed a little hard and made me feel that playing this game is more about money management than planning and building a city. However as i tried it out some more i got the hang of things and began to realize that the simulation is pretty realistic and has a lot of variety built in.<br />The key to enjoying this game is to understand that adding more amenities to the city - like colleges, garbage collection, hospitals, public transportation,... is expensive and to prevent those investments from draining your money, the city needs to expand as soon as every one of these things is added. So basically you need to zone more areas for residential, commercial and industrial growth as you add more facilities so that these facilities are shared by more people which makes them cheaper to you and more people means more tax revenue.<br />The other thing i found very interesting is how the city doesn't always need to grow the same way. You could decide to build a farming community where you don't bother much with education and pollution or you could build a high tech city where you have to make sure you're encouraging the right kind of industry and people to move into your city.<br />The Rush Hour expansion (which is part of this Deluxe edition) is more useful when your city gets really big (i would say 50,000+) so that you can now add different kinds of public transportation means. To make the right decision regarding the location of subway stations, etc. you can look at the traffic flow across the whole city or concentrate on one building and see how people are getting to this place.<br />Then there is also the next step of connecting cities together. This enables you to build an industrial city with high rises and a neighboring one thats an affluent suburb with big mansions and boutique stores.<br />This game has a lot of depth. It does take a little time to get the hang of it but hey... no pain, no gain :)f it but hey... no pain, no gain :)
5.0	IAM CAROLINE AND I BOUGHT THIS GAME FOR MY NEICE CARRIE WHO LOVES THE OLSON TWINS SHE HAS MOST OF THEIR VIDEOS ON V H S  AND I LOVE ALL MY 7 NEICESES AND 1 NEPHEW FOR WHEN I WAS THERE AGE WE COULD NOT AFFORD MUCH NOW THAT IAM AN ADULT I AM A TOY COLLECTOR WHEN I WAS TEN I SAID THAT WHEN I GREW UP I WOULD HAVE ANY TOY I REALLY WANTED CAUSE EVEN ADULT S PLAY WITH THERE TOYS  LIKE    THE TV AND CARS AND DO THEY NOT RIDE ON CARNIVAL RIDES?
5.0	This is a cool game.  I am an avid COD Modern Warfare 3 player, and I love all the Halos.  Playing this reminded of the type of feelings I had when I was first introduced to Star Wars and Halo - &#34;This is Awesome&#34;.  Though I still play COD MW3 as there seems to be more to it in multiplayer, I enjoy playing Titanfall immensely.  Wish there had been a campaign.<br /><br />The statue is very cool, but looking back I do not think it was worth spending $250.00.
5.0	No complaints works just fine.
5.0	Cable works great and was not expensive.  Good length and definitely handy to have when out and about.  Worth the buy.
5.0	I just bought my kids a Nintendo 3D and they love getting it, and love playing it as well.
5.0	.  .  Hands down, my favorite wii game, and we have 15+ titles.  The Williams Challenge is awesome, just wished you could reorder the machines though...I've played Gorgar and Taxi more than all the others.  If you like pinball, look no farther.  If you don't like pinball, I'd say don't get it...
5.0	First off, I just want to say that I have played all of the other call of duty games available for the wii, except for call of duty 3, the conduit, red steel, and many other FPS games available to the wii, so I am quite experienced in this area.. I would have to say that this is the best call of duty game released thus far!! I have had a ton more fun playing this game than all the others! Unlike its wii predecessors, this game packs every bit of what the HD versions have, except for local multiplayer. This is not a huge negative in my mind as I usually play online or single player. One other positive is that this game has improved immensely from the laggy versions in the past such as modern warfare reflex. I have not had it lag once! Zombies was also included in the game, which is an absolute blast to play and works seamlessly online. I would definitely recommend this game for anyone looking for a decent fps shooter on the wii, as it is the best, most fun, and most well rounded one I have come across thus far!
5.0	Great game for any Metallica fanatic.
5.0	Great product, just as described =)
5.0	Works great! love the extra storage space.
5.0	I thought Morrowind was very good altough i found it hard to get levels under my belt and money but after a while i nicked loads and was about lv 30. overall it was ace and BUY IT
5.0	"GTA: Liberty City Stories is the first game in the series to hit the PSP, and you can bet it won't be the last. Given the dismal crop of PSP titles currently available, an original PSP-only GTA game couldn't have arrived at a better time. And the good news is, Liberty City Stories is a real Grand Theft Auto game, through and through. Whether you love the GTA series or despite it, the fact is that Liberty City Stories is on the same quality level as its bigger brothers on the PS2, Xbox, and PC. You'll be surprised by how few compromises Rockstar made in order to bring the world of Grand Theft Auto to the PSP. On a visual level, the game looks simply awesome. It's not quite as detailed as Vice City or San Andreas, but it absolutely destroys the original GTA 3. The graphics look so clear that you can read the type on fliers and billboards posted around town, even on the small-ish PSP screen. As series fans well know, the game is set in the New York-inspired Liberty City. Liberty City itself is ripped straight from GTA3, and it's never looked better. From the huge crowds of pedestrians to the cars, you'd be hard-pressed to tell Liberty City Stories from GTA3. Toni himself looks fine, if a tad blocky. But in a welcome piece of news, many of the legacy character animations have finally been replaced, so longtime GTA fans won't have to keep looking at the same stupid jump animation that plagued that last three games. Liberty City Stories comes up a tad short when it comes to special effects; you'll notice that effects like explosions won't draw unless they're fairly close to you. But the weather effects are spot-on (and now include snow!), so it's a worthy trade-off. We could do without the infamous blur effect, though. And, there is a noticeable bit of ghosting on the PSP screen--especially when Toni runs; not the game's fault, but it should definitely be noted. Perhaps most important of all is the fact that, despite its visual beauty, Liberty City Stories runs butter-smooth. Even during heated action or driving scenes, you'll be hard-pressed to spot any framerate stuttering. The core gameplay is ripped straight from earlier entries in the series, so you'll find that Toni can't pull himself onto walls or boost his stats like C.J. could in San Andreas. But aside from a few tiny compromises--you can no longer crouch, for instance--this is the exact same GTA you know and love. We think that's damn impressive. The single-player mode pits you against a succession of missions and side missions, just like the console versions, and this approach holds up very well for brief snatches of gameplay on the bus or the train. When it comes to handheld gameplay, Liberty City Stories is just a natural. We especially love the new PSP-only multiplayer mode, which stands as perhaps the biggest single reason to pick up the game. Up to six players can compete in a local (or \\""ad-hoc\\"") wi-fi match. There are seven modes in all, and they range from standard deathmatch (Liberty City Survivor) and races (Street Rage) to more sophisticated team-based games where you sabotage enemy cars (Protection Racket) or steal tanks (Tanks for the Memories). Our favorite?:Hit List, an addictive little game for larger groups. In that mode, one player becomes the target while the other players relentlessly stalk him through the city. Fun! Now for the nerdy stuff. The UMD loading speed is surprisingly fast, but load scenes still popped up little too frequently for our tastes. We also appreciate the fact that Rockstar supports custom soundtracks, but we detest the highly limited system that they're using to implement them--you're essentially forced to rip a CD straight to your PSP's memory card. Not an ideal solution at all. But those are quibbling details. Liberty City Stories is a truly worthy entry in the Grand Theft Auto series. In fact, if you hated the crudely-implemented RPG elements of San Andreas, you might actually prefer this game's simpler approach. Regardless, this is the game that will finally make the PSP a must-own handheld device. You should buy it immediately. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />"
5.0	surprized my daughter and her family, they wanted this not the new version and were very happy to recieve it on christmas.
5.0	I have been dying for a Game Boy for years but got around to buying one.  Finally, my friend gave me the Gameboy Color bundle for Christmas and it came with this game.  I was never really a Pokemon fan and never really understood the concept or really cared for the cartoon or movies.  I'm actually rather picky with games and am surprised that I LOVE this game.  <br />I think it's because I like games that make you think, require you to make decisions, also have you battle and acquire things (like Zelda, which is another game series I love).  In the beginning, I basically started playing with no clue as to what I was doing.  But then I got stuck so I looked up a walkthrough on the web and had to start over.  It has taken me 20 hours (over a span of 3 weeks) but I am now on the ice path, getting ready to see Blackthorn City and then I'm done with that part of the game....I'm assumming I got to Johto next?  We'll see....I didn't read the entire walkthrough because I do want to be surprised.  So even if I, a non-Pokemon fan, can love this game then it must be awesome.  <br />Two things, though....I hate the fact that while trying to explore caves or the ice path or using surf in the water, I am constantly stopped by wild pokemon to battle.  This annoys me because it stops me from getting to where I have to go.  I don't mind a battle every once in a while but it's like every 2 steps, I am stopped.  Also, the whole ruins of Alph puzzle is confusing as well as keeping up with the radio shows and etc.  Sometimes there are TOO many things to keep up with.  Those people who are Pokemon experts may not encounter this frustration but those of us who are playing for the first time may find this confusing.  Anyway, it is worth the confusion and frustration....BUY THIS GAME....I just hope I can catch pikachu!  =)
5.0	"This game's THE BOMB!<br />I received mine early via the Roscoes Chicken & Waffles early bird giveaway.<br />The passing game is really spot-on this time. For instance, one time I was passing a basement window and I heard Gilby Mitnick III Jr. whining to his mommy about not passing him his Lunchables.<br />You definitely can't be conservative (with your playcalling) at all. That's a suckers way out!<br />I've really upped my game a lot in the 2 days I've had it so far. My friend said that my offensive game was \\""unfair and imbalanced\\"".<br />Poor guy sounds like one of those \\""Hate thy neighbor\\"" Retardicans!<br /><br />I'd give this one 5 stars for playability."
5.0	"The cinematics and animation is much more beautiful thanks to the capabilities of the Xbox 360.  I have only been playing for a few hours, but the story is already captivating.  The battle combos flow flawlessly and the new one-button system is great.  When the creators said that the new moral system was more in-depth than just good and bad, they weren't exaggerating.  To be \\""good\\"" throughout the game means sacrificing more than in the previous game.  Now you have to sacrifice the amount of money you earn when you own businesses as well.  I can go on for hours about the many positive aspects of the game but I will not.  If you liked Fable, you'll LOVE Fable II."
5.0	I got this game like two months ago and i played almost every day and i am still far from the ending, its pritty long game and the graphics are awsome. i never been into zelda games because they are boring to me and cheap, but this one is totaly diffrent from any zelda game out there. You play as link and when you travel to the shadow relm you play as the wolf. When you get further in the game, you get the power to transform into the worlf even when your not in the shadow relm. You can buy bombs, fishing lures, and many other little items. If your a fan of zelda games you will defenatly like this game, and if your not you will be introduced to the best zelda game out there.
5.0	I like Hexen.I played it when i was 2 years old but my mom threw it out thats a pain.
5.0	Nice! Like how it works for the Wii U and the 3DS, able to communicate online, or just use them like headphones. But I don't know much games from Nintendo that uses headsets. I know I'll use it for Call of Duty, Pokemon, Asassins Creed, and as headphones on other games.
5.0	I Love this game. Period. Carmen has never been better than in this story.<br /><br />Important Notes-<br />The version I got only supports Windows 98/Windows ME operating systems. A program this old won't run natively on modern systems. That's where virtualization software comes in. Using a virtual machine you can install an old operating system like Windows 98 and play programs from that era on it. It's pretty easy to set up.<br /><br />Though if you use VMware for your virtualization software of choice, you'll have to install the sound driver yourself for the Windows 98 operating system. You'll be looking for a Creative Ensoniq AudioPCI Driver. Go to Creative's support site and download the latest Windows 98 driver listed for Ensoniq AudioPCI. After downloading, copy and paste or drag and drop the driver file into your virtual machine. It's an executable installation file, so you just double click it (inside of the virtual machine) and it'll guide you through the installation process. Restart the virtual machine and voilà! Your sound is now working.
5.0	i remember i used to have this game and i bought it because the original got scratched way to much. But now years later it does not disappoint.
5.0	I received this in a timely manner.  It was packaged well and everything works great!  I'd definitely buy from this seller again.
5.0	A life saver for active kids on rainy days
5.0	it gives me way more space to work with. i can download all my games to my hard drive easier
5.0	replaced an older deceased unit still a great system.
5.0	MY GRANDSON LOVED IT FOR HIS BIRTHDAY PRESENT  HE IS INTO SOCCER
5.0	Very nice product, It matches the DSi perfectly, shipping was very fast.  Thank You very much.
5.0	Product as described. Super fast shipping. Directions were enclosed and we found that they were clear and easy. We were concerned about the stickers peeling but they have stayed on very nicely. Great way to add pizazz to a boring black ds lite . Thank you!
5.0	Got it for $30.  I have to give it 5 stars for that price
5.0	This is how Tomb Raider should have been all along. Fantastic play mechanics, design, and graphics. No perviness. The story is good. There is incredible incentive to do all side-missions as well, since it rewards the progress of the game. I have not tried multiplayer yet, but solo mode is just amazing. I compare it to UNCHARTED meets ARKHAM ASYLUM.<br />Do yourself a favor. Give this a good run. It is a fantastic game.
5.0	"The Fight is a physical workout and is exhausting, however it keeps you entertained while doing it.  The game is definitely worth the money, but don't buy if you expect a Wii Punch Out type experience -- you have to actually punch to play this game.  -It starts out slow, as you train and build up your xp it does speed up.  Don't give up on the game right away.  -The game is physically exhausting, but in a good way  -It takes some time to get used to the controls, but once you do it is great  -It can be tricky to get head tracking to work, proper lighting, distance from the camera and a clear background are a must  -You have to keep your feet planted, which is takes some getting used to.  It would be nice if there was an option to have a third controller that went around your waist as a \\""belt\\"" that allowed the Move to track your distance so you could move your feet"
5.0	Came in awesome condition and worked instantly. Thanks!
5.0	I waited about a year to get one of these and now I don't know how I lived without it!<br /><br />The biggest benefit is that this make it SO MUCH easier to enter various information into the fillable forms on the Xbox and various on-line forms.  In fact, it's pretty much required if you want to chat with your friends while playing games, otherwise, it would take forever using the on-screen keyboard.<br /><br />Since this attachment uses the jack that you would normally use to plug in your headset it provides another jack for you to plug in your headset.<br /><br />The keyboard doesn't noticeably affect my ability to hold on to the controller during game play but it does add bulk and may require an adjustment period for some.
5.0	I'll admit that the Wii U had a rough start with it's lack  of games at the beginning of its launch, but it certainly is making up for it now. This is a great bundle. New Super Mario Bros U and New Super Luigi U are fantastic games. They remind me of everything that was great about gaming back in the 90's. With HD graphics and classic Mario fun, you can't go wrong. The challenge level is neither too easy or too hard. Anybody will get a kick out of playing these two titles. If you enjoy platforming and adventure games, this system is for you. With great titles like Wind Waker HD, Rayman Legends, and Super Mario 3D World this system is already building a great library of games. And with Donkey Kong Tropical Freeze and Mario Kart coming out soon, there's no reason not to buy the Wii U. Wii U is well worth the money and has something for all gaming tastes.
5.0	This is a really cute speaker stand for DS and my 4 year old son loves using it.  We have a DS lite which fits very well in the holder.  The speaker quality is surprisingly good and the stand is nice and cushiony for your wrists.  A fun way to have both hands free when playing DS games.
5.0	So much fun!!!! Ready for an 8 player sing off!
5.0	Fast shipping, very happy!!!
5.0	Very fun game. I am a fan of the Legend of Zelda games and the Samurai and Dynasty Warriors games and this game was a wonderful combination of the two. Being able to play as some of my favorite characters from Zelda games and take out armies of monsters from the series has yet to grow old. And the battlefield BGM's are a nice twist on familiar melodies that admittedly made me a little nostalgic at times.<br />I am a little disappointed that the main storyline wasn't longer, but there's additional modes of play that add extra difficulty and achievements to obtain so it's not a complete upset.
5.0	Ok before you read this, ORDER THIS GAME. Now, let me tell you - this is by far the most impressive next generation game I have ever seen. Forget anything you saw on PS2 or even those early XBOX tech demos, this little 16  month old console is throwing out graphics that will make your jaw drop. At  one point in the game you walk into a pool of water and as you walk through  it the water ripples so realistically you will not believe your eyes. This  game has so many JAW DROPPING effects and graphical nitches, as well as  lighting it will amaze you. <br />Gameplay wise it is as good as any RE game,  just twice as long and has an involving storyline that keeps you in  suspense until the end, unlike RE3.<br />What can I say, if you have a  Dreamcast buy this game now, if you dont have a Dreamcast but one just for  this game, you will NOT be dissapointed.
5.0	Squaresoft's still got it.<br />You know, I used to think that nothing in the world could ever beat the supremousy of FF7, but then I played FF10.  FFX just kicks the living crud out of FF7 in every aspect, including storyline.  <br />And for those who said there wasn't enough gameplay just gave up to early.  That's right, there is so much to do in that game that I've already played for 125 hours and I still haven't gotten everything.  If you play the game simply to beat it, you're missing out on what Final Fantasy is really all about.  Beating the game is really only half of the game.  I don't usually buy a game to end up only playing half of it.  That would just be a waist of perfectly good money.  So once you actually get through the main plot, go and buy a strategy guide to squeeze every last drop out of this game.<br />And just for the record, in FFX, you can actually beat the game and then go back and get EVERTHING.  You can't miss anything permenantly since there's only one Disk to the game.  Makes sense.
5.0	My 16 year old likes this a lot but says that the makers gave KD almost super human powers!! I'm just glad I paid half price! I feel like I have super human buying powers!!
5.0	"While the fighting system is deep enough to provide an entertaining challenge to hardcore fighting game fans, it is also easy for beginners and even younger children to pick up the basics well enough to enjoy the game after a little practice.<br /><br />We babysit my 9 year old niece and 5 year old nephew frequently, and often end up playing PS2. We played Soul Calibur 3 for a while tonight, and they both got the hang of the game quite quickly. In two-player versus mode, the players are given the option of adjusting the amount of life their fighter begins each match with, so players can adjust the amounts relative to each other to even the odds a bit. Of course, you can just let the kids win most of the matches to keep it fun for them and save your best moves to use on your friends.<br /><br />Although the ESRB rating is T for Teen, I don't believe a reasonable adult would find any of the content inappropriate for younger children. Some of the female characters were obviously designed to appeal to young males, but there is nothing in the game they couldn't show on prime time network television. The fights do not contain any blood or gore, and there is no foul language, unless you count the antiquated \\""cur\\"". If you have a child or teen that enjoys fighting games, this one is a must have, and more appropriate than many of the other fighting games on the market IMO."
5.0	For anyone whose played any FIFA game in the past, you can expect this game to provide endless hours of intense fun and competition.  There are a few changes, however...all for the best.  The players have full 360 degree control, whereas in past FIFA games a player can only move up, down, left, right, and diagonally in each respective direction.  The dribbling system for tricks has been improved and works great!    My only flaw is it seems the computer rarely gets any foul called, yet when I'm playing, I get called on for many more things, even when I reach the ball first.  Maybe they did it to speed up the game so it wouldn't stop so often because of fouls, but it's very one-sided, almost as if the refs were programmed to favor the CPU.  That's really the only flaw I have.  The goalies are a lot smarter, the shooting is simple but not limited, and the pace of the game seems perfect to me.  The graphics are really good, and the soundtrack is different but fits the game rather well (minus a few annoying tracks).    Overall, I give this game a 9/10 simply because of the way the fouls are called to CLEARLY favor the CPU.  there's always room for improvement, but I like FIFA 10 much better than FIFA 09.
5.0	Best bang for your buck!!!!!!! it was money well spent! Kills fast and makes people mad!! so yes totally Awesome!!
5.0	If you're a fan of 2D fighter games it's here on the Dreamcast. Capcom vs SNK 1-2 import, Vampire Hunter Chonicles import, King of Fighters 99-02 import, Marvel vs Capcom 1-2. Jo Jo Bizarre Adventure, Street fighter 3 Collection, Samurai Blade 2, Mark of the Wolves, Sega Ages Volume 1. And Sega Saturn have tons of 2D fighters and shooters a lot are import so get the dreamcast and saturn to complete your 2D library.
5.0	I actually really enjoyed the activated ejecicios of this application. I recommend buying the product is very practical, easy to use and gives you motivation to continue with the exercises.
5.0	My grandsons really enjoyed this games.
5.0	i ordered this game as a gift. It came in as schedule. its a fun game to play, i brought it on sale and it was a great price
5.0	Players are challenged to trade old &quot;first person shooter&quot; tactics in for new strategies and methods of attack because the only weapons are clubs, axes, swords and shields. Rune has vivid Viking scenery and includes a version of UnreaEd (an editor) for creating new levels and modifications to guts of the game.<br />I'd recommend this game to any die-hard gamer.
5.0	Pokemon Black definitely exceeded my expectations. I am thoroughly enjoying the game. The graphics are very impressive, and I am also pleased with the new Pokemon. I think the game developers did a great job making this new game different and yet still true to what Pokemon players love about the earlier games.
5.0	Holds twelve games and room for extra memory card. Good quality case, a lot better than the playstation case that only holds eight games.
5.0	A fun and simple golf game. Been a fan since ps2.
5.0	The display is nice because it shows red for empty, yellow when it is half charged and green when it is fully charged. The only annoying thing is tht the cover is a bit of a hassle to put on woth the battery inside.
5.0	I play for hours on end in free play.  Then when I found the LA MOD I spent even more time playing it.  One hell of a game. Hoorah
5.0	It was exactly what I expected, high impact game, gave it 5 stars because of excellent format. Nothing to dislike would recommend this game to everyone over 16yrs of age!!!
5.0	Great work out!!  Me and my daughter danced to those tunes and my gooderness, what a work out.  I enjoyed it!
5.0	Because the prices of Brazil I decided to buy my PS4 in the American Amazon.<br /><br />I received the order in Brazil after 4 days of sent and in perfect condition. As soon as the console arrived I was running to test.<br /><br />Everything is working perfectly and in proper standard of Sony quality. I found the system very fast and stable. The configuration is very simple and quick.<br /><br />The menu is very attractive and everything works without any locking. Tested the PSN Killzone and Fifa 14, in addition to free games from PSN.<br /><br />Congratulations are Sony and Amazon for delivery.<br /><br />thank you
5.0	Excellent product, excellent quality. 100% recommended and fast shipping.
5.0	There's not much to say about this product, it's first party Nintendo. That should be enough, however since it's 2012, spend the few extra bucks on getting it in a Very Good or Like New condition like I did. In the description of the product it should say the buttons are not sticky and the joystick is firm. Other than that, Atomic Purple is a pretty damn cool color.<br />Overall: A+
5.0	I have been a big fan of the Fallout franchise for awhile now, and I have never been more impressed.
5.0	Although, I found the user interface odd at first. I have grown to love this game more than any other I have played. The missions are fun and challenging, and even the weak creeps are still a challenge when in large groups. The game keeps you on your toes. Having the Dynamic work of both Space flight and Space Battles, You have a whole second side of the game where you get to do ground Battles. Constantly your tactics need to adapt and improve, You even have PVP chances where you can test your mettle against other players, even though the computers can be just as challenging. One neat thing is the fact that the computer levels when they are +1 they become difficult to say the least, the challenge rating really does keep you in need of finding better weapons and tactics to keep alive during this Galactic sized war.    100% fun for those who want a challenge, and a dynamic game.
5.0	The game speaks for itself, it's amazing to see what Blizzard did with it. I am simply obsessed. Thank you Blizzard.
5.0	Exactly as advertised. Works perfectly.
5.0	This game is the reason there should be more hours in the day, needless to say I'm constantly hooked on this stuff! I believe by now I have squeezed every cent I paid for this. This is just an amazing multiplayer game. You have six characters, countless levels, numerous missions and whatnot. You can never get bored of this baby. I've been playing since February and its June now, and I believe I have not missed a single day.
5.0	Been a fan of Hori Screen Protectors since the DS Lite. This protectors aren't any different in quality but the application process is once again improved from the previous generation and the application on my New 3DS XL went off without a hitch. No dust under either protector. Instructions and tabs are clear and understandable.Highly recommended for those looking for screen protectors.
5.0	Has some pretty good games, you can play with the cpu or with 2 players. Pretty good and it does work with my new ps2 silver. I was hesitant to buy it because of the other reviews, but gave it a shot, my new ps2 silver doesn't have a problem playing this disc.
5.0	This game is awesome. Story, while it won't blow your mind, keeps you interested and engaged and wondering what will happen next. Graphics are pretty darn good and can definitively hold its own against the very best. There are plenty of scripted events that are extremely fun to go through and it keeps the game flowing and non-repetitive. I mean, what more is there to say. Puzzles are at perfect difficulty. You feel great after completing them and you rarely get stuck (although towards the end, it might happen).<br /><br />Personally, I think I like this game more than Uncharted series, in which it is pretty similar. On paper, I think Uncharted does most of the things better (acting, scripted events, presentation etc) but I really like the world of Tomb Raider a lot more. Uncharted is a little bit more Disney-like in the sense that everything works out for everyone in the end. Tomb Raider's story and atmosphere is not quite the same and it is a lot more mature and deals with more brutal moments, which is just more to my taste. Plus, I always wanted a good game that uses bow and arrow.<br /><br />If I have one criticism, it is that Lara Croft is a pretty weak character in this game. I get that she's supposed to be vulnerable but they made here a little bit too vulnerable, it's especially a little bit annoying when you're pulling off all these action scenes only to hear her continue to whine. There's also little evolution of the character. They say this was suppose to tell the story of how Lara became a badass, but until the end, she stayed pretty much the same.
5.0	Excellent RPG game if you like games like Fable then you will like or should I say love this!
5.0	I am 22 years old, and I think this RPG is amazing! I played once through the whole game when I was 19, and I am planning to play through it again. This RPG presents a great story with unexpected plot twists. The characters are so vivid and memorable. I don't want to go in to the details. I highly recommend this game to everyone!
5.0	If you want a game that you can take on road trips, and play the whole time is it it, never gets old, fun and original.
5.0	First, I would like to say thank you to everyone who leaves their comments and reviews on their purchases.  If it weren't for the reviews, I wouldn't have ever bought anything from Amazon.  I enjoy spending alot of time at home and thought about buying a gaming system.  The last system I owned was the sega genesis.  Since I haven't played any video games since then, it was recommended to me by a friend to buy the wii.  I absolutely love it!  I have my wii connected to my wireless network and stream netflix and also enjoy the news and weather features!  You cannot beat the price ($199) and highly recommend for any age.
5.0	This game is simply the best game out there. GET IT NOW!
5.0	this game is a must for anyone i cant stop playing it even after a month seriously if you enjoy a little blood and a good story line this is for you
5.0	The whole family loves playing this game. There's usually someone on it, whether alone or with someone. We have Mario on the original supernintendo that was mine way before becoming a mom. The kids used to play that but since we purchased this Wii game, my old one collects dust. Great fun-moving game.
5.0	This is a must own title for rpg fans who need to know what all the fuss is about! If you don't know what all the fuss is about run out and buy this game now!
5.0	The game was amazing with fun gameplay, a good story, dark compelling atmosphere, and interesting characters. In the end it is just a good buy.
5.0	If your like me, you saw the medal of honor franchise stagnating, not exactly in decline, but there was little forward movement.  Then along came Call of Duty Finest Hour.  Wow.  Well if you liked Finest Hour but didnt see what else could be done, look no further than Big Red One, which takes gamers into chapters of WW2 history that many people sadly dont know.  Beginning in 1942, Two years before D-Day, and thus two years before any previous WW2 video game, this game brings the gamer, with the same squad of characters through the entire European theater, from the First clashes against the Vichy French in Algeria, to clashes with Afrika Korp and Italians in Tunisia.  Unlike other games Africa is not merely a small two level affair, BRO gives it the sense of importance it deserves with over a quarter of the game happening there.  Then its off to Sicily where you help knock Italy out of the war.  I especially enjoyed fighting the Italians for a change, new weapons, vehicles and such.  Once you get to France you realize just how tenacious the Germans are, and the game progressivly gets more challanging until you reach Germany itself.  Definitely an amazing perspective, and a more realistic one.  The average soldier did not, as Medal of Honor would tell you, end up in the OSS blowing up endless secret german or japanese weapons behind enemy lines, they would in fact be fighting inch by inch with their squad for the duration, and thats what stays with you when you finish this game, the sense of how long and hard the war was on the average soldier.  Knowing that for the guys who landed in Algeria in 42, the odds were against them living to see the war end in 45
5.0	This game is great for 9-10 year olds. Keeps girls busy for hours. Girls learn to take care of a horse. I think if your into DS games then this is the horse game for you. You will love it as my daughter has loved it!
5.0	This game had me glued to my 3DS for the entire length of the story. The game is not perfect, there is a known bug that cab corrupt your save file, but It's very easy to avoid it and the game is totally worth playing.
5.0	Both games are hard as heck, but a LOT of fun! Not necessarily for people who are too used to Call of Duty-style shoot-em-ups (no offense), but hardcore games will LOVE these games' creativity and post-apocalypse setting! Plus, it's 2 games for the price of one!
5.0	So fun for the kids. We havent experienced any bugs in the gaming. Easy for the kids to navigate.<br /><br />As a side note, we also own the kinect. Our kids pick the wii over that because of the responsiveness of the games. Also, they hate the loading time of the Kinect. We have several games that are fun, but these are more fun, and easier and quicker to load and play.
5.0	I am very pleased with my recent purchase of the xbox360 arcade stick tournament edition; it has exceeded my expectations. It was in the original packaging with no scratches. The controls are very responsive.
5.0	We got this as a gift for Christmas, installed it and it still looks great. Kids will pick at stuff if they think it will come off and this won't get that.<br /><br />It was hard to put on but not terrible. I wanted to get it on perfectly and really worked at it.. It was worth it.
5.0	Love the Dragon age games!
5.0	Single player is non stop action and plays out like a epic action movie.  Multi feels like what TF2 was suposta be.  Perks for each class you make but a bit of a comic twist. Use the cold blooded perk and your charater has blue skin.  Kill someone who killed you and you get a Payback so the person dies with money flying out of them.  Little things like that take away from the realism but add to the fun.
5.0	X-mas present for my son.  A teenager not sure if he likes it but I got a smile when he opened and he got it ready for is Xbox right away.
5.0	Great game for hardcore RPG fans. If you own a ps3 and don't mind to get your @ss handed to you a few times, then by all means buy this game!
5.0	Game is very buggy, fun to play when it works.
5.0	My grandson loves it.  Keeps him busy for hours on the wii.  Good, clean fun.  Now he wants me to play against him...
5.0	The DVDs arrived in an excellent condition, installed the game (using the serial numbers provided with the game) and then I take-off :)<br /><br />Highly recommended.
5.0	Really nice, it does help to improve your k/d.<br />Paddles feel nice, as well as the bullets.<br />Controller is in pristine conditions
5.0	This was the right gift and the right price. I know it's just what my friends would want to play with.
5.0	Choose your favorite characters from capcom and snk the first and best 2D game on gamecube.
5.0	Who wouldn't love pokemon?!  The fact that you actually get to see your pokemon follow you around in this version makes it pretty fun :)
5.0	This game is amazing. From the story, the soundtracks, the characters, and almost every detail within the game is beautiful. I first picked this game up thinking I'd only play for 5 minutes because at that current time I was really bored and didn't know which game to play, then all of a sudden I found myself heavily engaged at playing this game. The plot in this story is beyond amazing, and the ending will have you begging for more, I assure you. I don't over exaggerate when I say that THIS GAME IS A MUST HAVE! It's one of the greatest games I have ever played in a while, especially for PSP! Stop, drop whatever you're doing, and pick up this game, because I assure you that this game will be definitely worth your time!
5.0	Well worth the extra money!  I bought the cheap protectors first and they were junk. So I spent the money on these and good not be more pleased. They go on easy, easy to get all the bubbles out. After application they are basically invisible, my child didn't even notice anything different. I would buy these again!
5.0	One of the greatest video games ever.  I'm a big fan of the AC franchise, so I am a bit biased, but this game was amazing!  It was like Pirates of the Caribbean meets Assassin's Creed.  Assassinating Templars, exploring sunken ship-wrecks, battles on the sea with the Spanish and English Navies, this game was so exciting!  EPIC!<br /><br />The gameplay was a huge improvement over ACIII.  The story-line, on the other hand, has lost some of it's awe factor from the Ezio trilogy, which is disappointing, because that was a huge factor in my love for the franchise.  even with this weak point, AC4 is a huge win, and a wonderful blend of pirates and assassins.
5.0	Grandson loves this game! When I ordered it, did not know it had a statue. Added bonus for sure! The boy was thrilled!
5.0	Even for a Wii game, this is a beautiful game with gorgeous 2D hand drawn visuals. The game stick to traditional Japanese culture and even has Japanese voice acting(with English subtitles), this really isn't a turn-off though since it only adds to the atmosphere. The game also plays very well and fluidly with traditional controls. Not every Wii needs to be motion controlled to be fun.   The difficulty level, even in the easiest mode expect to be defeated every once in a while. This game is challenging indeed.    Though the game sometimes feels too linear, and you may feel like all you need to do to progress is to go from point A to B.    But with 20+ hours of main story gameplay and 30+ hour for full completion, this game is worth it.
5.0	It was fine no problems. My son loves it  I would buy this again and recommend it for parents who are looking for non violent ds games. Thank you!
5.0	I purchased this for a Steeler's fan & he absolutely loved this gift!!  When you have to think outside the box for gifts for kids this is perfect!!  You definitely should use a hair dryer when you put this onto the Xbox it helps the Vinyl stick on places & use the squeegee.  Easier than I thought to apply.
5.0	got here fast and functions
5.0	this turtle beach headset works better than the other one i bought the headset fits better on the head an covers the ears better an the volume controlls an not on the headset like my other one so its much easier to change the volume an chat on this one
5.0	This is just a fun game.  I enjoy it as someone who grew up playing the original Nintendo when I was a kid.  I bought the Wii so that we could play games together as a family and it is a great machine to do that with.  Super Paper Mario mixes the best of the old school Super Mario Bros. with the 3-D of a modern game.  I love switching from 2D to 3D at the press of a button.  You see things from a completely different angle and it is cool and fun.  One boss is defeated by quickly switching back and forth and then hitting him when he comes close.  My kids love this game and can't wait for me to get home from work so that I can play some more or watch them play.  I highly recommend this game to anyone who has a Wii.
5.0	I was worried about purchasing this because of some of the reviews saying it was DOA and when my arrived I tried to charge it, but the lights only flashed once and then were off. I checked about 20 min later and the controller was charging like it should and it has been working great ever since. I have tested this only on emulators and dead trigger and it has been amazing, it is so much better than using the on screen controls.
5.0	This was a fantastic purchase, I use it for playing Street Fighter IV. The product works fine, I haven't seen any signs of wear with my moderate usage. I was a little surprised that it felt a little cheaper than it looked in the photo. Regardless, it works just fine and I've had no problems with it.
5.0	I bought it at Toysrus in the Spring I Enjoyed it alot I'm in  the last  level so I'm glad about that but I would recomend you  rent it first.
5.0	I bought this Skylander for my 8 year old grandson.  He is a whiz on the TV screen and loves this spooky hand.  I don't know much about the game but he does and I try and keep up on all the new ones and surprise him with them.  It's fun for him and for me too as I love to see the joy on his face when he sees it.
5.0	Keep your head down soldier, or you'll get it taken off...this is one of those games that are so immersive you'll find yourself playing in the dark w/the volume up and LOVING it....the most realistic WWII FPS hands down.  Most times you will have your squad with you so you wont be alone...but at other times you'll see them get cut down one by one as the lead flies so thick you will be looking for a place to hide and crying for your mama.
5.0	I don't see what everyone's bitching about, works great for me on my note 3. I play a lot of emulator games with it and am the envy of my local nerds at my college in between classes.
5.0	I've had the game since its release and its a lot of fun. Creating levels and being able to play everyone else's creations is pretty cool. Some are short and some must of taken months to accomplish. Very satisfied and I enjoy it more than lbp2 (to much content to learn to use). Great game for all ages! highly recommended!
5.0	Really fun game, active all time, demand a lot of space but is ok. I am take a good option.
5.0	Works well. A little tricky to install. Different generations of PS3 controllers have slightly different build designs so be careful when disassembling.
5.0	My Son loves the color of his remotes. I like that they are not bulky. I would buy them again.
5.0	Love this game and really enjoyable. If you are a fan of the infamous you will like this game
5.0	After having gone back and forth with buying a wheel for my favorite racing games.  I finally bought one used locally.  Now i'm an older gamer, and an avid racing game fan so the thought of adding more realism to my games seemed like a no brainer.  I got the wheel hooked it up in a matter of a few minutes, and had it fired up ready to go.  By now everyone should know that the wheel is not truly wireless, and needs an external power source for the force feedback aspect of the wheel.  it also needs either a rechargeable plug and play unit or 2 double A batteries.  Hit connect on the console, and on the wheel, and BAM you're ready to go.  I tried the enclosed Forza 2 demo but if you don't already own the full game shame on you.  Wheel does take some getting used to and like a few reviews have said the pedals and my table of choice tend to slide, but i hear a yoga mat works wonders and have to get one of those before Forza 3 streets.<br />  I like the feel of the wheel and the positive and negative feedback that it provides me over the rumble strips, gravel traps, and the occasional grassy stretch as i go shooting off the course at speed.  For me it really does add a new level of realism to the game, and i really enjoy it.  I am still in the learning stages so i have yet to break old lap times, but wanted to share my feelings.  I love the wheel and it feels very responsive during the races (even if this one was used) I noticed moving through the turns, and uneven straights the wheel will fight you a bit.  The pedals seem very sturdy under usage and appear to give me finer control over acceleration.  The paddles feel like the real thing to me but i have little experience with any real world car equipped with them, but like I said.  They feel good to me!  I do wish that it had a little more rotation but i don't think that it is really necessary more like a personal choice than anything else.<br />  For fine tuning things like paint, vinyls and so on in games like need for speed, or Forza i would strongly suggest going back to the standard control pad for that finer control rather then using the wheel, D-pad, and paddle shifters to move around with.<br />  Overall I am VERY happy with my purchase, and hope that this helps others who are stuck on the fence like i was. This is the table i used for the stand, and it works really well provided you add a little book or something to really clamp it down tight.<br />  http://www.amazon.com/Table-Mate-Table-Mate-II/dp/B0007YDUXI/ref=sr_1_6?ie=UTF8&s=home-garden&qid=1255374461&sr=8-6need for speed, or Forza i would strongly suggest going back to the standard control pad for that finer control rather then using the wheel, D-pad, and paddle shifters to move around with.

5.0	"In my opinion this game is the greatest action-adventure game ever created.  Drawing from the Legend of Zelda games, it is a mix of fast paced action, puzzle solving, and platforming immersed in Japanese myths and legends with a deep, engaging story.  As the Japanese sun god Amaterasu reincarnated, you play as a wolf with god-like abilities, weapons, and a unique art brush that allows you to stop time and wreak havoc on your enemies.  The unique Japanese art style and music enhance the game as you fight demons, giant spiders, and other bosses of epic proportions.  A must have for any Zelda fan as well as anyone who enjoys video games casually as it is easy to pick up and learn.  For hard core gamers, the amazing story and unique combat system are complimented with a wide variety of side quests, collectibles, and an XP system using \\""Praise\\"" to level up giving 50+ hours of gameplay.  If you like it, spread the word around because Okami does not get near enough credit as it's due."
5.0	Harvest Moon has been HUGELY addictive on the SNES and N64. The GBA version is just as addictive - and can be played anywhere!<br />The familiar, fun gameplay is here. You're a kid taking over a farm. The farm is in disrepair and needs help. You start out by weeding the garden, chopping the logs into boards and breaking up rocks. You slowly start growing crops, raising horses and chickens, and making a name for yourself. <br />You might think this would get boring, but time is running all the time. You have to get food to your animals, play with them, keep your crops watered, get your field cleared, mine for supplies, go into town and chat it up with the local girls. <br />There are the usual goodies - horse races, other festivals that come on certain days of the year. There are upgrades to your tools and little sprites that help you out with your tasks. You can fall in love with the girl of your dreams and build a life together. With lots of customizable names, from your farm to your dog to your horse, it really begins to feel like your own little world.<br />The graphics are great, and while it's not a button-mashing extreme, the clock is always ticking so you get a sense that you have to get going with your life in order to feed yourself and your animals. There aren't goals to meet or points to score - there is a farm to tend to and responsibilities to manage. It's a great game for all ages and VERY rewarding.<br />My one complaint about this game - and keep in mind that this is a HUGELY addictive game for me so I love it - is that it only lets you be a male. Why?? I would LOVE to be a girl on the farm who is dating boys. It can't be THAT hard to switch a few names and pixels. Why am I forced to be a boy? Why can't a girl run a farm?<br />That being said, it's a ton of fun and well suited for the GBA. Grab a copy - but be warned, you'll be playing it a lot!
5.0	"The Wii is an innovative gaming system that brings the gaming experience to the entire family.  In the past the game system where mine.  On the rare occasion that someone in the house wanted to play they felt obligated to ask me.  Well with the Wii it is a system for the entire family.  My wife and kids enjoy it as much as I do.  The games that came with the system are fun and easy to play.  My wife enjoys the fact that groundbreaking cordless controllers incorporate physical movement into the game playing experience.  The Wii is designed to get you moving.  One of the biggest complaints about gaming is that kids are no longer exercising because they are playing video games.  This is not the case with the Wii.<br /><br />One of the most exciting features of the Wii is the Wii remote or Wii-mote.  You can control your players in the game by pushing the buttons on the Wii remote but you also might have to swing your arms or move the controller through the air and the Wii console translates those movements into movements on the screen.  The Wii remote is the primary aspect that distinguishes the Wii system from all others.<br /><br />The Wii easily connects to the internet.  This feature allows old school gamers to down load retro arcade and home video games onto their Wii console at a relatively inexpensive cost.  Most games range from 500 to 200 will points ($5.00-$20.00).  All of the Donkey Kong series, tecmo bowl, Mario franchise and about a hundred others have been included.  Some of the systems that have lent their most popular games to the Wii library include, the original NES (Nintendo Entertainment System), the SNES (Super Nintendo Entertainment System), N64,  (Nintendo 64), TurboGrafx16, Sega Genesis, NEOGEO and several arcade games.  More titles are being added every month.  You can also surf the world wide web, store photos, check the weather and I understand that soon you will be able to download music.  One of the most used aspects of the Wii's internet capabilities is online play.  Interacting and doing battle with other gamers all over the world is far from new, but it is still an intriguing aspect of gaming.<br /><br />A drawback to the Wii is that you have to purchase additional controllers and accessories to get everything out of the most games.  Many of the games you can download require a \\""classic\\"" controller.  The Wii Fit board costs quite a bit but it is a way to get a pretty good workout for those of us who could are not world-class athletes.  There have been reports of significant weight loss based on some Wii and Wii Fit games.  Most of the additional purchases that I have made have been well worth the cost.<br /><br />To me I can see the Wii as more than just a gaming system.  It is a way to have family time, a social networking device, it is a news and weather outlet as well as a way to get some exercise and have a pretty good time playing video games.  The Wii is pretty close to being a lifestyle.  I would recommend this to anyone.<br /><br />BKOOL - Real Game Player!"
5.0	Really love the quality and I can play for hours and hours and it doesn't hurt my ears. Definitely recommend!
5.0	I wanted this for my husband because he's such a fanatic for everything unique that comes with Xbox 360. It's beautiful, shiny and it looks like my husband's Christmas is going to be a very bright one.  I am no expert, but since this is a limited edition, I'm assuming it won't be widely available for very long.
5.0	"I have had this drum set for three months now, complete with an additional cymbal.  It works perfectly with Rock Band 3 Pro Mode, and is a great way to challenge yourself again if regular expert drums have gotten too easy for you.  The cymbals add a new dimension to the gameplay.  The pads and cymbals physically are very good.  The pads are very durable and much better than the original Rock Band drum pads.  The cymbals are a bit loud, but I have yet to have problems with hit registration (I play Pro Expert Drums now).  The pedal is very large and completely metallic.  It is very durable, but somewhat loud.  I ended up using my old pedal that I had been using with my old set by using a 1/8\\"" to 1/4\\"" converter (the Ion set requires 1/4\\"" inputs). My old pedal is the Value Pedal MK1, which works perfectly with the Ion set by using the converter I mentioned earlier.<br /><br />Overall, I would recommend this for anyone who loves Rock Band and wants to add an extra dimension to the game.  In the three months I have had it, I have been playing much more often and having more fun.<br /><br />Here are some videos of me playing on the drums on pro expert difficulty:<br /><br />Holiday by Green Day<br />[...]<br />Hysteria by Muse<br />[...]"
5.0	I just recieved my Elite today, I had to pick one up due to the Amazon promotion (12 + 1 month xbox live free too bad the promotion is gone now.) So my Elite have the jasper mobo which is great due to it being more quieter than my launch 360 (which i still have and working). I am no fanboy so this is a honest review. I have all three console (Wii, PS3, 360). I love all the PS3 exclusive (LBP, Infamous, MGS4, etc..) and 360 (Gears 2, Halo, Fable, etc..) and Wii (Mario Galaxy, LoZ:Twilight Princess, Animal Crossing etc...)<br /><br />One thing i notice different between These (fall 2009) and the other xbox 360 (Pro, Arcade, GOTY Elite, RE5 Elite) is that the power brick is WAYYY Smaller than before. I compared it with my RE5 Elite and my RE5 Elite have a bigger power brick even tho its a jasper.<br /><br />I read some forums and some people said that these fall 2009 are not always jasper, so  it might be a risk ordering it from amazon. But i did, and got a jasper, other people have also receive jasper.<br /><br />So both ps3 and the 360 elite cost $299. Both are great console to own. It all comes down to your own opinion on which to choose from. BOTH DO NOT come HD ready meaning you will have to buy your own HDMI cables or Component Cable But HDMI cables are cheap you can just buy it here at amazon.<br /><br />PS3: Blu Ray player, WiFi, FREE PSN membership, Sony Exclusive games (God of war 3, Uncharted, GT5 etc...)<br /><br />360: LIVE membership $50 a year (sometimes cheaper if you can get the LIVE cards on sale), 360 exclusive games (Alan Wake, Halo ODST, Fable 2, Gears 2 etc...)
5.0	The Lego games are similar in the things you need to do, but the story lines are all different.  They are such a blast to play!
5.0	I received on time and in excellent condition. It is a very fine article. The image presented and the description in the offer is pretty accurate to what I received.
5.0	I enjoy the realistic game action provided from the product. It was a replacement from a lost game. So once again game on!
5.0	Wonderful. The puzzles are fun and the storytelling is FANTASTIC. Stephen Merchant and JK Simmons give stellar preformances in addition to the franchises staple, Ellen McClain. What a great concept and execution.
5.0	If you just have to have the best sound experience, maybe these is not the headphones for you.<br />If you are looking for something in the $60 neighborhood and you realize that eventually your dog is going to chew the line, or you are going to sit on them, or drop them, then you think &#34;what is the point in a $100 or $200 headphone anyway?&#34;<br /><br />Xbox live mike worked.  Push in and turn to lock in the mike.  Only one side of the mike receives sound, and if you think about that, that is what you want.<br />I found the headset comfortable, I have a big head, medium ears.  3 hours of Skyrim last night, I forgot that I had them on, so that means that the headphones were pretty comfortable.<br />I do not think this is the best headphone on the market, I suspect there are more expensive headphones with more directional speakers and better quality.  I am not sure I have good enough hearing to take advantage more expensive features.<br />There is about a &#34;body length and a half&#34; of cable.  I think this was less than my previous headset had.  My xbox cabinet was already setup before this, with a &#34;USB extender&#34; and &#34;component cable/sound&#34; located right at the position I wanted, so the shorter headset cable worked okay for me.<br /><br />I did not hear a hum in the background, I will listen tonight again to hear if I hear a hum.
5.0	have lots of fun  playing this, my grandchildren have lots of fun with it also.  keeps them entertained when they visit
5.0	This game always has something new to do, you can have multiple characters playing in the same town now as well, up to 4 different save files. Very entertaining, tons of game data (largest  3DS Game Save File ever made)<br />I recommend this for any age.
5.0	Chell, a test subject at Aperture Science, has successfully destroyed the insane AI known as GLaDOS and escaped from the facility. Unfortunately, injured in the final battle, she was 'rescued' by a robot from the facility and returned to cold storage. Awakening many years later, Chell finds herself once against trapped in the facility. With the help of a friendly AI, Wheatley, she must flee once more...something made harder when GLaDOS is brought back online.  Released in 2007 as an add-on to the 'Orange Box' compilation, Portal was a surprise success for its developers, Valve. It won several Game of the Year awards and glowing plaudits for its conciseness and the cleverness of its central mechanic, not to mention the frequently hilarious writing (and the brilliant closing song). Portal 2 has a lot to live up to and is put in a difficult situation for a sequel. Sequels are usually bigger, more epic and larger in scale than the original, but the Portal concept wouldn't really work on a vaster canvas. Making a sequel to Portal that respected the original game without ruining the things that made it brilliant would therefore appear to be a tall order.  Happily, Valve have pulled it off. From start to finish Portal 2 is almost unimpeded brilliance. The game is longer than Portal, coming in at about eight hours compared to the original's three. Since even the splendid original game was risking becoming stale at the end, Valve have split the sequel into three clear sections. In the first Chell uses portals very much as in the first game and is aided by Wheatley and opposed by GLaDOS. At the end of this sequence Chell finds herself in the most ancient parts of the facility, where a very different set of puzzles await using different mechanics. In this section she has no enemies or opponents but is guided through the puzzles via messages pre-recorded by Aperture Science's long-deceased founder, Cave Johnson. After this she returns to the upper levels where an all-new set ofchallenges await, leading to the epic conclusion.  As such Valve neatly avoid what could have been the game's biggest pitfall, outliving its welcome. The shifts in tone, plot and game mechanics are handled well, but still combine to form a coherent game. The cast has been enlarged with the addition of Stephen Merchant (Ricky Gervais's wingman, who increasingly is outshining his partner) as Wheatley. Valve wanted a completely different type of vocal performance for Wheatley then you normally get in a video game and Merchant's half-ad-libbed dialogue is different and more immediate, not to mention hilarious. J.K. Simmons (best-known as J. Jonah Jameson in the Raimi Spider-Man movies) provides the recorded voice of Cave Johnson and his deadpan delivery of increasingly deranged dialogue is also excellent. Ellen McLain also returns as GLaDOS and, in one of the more inspired ideas in the game, is given more dramatic meat to work with as GLaDOS begins to suffer an immense internal struggle as she and Chell discover the secret past of Aperture Science.  Graphically, the game looks great with some impressive production design and animations. The Source Engine (eight years old in 2012) is definitely ageing, but nevertheless remains impressive. The puzzles are fairly fiendish and require some lateral thinking in order to make sense of all the new elements ('paints' that give different effects to surfaces, catapults that throw the player around, tractor beams and light-bridges), but the gradual introduction of these elements allows the player to get to grips with them effectively. There's a few puzzles near the end of the game that are really tough, but nothing too frustrating. More complex are the puzzles in co-op mode, but with two players working on solutions these shouldn't be too much of a problem.  Events in the game build and culminate in the final battle, which is once again impressive. However, the finale of the game must rank amongst the most bizarre - but also brilliant - in gaming history. From the unexpected opera serenade to Wheatley's closing, introspective monologue it's thoroughly entertaining. Things are left open for the continuation of Chell's story (either in further Portal games or possibly future Half-Life titles) but there is no cliffhanger.  Portal 2 (*****) is funny, clever, dramatic, well-acted and constantly inventive, and one of the best games in Valve's already stellar history. It is available now in the UK (PC, X-Box 360, PlayStation 3) and the USA (PC, X-Box 360, PlayStation 3).
5.0	Worked great as a replacement.  The Wii started working as soon as I swapped out the old for this one.
5.0	Its MADDEN need i say more.....REDSKINS all the way BABY!!!!!
5.0	Microsofts taking over the living room and television viewing experience, and they're doing it with the kinect; voice and gesture controls. Apple and Google should take this as a shot across the bow, and they might want to get on their horses if they want to compete for the whole home experience.<br /><br />It's just a matter of time before apps are developed to make the Xbox One the hub for all home automation. Imagine controlling your lights, AC/Heat, Fireplace, Garage door, front door locks, all with the sound of your voice.  Microsoft takes it's first GIANT step in this direction.<br /><br />My only hope is that they foster the open app environment like Apple, because if they do, the sky's the limit for what this console might accomplish.
5.0	Love this game as does my 7 year old. Nice to find a game we can play and enjoy together. It's somewhat similar to the Mario games. If you or your kids like those you will enjoy this.
5.0	I have played every Diablo since the beginning and i have to say so far this is the best. One of the top points i will say is that after playing Diablo on console i will NEVER play the PC version again. It is so much better for XBOX. much more user friendly, better loot and drops, better overall game experience. you can beat the game really easy in all modes if you use a lower difficultly setting but when you up the difficultly it actually brings a good challenge to the game. i went through and beat the entire game through inferno on normal mode and now i have tried to play the more difficult setting (above hard, cant remember the name now) and i have died multiple times so the challenge impresses me. i went and got the storyline out and now i challenge myself to harder demons for better loot.<br /><br />A+ on this, cant wait for an expansion!
5.0	Amazingly fun for all the members of the family. <br />Fully  recommended.
5.0	This is an excellent follow up.  After devoting much of my time to FIFA 2002, I was very pleased with this.  If you are not a big soccer fan this game might get a little repetitive.  otherwise I recommend this game.<BR>GUNNERS F.C. rules!
5.0	I was waiting for a long time for a good RPG for my favorite console. I played some RPG's before, but none of those had ever hooked me as Demon's Souls. I think the action is so good in this game. It's a difficult game, very difficult!, but once you understand all you can do in the game, the game becomes an addiction. If you have a PS3 this is a must play!
5.0	Fun for the whole family, Kinect is fun to see yourself in photos after the game is played. Adds to the fun and laughter
5.0	If like me you have a wii, PS3 and XBOX this is a must have item. It's not cheap, but it is very well made and looks like it will fit most LCD, LED and plasma TVs.<br /><br />I couldn't be happier, it's a shame they don't sell these in the UK which is why I had to get this shipped from the States.
5.0	Happy with this bundle. Great deal!
5.0	Works like an original
5.0	3 day super fast<br />Fun game fast install great game for value.
5.0	Worth buying! It will give you many hours/days of challenges and a great deal of laughs! I would say the first of the 2 in this series is the best (the second of the two wasn't so good). The graphics are beautifully drawn and rendered and in a cartoonish style.
5.0	I think that this kit works perfectly. I have had No problems with it, and it lasts as long as promised.
5.0	Works just fine, fits snuggly in the gamepad's port.
5.0	great graphics i loved every thing about it i recommend this because it will be the most played game for a while
5.0	It's already been said by other reviewers, but these little snap-on accessories make an already great controller pretty much perfect.  I'm by no means a hardcore gamer.  I noticed these when browsing Amazon one day and made a note to try them when I needed another $5 purchase to get free super-saver shipping.  They are absolutely simple to snap into place, and once they're there, it'll feel like they should have always been there.  Will they make you a world champ in your favorite game?  Probably not if you aren't already.  But they will make the controller more comfortable to use and help you be more precise.  Great care was taken to match the material texture and appearance with the original buttons, so they don't even really stand out as an add-on once attached to your controller.
5.0	Case arrived in good condition and game plays great!
5.0	This cable does exactly what it says it does, making placement of the Kinect device relative to your console or PC much more flexible.  My Kinect applications (PC) operate at the same frame rates as they did without the extension cable.
5.0	This little game is worth many hours of fun! It isn't too hard at first, but later it get's very tricky and I find myself re-doing levels to try to do better.  Very Addictive!
5.0	Best driving game ever.
5.0	Prompt shipping. Excellent gift, just what my SO wanted.
5.0	it works great, must buy, i'm not much of a gamer but it keeps my xbox cool when I watch moves
5.0	"This system is redesigned from the old ps2 and is significantly thinner (about the with of a small paperback book) and weighs 50% less and it's all for the same price as the older models, and still has the 2 usb ports for headsets and keyboards as well as OPTICAL out for Dolby Digital high quality sound. The only changes made were that they did away with the IEEE 1384 (I-link) port so you have to get the new designed multitap for 4+ players, new upright stand, you CAN NOT use the ps2 hdd with this system, top-loading disk tray so there's no more malfunctioning disk drive, intigrated IR reciever for remote access without the small adapter for some of the older ps2 models (also allows you to turn ps2 on/off with SEPERATELY SOLD SONY ps2 remote) and this system has intigrated network abilities (including dial-up internet)so you don't have to buy an adapter. This system also has the best game library and features games like ratchet and clank 3(highly recommend) and jak 3. The game library has 2X more games than that of the xbox and more choice and less \\""kiddie games\\"" than the gamecube. The graphics are great but the x-box does has better graphics. This system is my favorite out of all three and I would recomend getting it."
5.0	I loved Mario Kart when I was a kid and this new installment does not dissapoint! Good job Nintendo.
5.0	Awesome air combat simulator game for PS2... Too bad they don't make 'em like this anymore.  If they made one just as good for PS3, I'd own it as of yesterday, if they made it for PS4 I'd be buying myself a new PS4 just for it.
5.0	Good price fro a great controller.
5.0	These wires fixed whatever the issue was that wouldn't allow our Wii to stream to our newer HDTV. We had the &#34;appropriate&#34; wires, but they weren't working... this one did! Plus we have the tv mounted on the wall and didn't want the components to have to be perched right below the tv which was the only alternative with a normal 5-6 ft wire, so the 10 ft wire allows us to hide the components out of the way from the tv.
5.0	Love it. Great item and easy to install.
5.0	just as expected!!!!!!
5.0	This game is very fun and will keep you entertained for hours.  Its best if you have friends to play with.
5.0	[[VIDEOID:mo3BTFRI8A5G3H]]Hey guys, I uploaded a video to give you some more information/better view of the CTA PS VITA Hand Grip, I hope it helps! I would have made it longer but Amazon has limit on size/time that can be uploaded<br /><br />I specifically bought this to use my PS Vita's remote play feature with the PS4. Without the grip, my hands would always touch the back touchpad on the PS Vita, which during remote play is the R2/L2 buttons on the PS4. So playing games like killzone and need for speed were almost impossible. This definitely fixes that problem.<br /><br />For playing PS Vita games, I used it to play the Uncharted: Golden Abyss and its great! It makes the whole gameplay a lot better and definitely makes it feel more like a PS3/PS4 controller.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />-Light<br />-Fixes Remote Play L2/R2 issue with the PS4<br />-Soft in your hand<br />-Not to expensive<br />-Doesnt cover most of the ports, except charging port<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />-Covers charging port (not an issue unless you are charging and playing at the same time)<br />-Obviously doesnt allow the PS Vita to fit into your pocket or other storage areas easily<br /><br />Overall, I would definitely recommend this to anyone with a PS Vita, even if you dont use the remote play feature with the ps4, this is great to have just to play PS Vita games, its soft and molded perfectly to fit into your hands. I havent hand that issue that it moves around when docked as other reviewers have mentioned, mine seems pretty sturdy and set in when i attach the grip to the PS Vita. I bought it from Amazon for $13 and it shipped right on time with Prime.<br /><br />If you have any questions let me know! I hope this helps :)
5.0	Great experience! Great product!
5.0	This item shipped quickly, even during the holidays. The item was exactly as described I received a brand new DualShock 3 Wireless Controller in the package. The package was in in perfect condition so was the item. This item also was in perfect working condition my nephew has been having a blast with his custom color controller!!
5.0	Our original sensor bar quit working so went looking for one.  Was told by GameStop this was no longer sold anywhere so we bought one of their battery powered sensor bars.  That thing when through batteries like crazy and we spent over $40 in batteries in 6 months!  Found this on Amazon and it's perfect for our older Wii and no more battery expense.  Thank you Amazon!
5.0	I bought it as a Christmas present last year. My husband also has this game and they both still enjoy replaying.
5.0	El juego viene con dos discos en cajas deferentes, una es una caja metalica de coleccion muy buena y la otra una caja normal que incluye el beta de batlefield 4<br />producto nuevo sin uso, entregado en fecha y comprado a buen precio (40$)<br /><br />Vendedor serio cumple con lo que ofrece y como corresponde
5.0	When shopping for a supplemental storage drive for our Xbox, we were concerned that some storage devices might be poor quality or unreliable. This one has performed exceptionally well for 2 years and I can safely rate it 5 stars.
5.0	Quite possibly the greatest fighting game for the Nintendo 3DS to date! i don't know what else I can say. Play if for yourselves, and you'll see what I mean!
5.0	Super fast shipping, thanks! AAA+++
5.0	Boyfriend loves it. I definitely recommend.
5.0	"Halo 4 has adopted many attributes from the call of duty games, for better and for worse, but mostly for better in both its gameplay and matchmaking options. The actual campaign seemed fairly short, but there are new bonus missions called \\""spartan ops\\"" which totaled altogether are significantly longer than the campaign itself, and are equally entertaining.<br />If you had to choose between Halo and Call of duty, choose Halo."
5.0	is very good game looks like the TV series difrutar hope much of this game i like the horror survivor
5.0	I have read a lot of reviews of how the game doesnt run on computers, but that is because they are older computers. i run my game on and AMD athalon 1.2gig, 256 mb ddr ram, and an ATI radeon 64mb video card and it runs great. i know what your thinking, well that computer is really good. my friend runs the game fine on his 333mhz pentium, with 64 mb of memory, and an ATI 32mb all in wonder card. even a slower computer can run the game. as for gamplay, some of the best i have seen. i used to play triple play, i am a high heat fan by far now. the game is the closet thing i have seen to real baseball yet. the tv style presentation could be better, but all in all this game is definitley worth it.
5.0	nothing but positive feedback for this game, buy it, cause it's great. and if you have any problems with it freezing, just make sure you have the latest version installed, as im sure the system, before you start the game,  will tell you to do so.
5.0	I really really like this game! it was the first game I got for my N64 and i still play it. The graphics are wonderful and colorful and the gameplay is great. You can play it for a long time and not get tired of it. There are nine huge worlds and they are all very different from eachother.<br />The game is very simple at first and it´s easy to learn how to play. But then it gets REALLY challening on the last worlds.<br />I recommend this game to anyone! But maybe not young kids cause it´s a little difficult..
5.0	We bought this for our three year old who loves batman. Most other batman things are way to much for his age but batman brave and the bold is great for the younger set. You can even turn on jump assists so that he doesn't need help with that part of the game. My son still needs us for other parts but since he has been playing games on a ps3 since he could hold a controller he really doesn't have much problems with this. It is still probably best for slightly older kids but you know what's best for your kids skill level.  I don't think kids past 7 -8 would get much playtime but my husband had fun beating it so who knows.  It came fast and was a great price so we are really thrilled.
5.0	I'd have to say this is my second favorite game of all time, it's right up there with Perfect Dark.  A great game, certainly not for the younger crowd. (I'd say for 10 and up)  Not for content, of course, but I think a youngster would have a rather hard time grasping it.  Other than that, it's a helluva lot of fun to play, and very enthralling.
5.0	This is my favorite car game ever. Fun soundtrack, great graphics, easy controls. Cars feel fast.  It does get a little redundant , but all games do.
5.0	I enjoyed playing the others and this one is just as good. Still playing so can't speak to the finish, but am enjoying it very much.
5.0	Have been using this for about 6 months now with absolutely no problems actually keeps the dust blew out and system has not overheated since I installed it would for sure buy again AAAA++++
5.0	Hands down one of the greatest PC games ever made.  I spent many an hour as a child playing the Roller Coaster Tycoon series at my friend Zach's house every summer.  We'd spend weeks building up our favorite parks and being kids not fully understanding the mechanics of the entire game, would struggle to beat each park.  At the age of 24, I still play this game and very much enjoy it.  I understand everything about the game and can build a park to all its strengths with ease.  Chris Sawyer is a genius, and this series is legendary.  While I did enjoy its sequels, the original Roller Coaster Tycoon will always be my favorite.
5.0	is a good product and was received at the time indicated, the process was easy for purchase..  thanks for your good service
5.0	I bought this game 2 years ago only because my kid wanted me to. I had read so many bad reviews on here I was sure I would hate the game also but I am just starting Act 3 now and boy was I wrong! Here are some thoughts:<br /><br />Story-- I will admit that the story is not quit as...gripping as Origins because the fate of the world is not riding on this story. In fact, for a while in Act 2 I was wondering what's the point anymore since all my characters family were gone now because of one reason or another. But then more quests showed up and that keeps me going. Now it appears it's up to my character to save Kirkwall from tyranny, which I suppose is noble enough.<br /><br />Combat-- Very fun...and, IMO the button mashing aspect has come in handy when I needed a drinkor a snack. I can just hold the controller and push A over and over with one hand and use my other hand for whatever else!! LOL<br /><br />Equipment-- This I do find frustrating. I find so many interesting things that I would love to share with my group but the game won't let me. Instead I have to hunt around in all the shops, or random quests, to find the armor upgrades for my companions. The only way to customize your companions is their jewelry and weapons (except Varric) and their character stats. BUT, I can say that because of this I have been able to save up a ton of money to buy the pricey things I really want.<br /><br />Exploring-- Yes, I have to agree that the caves and underground areas do get old pretty quick since they only have maybe 4 different layouts?<br /><br />Dialog- I LOVE the new dialog wheel with the symbols in the middle. It's particularly helpful when trying to romance someone to see that glowing heart pop up so you have a clearer idea of how to progress the romance. I do still feel that the dialog option shown should match what is actually said, but they still aren't doing that.<br /><br />Romance-- This is still my first playthrough so I haven't completed it yet but I have to say that when I first met Anders I thought he was just the DA2 version of Alistair. But, as I've seen through experience now, Anders is waaaay more intelligent, mature, charming, and responsible. Alistair was SUCH a whiny baby I almost puked during his romance in DA:O because I had to pander to his whiny insecurities shamelessly! UGH! But I digress....then I met Fenris and decided he was the romance for me. That sexy bass voice was just made for the bedroom! He's being difficult due to his tortured past but I will persevere! LOL<br /><br />Glitches-- Yes, as of yesterday 6/30/2015, there are still glitches in the game. The prompt that comes up when exiting an area that asks you if you want to &#34;venture forth with your party&#34; occasionally will pop up again during the loading screen. Then when I get to the new area it is still there so I have to push A again in order for it to disappear. It hasn't affected gameplay so far but I suppose it's possible. Also, when I first started the game a week ago when I first met Aveline and her hubby, it glitched in a way that made me have to redo the whole conversation a second time. Very odd.<br /><br />Minor frustrations aside, I am thoroughly enjoying this game and am glad I gave it a try. It's definitely not as involved as DA:O so it's not taking as long. I may even play it a second time.ay that when I first met Anders I thought he was just the DA2 version of Alistair.

5.0	I've been wacthing this game since 2000 when rumors started.As a Die Hard fan of the Resident Evil Series owning all the Videogames including Survivor and Gaiden...this is a must have game for me.We get see Rebecca and the Bravo as their 'Copter crashes for no apparent reason.No items boxes will make it hard but the partner zapping system is something I've wanted since Resident Evil 1 in 1996.Their will also be new enemis to fight like Frogs,Scorpion and new Tyrant.Plus Wesker and Birkin are back to reveal more Umb. Secrets!I've pre-ordered my game and Guide i suggest you do the same.
5.0	Just ordered this amazing deal! After weeks of research and deciding which console was best for me, I ordered this one! I love how it comes with 2 GREAT games! The only thing thats not much of a problem is the tax. It was about 30$ of tax. Anyways I can't wait for it to arrive!
5.0	I cant begin to tell you how great this game is, just buy it you wont be dissapointed... not only is it good to start seeing the F word used in games it proves that games a growing up with the people who play them...
5.0	First off, great intro music. Not as much playing the game as I would like but still a great concept, I prefer to be more sneaky even on a shoot em up. Good characters, but not as good as Foxhound characters. The setting (on the plant) is very good but the game becomes too unreal towards the end. This game is like a movie in places, which i like but some of the codec sequences where to long and off the point. Overall this game seems to be good when arsenal gear isn't involved. <br /> <br />I know i've slated the game here a bit but these are the only bad points the rest is 100% quality. BUY IT!
5.0	"Is like a top \\""tier\\"" gaming mouse, amazing quality, and does everything that a gaming mouse should do..."
5.0	As a fan of the halo games I must say that for me the best of all the games has always been the first one. This is because it is the most difficult one because your fighting elites for this and the scenery it buts it on the top.
5.0	I got this game for my brother because he loves Lord of the Rings and is a fan of the Lego XBox games.  He says it's a lot of fun!
5.0	Nothing on it stated it was made by Microsoft, but it looks so alike. This one works fine, I mainly bought it for the digital audio output and actually get Dolby digital sound. People never knew that, you paid for a game that you were able to get through the original Xbox with 480i video and digital audio, but never got. I had replaced this one with the HD version. Using s-video was great, until I started using the component. Digital sound is completely different than analog.
5.0	My child plays it all the time
5.0	As a sometime Ceasar III addict, I can tell you this is not just another city-builder game. You start out as a lowly merchant with limited funds & one or two ships in a hometown of your choosing. You then have to decide what goods to buy, load onto your ship(s), & where to take them to sell. But you have to be careful because the more you buy, the more the price goes up. Conversly, the more you sell, the lower the price drops. After you get some money & clout, you can start building factories, housing for the residents, more ships (four different types) & trading offices in other cities. Some goods require raw materials which you usually have to import from other cities. Others are basic foods which you must provide to the people, or they get angry and leave town, leaving your factories idle. After you move up the ranks of society to Patrician level, you can be elected Lord Mayor & become eligible for missions (founding a city, hunting pirates) which will put you on the track to becoming the next Alderman- leader of the Hanseatic League. Eventually, you will become as rich as Bill Gates, with feets of ships carrying goods all over 1300s Europe. That is, if pirates, plagues & Princes don't bankrupt you.
5.0	It needs better packaging, it looks and feels like a bootleg copy.  I have yet to be able to play the game.
5.0	I absolutely loved this game and absolutely recommend it for everyone!<br /><br />I have played the poodoo out of A Link to the Past on SNES, and this is definitely a spiritual successor. It is largely the same layout in terms of controls, the world map, building placement, etc... but just enough things have been changed or moved around to feel like a whole new game.<br /><br />For example, if you are looking to find a jar that is hidden under a specific bridge that you need flippers to get to... it's still there.<br /><br />However, if you go to Lake Hylia in Dark World aka Lorule expecting to find the Ice Dungeon, you will be surprised to find that it has swapped placed with Turtle Rock.<br /><br />So, for the most part, if you have a photographic map in your head of the SNES game, you will have no problems navigating in this game!<br /><br />Being able to rent every item/tool in the game makes it super accessible. It gives newcomers more freedom than they should have though. Makes the game less linear, and since the world is so large, newbies can get lost easily.<br /><br />The exceptions to this are the Titan's Glove and Mitt, the Blue and Red Armor, and a couple other things.<br /><br />Hyrule (Light World) is still 3 dungeons and mostly linear, except now you don't go to the Desert Palace as one of the dungeons... now it's the Wind Dungeon in Lake Hylia.<br /><br />Lorule (Dark World) is what... 7 or 8 dungeons still. They're pretty much the same except for the Desert Palace, Ice Temple, and Turtle Rock.<br /><br />The ability to turn into a wall drawing and move around definitely adds a new dimension of exploration to the game. I think it definitely helped make the world seem new by having to use that power so much later on to fully explore each area.<br /><br />Also, you get 3 save slots if you're looking to share the cart among friends and/or family.<br /><br />There is a HARD mode upon completion of the game. Not really New Game+ since you don't get to keep your gear, but still nice. It definitely hurts more when you get hit.<br /><br />Streetpass allows other players to upload their Link with certain selections of their gear and all of their hearts to allow for Shadow Link duels. You will find the other players' Shadow Link avatars somewhere in the world (you can ask an NPC for a location) and go fight them. Depending on their gear and hearts, a money reward is set and distributed upon defeat of the Shadow Link. Kind of neat, but definitely not life-changing.<br /><br />My wife is a newcomer to the series and hasn't been able to put down the game either. She is definitely not a gamer, but has managed to steadily work her way through the game with minimal assistance from me. I told her where to get that jar under the bridge and that Death Mountain is a maze of buggery and it was OK to get lost there. She was a bit overwhelmed with what to do when she got to Lorule, but I told her just pick one and try it just to get the ball rolling. It's still a work in progress with her, but I am confident it will be one of the few video games she has completed.p your gear, but still nice.

5.0	Once you get used to the differences between the original NES controller and this one, it's totally awesome!
5.0	This guitar controller is the most responsive controller to date.  Not only does it feel just right when you press the frets or strum on the guitar but it has several nice new features.  Ever feel like raising your guitar to activate star power or overdrive is affecting your ability to hit some of the notes?  Well now you have a large button next to your strummer that you can roll your hand back over to activate it.  Awesome feature.  And while I don't always use it, the slider neck that's included on the guitar makes for some fun solos.  You won't be displeased with this guitar  controller!
5.0	The glasses are awesome, makes such a difference in even my gameplay let alone my eyes. Def worth the money compared to the other highly overpriced competition..
5.0	I think this is going to be THE hot christmas toy for 2007 so buy yours now before your stuck getting one off ebay and paying more than you should.     One thing to note. The bundle comes with a mic, guitar, and drums. HOWEVER the game can allow for 4 players at the same time (mic, guitar, drums, and bass), if you want the full experience of the entire band YOU MUST BUY AN ADDITIONAL GUITAR! It is NOT included in the bundle. A lot of people don't realize this. Any guitar from the Guitar Hero games will work. If you don't buy one, you are going to wish you did.     Of course you have the option of playing from 1 to 4 players at once so its not essential to have the extra guitar (it won't stop you from playing the game) but if you want to rock with friends and fill out the entire band, you'll want it.     Awesome game, lots of fun. You can start out on easy mode and work your way up. They are going to have new song packs to download and lots of other fun additions so it will stay fresh and exciting for a while. I'd say the only bad part of this game is the fact that I can't stop playing it! Very addictive.
5.0	"I can't review this as an \\""expert gamer\\""--the last time I owned a game system before my recent Wii purchase was the *original* Game Boy! Part of the reason is that games are just too crazy with all of the buttons and extreme graphics. If it's not intuitive I can't really do well with it. Well, this game is old school in its functionality, but it's brand new in its \\""coolness!\\""<br /><br />Playing this in multi-player mode is just the best. It is easily the most fun (and funny) game I have ever played! When Mario starts hopping on Luigi and you hear  \\""Oh, Owww, ooh\\"" it's a blast. When one of the characters is on the Yoshi powerup (my favorite by far) and they swallow one of their pals and spit them out again, well, it's hard to describe how fun that is. If you get a 4-player game going, it can quickly turn to mayhem as the characters start flying all over the place!<br /><br />If you have ever liked the traditional Mario games, this is pure fun. You will sit down to play for a few minutes, and it will quickly turn into a few hours. I highly recommend this!"
5.0	I use this with Steam Big Picture to play games on my TV.  Who needs an Xbox when you have a far more capable PC with Xbox controllers?
5.0	for my son, and he loves it
5.0	Very fun game the kids love it.  We are able to play as a family without fights even the two year old can join in.  He doesn't win but he things he is playing and that helps.
5.0	nice colour ,good design ,you can feel every steps,explosion ,gunshots, and the best of all is the original from &#34;SONY&#34;.
5.0	My son loves it and the fact that i got it so early even earlier than his birthday is a very nice thing. Thank you so much and i give u 5 starts.
5.0	this is a great game. Have had much fun and use out of it. needs more expansion to keep me interested
5.0	I have only had this product for a day but I love how it lights up so you can easily see if controllers are placed inside it properly and if they are charging or fully charged. It is a great simple device. It plugs into the wall btw so you dont have to have it right next to your PS3 which is good. It would be nice if it had 1 usb charging port on it so I could charge a dual shock at the same time though.
5.0	Sid Meier games are some of my favorites and this xpac adds even more fun
5.0	Amazing unsung rpg game for the SNES! A must for any SNES collector. Look up youtube vids and see for yourself.
5.0	I am from India and IAF inducted a bunch of SU-30 MKIs in it's airforce. I wanted to get a feel for this fighter and bought the flanker 2.5 . I also own Microsoft CFS2 , CFS3 ( dont waste your money on this ) , IL2( money well spent ) , Ka-52 just to name a few. <br />  Flanker 2.5 is not a game. It is a simulator. So there are no points flashing after you complete a mission successfully. I have been playing it for an year now and even now it keeps me intrested. There is a lot to learn. You need to learn about the plane , your enemy plane , Different missiles and their envelopes , radar range , when to track , when not to track, how to refuel, when to fire a missile and a whole lot more.<br /> So , if you want a game that you can master in a couple of weeks , this is not the one. If you are looking fo some simulator that will teach you about different weapons systems, tactics and more importantly how hard it is to be a real fighter pilot , this is a keeper.<br /> The graphics are excellent and very light on resources  considering the vintage of the game.It is comparable to Microsoft CFS3 in the graphics quality but with 1/3 the resource usage.<br /> Buy it if you are a serious aero or sim enthusiast...you will LOVE IT.
5.0	love it and still have it. thanks for selling this great game., for a cheap prize  and tax to be sent
5.0	Great product! Great seller!
5.0	Bought this after my genuine Microsoft batteries suddenly died after less than a year of use. They charge very quickly and last all day .  I also like the integrated USB port for charging other accessories
5.0	it works perfectly with the wii u.  tHE CUSTOMER SERVICE KNEW WHAT HE WAS TALKING ABOUT WHEN I CALLED AND EXPLAINED WHAT WAS WRONG.  HE KNEW WHAT WAS WRONG AND HELPED ME FIXED IT, NOW WE PLAY GAMES EVERY DAY.
5.0	If you like B-Movies from the 50s/60s looks like Destroy All Humans might just be the game for you. The game sets you down smack in the middle of what feels just like a 50s sci-fi film. The story is a simple one you are a part of a superior alien race who needs to retrieve DNA placed in the brains of humans to survive. So your mission is simple - Destroy All Humans! <br /> <br />Both the story and game play options are described to you during your game play. So you don't really need to read the instructions and can just dive right in. [However you may wish to familiarize yourself with the controls a wee bit before starting --- we found ourselves hitting all the wrong buttons at all the wrong times.] <br /> <br />Fun game for almost all ages [violence you know --- kinda figured that one out with a name like Destroy All Humans]. <br /> <br />Biggest downfall of the game is that when you die you start your mission from the beginning. And that can be very frustrating when nearly complete and you get your final zap. Game play is not saved until you complete the mission and head back to the Mothership for further instructions.
5.0	Loved these games they are both extremely fun. I'd play undead nightmare first it makes the original game even more fun.
5.0	"\\""Rally Trophy\\"" is a retro take on the rallying sport. \\""Rally Trophy\\"" takes you back to the 1960's when the Mini-Cooper and Lancia Stratos ruled the sport, cars that are featured in this game.<br />The heart of the game is the single-person point-to-point rallying. If you are not a hard-core rally fan, you may find this lack of on-screen challengers boring, but this is what true rallying is about. If you prefer the bumper-bashing NASCAR style racing, there is also a mode that lets you compete against other cars in a closed circuit race course, but this is only an added feature, not the heart of the game.<br />The developers of this game seem to have learned from mistakes made in the past by other developers. Some other past racing simulations pushed the realism so far that most people became too frustrated and quit. \\""Rally Trophy\\"", although simulation oriented, does not scare you with ultimate realism. The controls are forgiving enough that in approximately 30 minutes, you will be driving reasonably. And as you unlock more cars, you will find that 30 minutes is enough to become accustomed to the new more powerful cars. This is not to say that you will be able to win - this will require much more time. But after 30 minutes with each new unlocked car, you will not find yourself spinning out constantly.<br />The graphics are beautiful and the engine sounds are particularly believable. Only if you go seriously off course will you notice some of the tricks used to paint the scenery. You will need a very fast system to turn up all the eye candy. Very few people on message boards have been able to turn all the graphics options to the maximum settings. That said, even minimal settings yield very beautiful graphics.<br />Nits and picks. There are only four countries that you will race through: Russia, Kenya, Finland, Sweden, and Switzerland. You will unlock more courses as you finish championships, but the courses all fall into these four countries. Also, the menu interface, while functional and easy to use, lacks a certain polish that is expected in a top studio effort.<br />Although the description here does not say so, this game works perfectly (perhaps better) on Windows 2000 and Windows XP. Be prepared to spend some time tweaking this game to make it work. \\""Rally Trophy\\"" has developed a reputation on the web for being very picky about the machine that it is installed on and possibly requiring a very large effort to get working at all. Be sure to visit the technical support forum and update all of your drivers. But trust me - it will be worth it.while functional and easy to use, lacks a certain polish that is expected in a top studio effort.<br />Although the description here does not say so, this game works perfectly (perhaps better) on Windows 2000 and Windows XP.

5.0	Only thing price caps suck
5.0	Bought for my 11 yr old granddaughter, she loves it, the thought of playing with people around the world is very cool.
5.0	This charger is great!  It allows you to charge two controller and your wireless headeset at the same time.  The two tone colors let you know when the controller is charging and fully charged.  Highly recommend this product.
5.0	My son loves the entire Spyro game.  I played with him a few times and as long as he is enjoying it, I do to.  Well worth it!!
5.0	This was much better quality that I thought it would be.  It looks nice, works well, and is the main reason I use the Xbox for HBOGo now.
5.0	I first played this game when it was an included demo along with Resident Evil: Code Veronica X for the Playstation 2 way back when. Ever since then, I've been addicted to this game. Instead of the slow pace one would have originally expected from the game (seeing as it was originally intended to be a Resident Evil title) the game is fast, furious, and full of incredibly enjoyable action gameplay. From the first moment of getting a key off a marionette to flying an airplane out of a collapsing mountain, the game never ceases to be one of the most enjoyable gameplay experiences not only on the PS2, but of any game ever released. It is a true classic and is something that should be played by everyone. And for those who enjoy difficulty in their games, once you beat normal, there is hard, and the incredibly hard (I seriously broke my controller playing this mode) DMD (Dante Must Die). Considering this is now availible for quite cheap here on Amazon.com along with everywhere else, there is almost no excuse not to pick up this game if you for some reason haven't yet.
5.0	I have Borderland 2 and loved playing it still. So I got this one to see if it is as fun as the First.
5.0	awesome product. no problems at all.
5.0	I like this mostly for the ski ball. I love to go out and play ski ball but it is rare to find anymore, playing this game is like the real deal. I love it.
5.0	I have become obsessed with this game.  I loved Bioshock and Bioshock 2 is just as good if not better.<br />The Special Edition has an art book that shows all the work put into all the environments and characters including the genetic splicers who have messed their DNA up.  It includes a record album of the first soundtrack for Bioshock and has a Bioshock 2 CD with the score for it included.  This edition has lithograph copies of some of the posters from Rapture in it.  They are very nice.  The game of course is in the box too.  Everything comes in a stunning collectors edition box.<br />Bioshock 2 tells a new story that that started right before the Rapture Civil War but mainly happens 10 years after Jack the main character of Bioshock does his damage kills Andrew Ryan and Fontaine and the war is over.  Little girls from all over the Atlantic coast are going missing.  Little Sisters and Big Sisters now roam Rapture.  The Big Daddies are being produced again.  Adam flows and now one Sophia Lamb rules Rapture.  Play and find out how Delta the Big Daddy will change Rapture and get back what was stolen from him.  Eleanor Lamb needs her Daddy.  Only Big Daddy can protect her right.
5.0	Fantastic game with the right amount of difficulty and progression.<br />This in a must in any game collection. Highly recommended.
5.0	I love this game.  I hate RPG, and I really don't care for that aspect of this game.  But the battle system is just so awesome, I can ignore the RPG aspect.  Storyline, who cares?  Gimme the action, and there is plenty.  Not  quite the 150 hours (minus the cheesy dialogs) and it is probaly more like  60 hours of actual combat.  I don't know if I slept under a log too long,  but this game has a fresh concept that appeals to me.  I wish there were  more like it so I could buy those too.  There is something so blatently fun  about this simple looking strategy game- which is far more in-depth than  first appearances.  I have been unable to remove it from my PSX for weeks!
5.0	My 5 yro son loved getting the game and characters. We have fun playing together as a family. The game is very fun to play.
5.0	ILL PUT IT LIKE THIS. THIS GAME IS AMAZING. ITS LIKE GOD OF WAR MEETS RESIDENT EVIL. IT INSTANTLY BECAME MY FAVORITE GAME_ ALSO EVERYONE SHOULD BE HONEST WITH THEMSELVES (yes im using capitol letters only bcuz of my enthusiasm). IF YOU WERE RAISED HARDCORE, STRICT RULES, STRICT PUNISHMENT, OLD SCHOOL STYLE....CHANCES ARE YOU(we) LOVE THIS GAME. IF YOU WERE RAISED LIKE A BRAT ALWAYS GETTING WHAT YOU(only you) WANT HAVING EVERYTHING YOUR WAY YOU WILL GET RID OF THIS GAME AS SOON AS YOU REALIZED YOUR BEING KICKED OUT THE HOUSE AND YOU HAVE TO START RAISING YOURSELF(yes you!!). GOOD LUCK. ENJOY. I LOVE DARK SOULS UNCONDITIONALLY AND WILL FOREVER RESPECT THE MESSAGE IT TRANSLATES(find out for yourself. earn your shortcuts.) THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME READERS :!)
5.0	Completely enthralling and brings right into the game.  Such a detailed world!!  Hours and hours of completely new game play.
5.0	Got mine on Sunday as advised. So far working great. Did software upgrade to 1.5 and upgraded by PS3 COD Ghost.
5.0	Definitely among the best games for the N64. The physics engine is amazing, but the game has much more. It's a lot like Banjo or Mario, but everything has a subtle twist that makes it really feel like a different  experience.<br />All the different ways the tractor beam is used are very  cool. You can pick things up, throw them, stack them up, smash them open,  and even swing from handles. There's a lot of stuff to do here.<br />I really  loved Mario, and I liked Banjo alot. I think this may rank just below  Mario. If you like adventure/platform games you *must* buy this game.
5.0	ESTE ES UN REGALO DE NAVIDAD ES UN JUEGO MUY DIFICIL PERO NO SOLO HAY QUE PELEAR CON LOS JEDI TANBIEN TIENES QUE USAR LA FUERSA Y USAR LA MENTE EN TODOS LOS NIVELES Y TODOS LOS QUE VAYAN A COMPRAR ESTE JUEGO HAY QUE PENSARLO BIEN...ME LO REGALO SANTA,YO TENGO 7 AÑOS Y ME GUSTA MUCHO LAS GUERRAS DE LAS GALAXIAS.
5.0	I can simply Compare this game to WWF No Mercy and WWF Wrestlemania XIX(19).  The wrestlers are very detailed and the WWE Universe mode gives you a lot of control over the gameplay.  The online play can lag at times but that has alot to do with the players conection.  Overall i would recomend this game.
5.0	My family play's Cabelas dangerous hunts and it fits and works perfectly.  Would recommend it good feeling in your hand and easy to use.
5.0	Three great games on one disk. What's not to love? If you're a Grand Theft Auto fan then you simply must have these games. Why not save a little shelf space and have them all in one spot?
5.0	I purchased the Ps3 controller for my son. he always wanted his a color for the game. Nice price and gift.
5.0	Bought this for my hubby who was getting very frustrated trying to use the controller to play his racing games. It works extremely well for him with the exception of the pedals that like to move about. He got creative and made a device to hold them securely in place and is back to enjoying his racing again!
5.0	One of the last Swap Force that my son was looking for!
5.0	Super saver shipping sucked rocks on this pre-order, the game sat in town for a few extra days waiting to hitch a ride for the final mile to get to my house.  The graphics for this game I would rate as good; most of the story line was very good.  One or two areas / play styles seemed a bit dead / recycled.  The game play and the story line from another book semi-sort of based on the planet did not match.
5.0	Todo muy gracias, el regalo de mis ahijados... esta perfecto para ellos y toda la familia.. .. . . . .
5.0	My wife hates having the cable rigged up through the Xbox, because the controller set up.  This solved my problem.  This works great for all non-gaming Xbox controller needs.  Its super high quality and feels great.  Definitely recommended.
5.0	The game is the best, the pad is the best. Tried first with another dancing pad, but no chance, only this one works! I already bought two, one for myself and one as a present, and all was perfect: product, delivery.
5.0	My husband and I were looking for a case to fit my stepson's Nintendo 3DS XL console that we got him for Christmas and I had seen a review that this case fits the XL.  If you are looking for a case that fits the XL console look no further this is the perfect case.  Awesome quality and fits his console, charger, stylis pens and 40 games.  So happy that we bought this case and it even has a shoulder strap.  Would totally buy this case again!!!
5.0	I found the game to be alot of fun if you can drive pretty good.
5.0	"it make me save my favorite word \\""TITS\\"" cause thats how cool this game is to me i havent payed it sense back in the day....which was a wednesday by the way! so you should get the game!"
5.0	Unlike WWE Backyard Wrestlers Dont Let All Of the Fame And Money Get to their Heads,They Still Have Heart For The Sport And Simply Live To Entertain Fans And Will Do ANYTHING To Do Just That. I Look At This Game As A Tribute To All Of The Backyard Wrestlers. Once Again This Game Makes The WWE Look Like Ballroom Dancing. Thank You BYW
5.0	this is one of the best of the game deals i have ever bought.hope to find good games more often.
5.0	Really fun online multiplayer game! I have grown tired of multiplayer games lately as they don't seem to be very fair to the casual player but this game is really fun whether your are the racer or the cop!
5.0	"It's a shame when you can do drive-by's, robberies, and stomp innocent people into the ground, but parents let their under-age kids play this, then complain when they have innocent sex in it. Sex is constructive, violence is destructive. I'm so pissed off that as a grown man I can't play games the way they were supposed to be intended for me. <br /> <br />I've always wondered why they held back in \\""M\\"" rated games. It's because they WANT kids to buy them. That's the truly sad part."
5.0	I'm not sure if the game itself works as of now since it's a present for my little cousin, but I looked over the disk and saw no scratches or smudges. The case was a tad broken, but that could've been the delivery service. So overall I'm glad I got it so quick, and I'm happy about it!
5.0	This is a wonderful game. I am making a review quite a bit late. Almost 10 years late. But this game wouldn't bore me in 20.<br />I won't go into the story much, as that is something potential players would want to experience themselves.<br /><br />Gameplay: Amazing. You basically get to program what your characters do, when they do them, and how they do them. It really is interesting, and I wish it had been brought to more games. People complained &#34;The game plays itself&#34; That is bullcrap. There is an easy to find button that turns the programming (called gambits) off. Then the only difference is that you walk around instead of standing in a line.<br /><br />Characters: These characters have their flaws. Some I wish were developed more, others I wish they would just leave alone. They didn't get the characters quite right, but they are still interesting enough to keep playing and enjoy them.<br /><br />Weapons, magic, etc.: Holy crap. There are sooooo many weapons, so much armor, so much magic. The weapons in this game generally look awesome and work awesome. There are a few exceptions, and I wish some of the weapon classes had more options, but really it is fantastic.  Armor is armor, but you can't see it on your character, which is a shame. Magic looks great, and the weaknesses do significantly more damage than normal, which is good.<br /><br />Graphics: I personally really don't care about graphics too much, but I must say that these graphics are quite stunning. They are almost on par with ps3, which is quite the feat considering their limitations with the ps2.<br /><br />Post game content: This game is huge. I would probably compare it to the likes of Borderlands to with a couple story DLCs on it. Possibly more. There are monsters to hunt, loot to get, side quests to complete. But there are a lot of them, and they don't get too repetitive usually. Except for a few, but not so many that you quit playing.<br /><br />I put 500 hours into at least one save file. But I also repeated that amount of hours over around 4 different memory cards. Once you complete the game, there really isn't much to do...but start another one! I am serious. You could miss a lot in the first few playthroughs of this game. I doubt anybody is actually thinking of buying this game anymore, as this is now 2 console generations old. But I posted this for a few reasons: For those of you who still have a ps2, (like me) and are still interested in some games for it. Also, if anybody from Square Enix is reading this, please please PLEASE do an HD remaster! I would definitely pay like $40 if you released this (preferably the International version) on PS3 or PS4 or even PSN. Just Do It, to quote Nike.le.

5.0	I had this game several years ago, and wore the disc out, so I ordered a new copy of the game. Exactly the same game play I remember, still highly recommended even though it’s a few years old in terms of graphics and such.
5.0	...you own a Voodoo card. The Voodoo compatability is terrible right now. If you own a Voodoo card, wait a month or two and then see if they have improved the performance. If you already own an nVidia based card, you should definately get this game. It has a lot of depth and unlimited replayability.
5.0	Portal 2 is just simply a one of a kind game that gracefully uses the laws of physics to create a home run for Valve(the company who made the Half-Life games). The story is so gripping and keeps you on the edge of your seat for hours.
5.0	Awesome thing too bad its kind of impossible to get.
5.0	This Mario game has brought back many memories of the old Nintendo game.  Our grandchildren have had countless hours of fun and laughter.
5.0	I don't purchased for the ps3 game (but the steelbook is great plus) but when I saw this European version of the statue, I was very shocked, the details, the paint, the battle's pose. this collectors edition should be on all racks dc comics fans, it's really extraordinary!!
5.0	I bought this game because of other positive reviews and I am so glad I did.  It's an excellent game if you like to be challenged.  Time flies and it's refreshing not to be shooting at someone.  I highly recommend this  game to anyone who likes to put their brain to the test.
5.0	Son uses all the time.
5.0	The product shipped on time and came with a game (Lego Star Wars) I ordered for my son.  So far so good; he loves the new xbox.  We were playing on the old xbox system until it finally died about three weeks ago (10yrs of solid gaming).  Both my son and I are happy with the new 360 so far.
5.0	THIS IS AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!! yes you need a internet connection, but thats a small price to pay compred to what you get. Half life 2 is one if not the most amazing game ever, and this come with the expansion! If you havent played the first half life, this comes with it, and its redone with the source engine which makes it much more realistic way better. Also this comes with COUNTER STRIKE SOURCE! CSS is and AMAZING online multiplayer game. You can paly these games months on end and never get bored. i give this collection 2 thumbs WAY UP!!!
5.0	my eight year old grand daughter loved this bought for her birthday. She is over the moon so, yes I love it.
5.0	As other reviewers have noted these are ever so slightly larger than the stock analog joysticks.  It has not made any noticable difference in gameplay for me.  The size difference also did not effect the installation, which was made fairly easy by a video on youtube.  Much cheaper than buying a new controller, and it comes with 4 thumbsticks per pack.
5.0	I knew this game was gonna be great whe I bought it, and it was.  I played through it co-op with a friend; unlike Saints 2 it almost never crashed.  Hilarious and most of the mini-games are fun too.
5.0	"...if you haven't played this game for GCN you have to get this game.  First of all the graphics are like the characters are about to jump out of the screen!  The sound is good and the voices of the characters are so incredible.  There are all new characters like Metal Sonic and Amy.  I could go on about the characters, but I don't want to tell you people to much.  There is extended multiplayer with all new multiplayer levels.  On single player you can play on the \\""Hero\\"" or \\""Dark\\"" side of the team.  You have to finish both \\""hero\\"" and \\""Dark\\"" to beat the game.  But after you beat the game you have to play one last level and it is FRIEKEN HARD.  And about the bosses.  There alot harder than on the regular Sonic Adventure 2.  This game will take you about 12 hours if you play through the whole thin and don't stop.  Overall here is the lowdown. <br />Graphics 10<br />Sound 10<br />Gameplay 10<br />Picture 10<br />This my opinion and I think that you will think the same thing...This is a must buy game!!!"
5.0	Great quality! My daughter is going to love the color and I love that everything will be all in one place.
5.0	GREAT protection for my DS. I recommend this for any DS user!!!
5.0	In one word, excellent. Easily worth at least double the price. One of the best games ever; far outdoing its predecessors (Civilization, Civilization II), and even (loosely) continuing the storyline of CIV2. -- <BR>Definitely recommended.
5.0	BEST GAME FOR PS3 !!!
5.0	My grandsons couldn't stop playing it - my son had to turn off TV to get them to bed. And we love LeBron!
5.0	This game's story is a little weak but the graphics are amazing. The graphics alone make this the ultimate Assasin's Creed game. The only criticism i would have is the stupid Uplay account that ubisoft almost forces on you. Why they can't just link this to your PSN account?
5.0	I was looking for a new game to play when i came across this title. i was a bit hesitant because i am not really a fan of this type of game genre but i gave it a chance and pre ordered it anyways.<br /><br />Got the Amitabha Edition because of the extra stuffs that came with it.<br />The lithograph interests me most. i had it framed and displayed in my room. (i was really expecting it was framed though. but oh well, it's still a cool piece). The Face cover has some miss cut on the edges but still cool all in all. The skin is nice too but i hope there is a wallpaper to go with it (or it was just me) and the of course the pouch is really soft but i am not using it.<br /><br />About the game:<br />Okay the game controls are easy to master. X is for jump, square for slash, etcs. The visuals are crisps and beautiful. Even enemies are nice to look at. I find some dialogues and scenarios really amusing. The BGM is also good to the ear. Despite the repetitiveness (I mean, you travel the same map, see the same backgrounds most of the time, fight the same monsters/enemies) i don't find them boring or annoying. I actually felt more nostalgic than that. I kind of miss these kind of games. For those who love to experience something old school 2d/ linear gaming (or whatever its called) will really find this enjoyable. It's a nice change from the usual games of this age which I sometimes don't find too enjoyable. (okay, this is a personal opinion so others might find it boring to run back and forth the same area and hearing the same music.)<br /><br />another thing, I hope there is a game+ if i complete the game where i can start over with bonus stats or things to carry over when i start over. Still all in all, i am really loving this game and can't wait to carry on when the new scenario DLC comes out.
5.0	If you have the computer capabilities to play Halo 2 for PC, I'd highly recommend giving it a spin. Give it a while and get used to it and you'll find out that it is a spectacular addition to your collection of computer games!
5.0	I would like to say that this is the best game by far and it's in great working condition.  Thanks.
5.0	We bought this for our grandkids.  They love the Smurfs and have vast amounts of energy to burn.  Provides them with a learning experience and plenty of exercise.  Beats sitting on the couch pushing buttons and toggle switches.
5.0	Great Christmas gift - there are so many things that you can do on the Xbox that you can't do on the Wii.  I love it!
5.0	All I can say is WOW.  I am 32 years old and ever since the NES I have loved video games.  In particular rpg's and strategy games.  I agree with another reviewer on amazon that the recent rpg's have lost the charm and fun many had in older console generations.           I bought both a Xbox360 and a Ps3 and to date, I have played more rpg's on the Xbox than the ps3.  After loving the ps1 and ps2 library of solid rpg's, I have been shocked that Sony has abandoned one of its largest core gamers in this generation.       I first heard about this game only recently and was happy a rpg/srpg was coming to the ps3.  However,  there was little fanfare from Sony or the video game magazines so I wasn't expecting much.      All I can simply say is that this is one of the most enjoyable games I have ever played.  The story is amazing, the graphics charming, music solid, and gameplay addictive as any game in recent memory.   You will enjoy many hours playing this gem of a game.       What really frustrates me is the lack of promotion Sony has given this game.  With Sony starving right now for these types of exclusive games,  why not promote the heck out of this.  Seriously folks,  this game is a system seller.  Remember Sony, many gamers bought a ps3 expecting good rpg's, not for a million 1st person shooters.        Oh, and thank you Sega for giving us this AMAZING game.
5.0	"I'll refrain from reviewing the PSP, as that's probably easily accessible somewhere else.    This bundle is a great deal. 1 UMD, 1 game, the PSP, and a 1 gig memory stick. The UMD is a collection of the \\""best\\"" (I personally don't agree, but that's besides the point) Family Guy episodes. The game, Daxter, is not as great as the other games in the series, but is fun enough to occupy me for some time. The kicker, for me, was the memory stick. Yes, memory is getting cheaper. However, this bundle is a little cheaper than if you even bought a PSP and the 1 gig memory stick separately. That, plus the two discs, and I say this is a superb deal."
5.0	Our son wanted as soon as he saw this in previews at the movie theater at Thanksgiving. DH thought would be dumb, so I read reviews & saw good things on here! Santa brought this to our son & he had it open as soon as all gifts were put away & playing!  I am trying to figure out if we can buy just another portal so that he can play with others when they are over, but haven't found just a portal yet.  Anyways, great game for our 6 year old son!  He's loving it!
5.0	These cables are a great buy if you ever need to replace the ones from your PS3.
5.0	I received this product in about 1 week from purchase.  I can't remember if it was new on the ad but it looked new to me.  Perfectly packaged, excellent condition, and works well.
5.0	My son found this on amazon and begged me to buy it.  purchased it and he loves it, love it!!
5.0	I give the game 5 stars because they did a great job at advertising and getting everyone to buy a remodeled version of every other CoD since the 4th...in conclusion im returning this and getting assassins creed as I originally planned...unlike the some of the other reviewers who just Hate on the game for whatever reason I honestly think if your into CoD hardcore you will enjoy it but if your like me and prefer quality,originality, a lengthy campaign and innovation (even if its innovating on what's previously done it shows that they showed some effort) in games then you are better off buying something else....activision is the new capcom...the next CoD will probably be better seeing as people have come to shun this redundancy  in the end you should play whatever is fitting to you regardless of what anyone else thinks
5.0	The game has a few glitches and the humor can be pretty crude, but I don't think I've laughed more playing a video game. Super enjoyable. I highly recommend it.
5.0	I've had this for quite awhile and still go back to it often.<br /><br />It is full of a huge variety of games from board games to card games and a few other oddities.<br /><br />There are two modes of play:<br />Free play in which you can pick and choose just about all games (some are unlocked as you complete sections of the other mode of play).<br />Stamp play in which you start with easy games (you don't get to pick) and have to work your way up, earning a stamp for each level you complete. If you cannot get through a particular game, there is no need to worry. You get a stamp for trying and after three stamps, you have completed that level. If you win, you get three stamps and advance immediately.<br /><br />It saves your progress although there is not a way to keep more than one saved file.<br /><br />Most games have three levels of play, easy, medium, and hard. There are a variety of skins for each game (normal, stone, paper, techno) but these are unlocked by playing and winning.<br /><br />Some of my favorites are: backgammon, connect five, grid attack, Spades, Escape and Word Balloon. Some of the games do not offer much in the way of a challenge but are great for passing time and zoning out.<br /><br />There are some duds like soda shake (although for some reason I keep doing it...) bowling (way too hard to do with a stylus) and darts.<br /><br />This is not a game that builds excitement but is great for a doctor's waiting room, to de-stress after a busy day or just to better your score.
5.0	My 14 Year old son is having a blast and lots of fun with this Game.
5.0	This was a gift for my little sister, and she loves it. Good deal considering the system was a limited run in this color.
5.0	This is my personal favorite in the Halo series. The graphics are great, there are new weapons, and the gameplay is a lot of fun. Only problem I had was that I was a little confused with the story (this was my first Halo game). So if you haven't played Halo 1 or 2, play them first. Otherwise you won't understand the story. Anyway, I loved this game. Highly recommend it for fans of the series.
5.0	I've had none of the restarting problems others have had. It works great and lasts for at least a year.
5.0	This game is often said to be just a GTA in the West but it is much more than that. The characters are more dynamic and more lively than that of GTA. Most of the as[ects of the game are great but there are a few minor setbacks.    Positives  + HUGE world to explore  + Varying amount of difficulty  + Fun multiplayer  + Pretty good graphics  + Euphoria engine allows for great animations    Negatives   - HUGE world...sometimes you have to travel a long way  - Euphoria engine sometimes gets you stuck into objects or continually running into objects  - Either the story wasn't that good or I have add, there are soooo many sidequests you often forget the story    Overall it's a great game, but if you get distracted easily with open world games then you may just want to give this one a rent. But either way, this title definitely packs fun for many hours.
5.0	granddaughter loves to play this with her friends. they use it a lot and will probably want the next version
5.0	theres a lot of weapons and monsters. all of them can be fought alone but some are very hard to kill. this game is the home of white fatalis the strongest monster in the monster hunter universe
5.0	I bought this item a couple of months ago, and it does the job. My son lost his original cover, and without it, the battery kept falling out. The two covers that come with this are different sizes. I am assume one is for the PSP 2000, and the other is for the 3000. My son has the PSP 3000, and the thinner cover fit perfectly--similarly to the original. I tried the other one just to see and it fit as well-- although not as snug because it had a little more bulk to it; therefore, the battery had room to move around and disconnect from time to time.<br /><br />Overall, if you lost your original cover, these work great, and not bad for the price. The customer service was great, and I did not have any problems receiving my order.
5.0	everything was great and they work wonderfully
5.0	"My experience was the polar opposite.  Granted, I've only tried it with the Kinect Tuner and Dance Central so far, but I took the two minutes to install it and my Kinect experience immediately improved.    My setup: I have a 40\\"" Sony LCD HDTV standing perhaps 2-3 feet off the floor, atop a piece of furniture.  The Kinect Sensor sits on the TV's base, so it's just under the screen.  I only have about 6 feet of space between my TV and couch (with a wall directly behind the couch), with hardwood floor underneath.  The room was well-lit at the time I used it.    Prior to installing the Zoom, my Kinect Sensor could ALMOST get my whole body in the frame when I was standing all the way back against the couch.  Now, I can stand 1-2 feet in front of the couch, and it sees my whole body, with lots of room to spare!  During my time with the Tuner, it didn't see me at one point; I walked away, then came back, and all was fine from that point on.  Hand tracking functioned 100%, but the positioning feels different now because you don't have to be so far away!  I don't have any games that check for the floor, so I can't speak for that.    I can now actually play Dance Central, so this is a 5-star item for me and worth every penny.  It may be that the Zoom will or won't work for you based on your setup.  I second the notion of the reviewer asking for folks to post their setups along with their reviews."
5.0	I enjoy this game so much, a great and underrated jrpg, a hidden gem and I highly recommend this game
5.0	WOW!  buy this game fast.  don't hesitate.  Do it.  this is the best game of all time for any console or pc.
5.0	The product has made me happy. Its in very good condition, works wonders on my gameboy, and is more then expected. I honestly thought i was gonna get some second hand charger but got one as good as new,
5.0	Wow! Now this is a next gen game. I can not wait to see what this game looks like in 3-4 years when these consoles really start churning out games that utilize the hardware to the full potential they have. I must say please NFL do not renew the license agreement with EA in 2014 and let 2K get back to making a football game that is as good as their NBA series. This game is one of the must have PS4 games if you enjoy sports games that is. If it were a pick between Madden and this game pick this one. You will not be disappointed.
5.0	Great Grands loved it.
5.0	I almost didn't buy this game because of the negative reviews. It seems that either people love the game or hate it. Those who hated it didn't seem to think it was fast-paced enough. This is why I liked it. The vendor has patched the game and corrected the problems other reviewers complained about. The graphics and gameplay were flawless in single mode and online play.<br />One reviewer complained that the area was too big and combat was to seldom, however, the maps guide your way to the objectives and if you follow the mission there is always action. I have played online popular online war games and this is quite different. One thing is that you can use almost anything. Second, you can destroy almost anything. Third, it has more strategy and offers more options for coordinated efforts among team members.<br />Some of the other popular games are blood baths where you rush in and try to kill someone before you get killed. You respawn and rush in again. The action is at a blinding speed and a soldier's lifespan is quite short. This game can be fast paced when taking an objective, but there is more time to think, coordinate an attack and set up a defense.<br />I have to give it 5 stars. It is slower paced than some games, but has many advantages that other games are missing. When I say slower paced I don't mean slow paced. There is plenty of action but you have time to plan your move before going into the action.
5.0	My grand daughter loves to draw and this game gives her more to work with and use her imagination with.
5.0	The graphics are great. It's pretty much like living in your own little fantasy world.  You can buld many things. Even torture chambers!
5.0	this game is one of the best fighting games i've ever seen. i've played this at the arcade and thought it was amazing. the graphics are so good and the fighting moves are very well done. my favorite thing about this game that makes it unique is that every character yields some sort of weapon. i don't know how the playstation 2 version is going to be like since they are adding a couple of new features and a new character. the new character is going to be heihachi from tekken. i don't really know how he's going to fight since he doesn't have a weapon...????...he has wristguards...well, that doesn't matter. soul calibur 2 is a great game and i can't wait for it to come out on the PS2.<br />***just a note: for the gamecube version the new character will be LINK from the legend of zelda and for the X-box, the new character will be SPAWN.***
5.0	Wii Fit is amazing.. whether you lose weight or not is not the point.. this is a real breakthrough in videogame design and I think everyone should own it for that reason.
5.0	The GKids were delighted to have this in my game selection and we have enjoyed playing it several times over the Christmas vacation.
5.0	The ending was a bit disappointing but all of the dlc makes this a better game and the Extended Cut dlc makes the ending better but not great.  Overall, this third game of the Mass Effect trilogy has improved graphics and the shooting mechanics are much better.  The cut scenes are good and the crew talks to one another which makes the game more like a movie and more interesting.  You get to land on Mars and go to Earth twice, first in Vancouver and at the end in London.
5.0	I'm sure the boys are getting all they wanted with this game but all I can say is &#34;Great service, as usual, Amazon!&#34;.
5.0	Really its a good game loving it
5.0	controller is very small but sleek. worked great for my genesis 1
5.0	If you played any of the five games that are on this cartridge, you'll know how great this purchase will be! For those who haven't, these are the Super Mario games that made Nintendo famous, and everyone who played them happy. It is really worth buying this game!
5.0	Excellent expensive though
5.0	this game is beautifully animated with fresh new tracks that do a nice job exploiting the antigravity capabilities in this version.  the unique detail in each course is impressive, not much cookie cutter from track to track, and the varying vehicle property combinations make a big difference depending on the style of each track.<br /><br />changes I enjoy include the ability to evade the blue shell with the super horn item, the increased importance of vehicle options per track, and the inability to pick up another item while holding one behind your car (this made it a little too easy for leaders to break away).  the reintroduction of the coins for top speed adjustment is welcome, too, which is also the way in which unlockables are obtained.  the highlights reel at the end of each track is great for sharing and posting a great run.<br /><br />things I don't like include the choice of playable characters- namely, the use of the 7 koopa kids from mario 3 and the 'baby' characters beyond just mario and luigi.  the koopa kids have such a minor presence in the series that I think they really wasted some nice opportunities to insert more familiar or at least previously used characters, like dry bones, birdo, boo (or king boo even), diddy kong, and baby bowser, which aren't present in this version.  baby peach/daisy/rosalina seem like a stretch too, and perhaps it doesn't matter much but unlocking one koopa kid after another isn't exactly rewarding.<br />the predictable rubber banding seems scaled back with regard to the leader shell, but it is also very much present with other enemy items testing you at predictable points on the 3rd lap of certain tracks when you are in first place.  finally, i think that during friendly games in which you are opening a game up to just the people on your friends list, you should be able to participate in voice chat during the race.  this seems like such a basic ability that was purposely enabled only in the lobby for supposed parental concerns, but which could add so much when racing against a close knit set of friends.  perhaps this will be added in retrospect.<br /><br />can't dock it a star though, still too good of a game.  4.5.
5.0	This is one of the best rpgs for PS1. Its in many respects similar to the FF series. You control a group of up to 3 characters at a time (out of a total pool of about 50 - if you can make them join you) to save the world from total destruction. Without giving away any piece of the story line this can be considered to be the sequil to Chrono Trigger from SNES. Chrono Cross utilizes the Active Time Battle system like most rpgs. There are also summons, however, unlike in most FF games they are not limited to certain characters. The graffics are half way decent for PS1 standards which means they are bad with todays standards. The FMVs are still watchable though    bottom line, if you still have a PS1 or feel like playing some 'retro rpg' games pick this one up and you wont be disappointed
5.0	This game is Awsome and so fun
5.0	I have liked this charging dock for Nintendo, it is simple and charges battery packs quickly. Bought one for my grandson because I trusted that it would work good for him too.
5.0	if u looking a great game of world war II, This is It<br /><br />Pros:<br />*great graphics and sound<br /><br />cons:<br />none
5.0	Thanks so much the product avrrived before time but it said new and it was like it was made as soon as it got here. THANKS so much i will buy another set
5.0	"I bought one a year ago and my mother has since bought one too.  Its a great work out paired with the game \\""biggest Loser\\"""
5.0	This is the type of game that you would have to be a fan of action type bosses (aka jumping, dodging, shooting, swinging a sword, and figuring out attack patterns) with a lot of RPG elements. Keep in mind though that their is no leveling system and you WILL be farming bosses, monsters, and nodes in order to progress and craft yourself better gear. Think of it as an action mmo game with no levels that can also be played offline. Also be prepared to look up a lot of things. They do hold your hand a bit a long the way but you are better off trying to read it somewhere else imo.    Multiplayer works great too. Just be sure not to knock or shoot your friend off during mounting.
5.0	Very easy to set up, assembled in minutes and was playing almost straight away.    Response is good, only complaint there is that the cymbals need to be struck hard in order to register multiple notes. Single notes you can tap but once you are hitting a cymbal successively, I find that you need to strike it harder.    Set moves slightly with more complicated bass drum pedal notes.    The service though was excellent, this was from an outside seller and the drum set arrived before the earliest date that was suggested on the order
5.0	Nice game, came without a box, but that's alright, I love Metal Slug games so I can figure out the controls. It won't ever beat the real thing on the real Neo Geo, but this will do!
5.0	I like the entire vs. series from Capcom. What a concept! Now we have a sequel that gives you a 3 character tag team with even more bells and whistles. Very flashy game and you could never get bored with so many characters to choose from. This game has fun written all over it. Forget what you read about 3D fighting and graphics. I always thought people played video games for fun and if fun is what you want, go out and buy this game.
5.0	Best game i've played in years, a must for any strategy gamer out there.  Blows Ground Control out of the water, varied landscapes including; Cities,  deserts, snow filled levels plus many more. Especially love the first  person control of the units, i spent all night just running around as a  marine sniping the enemy.
5.0	So I got Donkey Kong 64 second hand from a vintage store (I know, it's hurts me when they refer to 64 games as vintage, I was at least on my way to high school when it came out, yeesh, not THAT long ago) And I learned for the first time that you cannot play DK64 or some of the other games without this expansion pak. This included one of the Zeldas apparently. I never knew of this, I never had any of those games, so anyway, I had to quickly buy the expansion pak here in order to play my new (old) DK game, and I am glad I did. The 64 is probably one of the best gaming systems of our time, and any way to enhance that experience, I'm in. Get the expansion pak if you want a heightened experience.
5.0	Great mouse for not a lot of money.  Looks really cool and works great.  It does take awhile to get to you  but what do you want for the price?
5.0	Bought Crysis 2 as a gift and was told the game was amazing so buy it if you haven't already!!
5.0	Brand new in shrink wrap. Very good price with the game not being out very long. And with prime it showed up in 2 days.
5.0	I purchased this to hold all of the children's dvds that we keep in the car.  This fits perfectly in the consul of our truck.<br /><br />The DVDs stay in their individual slots perfectly and do not fall out easily.  Also easy to unzip and pull out any dvd that we are looking for.<br /><br />I would recommend this case as it is very durable and will last a long time.
5.0	"When I bought a Wii, I mostly bought it knowing there were titles that were exercise-based; this one is by FAR the best I've found.  It doesn't have a \\""little kid\\"" feel like some of the others (while I also like Wii Fit Plus, some of the balance games are absurd and using negative feedback to get you motivated really stinks) and doesn't browbeat you into submission (I'm looking at you, Jillian).    If you get any fitness game from Wii, get this one.  It's versatile for beginners and advanced users.  I love it."
5.0	This is by far the best COD in the series!
5.0	Good stuff. If you want to cheat and own some booty this is what you want. Also the pussy game is ridiculous.
5.0	This is a great game, and the 2nd zelda game I've played, after Twilight princess which I didn't complete as the game broke but In that game I don't think I completed that much of it anyways.
5.0	So so happy with this purchase! I could not believe the price especially when it included the rechargeable battery packs!
5.0	"There are Survey Sims and there are Study Sims. For example, Microsoft FSX albeit very detailed and allows you to learn aviation in a profound way, it is a \\""Survey\\"" simulator. DCS Black Shark is a \\""Study\\"" simulator. This means unless you already know the Black Shark, it is highly doubtful you will be able to jump in and start flying in real simulation mode like you can in FSX. However, Eagle Dynamics provides an accommodating game mode, which will allow anyone to take off with the Black Shark and enjoy a military chopper. Nevertheless, you can easily keep adding real features to the game mode step by step to make it more real as you strengthen your skills. That's the big picture. Now for the review...I have played this Sim for hundreds of hours and every single time I get into the Ka-50 Black Shark I just absolutley love it. I broke up my learning process into fully understanding the startup procedures, then basic flight procedures, then targeting and using the weapons, then shutdown...and on to advanced. I recommend a similar method. The graphics and modeling of the Ka-50 are stellar. The cockpit is stellar just for the fact that EVERYTHING works unlike FSX aircraft. The terrain and other outside eye candy are not really the focus but they are very nice as well. This Sim is foucsed on a real Ka-50 experience and is extremely credible for that point. It is an awesome means to learn to fly a military helicopter.  It is absolutely worth every dime in regards to a well crafted simulator.  And if you get frustrated, Eagle Dynamics has an excellent forum to help you along the way.  This is an absolutely incredible simulator, and I recommend it."
5.0	I enjoy this game very much! It is very fun and has alot of characters with different personalities and wonderful designs! I have been a fan of the Tekken series since I was a child in the 90's and continue to love Tekken to this day! :)
5.0	Christmas this year was a Shin Magami year.....Each item that was ordered for my son was exactly what was stated on the item when ordered.....Came intacked.......Short turn around....
5.0	Great replacements. , for the 6yr old who losses about 1 a week..lol this is a great. Product and it works good
5.0	Want a system now? Dreamcast is it. Want to play games on the NET? Dreamcast is it. Want a great selection of games? Dreamcast is it. Want to save some money? Dreamcast is it. Dont need another DVD player? Dreamcast is it. Want the best NBA and NFL sports titles ever made? Dreamcast is it.<br />What can I say.. This thing rulez!
5.0	"This is one of the best computer games ever, and the best single-character role playing game. <br /> <br />After the first few hours of playing Deus Ex, I was impressed the complexity of the combat system.  The tactical maps reward exploration, the hit point system is body-location specific instead of general (so a critical blow against a head is much different from one against a leg), and there are so many ways to approach a probem that it makes the \\""multisolution\\"" system of Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic look like Tic Tac Toe.   The options of long-range sniping, getting up close and personal with melee weapons or unleashing with automatic weapons and grenades also contribute to a great first person shooter experience. <br /> <br />After the first day, I was impressed with how the game went out of its way to set the mood of another world, the fact that if you wander into the women's restroom an NPC will make a sarcastic comment, and how almost every non-player character has something to say.  I was particularly blown away by how experience is awarded not for killing things, but for \\""exploration bonuses\\"", \\""progress awards\\"" and \\""achieved objective awards\\"".  Too many games reward the entirely unrealistic activity of looking for danger, while in Deus Ex there is little point to looking for an unnecessary fight.   <br /> <br />I moved the game from the \\""really good\\"" to the \\""ridiculously good\\"" column after it passed the 'toilet' and 'Asian languages' tests.  Have you ever noticed that people in computer games almost never have to go the bathroom, and that even large buildings don't have any toilets?  And also that games that have a lot of toilets, such as the Fallout series, tend to be really good role playing games?  Deus Ex has a lot of restrooms, with toilets that you can flush.  The second test is one that I've never actually seen in a game - the use of an actual Asian language rather than a bunch of scribbles.  Having spent about 6 years of my life studyingJapanese, the fact that most games don't even try to use a real writing system for signs supposedly set somewhere in Asia is really annoying.  Deus Ex does in the chapter set in Hong Kong, and it is so well done that I was able to tell stalls in the market apart by their Chinese-language signs.  Major respect due to the designers for their attention to this detail that everyone else ignores! <br /> <br />Finally, when NPCs began to give in-depth speeches on the nature of the relationships among society, the individual and government I decided that this game was off the charts.  It is the rarest of computer games - a first-person shooter role playing game that builds its foundation on ideas.  The graphics are a bit dated, but the graphics are not the reason to play this game.  Unless you need your games to be non-stop explosions and gunfire, you need to get this game."
5.0	Great game!!..Can't go wrong with any of the Medal Of Honor PC games!!...
5.0	Ah the good old authentic nintendo-made snes controller. I was feeling nostalgic not too long ago so I decided to break out my old SNES and play some Super Mario World and maybe some Super Bomberman 2 (classics). Anyways I was disappointed and (not gonna lie) a little heart-broken when I discovered my controllers had both given up the ghost. So, not wanting to wait for shipping, I searched around my local game shops hoping someone would carry old controllers, but no dice. So against the warning bells in my head, I picked up a couple of 3rd party controllers that the salesman assured me performed “just as good” as the originals… brought them home and was highly disappointed due to a severe button-to-action lag. It made playing Super Mario impossible since precise timing and jumping are necessary. I soon lost patience and bought a different brand of 3rd party controllers which… basically had the same outcome. Finally I decided to bite the bullet and buy controllers online. I didn’t want to pay the exorbitant price for a ‘new’ old controller (which was like $60), so I found a used one for about half that and bought 2… so I spent about that anyways, but my brother could play with me. They were packaged nicely and arrived quickly thanks to an excellent seller (luedem super games) . I immediately popped them in and crossed my fingers that I’d finally get to play the games of my teenage years how they were meant to be played…. And….. I spent the next 6 hours playing Mario with my brother and the next couple days playing a host of classics. The original is still the best, these controllers are exactly what you want. Great experience 
5.0	Reminds me of the old days when i was a teeager, Pac Mac RULES. The other games are good as well
5.0	My boys love this!  The had the wireless controllers, but those lag, and the games they play require a quick response.  This controller give them just that, and it doesn't need batteries!  Priced right, too.
5.0	Excellent product! Go Sony!
5.0	Works great, clear audio, durable, great pickup
5.0	Although I've played this before and it's a lot of fun for an older strategy game, I'll really wish I could order it again. I have a copy of<br />DOOM 3 which has super duper graphics.
5.0	I am having a lot of fun working out with this game every day!
5.0	My grandson loved it. Fit his video game very well. Good quality and very sturdy for a handle held game cover.
5.0	I have a 3 yr old son and a 7 yr old daughter. They can't get enough of this game. Myself, a 33 grown man find myself playing the game with them. Lots of fun.

5.0	elegi este articulo por la exelencia de sus pasadas ediciones y escojo esa calificacion por que el articulo llego exelente.!!!!
5.0	"The add on was a fun and welcome addition to the Fallout 3 game, it breaks a little from the \\""norm\\"" of the game and was a fun addition that helped break up a rather long game (I played the point lookout in the middle of fallout 3. Overall I would rate it a solid 5 out of 5."
5.0	Great gift. My husband loves this game
5.0	Our son loves this game...plays it a lot, thanks for selling a game without violence.  We are very satisfied with this purchase.
5.0	This was an excellent deal. It shipped fast. The game is super fun to play.
5.0	I Have been Playing Asheron's Call since 1999 (on and off) and i am currently playing, this game is very well put together and is very well liked, especially to the people who dont concentrate on a plot  or story line, once you finish the tutorial, your free!, the game is great and the new expansion material is very creative and fun. The enviroment is also very nice, there are many many people who will help you (the people who are mean can be reported at a last resort, but mainly ignored), including me =). just for a warning, the different servers may vary. also if you dont want to die alot and get frustrated DONT PLAY DARKTIDE IFSO, it is a PvP, or Player Versus Player Server, meaning once your out there your a free kill to anyone. if anyone new kids, need help im Grasp Of Demon, or Death's Sage, on the MorningThaw server (Note: in my opinion, its the best, please join!) <br />                                          Thanks, <br />                                          Gamer Name, Grasp
5.0	I gotta hand it to the voice actors. For English dubbed it's a great game.
5.0	The best Elder Scrolls game.
5.0	This cable is awesome. I love it. Works perfectly and at a great price. Thanks.
5.0	Not worth $70 but a great game. Can be picked up used for about $10. Can't go wrong for that. The game offers hours of fun for anyone. On top of it you get to be a Ghostbuster. For a child of the 80's that might be a big deal for you. It was for me.
5.0	I originally had the OLED Vita and traded in the system and used the cash towards purchasing this lime green Slim Vita. The new Slim Vitas are not necessarily and upgrade or downgrade from the original models but a change in some areas that I value. Lighter, no more proprietary charge cable, and more comfortable in my hands were the major draws towards switching to the slim model. To top it off, the white / lime green Vita pops and is a major pleasure on the eyes over the U.S. all black model.
5.0	Bought this for my boyfriend for Christmas. He loved it.
5.0	"Where to begin...the graphics are amazing, the sounds are amazing, the trash talkin is awesome, the moves are unreal, and the courts are perfect.  That was my first impression.  Hours of gameplay later, I think it is still 100% true.  My favorite gameply mode is the \\""Be A Legend\\"" mode, working your way up through the street levels, earning respect, improving your game, etc.<br />This game is definitely worth the purchase."
5.0	Don't listen to the bad reviews! The game is just awesome!!!!
5.0	My grandson has a DS given tohim as a gift and had only a few games on it.  I decided to buy this since he loved the movie, and he absolutely loves the game too!
5.0	The game was a gift.    The recipient could not play the game because Big Fish wanted the purchaser cr. card info and purchase info.  I don't know after a month if the person I bought the game for has been able to play it.    Can't Amazon do something about this?
5.0	This game is fun and it really works your body out without keeping you out of breath. I was sore for three days
5.0	Great,really nice high quality charging dock. Makes charging the 3ds a breeze. This I recommend to anyone who owns a 3ds.
5.0	It seems obligatory to mention the reviewer's experience with the Tomb Raider series to begin with so I'll get that out of the way here: I've played the original Tomb Raider, Tomb Raider 2, Tomb Raider Legend, Tomb Raider Anniversary, and Tomb Raider Underworld. I don't have any particular emotional attachment to the original series, appreciating them mostly as entertaining action adventure games that are heavy on the action.<br /><br />Tomb Raider Anniversary is my favorite of that group, combining modern day graphics with classic environmental challenges and puzzle solving. Figuring out how to traverse an environment set up like an obstacle course is the main reason I enjoy these games and the like such as Prince of Persia and Uncharted.<br /><br />The Tomb Raider remake is very action-oriented. This is not the worst thing as it is pretty well executed for the most part. Lara starts out as an amazingly athletic individual who has to combat enemies with that most old-school of ranged weapons, the bow and arrow, awkwardly scrambling away on all fours to dodge attacks. By the end of the game my Lara could easily take on groups of heavily armed enemies, skillfully sidestepping their lunges and one-shot stabbing them in the neck with an arrow. This progression feels highly earned as you gain experience by defeating enemies, finding various nick-knacks, and generally moving through the story. Weapons can be upgraded by finding salvage and upgrading them at your campsite (shades of Dark Souls). That dinky wooden bow will eventually become a deadly competition bow that can slice through multiple enemies and capable of shooting grenade arrows (!).<br /><br />A large amount of the encounters can be overcome through stealth and judicious planning of how to take down a group of enemies, but discovery ends up in protracted firefights. That's fine. What's not so good are the frequent quick-time events (QTEs) that pop up during action sequences. I detest QTEs and some of them are mandatory to progress through the game. There are a few sequences that I played through one or five times too many, cursing as I mistimed or mispressed the button cues. QTEs rob the player of skill and agency in determining his or her success. Game developers, please come up with better game mechanics than the QTE!<br /><br />Exploration wise the game shines. Lara acquires more tools to move around the environment as the game moves along, in a manner that feels highly similar to the Batman Arkham series. Ziplining, using a climbing pick to scale a rock face, and just jumping and climbing over everything in sight never really got old for me. This all comes together once you've completed the game and get the opportunity to explore previously visited zones with your full toolkit.<br /><br />Going back to those old areas is pleasant because the graphics are pretty darned amazing. I would frequently stop to rotate the camera and admire the surroundings while also looking for particular points of interest. Lara herself is depicted rather gritty and grimy. Her proportions are not as extreme as her previous incarnation and that's effective at driving home how this is one lone young woman up against the world. There is good variety in the environments which include lush forests and snowy cliffs battered by snow and wind. The indoor settings also look nice but aren't as ripe for exploration. A note on the tombs - there are a number of them scattered around the various zones and they behave more like puzzle rooms than anything else. Figure out the room's gimmick and get the prize at the end. I enjoyed these sections but they were too far and few between.<br /><br />Lara's character development feels earned. She becomes more of a badass just as you as the player gets better at the game, and this symmetry is plain satisfying. The peripheral characters feel much more flat and cliched. They act as catalysts for the story rather than fully-fledged individuals themselves.<br /><br/>An excellent job by the folks at Square Enix at reinvigorating this proud franchise. More exploration, less QTEs in the next one and they'll really have a new classic on their hands.
5.0	Game is great for anyone, no matter how much time you have to play. In this game, you don't have to play for 10+ hours a day to enjoy high end game content. The game mechanics are excellent and I will be playing this game for a while.
5.0	If you like looking for object this is a good game. More then one game included. Have several options on how to play.
5.0	I played this with 1 gb memory,an MSI dedicated card,80 gb hard drive and and very angry celeron 3.2 processor that feels like a whipped pony trying to race on Churchill Downs with the big guys.It ran a great race and I'm proud of it.I had Vista installed and had no problem.You really need a good system to play this game. I tried to play it with integrated ATI EXPRESS 200 and could n't load up. I would always crash and get a windows graphics error message. The problem was I didn't have shader3.0 .The msi took care of that and also helped vista aero graphics.The game itself is pretty good. For the price I paid for it  it's a good buy and I would play it again.The game takes up 10 gb of hard drive space. I played it on an 80 gb hard drive with no problem but I would advise using a larger hard drive.It's a good game but demands a great computer.Don't knock Celerons as junk. It did the job although a Pentium would have been better.
5.0	works better than my original wii remote. product identical to branded wii remote but without wii logo. Not sure of its durability yet.
5.0	I have been meaning to buy a charger to my Gameboy Micro but never did. Then one time I ordered for a charger from a website that was not Amazon and I ended up getting a charger for a Nintendo DS. Then I tried again at Amazon and I got what I wanted.
5.0	Very good, my kids loved it.
5.0	I needed a newer headset for my PS3 since the Motorola one I had was not rechargeable. Needless to say I got the matching Sony one to get the few extra features it offers such as on screen battery indicator, mute on/off etc.. A very nice headset. Have not noticed much discomfort from it even after extended use. My ears are on the small side as well, I know some reviews say it hurts after an hour or so. It comes with 2 different sized ear bud rubber covers so I suggest trying them both to see what fits best. Overall great build quality and sound clarity. Would recommend.
5.0	This is an excellent headset works great and the customer service from the company is amazing also. Its pretty loud too and people can hear me perfectly on the other end and cant hear my tv so the noise cancellation works.
5.0	Well, I just started using this one, but it seems to be working just fine.  I'll write another review if something goes wrong, but I doubt it will.
5.0	This game is utterly amazing. I rented it from Gamefly to try it out, but let me tell you, every second I had was devoted to find out what happens next in the incredibly fascinating and intriguing storyline. The storyline itself receives a strong 10/10 from me. (being generous) if I had to rate it raw I would say 9.6/10 and thats just including details which are not even significant enough to be major factors. So Im just giving two points of view for this game. It will make you feel all sorts of things; Fear, Sadness (towards the end), a feeling of completeness (at the end), happiness, action, adventure, its just a great game. Honestly one of the deepest games I have played throughout my gaming career. I have and will continue to recommend this game to many friends. I will be looking to buy the ranger edition as well. MUST HAVE W/ ANY PS3 PLAYER. Breakdown:<br />Storyline: 9.6/10 or 10/10 (generous)<br />Characters: 9.5/10 or 9.5/10 (generous)<br />Weapons: 9.8/10 or 9.8/10 (generous)<br />Build-up: 10/10 or 10/10 (generous)<br />Graphics: 11/10. Seriously this game is perfect.<br />Overall: 9.8/10-- 10/10.
5.0	The 12 year old wanted a chat pad for his XBOX 360 wireless controller. ..I couldn't fathom shelling out $30 plus for the &#34;official&#34; one. I bought this one, he loved it, plugged it in, and it works like a charm. His only &#34;gripe&#34; is that the keys aren't backlit...I'm okay with that since I don't want him playing in the dark when he should be sleeping! Plus, I don't even actually know if the Microsoft &#34;official&#34; chat pad has back lighting of the keys, so I can't count that as a negative in comparison.
5.0	Lots of fun for the whole family, gets them up off the couch!!
5.0	Who would have thought to put together a roster of some of the greatest fighting characters from two different fighting games, fighting styles and are graphically different from one another but still maintained it's two dignities and yet still made it work: Capcom and Namco, that's who. Take that. A masterpiece.<br />P.S. Now where's Tekken X Street Fighter?
5.0	Twas a good buy. The deal of all ages. Eternity even. Possibly even could have sold me ice, and I'm an eskimo
5.0	Fast shipping, great service and, of course, a fantastic game.  Mind you, I already knew that last one prior to purchase, but happy with the shopping experience in any case.
5.0	This is the best system ever.  It has sold more consoles faster than any other in the shortest amount of time.  This is all for good reason.  Dreamcast is simply awesome.  One cannot let them pass it by wether you are a casual gamer or a hardcore gamer. Most of the games are awesome for the Dreamcast and not just  graphically either.  Games like Soul Calibur, which is definitely the best  fighting game ever and a must for any Dcast owner, control perfectly and I  have yet to find a flaw with this game.   Don't wait till the Playstation 2  comes, well you can if you want but you decide.  You will look at the  Playstation 2 with graphics a little better than first-generation Dreamcast  game, but when the polygon counts get this high you can't really see much  difference.
5.0	Perfect for Xbox 360 controllers that have worn out rubber and missing grip on thumb joysticks! perfect for the controller if it doesn't..it fitts even better...lil bumbs add great grip and makes your controller feel knew...even thoe it moves a little on the worn out rubber joystick it stays.an A from me..i recommend .
5.0	I got it fast and in perfect condition. I am real happy. It came a day earlier then it said it would and tracking was awesome I got a confirmation as soon as it was dropped off at my door.
5.0	Fun game but wanted to rip my hair out on that last boss.
5.0	well, It's the official one! I bought some generi variations and they're really inferior.<br />There's not much to talk here, if you wanna play singstar, I highly suggest you do with the original microphones. The other ones won't be as great.
5.0	Bought this so I could use the XBox 360 controller on my Fire TV works good. I have not tried two 360 controllers yet.
5.0	Love this game especially when modded by the nexus community. Hours and hours of replay value that will last you for forever or as long as nexus continues to put out such amazing mods for the game.
5.0	It is just like new It is just like new, the kids are very happy and it didn't cost a fortune
5.0	Who ever doesn't have this game you have to get it! The graphics are so cool and the sound on dolby digital surround sound is AWSOME! Even without surround sound the sound is still cool. It has 12 levels/missions. It also has new gadgets and here they are: Q-Jet, Q-Claw, Q-Laser, Q-descripter. There are other ones but you will have to find out while you are playing the game. (....) It has some new guns. One of the guns is the P2K which looks exactly like the real thing.  This game is out for PS2 and the graphics are just a little bit better on GameCube.  On one of the levels(the third) you have to disable a van to get something, but dont worry you will find out what it is.  You can't destroy the van or else you will fail your mission.  The car you drive has missiles, rockets, etc.  There I just gave you a little tip about the third level.  You have to buy this game!!!  ...
5.0	the best adventure game ever!<br /><br />i'm Waiting for the new release in 2012 of sly cooper, great adventure game higly recommended
5.0	AFTER LOVING THE FIRST '' EVIL DEAD '' GAME I COULD HARDLY WAIT FOR THE NEW ONE TO COME OUT.. MOST PEOPLE DID NOT LIKE THE FIRST GAME , WHICH I THINK IS MAINLY DUE TO HOW HARD IT WAS . AFTER ALL-THE DEADITES CONTINUALLY RESPAWN , AND THAT IN ITSELF CAN BE FRUSTRATING.. SO IN THIS GAME YOU HAVE TO ONCE AGAIN , SAVE THE WORLD FROM THE DEMON MENACE CALLED DEADITES.., AND YOU ARE ASSAULTED WITH WAVES OF THEM ,BASICALLY DUE TO THE FACT THAT THE GAME IS BASED ON THE '' STATE OF EMERGENCY '' GAMEPLAY .. BUT ALL THAT ASIDE , THIS IS A VERY COOL GAME! THE ONLY FLAW IS THE SHORTNESS OF IT , ONLY 6 LEVELS .THE GAME DEVELOPER SHOULD HAVE PUT IN AT LEAST 10 TO 12 LEVELS.MOST OF THE TASKS YOU UNDERTAKE ARE FAIRLY EASY , BUT THERE ARE LOADS OF DEADITES OUT TO STOP YOU AT EVERY TURN ! BUT WITH TIME AND PATIENCE YOU CAN PROGRESS THRU THE GAME , IF YOU DON'T WASTE YOUR MEDIKITS , AS SOME DEADITES DROP POWERUPS , AS WELL AS AMMO. PLUS ALL THE COOL WEAPONS YOU GET THROUGHOUT THE GAME , MOST OF WHICH YOU WILL NOT REALLY NEED .AS WELL AS COOL  MAGIC SPELLS TO PERFORM TOO.AND ASH IS CONSTANTLY MAKING WISECRACKS , AS WELL AS SIGNATURE COMMENTS YOU CAN MAKE HIM SAY ACCORDING TO THE LEVEL YOU ARE CURRENTLY IN.. BUT THE ARCADE MODE MAKES UP FOR THE SHORTNESS OF THE GAME.. YOU HAVE VARIOUS TASKS TO COMPLETE IN A LIMITED AMOUNT OF TIME .AND THE WEAPONS YOU GET TO USE VARY IN RANGE ..SO PICK IT UP TODAY !AT [THIS PRICE] IT IS A STEAL AND WELL WORTH IT !  ALL '' HAIL TO THE KING ''  ASH FROM HOUSEWARES !!
5.0	Everything was as explained!
5.0	Got this game for my stepson's birthday.  He loved it, played on it constantly.  I give this seller 5 stars for fast shipment and a good product.
5.0	One of the best games I have played.<br /><br />This game is a sneak/assassinate style game or it could be a one man army style of game.  You decide!  The replay-ability of this is fantastic as each mission causes changes in the following missions and the world that the game is played in.<br /><br />This contains the main game plus 3 add ons.
5.0	I'm very happy with the quality of this skin; the pieces peel off easily and stuck to the surface of the DS extremely well once pressed into place. Everything is pretty much a perfect fit, though the skin around the movement &#34;cross&#34; button may be a tad bit tight. Either way, I didn't run into any issues when applying it.
5.0	OK! No problem with it!
5.0	I have owned and played EVERY version of this series. I've been playing with Doctor Strange, Captain America, and looking for a third to play as a main team. I always have fun playing this game.<br /><br />It has a deep learning curve, and you will want to train hard before going to the internet and play online, but you will love it regardless.<br /><br />Unless you lose, then you'll get mad...
5.0	This is a great system.  Period.  It was my second game system, and its awesome.  I don't mind the graphics, they're fine.  It's one of the few systems capable of playing 'Pokemon'.  That's the whole reason I got this.  Also, I like the DS Lite because of the stylus thing.  An iPod touch works best with finger touch, so its easy to get oily, scrubby, and broken.  I like this touch screen, using styli and all.
5.0	Halo is one amazing game. With seamless graphics and incredible gameplay, this game is the closest thing to actually waging a war against an entire race of aliens bent on universal domination. Co-op is da SHIZ NIT and you have never had a party before until you host a eight player HALO system link party. If you have friends who are prone to controller throwing you may want to have a couple extra just in case (just kidding). My friends and I have had more fun playing system link HALO than any other game or any other thing we would ever do at a party. The single play is amazing and if you have ever played a first-person shooter and are thinking that this is more of the same recycled crap from those budget games you are absoloutely wrong. Years of painstaking work and playtesting have resulted in the greatest game of all time. The bottom line is this: HALO IS THE GREATEST GAME OF ALL TIME SINGLE AND MULTI-PLAYER WISE AND DESERVES TO BE BOUGHT BY ANYONE WHO IS 13 YEARS OF AGE. the reason why I say 13 is because there is quite a bit of blood and lots of intense killing. If you are a mature 13 yearold, you should have no problem with this game (this is to you parents out there who think videogames are the source of all of the world's violence). I have only two SUPERsmall gripes and that is no custom soundtrack capability on the Multiplay and the levels can become slightly repetitive. WORD UP PZ OUT. p.s. if you are thinking about buying HALO 2 and you do not own a copy of HALO 1, I STRONGLY recommend buying HALO 1 first because there is so much depth in the storyline that it will help out a lot if you have played through HALO 1 before you play HALO 2. later y'all
5.0	Wow.  So, first off I have some back problems and I haven't let it stop me from playing video games but I should have because I've been in pain from terrible posture from hunching over my controller on my couch in front of the tv ever since I started playing games 20 some years ago.  I really screwed up.  I had been leaning in, towards the TV, when I should have been leaning back into the couch with the controller in my lap comfortably.  I regret very much not getting one of these many years ago.  It's really reignited my passion for games like nothing else has in ages.<br /><br />It's more comfortable for me to sit on the couch with this in my lap, than it is for me to just sit on the couch.  I picked this up for fighting games, but I'm finding that it works amazing at many other games as well.  I do mean amazing.
5.0	My expectations are definitely surpassed. And i got it 11/11/11 I was worried it would be late. The graphics also look amazing!
5.0	excellent game! it's like a challenging game of chess with all your favorite yugioh monsters thrown into the mix
5.0	My husband and I got it for a family gift. So far we love it. They like playing the WII sports and I love the Zumba dance and my daughter loves Just dance. So far so good for a family that really doesn't play video games.
5.0	i had this years ago. i had so much fun with it i bought it again. it's a great game.<br />it's a dos game so i had to use win 98se to play it.
5.0	No Brainer - buy this game! This is a perfect mash of Black Flag and AC III. I did recently replay the Ezio trilogy and miss the bombs, arrow storms and side stories (ladies) that are so prevalent in those earlier releases. However, there are some outstanding tweaks to this release: Naval Campaign lets you skip the mini-game battles, North Atlantic sea exploration and battles (can take sides in open conflict, defeat slaver ships, crush icebergs), cave exploration, grenade launcher, assassin stalkers after you. The colder climates are a nice contrast to Black Flag however there is more to explore where the snow and hunting challenges will remind you of Conner's work in AC III. I am working on finding treasure coordinates and upgrading my ship - while doing these diversions I keep coming up on other diversions that turn out to be more fun... it is going to take me a respectable amount of time to go the completionist route (easily 40 hours with good replay value). Sure, the computer hacking is still tedious and there are a few glitches (crewmen doing the jig in midair last night); but, overall it is much smoother than previous offerings. The story line is strong; but, has been less of an interest to me because the game gives you such a strong sense of being on your own. The up side to that being you cannot go anywhere without having to dish out some learning!
5.0	As someone who doesn't feel comfortable enough working out around other people, this program is *perfect* for me. I love how I'm able to customize practically everything so it's tailored just for me. I'm down 13 pounds so far and I'm actually enjoying my daily workout routine, something I haven't been able to say in a long time. <br /> <br />If I could change anything, it would be this: <br /> <br />-Less downtime, Maya sometimes takes a good 5 - 15 seconds to 'find the beat' to get back into routine if I had to pause the program. <br />-The ability to increase/decrease the difficulty of a single exercise. When Maya asks how I did at the end of a section - where half the exercises were too hard and half were too easy - what do I say? I would like the ability to give a thumbs down to a specific exercise, basically saying dump that but keep everything else. <br /> <br />Over all, this is the best PS2 purchase I've made in a long time.
5.0	I have never played a Dynasty Warriors game before but I am a huge Legend of Zelda fan having played most, if not all, of the console versions of those games.<br /><br />Well, I am now a fan of Dynasty Warriors and will be looking to pick up their previous games because this game is a blast.  It's awesome being able to play as all of the well known Zelda characters.  Plus the game mechanics of killing a ton of bad guys in addition to the strategy needed to capture bases and then hold them is very satisfying if somewhat repetitive.  All the sounds and power ups are straight from the Zelda games so it definitely feels like this game fits within the canon of the Zelda universe even if the game play is vastly different from your standard Zelda game.<br /><br />I highly recommend this game especially if you like either hack-and-slash or Zelda-based games
5.0	Recently a number of amazing first person shooters have been released, Halo, Far Cry, and Doom 3.  Simply put Half-Life 2 is an entire step above these.  The storyline is unmatched, the detail and mystery quickly draws you into the game.  The presentation of the game is nothing short of cinimatic, the environment, characters and combat are great.  The characters in particular look more like they belong in a movie than a video game.  Additionally the physics of the environment add an entirely new dimmension to the game, a move that took Doom an expansion to duplicate.  My comment of being near perfection only refers to the sometimes annoyingly often loading screens, and the more annoying than intriguing silence from the main character.  These are only the most minor of shortcommings, simply put this is the best game you can buy with your money.
5.0	gracias el producto llego a tiempo fue el indicado viene en espanol y aqui en venezuela mi hijo de 6 anos lo entiende y lo juega es original y vino completamete sellado
5.0	5 and 10 year old love this game. They figured it out after about an hour or so of running around without any help. They play it on and off with other games but its one of their favorites. If you have a dinosaur lover this is a game for you =)
5.0	Love limited editions! Steelbooks for life
5.0	Really good quality. Very pleased.
5.0	Great weapon selection, long playablitiy. Various ways to kill your enemies. AI is very interactive and makes the game challenging but fun. Would recommend this game.
5.0	It's very sturdy, adds nice height, and it's easy to pick up and put away. It's definitely worth the price.
5.0	Great battlefield experience, totally imersive! Use your mic and work as a team with your squad, so many users don't seam to play the game this way!
5.0	An excellent, polished controller that seamlessly integrates with mobile devices. Tested on a Galaxy Note 3 and Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 tab.
5.0	This game is just like Lord of the Sith games I and II, but way better. I know that there a die hard Star Wars Fans out there but just give this game a try. You don't know what you are missing if you don't.
5.0	It does exactly what you would expect. Small and compact. Works great on my Asus Transformer tablet. Easy to set up.  Plays games like dead trigger and shadow gun perfectly along with others games of that style (Pretty much any game made by Nvidia will work and a select few that are made by other developers) . The only complaint really is that if you have bigger hands or are used to playing with an Xbox controller than this will feel very small in your hands and a tad awkward at first. Extended game play may cause your hands to gramp a little bit. If you have carpal tunnel this may irritate it. But overall great little controller for on the go.  Comes with a nice little carrying case and kick stand to hold your tablets or phones. I would recommend this to anyone looking for an Android gaming controller for portable/on the go use.
5.0	Exactly what it says it is....
5.0	Off the hook! I use 2 of these blasters at the same time with House of the Dead.
5.0	Bought this for my son for Christmas this year. He played the demo on the xbox and seemed to enjoy it but of course the demo only goes so far in a scene. Can't wait to see what else he can do in the game.
5.0	There's no reason not to like this product, you know what your buying, it's a cord that charges your 360 headset, and that's what it does, the cord isn't short or long it's great.
5.0	What a great headset very neat with the box very high standard headset i would definitely buy again if i could
5.0	this game is sooooo grate that I don't play anything else   this game is sooooo cool I'm freezing   this game is genetically different.
5.0	I like it because it is new and it is in good condition!And what I also love is the function. It works perfectly
5.0	Great game. Shipped very fast.
5.0	THE MONSTER CABLE AS ALWAYS PERFORMED SUPERIORLY.  EXCELLENT CONSTRUCTION AND QUALITY.  ADVISE PURCHASE WITHOUT HESITATION.
5.0	I was very skeptical about this. It's so cheap and seemed too good to be true. But it arrived, it fits, I love it! It's nice to have something soft and squishy, textured, to hold onto when playing for long periods.
5.0	This handheld system is amazing. Two bright acreens that adjust to conserve battery life. One that utilizes a stylus allowing for intuitive game play on some games. Beautiful graphix and 3D rendered gaming. My kid and I love this thing.
5.0	When I purchased this over a year ago it was available only from Amazon.UK. This unit is still working flawlessly. It is comfortably lightweight. Audio is clear and the design will make you think you're at the helm of your very own star ship.
5.0	Definitely enhances wii graphics. It looked amazing on the two tv's I used it with. Also, look at that price!!
5.0	very good pruduct recommend 100%
5.0	The same as any other Xbox one controller but with a nice advanced warfare design. The start button or the three horizontal lines button I have to push it in deeper than my older controller. But the controller is out right beautiful and it has a nice little smiley face by the right trigger :)
5.0	Works very well. It doesn't have a drastic picture difference from the component cables either. My only problem with them is that you can't play full screen. But I don't think any cable does, so you'd need to have a TV with Zoom to get actual full screen capibilities.    However, I enjoy playing with a PS3 controller and on a TV 9 times out of 10. So you can't beat the price.
5.0	finaly!!!!! a game like battlefront (star wars) but without the lasers and wired battlegrounds this game will blow your mind!!!!!!!!!!!
5.0	GTA is one of my favorites games.. this game is all what i want, graphics, history, everything is good..i recommend.
5.0	This is a great product at a fraction of the cost of Hori - which ive used for my ds and i dont see why it is more expensive<br /><br />This film went on easy. I screwed up the first time but i just pulled it back and reapplied. Only got one minor dust particle trapped towards the edge of the screen -hardly noticeable. The film feels exactly like the gamepad screen and it is pretty much invisible. There is hardly any glare and no huge gaps around the edges and no bubbles. I didnt even have to smooth any out. Plus there are 3 protectors included, and for little more money you can get a 6 pack. Makes you wonder about the profit margins of other brands
5.0	This screen protector works great!  People complain that you need to keep it free of dust.  This is true.  You need to clean the screen really good.  All you need to do is use the provided cleaning cloth and maybe even get a can of compressed air to blow off any remaining dust.  Than follow the directions on the box EXACTALLY as it tells you.  I had no problems with it at all.  If you are a teenager and are having trouble just ask your parents for help.  Once applied you could not ask for anything better.  It will save your PSP from any scratches and keep the screen free from fingerprints.  The screen quality does not change with the exception of maybe being a little darker.  It is really not noticeable though.  It greatly reduces glare and that is a major bonus.  All in all a great purchace.  I highly recommend buying one.  I hope you all enjoy it's added protection as much as I do.
5.0	Big hit with my son.  Minecraft is all the rage now with the eleven year olds at my son's school.
5.0	Its Great, I defintely recommended, to anyone who is looking for protection.<br />Right Fit, its just perfect. nice color (blue)
5.0	Put on your flight suit, grab your helmet, choose a fighter and hit the cold depth of space in search of the enemy. Starlancer is a great shooter, graphics are very well done and the game play is sweet, the fun facter is here too, its not an easy game to beat so you'll be quite busy with this one, The game starts off with you in a rookie squadron known as the 45th's, each level of play consists of different missions within that level, for example...you may called to support a squadron of ships in one sector, then to be summoned somewhere else for what ever the mission calls for, the controls are a little confusing at first, each button, including the joypad has a different function so it will take time and practice to get used to but once you do, it makes the game all that much more fun and exciting....this game is very much recommended for those who love the cold reaches of space and taking the fight to the enemy....
5.0	Simple, fits, works.  Now we can have one charger upstairs and another down stairs. We take the Wii U to our room sometimes so this really helps. Good quality. Better price.
5.0	Good tactics game all around
5.0	This arrived within a day of ordering. Finally installed Christmas morning and everything was so easy to install and begin playing.
5.0	This pokemon game is awesome but I noticed that the picture for it is a fake copy of the game. The real one isnt transparent. The fake copies sometimes dont work so you probably shouldnt buy this one.
5.0	this game is very entertaining and I am happy to have made this purchase at such a reasonable price. RAISE THE BLACK FLAG!!!
5.0	It's like Drake's Uncharted but with melons.  Awesome story line, gameplay, graphics the whole number.  Great replay value as well!
5.0	this is great for playing hardcore games such as MGS peacewalker, Ps one games, and more. the feel is very comfortable and a bonus it can charge ur psp go.
5.0	Official product works great! No power adapter included just the charging stand, you can use the one provided with your original 3DS XL.
5.0	Thank you Saud for this EPIC steel book, I'm going to miss you & Marwan when you head out to the army this Saturday, all the best...:(
5.0	I use this remote with the Mario Kart 8 Racing Wheel...great combination...also used in some of the other games...good control...fast action...well worth the price
5.0	Incredible game. I honestly don't know why I held off so long on picking it up. Storyline, graphics, sound are all probably unmatched at this point in gaming history. The story is gripping (and for fans of the genre, maybe familiar) and the gameplay is intense.
5.0	i have spent almost 200 hours playing this game so far and have not finished the game.  this is the best game i have played in many years,so much fun
5.0	Can I use a GUNCON2 with this game?<BR>I expect this game would be good but I've only played Time Crisis games on PS2 with a GUNCON2. Definately get Time Crisis 2 &amp; 3 for PS2. They are the best games that you can use a GUNCON2 with. They're short(like all GUNCON2 games)but fun. Time Crisis 2 &amp; 3 also have a bunch of extra modes to make them last longer. <br />Suggestion to the designers of this game: make a long GUNCON2 game!
5.0	Great game, best of the franchise. Great game to play for hours of enjoyment. playing as the cops or racers, priceless
5.0	I enjoyed this game so much. Worth buying. =)
5.0	Everything I have(so far) will fit! There is a pocket for the AV cable, the box (of course), controllers, and in the back you can slip in at least two games in the original cases with no problem.<BR>Works for me!
5.0	I recently got the demo, it is ten times as fun as the game that came with it. The First person view gave me a chance to get the hit off the enemy without being seen. I love the hold up feature, this is an easier way to get items. If you aim at the head or the groin, the enemy will scream in fear and give you one or two item boxes.
5.0	Great game, fast shipping.
5.0	I'd heard bad things about this game.  Basically, I'd read that it was GTA all over again.  Car driving, killing, missions spread apart so far that all you do is drive from place to place.  There is some truth to that, but this game is so much more, and has quickly become one of my favorites.  There is a lot of driving, and there is some gunplay, but much more of this game is about stealth, puzzles, and problem solving.  There is a bit of a GTA feel to it, but I also had feelings of Tomb Raider with the puzzles (using one camera to find another to unlock a door, etc).  The side missions are fun, and really stretch the game out.  You can spend hours fighting crime or just wandering around the city.  Graphics are great, controls are accurate and intuitive, and it's really fun to play.  One of my favorite games in a long time.
5.0	"I can officially say that this is the first game I have ever pre-ordered and it was well worth the wait! I have been using the first version as my cardio workout for the past four months and was excited, yet hesitant, for the new one to arrive. The dance moves are definitely faster and more difficult than the first version, with a great new mix of songs. I was intimidated at first, but my 12 year-old daughter and I played each song we selected a couple of times to get the moves down. We ended the session with an exhausting two rounds of Proud Mary...WOW...that one will definitely be a part of my daily workout! I can't wait to try more songs and the \\""Just Sweat It Off\\"" mode tonight to actually measure the calories I'm burning. Burning calories has never been this much fun!"
5.0	Very happy with the product
5.0	Ok I agree the ending left much to be desired but I personally enjoyed the game play and loved most of the story. This game is full of great moments for the mass effect fan. my favorite mission was on tuchanka. The ending isn't great but nothing to boycott EA over. (Though the insistence on there game pass thing for multiplayer has me leaning that way)I still enjoyed the game though. it was dramatic emotional even though the ending didnt live up to the rest of it.
5.0	good condition and working
5.0	MY HUSBAND AND I BOTH ENJOY PLAING THIS GAME. IT IS MORE FUN THAN THE BOARD GAME. IT IS MORE TIME EFFICIENT. WE CAN EITHER PLAY EACH OTHER OR PLAY A COMPUTER PLAYER. IT IS VERY INTERESTING. AND IT HELP WITH SPELLING AND NEW WORDS. I PLAY THIS GAME EVERY DAY,
5.0	I got one from GameFunk LLC here on Amazon and it's so hard to believe it's a refurbished system. It look and perform amazingly spectacular. It came in it's factory box with all the manuals and stuff. Great Work GameFunk.
5.0	These do exactly what they are meant to do. I was skeptical about what these would do for my game play. I read the reviews before my purchase. It stated that they lessen the pull to center of the joystick. That is exactly what they do and make it easier in (COD2) to aim on target while tracking the enemy, especially when they are running. I am really enjoying them and do not think that I will go back to the original joysticks. The shipping from this seller was excellent. They arrived in just 2 business days in perfect condition. I would refer this seller to all.
5.0	I got this game for the xbox 360. It is GREAT.  The graphics are very good and it's extremely fun and challenging.  This game is a bit different from other racing games. You must learn the technique of Drifting to master this game and when you do, it is very entertaining, fun and different than your average racing game.  I highly recommend it.
5.0	My best pokemon generation. It have lots of mini games. Secret bases and contests are my favorite!
5.0	I have a wii, and the one thing I wished Nintendo had done with this was to make it a little less plasticy.  While CM4 doesn't wrap the system with faux-leather (which would be a little freaky) the wrapped controllers are gorgeous.  Yeah....I said gorgeous about a gaming accessory.  Seriously if you have 4 controllers lying around, get 2 red and 2 black covers or just all of one color, whatever.  The bottom line is that having these has oddly made me want to play with my Wii that much more.   Yeah...I said it.
5.0	Amazon has delivered this amazing game spot on. I have been following the AC franchise for quite awhile. With each game they improve in many aspects. I am currently enjoying this, and I look forward to the next AC title.
5.0	"I bought this mouse because my friend has a wireless mouse made by the same brand, Sharkk. It is a great mouse so far, no downsides whatsoever. I used to have a Razer mouse, and my new Sharkk runs circles around it. I will go over some points about this mouse.    Build Quality: This mouse is made of a very durable plastic. The sides, are a textured rigid plastic that is very grippy for your fingers but doesn't make them sweat. The top of the mouse is a smooth dark grey plastic, that I haven't had any problems at all with. All buttons click super well and the scroll wheel is great. 10/10.    Features: This mouse is packed with nice features. It has adjustable DPI, 7 programmable buttons, adjustable weight, 6 LEDs that light up the mouse in 7 different colors, and software to program your buttons and adjust sensitivity. Much more features than my old Razer mouse. 10/10.    Price: For these features, Razer's more expensive mice can't compete. 10/10    Software: This is the weak spot of the mouse. The software is sometimes jumbled, and some things are hard to find. There are also typos, such as \\""sensortivity\\"" instead of \\""sensitivity\\"". It's not bad, just kind of strange. 7/10.    Overall and Conclusion: This mouse is amazing. I am still giving it a five-star despite the software. I definitely would recommend this for my friends, and I think this mouse is currently better than some of the more well known mice. I am definitely hoping to try more of Sharkk's products in the Future! 10/10."
5.0	Used it to help play X-box 360 kinect games on a Epson media projector. I noticed no lag in the digital signal and we ran games for the family for a solid 3 hours. Could of ran longer but the area we rented out was only for 3.5 hours. Any ways the everyone had a blast playing on the kinect set up this way looking forward to doing it again for my Father in law's birthday bash.
5.0	Love it. My son loves this to bad they no longer make games for it. Now we have to get him an Avita
5.0	my controller look sick... i love it. is favorite controll now noone can take, ez to know which one is mine...!!!
5.0	Awesome product for N64 controller. Plenty of length for price.
5.0	One of my sons favorite games.
5.0	I really enjoy the Guitar hero Series, ever since the days of the ps2 the time spent with these games have been time well spent. I still think that number 2 was the best installment, but 5 is worthy of the guitar hero name.    The full customization of every aspect makes this a more approachable title, especially for those who come from a rock band background. I feel the songs picked for this games tend to be less rocky, or even challenging, than the ones on earl-yer versions. But the format and gameplay are the same.     All together this is a good title, I enjoy making my own rockers and songs to play with them. I give this 5 stars and say get it today.
5.0	This is a replacement disk... I already had the game but i wore it out.... im appy to have a new copy... thanks much
5.0	This game was purchased for my 7-year-old, but so far it has also been really fun and interesting for my 5-year-old to play as well (I gathered from reviews and game suggestions that it might be a little old for my kids).  I like that there is a story to follow and that there are both spoken and written dialogue and instructions on the screen.  As my 7-year-old is a newer reader, I am glad that the game is providing some amount of educational stimulation.  So far the boys have been able to work together to do things in the game and they both love switching the different characters at different points in the game.  The boys say the game is &#34;awesome&#34; and &#34;really fun&#34; and &#34;just as good as the Wii LEGO games&#34;.
5.0	Such a cool phone case I can look at it for hours!
5.0	Plays very well, arrived in a timely manner, and I loved playing this as a kid so I had to buy it. Worth the money and the time, shipping and product were great!
5.0	I've been wanting this product for years but honestly had no use for it. I recently became a firefighter and with all the downtime I get it, this was an amazing investment. The pictures do not do this product any justice. The G155 is truly a must have for a gamer who spends a lot of time away from home. Simply perfect.
5.0	my son has had a good time playing this game.
5.0	Great game, I love the story and the whole layout of the game, especially with what they did to Master Chief's armor.<br />Still, i wish the campaign was longer - but then again I guess it could be considered longer if you played it on Legendary.
5.0	These things are fantastic. They look a little awkward at first, but its not about looks. Soon as you put your hand on your controller you'll be asking yourself why this wasn't the way the controller was designed in the first place. These trigger add-ons are extremely easy to install and make a HUGE difference in the playability of the R2 and L2 triggers. A must have item for the PS3 gamer.
5.0	My son loves his XBOX!  He plays his XBOX everyday<br />It looked brand new! I definitely would purchase another one.
5.0	I'm a big fan of the Lego games like StarWars and IndianaJones,<br />as you might know the two metioned titles play themselfs a lot alike which is kind of anoying, the great thing about Lego Batman is that LucasArts wasn't involved, finally we have more possiblities and got rid of the linear lvl structur. The game DOES NOT follow the movies, more like the characters with small references to the movie. It is a bunch of fun though, for kids as well as me 20 yrs old college student. Great game for fans as well as no-batman fans
5.0	This headset works better than a $300 Turtle Beach I purchased at launch of PS4.  Also, it works with XBOX ONE when you purchase an additional adapter.  It is not the same sound quality as you would get from a higher end headset but for the price it exceeded my expectations on every level.
5.0	Love it and was shipped right on time 😃
5.0	Hardcore is the perfect way to describe this game! It's fun and exciting! There's 9 levels that are all fully detailed. Of course best of all you can play it for hours! If you love skating and would like to freestyle skate then this is definetly the game for you! Enjoy!
5.0	These come in handy when you have kids who play too!
5.0	Whoa! This game rules. FFV and its addicting Job system are just awesome. FFVI and its story is just too cool. FFV can be complicated, but once you master it, it rocks. Who cares about the archaic graphics? The games are  too compelling for anybody to care. Definitly, definitly, pick this one up.
5.0	I bought this for my daughter... and.... I ended up hoging it most of the time!  I felt like I was 10 again!  The graphics are better, the device is smaller and portable, but it is just as much fun now as it was then! If you don't have this game, it is a MUST!
5.0	Me gusto mucho la compra se las recomiendo es un buen entretenimiento, fue entregada dentro de los lapsos de tiempo
5.0	I bought this game without any expectations, I barely knew what was it about. I decided to purchase it and i definitely aim the right game. it has everything to be a GOTY. The development of the story is great, special powers and weapons are cooler than any MWF game. It has become my favourite game ever. Dont hesitate to buy this great game.
5.0	Worth every penny! Only dislike is that it's annoying when talking to someone that uses one of these because the buttons are loud.
5.0	I'm not exactly sure what it is about the game that makes me love it, but I'll list a few elements:    1) Nostalgic JRPG/Anime-Feel: This is not going to apply to most folks, but for me there was a feeling in the art, voice acting, and story that just gave a good sense of nostalgia.    2) Graphics: The game is beautiful, it is very difficult to dispute that.  Unless you have an unreasonable hatred for the Anime/Manga style of art, you will probably think the same.    3) Addicting Gameplay: The factors are there.  Getting experience, leveling up, unlocking new Orders and equipment for my squad--I just kept wanting to grind to get my troops to the next level.    4) What-happens-next-syndrome: The game was addicting for more than just leveling up.  I just always wanted to see what the next chapter had in store for Squad 7.    Those are the four biggest factors in my opinion.  The music and other factors are decent, to say the least.    I just really love the game.  I will play through it again to get Rank A on all the battles.  Too bad there aren't any trophies.
5.0	I really wanted to try this game since I am a huge fan of pretty much everything square enix does. People on eBay wanted to screw me over with huge prices for games they had already played and used, but then came Amazon to the rescue! At a great price and got here right on time, this game came sealed and brand-new and frankly it is great! A must-play for everyone with a DS.
5.0	I bought this for my 12 year old daughter. She's exercising all over the house! How can you complain about that :).
5.0	Right fitted and good cover for my Xbox to prevent any regular wear and tear that might be caused from not having a. Case.
5.0	No boubt..this game is the best game ever since PlayStation 1<br />The improvement from the last GTA is huge.<br />I could give it 10 stars if I can
5.0	I had an issue with the cable that came with the game, and no retail stores sell the cable by itself.  It is a great buy and a good quality cable.
5.0	I loved the price for this game so i could not pass it up. The shipping was perfect and it was in the exact condition as it was listed. It was pretty much brand new. I could not tell that someone else had used already. Everything was included and i could not be more satisfied.
5.0	If you are not really sure about purchasing this game and you need a helping hand that tells you more about the game story line,well you better read this prewiew...The game PSO(Phantasy Star Online epi. I & II)its the most AWESOME game experience EVER!!! this game allows you to create a character in which you can change hair color,body shape, well everything. If you buy the game you won't be able to stop playing it, is like you are inside of the game playing all the time!!!! this game for me is the best on markets right now; The graphics (on the Xboxconsole ) are just amazing,there are so many beautiful special effects that, you'll be surprised in about how well done this game is. This game is 100000000 times better than the SEGA version, you should buy this you will never be disappointed about it and you'll love it !!!!!!!! buy it and get ready to have funnnnnnnnnn.....
5.0	What can I say, I have played this game so much I wore out my mouse. I'm sure that if you added up all the time I spent playing this one game it would total at least a week. Anyway, when you add on TFC and Counter Strike you've got hours of kick-a** play, especially if you have a good  connection. Can't wait for TF2 and Opposing Forces.
5.0	You'll love this game if you're interested in racing.  Notice I said racing and not NASCAR!
5.0	Quite nice.<br />Very handy. Well built
5.0	Played a couple times so far and these trainers kick my butt!  I read reviews with freezing issues.  I installed the game, so it mainly runs off the hard drive.  It has not frozen on me yet.  If you want to lose weight or build strength, this game is for you.  If you want to entertain friends, this isn't what you are looking for.  Great addition to my workout routine!
5.0	Correct item. Very very short cord
5.0	Just purchased this game... huge fan of Jordan... his story... his comebacks... I ABSOLUTELY LOVE the Jordan challenges. Just playing them will keep you occupied for hours... I love the Double Nickle part of the game because I watched that game when he came back and it was very memorable for me b/c of everything that was going on w/ him at that time. Game play is lil difficult for what I had been playing (NCAA 2010 by EA Sports), but I can say if nothing else, it is realistic, which takes some getting used to.  Once I got my handle together (and I must say, the control I have w/ my dribble is AMAZING... the moves you can orchestrate under the basket are unparalleled!!  I LOVE THIS GAME and am always looking forward to playing it!!
5.0	Bought for my grandson.  He loves it.
5.0	I love this case. It was well worth the buy because of the protection for my vita and the great headphones I received with the offer. Thanks! Also for the people who care about shipment speed this order came in faster than orders that I ordered before this!
5.0	I know people complained about this game, but the best part is swinging through the city!
5.0	then going to the store and it worked like any other wii wheel but it did take a bit to come in the mail
5.0	I use this thing every day and it is amazing great job genius mods, keep it up because i will be buying mods from you in the future for sure
5.0	Yes, this is one of those &#34;Visual Novel&#34; games that Japan has in abundance.  We get very few of them translated directly, but as soon as I found out about this and what it was kinda about, I just had to get it.<br /><br />And I loved it.<br /><br />The gameplay during any free time is easy, you can go wherever you have available and check things to collect the coins; during the free time you can talk to people and give them gifts to raise their friendship.  You don't have to worry about getting the relationships up in the main story 'cause you have the 2nd game mode that makes that super easy after you beat that main story.<br /><br />The investigations are pretty much straightforward; you can't miss anything.  The trials in the game become easier once you figure out the controls.  I admit that I didn't comprehend the controls AT ALL when the in-game text tutorial was trying to explain it.  It's much easier to use the touch controls during the trail than attempt to use the old PSP version style controls.<br /><br />it's more interesting and fun if you try your best not to spoil the story for yourself;  Figuring out what all happened and laying it out is thrilling and cool than knowing where everything goes and stuff before you get started.<br /><br />There are a few &#34;glitched&#34; trophies, for trophy hunters.  Or perhaps just typo-ed.  There are several trophies that say &#34;every&#34; trial, but really you just have to do the task with one.<br /><br />Now, the 2nd mode of the game.  Oh, I'm really loving the 2nd mode of the game. xD  School mode is really really fun.  It's like a mini-game thing where you assign people jobs and collect stuff in the school to build versions of one demented bear.  It's not at all hard, that game mode, and its a great place to build the relationships that you wouldn't have been able to build in the main game.<br /><br />The game is not for everyone.  It's dark, morbid, and a couple of characters spout foul language.  It's also a really laid-back game game-play wise.  After all, it's a Visual Novel.  The only action you get is when you have to time you shots at contradictions during the trial.  Nothing different and untold happens from the main story, there is only one real diversion in the game's story, so you can't miss anything in the main story.  I haven't finished school mode yet but apparently there are different endings there based on &#34;dates&#34; with the various characters.<br /><br />I'm really glad I bought the game, it made me make use of my underused PSVita.  I'm am patiently awaiting the sequel now, that is supposed to come out at the end of the year.
5.0	We have kept nerf cases on all the Ds's we have owned, and have never had any ds casualties. I highly recommend!
5.0	"Reasons this item is \\""Da Bomb\\"":<br />1. Portable<br />2. Hi-res, hi-color, great contrast screen<br />3. Loud, clear, stereo speakers (along with a headphone jack)<br />4. No streaking or static due to direct hookup to back of PS One<br />5. Looks cool<br />6. Chick magnet..."
5.0	This game is great! It is packed with detailed levels and puzzles. There are loads of side tasks to do as well as the main objective of the game. Very entertaining and fun! :)
5.0	LA Noire got here at a good time and I was happy with the product. I've played it before but it never gets old.
5.0	I just received this system last week and tested it out over the weekend with some used games that I bought.  Everything works great!  All games both NES and SNES worked perfectly.  I thoroughly recommend this product!
5.0	The game is great, so far.  Many new weapons and moves to use.  the graphics are very good.  Looking forward to playing thru the trilogy.
5.0	My grandson loves his Wii, and this added to his enjoyment as he can now play with his friends.
5.0	Bought it for my Grandson and he really like it.  On that fact, I would recommend it to a friend.
5.0	Boys love this! Fun game!
5.0	My kid loves the game and she is having the fun of her life and so are my family amd I
5.0	I owned this game as a little kid and as I grew up some how I sold it. Big regret looking back. But I have it again
5.0	i bought this for my son he sat down 1 day and had it done he said it was great and did what it promised
5.0	My daughter is happy with this console, is very entertaining and its management is really simple, I made a good decision to buy this product
5.0	Resident Evil is a well-established and much loved series of games, more or less in the survival-horror genre. Some of the more recent games of the series (I'm looking at you, Five and Six) have tended to veer more into the action-oriented &#34;shoot hordes of zombies&#34; area than previous Resident Evil games. Revelations, however, tries to mix both flavors into one tasty treat. And, as far as this reviewer is concerned, they did a damn good job.<br /><br />Familiar character Jill Valentine is the main character of the game.  The player controls Jill, with her partner (and new character) Parker Luciano as back-up.  Much of the game is played out on a (mostly) abandoned luxury liner, the Queen Zenobia. The atmosphere of this location is a bit claustrophobic, even in large, open sections of the ship. Combined with the music and sound effects, this heightens the sense of dread that some unholy nightmare is around every corner and crawling in every duct. The ship portions of the game are reminiscent of the older games, with a variety of puzzles and obstacles one must figure out, all the while trying to dodge and/or slay virus-infected zombies.<br /><br />Focus switches from time to time to other characters and locations. We play as Chris Redfield and his partner, Jessica Sharawat, as well as duo Quint and Keith. There is also a flashback sequence starring Parker and Jessica. These off-ship sequences are much more action oriented.<br /><br />One has a fairly standard array of armaments in the game, from hand guns and machine guns to shot guns and rifles, as well as a bladed weapon and a variety of combustibles. The motion controls are also fairly standard; and having the ability to strafe and do a quick turn and dodge become very helpful. A new component in Revelations is the Genesis.  With this, one can do a bio-scan of enemies (which also can generate herbs) but also locate hidden items and hand prints. Hand prints are the collectable of the game - there are 30 in total.<br /><br />You'll notice that Resident Evil: Revelations is for the 3DS (for now - other consoles will soon be getting Revelations as well). How's the 3D? Well, I must admit I very rarely use the 3D component with any game, but RE seems to use it well.<br /><br />In addition to the story line, there are additional features. One may play missions, either solo or with an online friend and unlock achievements, weapons, and costumes.  Also, once you have completed the game, you can play a new game + and retain your weapons and ammo (and hand prints)<br /><br />All things considered, Resident Evil: Revelations is a compelling portable horror experience. It's a great deal of fun and very satisfying to play. And, it'll scare the pants off you.
5.0	great price for all ages,mkes for family fun
5.0	This game is a wonderful form of entertainment.  You're part of the fairy godmother's family and you have to rebuild her empire from the ground up.  You face comical opponents like the NSH (Not-So-Hansome)Princes,  who is headed by Prince Combover.  It is a very funny game and you get to help fairy tale creatures as well in some pop up scenerios.  As you advance through the levels, it definetly becomes more challenging.  You are also able to upgrade a lot throughout the game.  The tutorial was a big help.  Fun fun fun!!!
5.0	Step son loved said it was scary
5.0	"Love it!  Not only is this a game but you are \\""in\\"" the game and its a great work out!  I have purched the Dance Central Game and I feel sexy doing the moves and I love the pictures at the end of the games. (SO funny) I am a working mother and never liked going to the gym after work (I would feel guilty) Now I can go home and do these games with my son and we get bonding time plus some great excersize!  I would strongly recommend this to anyone!  Our family loves it and so will yours!  Great work Xbox360!"
5.0	Gift to Grandson!  He loves the gift!
5.0	It's Kingdom Hearts 2, what more can I say? Run through Disney stories wielding a giant key like a sword on ravenous shadows intent on making you one of them, and a secret organization that wants to use you for some mysterious reason. What's not to love?
5.0	Bought this as a Christmas gift for my friend's son, and he was bouncing off the walls.  The array of characters makes this well worth the price.
5.0	I was quite excited when I got this game at the midnight release and I've been playing it a great deal since. I realize this game just came out but I feel that I have enough experience to review the game. Obviously if people waited to review this game after they beat it, we would be waiting a long time.     To sum it up, this game is incredibly fun. From duels, to hunting wanted criminals, to taking a nightshift watch in a local town, the choice of taking criminals dead or alive, the ability to shoot them in the knee... watching them crawl and grasp for their life then sauntering up to them and blowing their brains out with a special finishing move that is unique to each gun, to even unlocking outfits that each produce a special ability. And of course the Dead Eye, taking out multiple targets in slow mo is riveting, especially while on a horse. You can even play poker, gamble, and basically just whatever the heck you want. The morality system is also excellent, the choices and decisions you make will have an everlasting impact. The possibilities are endless.    I do agree that the controls take some getting used to, but definitely dont take away from the game. So far the plot line is keeping me hooked and the beautiful graphics are just pure eye candy to look at. I will be honest and say that I have not tried the multiplayer yet.    Obviously I cant give you an in depth review of the game because that would fill 10 pages easy. I have summed up the main points and my opinion of the game so far. I hope this has helped.
5.0	What is to be said that hasn't already been said by others?  If you enjoy creating a character and launching into the exploration of an open world full of quests, dangers to overcome and a &#34;special&#34; past to discover, this is the state-of-the-art.
5.0	Amazing game. Nothing feels better than jumping out of a helicopter onto a sky scraper, the sky scraper starts to crash beneath you, you jump off and parachute onto an enemy and shoot him in the head. Great fun.  Also, elevator wars are too much fun.  One thing I would love to see in the next Battlefield, is an even larger server.  Most of the excitement is all the chaos. Bring on more chaos!!
5.0	Plugged it in and it works like a charm. The cable was around $11 and more than long enough to make the connection between my TV and PS3.
5.0	"I'll admit, after my first play through I was kind of upset. I thought I invested all that time in the previous two Mass Effect games and felt cheated. But then I started to realize other possible endings to the game. I honestly couldn't have come up with a better, unique ending. It certainly made people think about it (look at all the drama even now). If we were just given the ending we wanted then we probably just forget about the game. But today I still remember clearly how the game ended and will probably remember it forever. So i guess the ending was successful after all.<br /><br />Ohh and just wanted to point out how dumb that same ending different colors argument is. TBH was anything in Mass Effect really drastically different if you made a different choice? What did you guys expect? Ending A=good Enging B=Bad Ending C=neutral ???<br />Im sure most people would have gotten with the \\""good\\"" ending. No matter what choices you made in Mass Effect 1 the ending turned out to be basically the same. Same goes for Mass Effect 2. Nothing different here."
5.0	This game plays great! I really like the soundtrack and atmosphere of this game.
5.0	This is a great game. It has awesome graphics and an even better storyline. Some of the explosion look fake, though. There is a great variety of guns that you can use in one player or multiplayer combat. Buy this game!!!
5.0	I have been using my 5.1 surround sound for quite a while and love it.  Now that we have a baby I had to go to something more quiet.  I love the quality of this thing and the fact that I can hear my own voice so I can tell if I am being to quiet or loud when I talk to people.  Surround sound seems to work great.  No problems with static, but I'm only about 5 feet from the base.
5.0	Great game for all ages highly recommend
5.0	Works great. Better quality than my other amiibos. Love the in game gear and challenges.
5.0	I was walking through the store the other day when I stumbled upon this gem.  I picked it up and immediatly brought it home, and proceeded to dive right into it.  I was immediatly greeted with a tale out of Japanese (Shinto) folklore. <br /> <br />I was mainly suprised because I had heard of the Japanese game, but had not heard that any US company was translating it.  The translation is excellent, although they committed the usual sin of shortening some of the more complex japanese names for people, places, and gods. <br /> <br />You control the sun Goddess (genderless in the game) who has come down in the form of a wolf to rid Japan of a demonic curse of darkness.  I'll give you a basic rundown on what to expect from the game in what I consider a few key areas. <br /> <br />The Good: <br /> <br />-  Graphics:  The graphics are simply amazing.  Its almost like the whole game is in the visual style of the old Japanese ink brush paintings.  The vivid colors and light vs. dark playing off each other are beautiful.  They might not be ultrarealistic, but they are amazing to watch. <br /> <br />-  Sound:  The sound in the game is absolutely amazing in all details EXCEPT the gibberish used for interaction with people (gets annoying after a while).  The traditional japanese music and the other sounds in the game add to the experience. <br /> <br />-  Story:  Imagine taking characters from tons of Japanese folklore, various stories from the folklore, and then rolling them all into one big fight to restore the island of Japan to beauty.  I don't want to spoil any of it for you, but suffice it to say I am looking into getting a book on Shinto folklore. <br /> <br />- Gameplay:  I am going to split gameplay into two parts.  first is the basic adventure style gameplay.  You control a wolf.  You can run and the longer you run the faster you will start running.  You can jump, and even double jump off of a wall.  You can headbut things.  Its your basic adventure controls but in thecontext of controlling a wolf.  I won't go into it much except to say that it controls very well, and is very comfortable to use.  I've played some games where it was more frustrating to control and it detracted from the game, this is not one of them. <br /> <br />Second is the Celestial Brush controls.  You'll notice a lot of the world is outlined in black.  This is because you can hit R1 and use your brush powers at any time in the game.  The game tilts and its like you're staring at a frame out of the game drawn with the japanese brush and ink.  The amazing part is you can control the brush with the analog stick and touch it to the paper with Square.  This allows you to paint, and depending on what you paint various things happen in the game world.  This goes from repairing bridges and water-powered mills, to bringing gusts of air to power windmills, to slashing through enemies or rocks, on through a total of 13 special powers.  It controls very well, and the switch between the regular game and the painting is instantaneous.  It gives you the feeling you're really controlling a god in the form of a wolf.
5.0	the product is exactly as marketed. it is useful for adapting audio with headsets and other third party devices. recommend this item
5.0	Great game!  It brings a fighting system similar to the Arkham game series, with the environment of an assassins creed game all in one.  I like to think of it as if Arkham and the assassins creed franchises had a baby in Middle Earth.  It also brings an interesting story to the table and expands the Lord of the Rings universe.
5.0	When I first heard about the pedal breaking under heavy use, I started to look online for solutions. The most recommended was this. So far, I've noticed the pedal feels much sturdier and I don't worry about it breaking anymore. I don't think I could be happier. The new hinge is great, much more resistant than the original. Overall, if you're looking for a way to make your pedal feel more responsive AND prolong it's life, I don't think there's a better way than Pedal Metal's solution.
5.0	My young nephew can play this game, because there's no volience (his mother would have a fit if it was)  and for me as i get more parts , the game gets harderwith each new level awlsome game !!!!  but i enjoy playing it.  and my cat likes the music  lol....
5.0	There is no better console for multiplayer than Nintendo, especially with titles like Goldeneye, Perfect Dark, Mario Party, and of course Smash Bros. <br />My friends and I have spent many an hour playing this game, deep into the twilight hours. It's amazing that a game that is so simple can be so insanely fun and addicting. Don't let the Nintendo label and the colorful cartoony character decieve you either, this game can get intense. It isn't easy, try going solo with three level 9 Samus' and try to tell me that this is an easy game. All of the characters are pretty equal in skill as well, even Kirby and Jigglypuff pack a punch (Kirby especially). <br />The most fun comes from Smash Brothers however when you and three of your friends go at it. Their is never a lag in action either, it's constant battle. <br />Buy this game and get your friends together because this game is very fun, very challenging, and very addicting. <br />And Captain Falcon reigns supreme!
5.0	Kids love the songs on this one
5.0	Very good price, the 2 video games are excellent but certainly skyrim is the best 100% Guaranteed!!! . I am very happy with this purchase! ! UUUUUUUUF!
5.0	Great RPG and the open world is great.  If you love zombie games this is for you.  Supplies are easy to find
5.0	I am an OLD TIME gamer, and I have learned over the YEARS to be patient and wait when new games come out. For the last 6-8 years they ALWAYS PUSH THEM OUT TO SOON. So you are paying $60 for a BETA VERSION of a game, FULL of bugs! ! !<br /><br />I bought mine in MID January, got it for $30 and I have had almost ZERO problems with it. So for me most of the bugs have been worked out AND I got it for HALF PRICE. I did the SAME with Battlefield 3. In case you don't remember they had PLENTY of bugs and problems with it as well, when it first came out. I waited, got it for $39 and NO BUGS...<br /><br />Doesn't matter WHO IT IS TODAY!!  They HYPE the program or game to B.S. you and deceived you into buying IT NOW, &#34;IT'S THE LATEST AND GREATEST...&#34; Battlefield or CoD or Microsoft Operating System or whatever that they have EVER PRODUCED!!
5.0	You know, ever since Final Fight arrived to arcades and home consoles, there have been lots and lots of games trying to imitate its gameplay ever since. This is one of those games that succeeded with that kind of gameplay, mainly because, well, it's by Capcom, the same company that made Final Fight in the first place.<br /><br />Like a Capcom beat 'em up should, the game contains 2-Player co-op, great gameplay that involves intense button-mashing, and incredible graphics and sound. Unlike Final Fight, though, Captain Commando has a more reasonable difficulty. You could probably make it above level 5 on your first try (Especially if you're a fan of this genre).<br /><br />Unfortunately, the game is clearly overpriced on Amazon (Almost 50 bucks? What?!). If you can find the game at a store or something, DEFINITELY buy this.
5.0	This is the best PS3 controller out there. My original PS3 controller came without the Dualshock technology, so when it came time to purchase more controllers I bought 2 of these. The battery life is well over 4 hours of continuous use, and the games offer good support for rumbling when they should. If you are looking for a rumble controller, I recommend purchasing the authentic Sony PS3 controllers such as these, and avoid the fake controllers out there. It is worth the premium, plus 1 controller is less than 1 game these days, so don't skimp on a cheap controller.
5.0	Wow I was hoping to receive a new game boy micro in a new condition but hey it's brand new and the japan version all black !!! It works great as well an look beautyfull! Awesome product!
5.0	I’ve tried to think about how to describe/classify this game.  Here’s my best attempt: an open-world, free-running, adventuring brawler with a unique platforming twist.<br /><br />The TLDR:<br />The game has challenging, but very fun mechanics that are intended to be mastered.  For me this was the point of the game: it’s fun to play.  If you like challenging and highly manual mechanics that are super effective once learned, this game is for you.  If you prefer a bit more automation in your mechanics and enjoy other parts of a game besides the controls and mechanics, this may not be for you.<br /><br />The Expanded Analysis:<br />Whether you’re in a challenge, a mission, or just messing around, it is a blast to run, fly, and slide around the world in this game.  The adventure is really fun and is filled with enjoyable and challenging combat.  The gravity control mechanic is really cool and makes for some unique open-world platforming.<br /><br />What I love most about this game is the mechanics.  That is the emphasis of this game: it’s fun to play and fun to learn.  Sure, the story is fine, the game is nice to look at, etc., etc., etc.; but, the point of this game is its gameplay (my personal favorite thing in a game).  This may be good or bad for each individual.<br /><br />In a game like Assassin’s Creed, free-running in the open world is fairly automated.  Sure, there’s jumping and gadgets to control, but, for the most part, you hold down the ‘free-run’ button and much is taken care of.  Even in combat there’s a fair amount of scripting and automation.  That is very different in Gravity Rush: you have to control much more of your free-running (or free-flying) and auto-targeting is limited in combat.  This may please some and displease others.<br /><br />In that way, Gravity Rush reminds me indirectly of Shadow of the Colossus in that the controls feel very manual.  This is true of many Japanese games that have a focus on mechanics (i.e., the latest PS3 Gundam game).  You feel very in control, but it takes some patience to learn and master the mechanics.<br /><br />There’s not a lot of hand-holding with these mechanics either.  There are a bunch of challenges (my favorite part of the game) that teach you the mechanics and how to handle certain situations (good combat combos, good platforming techniques, etc.), but they are not step-by-step tutorials: you have to discover what works by yourself in order to get gold medals in the challenges.  This allows you to create your own unique play style even if you end up doing things the creators clearly intended.<br /><br />The game has plenty of content, has an enjoyable quest, has fun side missions (my favorite part), looks and runs great on Vita, and is a blast to pay.  I highly recommend it, but I also recommend people be aware of the existence of intentionally manual and challenging (but satisfying!) mechanics.
5.0	When you attatch your gba to your gamecube, pokemon r/s is supposed to unlock an adventure mode that allows you to catch the oldies.
5.0	They're styli, or many styluses. I'm not sure which it is. But there are many in this box, in several different colors and they're all a little sparkly when you look up close. They seem to bea bit sturdier than the one that came with my 3ds.
5.0	This game truly exceeded my expectations! It is without a doubt the most amazing fps game on any system. The ending is kinda weak but the Xbox Live play is amazing!!
5.0	Ok, first, let me get one thing out of the way.<br />The xbox 360 controller was probably one of the best, if not the best, gaming pads I have ever had the privilege to use. Even after all these years on market, it never gets old.<br /><br />Now, the X1 controller is, without a doubt, a new standard in the xbox's line-up of controllers. I have bought this one from gamestop and it's in my home, ready to be played with the xbox one, so this review is a summary of using the controller from all of the events that I have attended (xbox one tours, microsoft store xbox one events, e3, gamescom, etc.) so I have had a fairly lengthy time using the controller. The ergonomics are simply brilliant as the controller fits snugly in your hand and it is a bit smaller and tighter so all the buttons are more easily reachable.<br /><br />One of the best things about the new controller is the impulse triggers feature. Oh, man. These things are just great. They said that they integrated a whole bunch of tiny rumble parts so that when you shoot a weapon, drive a car, run in a game, etc.- whatever you do in a game will match the action to the rumble feedback for more realism. I tried this out with forza and man, this is a world of difference. This feature alone would warrant this controller 5 stars, but the improved grip on the thumbsticks, the more fluid trigger-to-button layout, and the removal of the battery pack bulge on the back add even more value to this controller.<br /><br />Now, the last thing I have to mention. The D-pad has been finally fixed. It now rests in a depressed setting at the same location as the x360 controller, but now the D-pad is designed to work flawlessly with fighting games and other games that rely more on the D-pad. I tried this out with killer instinct at one of the events and it worked wonders. Huge, huge improvement over the xbox 360 D-pad (which was just awkward).<br /><br />Overall, the Xbox One controller is brilliant, already piling more improvementsand features on top of an already awesome xbox 360 controller.<br />The improved D-pad, innovative impulse-triggers feedback mechanism, insanely comfortable grip and ergonomics, and other tiny little things make the Xbox One controller a great new addition to the Xbox family of controllers.<br />Oh, and that sweet looking Xbox logo at the top looks slick as ever.<br /><br />Hopefully, my impressions/review helped any of you guys and gals out.<br />Peace and game on.
5.0	my son has not stopped playing this since i got it for him on his 6th bday. its been almost 4 months and he is soo good at the game. :) its easy to play yet hard enough to give him a challenge at the same time. i definitely get the cool mom award for this one!
5.0	THANK YOU FOR THE GREAT DELIVER TIME AND NO SCRATCHES AND WORKS GREAT THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING YOU ARE THE BEST
5.0	great product, great price, fast shipment.
5.0	I honestly expected it was going to break eventually based on other reviews but steelseries needs to use higher quality materials for this product in-particular because I haven't heard any bad issues about the majority of their other products. The wire started to break from the part that goes into the controller, The cable that is used is very stiff which isn't good for something which needs to go into the controller, as it makes it more susceptible to being dropped or broken. When It still worked I was able to use it all the time everyday with out any problems. Other than me accidentally bumping it and shifting it out of the controller. The sound quality was on par with the Turtle Beach X12 which I bought from amazon as well. I would recommend Besides the stiffness of the cable I found it to be a useful product for the time I had using it.
5.0	"I won't be reviewing the game itself, as you can get a review anywhere, including here.<br /><br />So I will be reviewing the contents of the collector's edition itself.<br /><br />The box is small. This will not be a \\""huge collector's edition.\\"" It's supposed to be \\""brushed-aluminum\\"" patterned. The cardboard box does look like brushed aluminum. However the surface is soft, and the finish will scratch very easily.<br /><br />The front of the box is a lenticular window. You will see the combadge inside it, and it makes it look like it's part of the box's artwork. When you open the magnetic clasp flap, you will see it set on a black background. It's a pretty nice display.<br /><br />The combadge is nice, and is made out of metal. It's the 25th century combadge, however, as depicted in the game. So if you're expecting a TNG, or Voyager-style combadge, don't look here. When the game was $10 or less, the price was worth it for the combadge alone.<br /><br />The free passes included are no longer valid, as the game is now F2P. However, they are heavy plastic cards, with three together unseparated. The artwork on the front of them is one of the newer classes of ship Cryptic designed. They would strangely be nice as a framed piece.<br /><br />The artbook included is attached to the disc case. The case's flaps are cardboard, and inside the first flap is the artbook. I find this cheap in a way, because the artbook is not separate from the case. So you can't leave the artbook out unless you leave the case out, as well. I honestly didn't flip through the artbook much, so I can't comment on the quality of the images. I do like artbooks, I just haven't paid this one's much attention yet.<br /><br />The in-game items are nice, however none of them cannot be obtained with a purchase on the in-game store. So you are essentially saving money by getting this edition, and getting them in the game.<br /><br />At this point, the best thing to do is to buy the collector's edition when it comes back down to a reasonable level ($20), and put it on your account. Not only will you get one month of gold membership (subscriber), you will retain some of the subscriber's bonuses after your free one month trial is over, and you will gain several items which would end up costing you just as much on the in-game store.<br /><br />Note, even if you already have an account, and are already playing, you can still apply a collector's edition game key to your account."
5.0	only downside is that main story is kinda short. my 6 year old nephew beat it in 2 days. but tons of unlockable characters adds alot of replay value. a must have for any marvel or lego fan. great for all ages
5.0	Great for those of us still rocking the original GameCube controllers. So far they all four seem to be working fine.
5.0	It's a Bioshock game. Is there anything else that needs to be said? The switch to third person fit the story well and overall I thought it helped the plot feel slightly more complex. I also enjoyed the addition of Elizabeth's character as she added fun advantages to the gameplay. While I typically despise DLC, I must admit I'm curious about what the developers will do with it in this case. It looks like it may be similar to Batman: Arkham City in that the DLC kept the story going instead of being cheap filler.
5.0	"I am a 45-year-old  who has been working out on a regular basis for 30 years. I walk, run, do step aerobics, and swim, in addition to using my Wii for fitness. I am in pretty good shape.  I purchased Gold's Gym Dance Workout to shake up my routine and I'm really glad I did!   When you first start the game, you can choose to create a profile and an avatar and then choose a personal trainer.  Your trainer will ask you what your fitness goals are and then select a program for you, based on your goals. The first workout was a \\""light\\"" one, according to the trainer.  It was relatively short, but even though I was still learning the routines, it really got my heartrate up. If you want a longer workout, you can select the \\""My Workout\\"" option and pick from a number of prepared workouts or create your own. Some of the moves are a little tricky, but after several times through, you get the hang of them.  If you are having trouble with a particular move, you can select that part of the routine, once you've finished, and the game will break the move down and let you practice it again.  If you've done any type of aerobics class, you should be able to follow most of the moves in this game.  However, you will probably want to work your way up to the advanced routines.  I haven't done anything beyond intermediate, and I'm still getting a good workout.  I like the fact that I will be challenged for awhile.  That makes the purchase worthwhile to me.  Another thing that I like about this game is the use of multiple controllers. If you have multiple remotes, you can use two of them at one time. I think this makes the game play better because the movements of both arms will be more accurately tracked. There is also an option to use the Wii balance board for some of the activities and for weighing in. You do not have to have the balance board to play this game, however.  In short, if you are looking for a new workout plan for the new year and you like to dance, buy this game."
5.0	Great game for those who want to THINK. Easy to learn and always keeps you on your toes.
5.0	A great little carrying pouch with 8-bit Legend of Zelda design. Pretty sturdy even after a few months of use and holds six game carts and a spare stylus. My 3DS XL and Nintendo DS Lite each will fit in it. Not easily visible from the pictures is that the zippers are actually the other two Triforces, while Link holds up one.
5.0	Twisted metal black online plays very well online. I had a chance to play it when the servers were up and it ran smooth. There is no story, just online mayhem. It felt almost like back in the day playing split screen on Twisted metal 2. Only bigger, better graphics and more players. The servers are down now but some die hard fans still get on to play using PCSX2 and other similar programs. If your a big fan of twisted metal its worth the hassle.
5.0	ok first off great game award winning eh not so sure only reason it won 2010 award cause god of war ghost of sparta came out real late in the year that would have won hand s down not taking away mgpw acheivement still a great game graphic are great stortline great love the game but i would have voted for gwgs
5.0	product was delivered as promised.  Not easy to use if you have rechargable batteries, but the kids enjoy the color.
5.0	This combo was well worth the price and the game is a hit w/ my kids and I!
5.0	This product is great for all your charging needs. It is a car charger, wall charger, usb charger, and extra batter charger... ALL IN ONE! If you don't like carrying that bulky wall charger the PSP comes with then this is for you. It's very compact and the usb charge cable is retractable. I'd say the only drawback to this is that the usb charger takes really long to charge the PSP compared to the wall charger, other than that this a great product.
5.0	ok it has PITFALL and PITFALL II the only reason I bought this in the first place..<br /><br />my only problem with it is I have yet to find an option to turn off the new 80s music soundtrack they've added over the original game music.. that gets kind of annoying.. like yuo're playing your old 2600 with the stereo on...<br /><br />now if ony we had MOM' I'M THIRSTY BRING ME SOME KOOL AID... .GET YOUR OWN KOOL AID... being yelled over it ocasionally..<br /><br />but It's worth it just for the two above mentioned games.. though KEYSTONE KAPERS was one of my faves as well
5.0	I bought this game for my daughter who has been playing the Harvest Moon games for years and loves them.  She loves this one too and has hardly put it down since Christmas.
5.0	"RE outbreak is quite simply the resident evil that fans have been waiting for. the game DOES NOT have an on-line fee for those of you wondering. The game re-traces the events of re2-3 only this time it's through the eyes of ordinary citizens. If you are new to the RE series, this is not the game for you however(try RE1 for game cube) for a number of reasons. one being the story line, and another being the over-all difficulty of the game- this is one of the more challenging resident evils. If you are a fan you will easilly recognize familar locations, items and monsters scattered throught the game, along with the story line. this is mostly a clasic RE game with a couple of changes(i.e. zombies break down doors and are faster, the game does not pause at the invintory screen, you work in a team- not solo, and oh-yeah...IT'S ONLINE!), which, in my opinion greatly increase the game's difficulty, realism and over-all suspence. As most people know, the big deal about this game is that its the first RE thats online, but if you don't have Broadband or OL for your ps2, don't hesitate to try out the game, as the one player game is just as good(if not better) and packed with TONS of replay value, including pictures, stills, fmvs, extra outfits, difficulties, new scenarios, and other little extras that fans will appreciate(newbies might not find them as cool though...). In short, this is a game that features a diverse cast of characters, an awesome story line, plenty of susspence, lots of re-playability, and a neat online function. For those that say that on-line communication is bad, it simply adds to the experience. If the game featured voice chat(instead of ad-libs) people would just talk about daily things, not the game. By doing things the way they did, Capcom created an \\""online resident evil,\\"" instead of a resident evil game with \\""online chat\\"""
5.0	Great follow-up to Guitar Hero III.  I won't buy new guitars, so I don't have the slider functionality, but there are a lot of great songs in this game and a lot most customization than GH3.
5.0	Excellent delivery and I love the product I have no other issues with this product. I is exactly what I expected and need.
5.0	This game is if im right the last Jill Valentine Adventure which makes me mad but this game is excellent. Ive beaten it 17 times and still like it. You get to kill infected zombies use cool weapons and lots of other neat junk. And when you beat the game you get a game called Mercenaries. And you get a key for new dresses. The Goal in the game is to kill Nemeses who is a guenie pig infected with the G-Virus not T. The T virus is the one that makes people zombies. You will team up with 3 of Umbrellas BioHazard Forces Mercenaries and kill everything and risk everything to escape Raccoon City. But on the way, one of your umbrella buddies admits he is a supervisor and trys to escape alone betraying you and your friends. But he dies and so does someone else. This game is so much fun but you have to find everything on your own you cant just goto a shop and ask for ammo cause everyone workin there are zombies. Youll love this game i just know yall will.
5.0	I am a long time voyager fan, I have every episode and every voyager book, so when i saw Voyager: Elite Force, i was one of the first people to go out and buy it last year. and i am glad that I did. It is without a doubt the best Star Trek game created. the graphics are slick, the levels are fun to play and the overall mission is one that really gets you involved in the game. It is linked to the hit TV show in more than one way. with chell trying to win Tuvok's respect and more. The original game is great, but the Xpansion Pack is just as good, it has a virtual voyager mission, a few new holodeck scenarios and adds a few new and interesting elements to the original game. In the original Game, Seven of Nine is played by someone else but Jeri finally decided to do the vioceovers and there is a patch in the Xpansion Pack. You should have a 800mhZ minimum processor with at least a good graphics card, 256mb RAM minimum and a good 5.1 sound setup to fully appreciate the game though. If you like watching Voyager or want to get a good startrek game, buy Star Trek: Voyager - Elite Force. You will not regret it. Live long and prosper!
5.0	great Product , no problems
5.0	It's beautiful! Worth every penny!
5.0	Christmas gift for my husband. It was a surprise and sure winner as I knew he loved the first few Borderlands games. As the wife, Borderlands is one of the few that's not annoying to watch or have in the background while doing something else in the living room.
5.0	Work amazing for running recon in Battlefield 4. The best thing to get if you enjoy 24/7 sniping like i do. The convex shape works better for rolling your thumbs when sniping as opposed to that concave shape that slips out every now and again.
5.0	Bought it for my teen age son and he greatly enjoys it.  I would not hesitate to recommend it to everyone with teens.
5.0	this is one of the few games released in recent memory which features a fully-realized world and conflict that is so masterfully done that you forget that it is a combo-heavy hack-and-slash title which tours the greatest hits of the genre. never once did i come across an area which felt like it was simply a hallway filled with things to kill, and obvious destructible elements because they saturate each area with both style and story elements which support the suspension of disbelief - a great example would be a conversation between Vergil and Dante which utilized background graffiti to illustrate and underscore the conversation. That being said, the storyline plays out much like some elements from V for Vendetta, with an emphasis on excesses of consumption - whether it is political ideology, food and drink, vanity or power.<br /><br />the controls are tight and the combos feel solid, with the ability to jump between three distinct fighting styles on-the-fly. graphically, the game looks pretty good, having been built on the always popular Unreal Engine. There is a distinct twist at the end which felt under-realized, but as i understand, the DLC fills in that noticeable gap.
5.0	I play kingdom hearts for a while. i try the ps3 version and it is great. graphic improve, story longer.
5.0	here's my problem, i enjoy racing games but am horrible at them.  anything beyond mario kart, i'm lost.  i have played the PSP version before, but never the PS3, so take that into consideration.....  loving this game. huge improvements over the PSP version.  first off, the controls, hugely refined and definitely feel more in control.  no longer feel like i'm forcing around the track with the sluggish PSP control.  with everything this game offers, this is the mario kart-esque experience i've been wanting.  the biggest part of this is the track creation.  i've learned from the previous title, as well as little big planet, that i was definitely never meant for any kind of level development in gaming.  anything i have tried to create has always turned out an unplayable mess.  now, with the tracing, touch screen track creation.......it even makes my tracks seem compotent, which is amazing and a huge feet.  add on to that the option of auto-populating your track, and i was racing on my creation within minutes.  your not going to get a deep racing experience out of this.  but, if like me, you want/need that casual/arcadey racing, this is a must.  also, with the track creation and being able to download tracks from other people, to say this game has replayability is an understatement.  worth picking up at full price.
5.0	for starters you get a veriety of wepons such as a spear , torch,boders,my personel faverite the soel reaver it self you all so learn severeal tecnics like how to swim and climb walls throwing enimy on spikes is fun to
5.0	I bought a pair of TB X12's and found out about the DSS later, I then purchased the DSS as it's 7.1 vs 5.1 in the DSS2, I wouldn't know how the DSS compares to the DSS2 though I can say that I am thoroughly impressed with the DSS! I can hear new sounds I've never heard before and it really immerses me into the game! I would highly recommend this to anyone thinking about getting them as it is well worth it and you can hear/tell where people are at in relation to where you're at!
5.0	"Wii Fit Plus has more \\""games\\"" to play. There's a calorie counter, which is nice to help get an idea of how hard you're working.  Wii Plus has the option for the strength training and yoga that doesn't involve waiting for each one to load separately. Which gives you more exercise in less time. If you can keep at it, it's worth it."
5.0	My son got it for Christmas and now I don't get to play my xbox anymore...he would like to be able to build airplanes that really fly though...
5.0	The King of All Cosmos has gone and destroyed all of the stars in the galaxy.  Rather than fixing the mess himself he seeks his son, the Prince, who is only 3 cm high, to go to Earth and roll virtually anything up into giant balls (called katamaris) to replace the shimmer of the night sky.  Anything means, well, anything:  caramels, tacks, mice, spiders, dogs, plants, darumas, flower clocks, sidewalk chalk drawings, floating toys, sunflowers, people, buildings, whirlpools, sea creatures, rainbows.  Anything.<br /><br />Katamari Damacy embodies this premise, which is a product of Japanese humor and quirkiness.  While following this story a side story of a human family plays out involving the children witnessing strange phenomena, their oblivious mother, and their father returning from a space mission.  Strangely enough the daughter proclaims &#34;Oh!  I feel it!  I feel the cosmos!&#34;  whenever your katamari restores a constellation.  The whole katamari situation on their planet just doesn't seem like a huge deal.<br /><br />Control-wise this game is very easy to pick up and play.  The game plays almost completely with only the analog sticks.  The Prince can push the katamari, walk around it, jump to the other side of it, float above it, and charge it up for a dash to plow through whatever's in the way.  The katamari can only pick up objects smaller and/or lighter than itself; bumping into looming walls or (seemingly) giant objects will cause the katamari to stop and maybe lose some objects.  As the katamari picks up more items it gets bigger, allowing objects that were once too big to stick right on and enjoy the ride.  This is what makes the gameplay so satisfying.  The fact that one starts by picking up caramels and erasers, moves on to teddy bears and shovels, and works their way up to humans (all in one level) feels like an accomplishment and allows for some revenge.  That bear that was walking around and kicking the tiny katamari is now fodder for the boulder-like mass rolling behind as it tries to flee.  Humans and objects that served as walls during the beginning can get plucked off the ground in a small amount of time as the katamari grows.  It's easy to develop a god complex when the planet is at the mercy of an evolving katamari.<br /><br />A notable mention for Katamari Damacy should go towards the music.  All of the tracks mainly consist of original, in-house compositions, and most of the songs that play during the levels are about (surprisingly) rolling things up.  The music is insanely catchy; some tracks are electronic compositions, some are jazz ditties, others sound like pop songs, and there's even a track with a children's group singing in Japanese.  Nothing sounds more suitable while a society is subjected to the threat of being rolled up and sent to space.<br /><br />In addition to the core gameplay there are also hidden Royal Presents in each level to collect.  If a player manages to snag a Royal Present and pass the level the Prince will receive an accessory to wear during gameplay, such as a scarf or antenna.  The most practical one is the camera, which allows the player to take screenshots during gameplay.  The game also keeps track of everything you roll up, categorizing objects by size, theme, etc.  It'll take a lot of rolling to achieve the full collection, ranging from matchboxes to skyscrapers.  The Prince may also view the stars and constellations created by completing the levels.  At first the night sky looks a little barren, but as the game progresses shining stars fill the voids and instill a sense of fulfillment.<br /><br />There is nothing else quite like Katamari Damacy.  Why should anyone roll sticky balls around Earth and send the final result into the night sky?  Because it's a very original and fun idea that anyone can pick up and try.  The simple controls, engrossing gameplay, catchy music, weird story, and odd assortment of objects on this very planet together create a game that is unique and remarkable.  This is a game that is meant to be taken lightheartedly; in Japan &#34;Katamari Damacy&#34; translates to &#34;Clump Spirit.&#34;  Validation is achieved in the beginning as the katamari nabs hordes of dice and sushi.  A sense of nurturing develops as it grows bigger and absorbs bigger objects, like furniture and animals.  The feeling of superiority flourishes as vehicles rise up from the pavement and people scuttle away from their round, tumbling fate.  But nothing trumps the entitlement bestowed to whomever sucks up cities, land, oceans, giant creatures, and nature - essentially the planet - into the mix, a feat that demonstrates mastery over the art that is Katamari Damacy.
5.0	As an adult DS Lite fan i was looking for a case to not only hold my many games but also my 2 systems. This baby fit the bill perfectly. I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a high quality DS Lite case.    Just a note. It's a little smaller that it looks. Really nice and portable but holds a ton of gear.
5.0	delivered quickly and works fine -
5.0	The kids and I are now playing with band-aids on our fingers! This great fun and a great way yo get started playing the guitar. I have probably pick a guitar 30 times started to learn a little then drop it. This has kept things interesting, fun, and easy to practice.
5.0	Perfect fit to the 3ds. Actually was kind of hesitant to buy it at first but it turned out great!! Really helps not cramp up your hands while playing. It arrived pretty fast too. Definitely recommended. Five stars!
5.0	Works great! This package comes with 2. I only needed 1 for my right analog stick. So, my daughter got to add to her controller as well. We both love them.
5.0	This is the Ninja Gaiden we know and love; fast and fluid combat, severed limbs, pointless and nonsensical plot, and awesome weapons and combos.  I played the original Ninja Gaiden 3 and promptly put the controller in disappointment of the downgraded combat.  The developers redeemed themselves with this version.  The combat has been restored to its former glory and the game plays like Ninja Gaiden  2 with the return of obliteration techniques and the flying swallow technique.  What's more is the new &#34;steel on bone technique&#34; that adds to the high-risk/high-reward combat we know and love.  They have done away with curatives and other useable items.  Instead, you gain ninpo power by damaging enemies with melee attacks and then use ninpo to both damage enemies and restore your health.  Also, your health is partially restored in between fights.  This added more strategy and risk to the combat as you now have to make decisions like &#34;should I see if I can finish off these last few enemies with only a sliver of health left or go ahead and use all my ninpo to regain health?&#34;  With regards to the plot, my 3 year-old niece has come up with more engrossing and logical story-lines.  But who cares about the plot when the combat is so satisfying?  If you enjoyed any of the Ninja Gaiden games since it was revamped for the XBOX, then buy this game -- just make sure it's the &#34;Razor's Edge&#34; edition.
5.0	whats not to love, I use this with all of my wii games lol, the condition is great and I saved so much on this item.
5.0	Fast shipping what else can I say great price
5.0	4 player multiplayer action at its finest. chaos MULTIPLAYER!!
5.0	"Why do I think this game is even better than the already fantastic first release? Well....there's several reasons. The main reason is the song list is larger. You must complete 40 songs to beat the game; the prior version you only had to complete 30. Another very cool feature is the Practice mode. I've played guitar for years (albeit poorly) and whenever I've been trying to learn a tough section of a song, I always learned to play those parts by playing the tough version over and over at a slower tempo. After a while you're able to pick up speed and nail the portion you had trouble with. You can now do the same thing in GH2. Fans of the original version will remember how hard it was to complete \\""Cowboys from Hell\\"" or \\""Bark at the Moon\\"" becuase you couldn't practice the songs at a slower tempo. Well, you can practice everything in GH2 and it will make you a better player. It even has a metronome clicking so you can make sure to stay \\""on the beat.\\"" <br /> <br />I can't wait to get together with some friends so I can try out the new versus modes. Even without the versus modes the added songs, practice mode and new three-finger chords make the game a must-buy for anyone who liked the original. Plus, I totally disagree with one of the other reviewers that said the sound is muddy. I honestly believe the sound is higher quality than the original."
5.0	Thank you! I love it!
5.0	Been using them for months and won't play without them.
5.0	I bought this as a gift on black friday and paid $15 less then any other store locally plus paid no shipping and handling and paid no tax which here in IL. is 10%,so I saved at least $35 by ordering it thru amazon and recieved it in about a week.bought the gift for an adult and they loved the built in games.this is a great bundle and lotsa fun,I might buy one for myself to travel with!
5.0	Personally I do not see what the big hype is over these toys, but my nephew asked for this for Christmas and loves it!
5.0	I'm really blown away by this game. InFAMOUS Second Son is an open-world, fast paced action game with unbelievable graphics. The characters really come alive with top notch mo-cap and brilliant acting.
5.0	I got this for my 7 year old son and he loves it. it played it a lot when we first got it but not so much now that he beat the game. he had fun driving the truck with watermelons in it. Its a great game and lots of fun.
5.0	Came in excellent shape with no problems and worked as it should. Came in excellent time and was a great price compared to going to buy it at the store.
5.0	Works as promised and delivered the next day.
5.0	Works great and is very durable. Dropped it once not very high but works great and is a very good controller
5.0	If you are like me, the reviews on X-Plane probabally will make you more confused than ever.  To help you make an informed choice I have addressed the questions that most complicated to process for me. <br /> <br />Is is the latest version? <br /> <br />This is the same verion you buy in the store (8.0).  You will need to download the free update from the x-plane website to bring it up to date to version 8.50. <br /> <br />Is the scenery up to date? <br /> <br />USA scenery only, if you would like the entire world on 7 DVD's you can upgrade latter for a reduced price or buy the 7 DVD version from the x-plane site.  The scenery detail is no better in the world-wide version, just more extensive.  HINT:  It is cheaper to buy this version on Amazon and upgrade to the global version. <br /> <br />Do I need a super computer to run X-Plane? <br /> <br />No.  Frame rates are typically much better than Flight Simulator X and display options are great. <br /> <br />In summery this simulator was well worth the money and is full of many advanced options...  Not a game but a great tool for a very serious flight simmer or real world pilot.  No graphical interface for the menus, but after some tinkering it's easy to get where you need to go (i.e., picking your plane and location).  Although I would not suggest this to somone new to simulators or flying, if you own Flight Simulator and want to have another great experience with thousands of different airplanes, give X-Plane a try. <br />
5.0	My 4 yr old daughter loves this game! It keeps her busy for as long as I let her play it! Great game for little who can't read yet!
5.0	I bought this bundle as a video game deal-of-the-day recently. I already had a white wireless controller and play & charge kit and I definitely enjoyed the freedom of wireless controllers. These kits are great because you don't have to keep buying new batteries or swapping rechargeable ones. I just play, and when I'm done I just plug them into my PC USB ports to charge, so I don't have to leave my 360 on. (These charge kits DO NOT WORK as PC controllers -- only for charging. Silly, eh?)    The deal of the day was for $45. An added benefit was that it was the black bundle, so the controller stands out amongst the many white ones that most people have. I have had no problems thus far and am glad I bought this bundle at the discounted price. I probably would not buy it at full price, though.
5.0	I have heard of the Call of Duty games, but this the first two that I have played. The game is not as easy as I thought it would be, but I had fun playing it.
5.0	This has been a great replacement for the last 6 months. No problems at all, which is all I ask for from a power supply.
5.0	Excellent product, it works perfectly.
5.0	İ like it:) this is amazing and this item is my favorite toy . My son and wife like so much.
5.0	Works fine for our needs.
5.0	my husband loves his ps3 plays it everyday thanks!
5.0	I like this game very much and the grandson and I play it together and really have fun. He is 17 and I'm 72, see, fun.....
5.0	Great game, very interactive action it's nice and long too I would recommend this game to any others whom are into this type of thing.
5.0	I bought this for my grandson to be able to play when he comes to visit; however, I recently bought a new computer and this game doesn't work on it because it runs on Windows 7. That was disappointing, but my grandson took the game home and is able to play it on his older computer and is having a great time with it (I rated the game by his enthusiasm). My advice to future buyers is to check to be sure the game can be played on the computer you intend it for.
5.0	helped tremendously, a must have.
5.0	So much fun and brings back so many fond memories of other great games from back in the golden &#34;Nintendo&#34; age ! :) I highly recommend this to anyone on the market for great adventure that's unforgettable ! :)
5.0	[[VIDEOID:mo2SV3LEG9GJK10]]First of all, I'd like to say that I have been playing strictly BF3 and MW3 the last couple of weeks, and I had this unopened on my dresser collecting dust. I was having doubts that I would enjoy it. I wasn't impressed at first either. As I first started, I was sitting on my bed, and realized shortly that the grappling hook wouldn't work as well as I wanted it to. I then realized it was necessary for me to stand up. It's sort of required you stand up. I really wasn't in to the story, so I skipped all the cutsecenes. It's pretty much about a boy named Edmund who is now dead, and his new name is Deadmund. He has to collect pieces of an amulet, blah, blah, blah.<br />The gameplay is a lot of fun. The best part is that you feel kind of cozy playing this game because of the colors. One level may be all blue, and another all red. It's fun, and gives me warm fuzzies inside (if that makes sense). The orchestra music is very soothing as well. The environments are so cool and colorful. I especially like the elaborate treehouse.<br />I don't think this game will sell well, unless people buy the $100 Move with this game included. It's definitely worth the 20 dollars extra. Currently, I'm #9 on the leaderboards in the story mode, so that tells me nobody is playing it because I'm only 4 or 5 chapters in. There is an at at home and online coop battle mode, as well as a versus mode, but I couldn't get an online match going, so I've been playing solo.<br />I really do wish that San Diego Studios would have created a sports title, but so far, this is the second best title after The Fight: Lights Out (requires 2 controllers). I think for anybody considering the $100 Move bundle, you should definitely consider this bundle over the $80 Move bundle. Peace
5.0	I purchased the advertised original Nintendo adapter, but did it from a third party seller on amazon.<br />Well, I received a knock off in a plain white box. It works but, it is not supposed to be this way.<br />Offered to refund but never did, or to have receiving it back at my expense, so it would end up costing me more that if I actually went to a local store and bought one, so I bit the bullet and let it pass.<br /><br />Since I'm reviewing the original product, 5 stars. (even the one I got is OK so far)
5.0	This may be a kids game but the story plot in it was extremely addictive. Wish there was a Horsez 3 or I'd be all over it in a heartbeat.
5.0	tangle free, easy, favorite color, and especially been 10ft makes it easier to be able to play at a caller rain distance. awesome.!!
5.0	the science behind these are so simple its amazing! there is a learning curve that you have to pass but once you get the feel for them you will have more control and will be able to aim more precisely while playing FPS style games. I use these on my right stick and the KF FPS Freek CQC on my left stick and have brought up my K/D ratio for most games AND my accuracy has improved. i would recommend for anyone looking to try to one up the competition.
5.0	great product.  fast delivery. fits nicely on the back of the console. thanks for connecting my xbox to the internet
5.0	Our Wii power adapter went out after a power outage. After looking at several stores, none of which carried replacements, I looked online. This was by far the cheapest one, so I figured it would be worth a try. That turned out to be a good choice. It's been over a month and it is working perfectly. Overall, I'd say this is a great bargain.
5.0	This game will hook you in and engross you in it's ingenuity. I have NEVER played a game like this. It's about time a company thought up of something so original and refreshing. You play as a modern day college student who learns of her grandfather's gruesome death. She stumbles upon a book and as she reads each chapter, she experiences it first hand. You'll end up playing from a Roman Legionnaire, Cambodian dancer, to a early 1900's Doctor. Each character uses weapons authentic to it's time. Not only do you have swords and guns at your disposal, you'll have magic spells. What sets this game apart from the others is the Sanity Meter. As you encounter enemies your Sanity Meter will drop and STRANGE things start happening. I won't go into that because you'll have to experience it first hand to know what I'm talking about. With the combination of EXCELLENT game play, graphics and sound, you won't go wrong with this game. So it's up to you to investigate his mansion and unravel the clues to prevent the world from, you guessed it, Eternal Darkness.
5.0	I purchased this for my husband for Valentine's Day. He loves this games and plays it during his down time. The graphics and animations are awesome, you can select characters from various comic stories and video games to challenge each other. I even played with my hubby and really enjoyed.
5.0	I Mean What Can I Say? Its Up To Date Stylish And Really Helps Alot For Those Whom Not Only Play Alot But Have Children Around The House That Play More (like myself). Love That It Comes With A Battery THE ONLY THING I DIDNT LIKE Is That It Doesnt Charge Old Battery Packs (The Old White Rechargable Ones) Other Than That Its Great!
5.0	I bought this game for my 3 1/2 and 4 1/2 year old sons for Christmas.  They absolutely love it.  <BR>It has several different Tonka trucks for them to drive thru town and stop in many different places.  Each Truck has a mission at each stop.  The instructions are easy for the children to follow and fun for them to play.<BR>The set does sometimes slip off the keys on my curved keyboard.  The kids had to learn to move it gently (Not a necessarily a bad thing).  <BR>I also have Windows XP.  Several programs that I have purchased do not work on XP.  But the Dig N Rig does.  The only bad part is that I would like to have my computer w/out arguing with my boys.<BR>A Must Have!!!
5.0	I got this on Friday of the week it was released and I was going hold off for a bit and I am glad I didn't. Here is the problem I have with this game though. You can't get anything done because it just hooks you in and I am a new fan of Soccer and this is a great way to learn for people like me and also good for kids as the content is very family friendly.     I know this will make some mad, but I was happy to see David Beckham put in the game and I love the added leauges such as the eircom leaugue of Ireland. That is actually what inspired me to get this copy. Just alot of fun and if your a fan of the NHL series this is really for you.
5.0	This is a really fun game that I just got a few days ago. It has a wide variety of things to do from running over people to shooting the cops. I would say this is one of the best entries in the Grand Theft Auto series.
5.0	If you plan on hooking up your Xbox to your top-of-the-line TV set and 5.1 Dolby encoded receiver, then this is the way to go.  You don't even need a HDTV to achieve great results from this AV Pack.  If your TV has 'Component' inputs, then you can take advantage of this product and the better color it produces.  Monster Cable also makes a similar AV pack, but this one is better for several reasons: 1) it is much less expensive 2) The Monster version doesn't include a jack for digital audio (Dolby 5.1).  You have to purchase a separate adapter, as well as the Optical cable, which adds considerable expense. (why Monster did this is beyond me. If you are spending the cash to upgrade your video, why would they only include standard RCA cables for audio??  My guess is because they want more money from your pockets!) 3) with this AV pack, you still have the option to use any Component wires you wish, although it does come with their own.  For instance, you can still use standard Monster Component cables if you desire. 4) it is made by Microsoft, who makes the Xbox, so you are using OEM equipment.
5.0	I gave this to my 5 year old son, who is very into superheroes and he absolutely loves this game!!  I got the game from the seller in a very timely manner and everything is up to the standards that I got it as.
5.0	My husband and I have had a great time with our Wii Fit and that says a lot coming from 2 couch potatoes.
5.0	excellent product I love
5.0	The Kinect is very innovative game.  I love that you don't need a controller to use it!  It truly is my favorite video game system out there.
5.0	the perfect add on the kids play with these characters all day
5.0	I'm so sorry I could not get back with u soner as my Uncel passed away and I was out of town
5.0	This is one of my favorite football games period. It's simple and fun, the way a football game should be, while still maintaining some of the more advanced aspects of college football if you want to be involved with them, such as recruiting and managing rosters.
5.0	"Let me first start off by saying that the images make the little streaks of color on this case look orange. I have received my case, and it actually looks more reddish than orange. Also, this case does not open \\""fully\\""; it has elastics on both sides which keep the case from opening a full 180 degrees (it opens like a clamshell).<br /><br />That said, I absolutely love this case.<br /><br />In general, I could tell right away from taking this case out of the box that it was very high quality. The outside appears to be a very, very stiff impact resistant material. I would say foam, but it feels much to sturdy to be that. The inside is lined a soft, felt-like material which is sure to keep your Vita in very good condition. There's also a flap in which you can store two game cards that goes over the screen when closed. The case also comes with a built-in loop on the back to thread a belt through, as well as a small \\""belay\\"" clip that allows you to attach the case to just about anything.<br /><br />If you want a stylish, well-built /fortress/ of a case for your vita, get this case."
5.0	The product is fantastic and was delivered in a reasonable amount of time.  The downfall is the shipping charges, unnecessarily high.
5.0	This gameboy just brought me back to my best childhood memories, everybody should get one as a gift! But overall , i cant stop playing my games, thank you.
5.0	This is one of the best games I have played in a long time. Favorite assassins creed game in the series.
5.0	The gameplay in Yars Revenge is addicting, fast paced, and very fun. This Game Boy Color version is much better then the version bundled on the Game Boy Advange with Pong and Asteroids. I know this because I had originally bought Yars Revenge for Game Boy Color used for about 2 bucks. At first, I could't figure out what to do in the game and didn't understand the goal. After I got the hang of this game I was HOOKED!!! It was the best 2 bucks I ever spent. Then, one day I popped the cartrige into my system, and it wouldn't fire up. Attempt after attempt to boot the game up failed: the game had inexplicably stopped working! I had played the game without a problem earlier in the day, too. So, since it broke I thought I'd buy the GBA version....wow, what a rip-off. For 15 bucks I got a slow paced, lower-rez graphics (yes) and much worse version of the game. Don't get me wrong, Asteroids and Pong are allright, but with no high score saves this compilation is lacking. Since the GBA Yars was such a dissapointment I hopped onto Amazon and once again purchased one of the most fun arcade style games EVER: Yars Revenge. <br /> <br />The storyline and main character in this game are very odd and unique. I won't spoil them for you. If you haven't heared of this game already and like arcade games or addicting games, this is a MUST BUY!!! The only downfall is that it won't work on your DS, so you have to bust out a GBA, GBC or original Game Boy to play it! And yes, this Game Boy Color software is backwards compatible with the ORIGINAL Game Boy hardware! How cool is that? I'd love to play this game on an original GB, too bad mine is gone for good :(
5.0	great game, but it took quite a while to ship
5.0	This game is the most amazing thing I ever discovered. I fell in love with every mission, character, location in the game and could hardly get away from it, but then I got to the ending and my blind love faded away... Could be worse, but still it was heart- squeezing gameplay. I find it really emotional game- not just shooting to alien things. If not the ending, project could be a lot more succesful, I suppose.
5.0	i bought this for my little sister for christmas and we both absolutely love playing it!!! i think maybe me more than her!! i just cant get enough of it!!!!!!!!!! defintiely recommend!! HAPPY SHOPPING!!! :)
5.0	Excellent! Absolutely amazing! Buy this game expecially if you're a Tomb Raider & an Uncharted 1, 2, & 3 fan!!!
5.0	The original was damaged, I purchased this one for the kids.  Works great. Have not had any complaints. Would purchase again
5.0	This has got to be my favorite way to charge. It is even easy enough for my four year old to use. I just bought a second one.
5.0	This was a great deal only .99 and shipping. The case is empty, no game inside, but that's what I wanted. I put a zombie movie DVD in the case that had had it's original casing destroyed. Plus, it's a collectors item for someone like me. However, I bought the last one.
5.0	"This is the best gameboy game I've ever seen.  My 12 year old son and all of his friends have been playing it non stop for the last couple of days.  The hardest part for them is finishing the last \\""book\\"" level #5.  It keeps them coming back.  I love the game too.  The graphics are much more 3-d looking and colorful than any gameboy game I've ever seen.  It's a classic Gumby adventure where I get to move Gumby through the Old West book level where Richochet Pete chases Gumby through a really cool mine cart chase similar to Indana Jones.  The Africa level and Arctic level's are really fun too.  I love being able to morph Gumby into a ball that can jump from wall to wall, sticking his way up an otherwise impassable climb.  My son and I still haven't finished the Planet Astrobot level, but I'm glad it's challenging.  He likes to go back to the other four levels and do them over a lot.  It feels like a classic clay animation adventure, but better, because we can be Gumby.  We love it!"
5.0	This is a very good game. In mega Man, you play through a group of levels. You can gain the powers of the bosses you defeat. There are many traps throughout the levels that can easily kill you. Each of the levels has a theme such as fire. <br /> <br />The main problems with this game are the traps. You automatically die from the traps.  <br /> <br />Other than this minor problem, I recommend that you get this classic game immediately if you do not have the collection for PS2 or GC. <br /> <br />Real name: Matthew Smith
5.0	I've had this game for less than a week and overall it's a solid game and well put together. I've tried other similar games, as far as sword fighting games go and they have nothing on this one. I picked it up last week and I'm glad I did. Its a daily game for me, worth the $60 it is sold for, got it for nearly $20 less thanks to coupons and what not but this game is worth every penny
5.0	I reviewed the game before, maybe even twice, I don't remember, when I was only partway through.  Having finished it, I've decided that the plusses far outweight the minuses, and I've rekindled my total Myst obsession.  It's really too bad that Live was scrapped by Ubi (*insert lots of nasty comments about UbiSoft*) because Cyan obviously worked very hard.  The forthcoming expansion packs should be fantastic, though, and avoid the server lag problems that Live had.<br />This is the major caveat: THEY MEAN IT with the system specs.  If your system does not match or exceed what's on the box, this game will be a waste of your money.  Other than that, I found that all of the puzzles were eventually solvable (far easier than Riven, anyway), and that even the hardest jump puzzles were doable after some practice (and I'm really bad at jumping games).  I just can't wait to see more.  Beautiful.
5.0	Let me start off by saying I'm a huge fan of the Metro series. I've replayed both 2033 and Last Light three times each, and I still feel like I'm missing small detail  in the game. Last Light has lasted me eighty hours already, and I still plan to go back and replay it later on. I won't go too into-depth about the game and simply tell you why you should support this developer by purchasing this game.<br /><br />Metro is one of those games that you won't enjoy unless you know what you're getting into. It can be a little rough around the edges, with framerate drops and texture pop-ins, but these cons are far outweighed by the pros. Last Light is an extremely cinematic and engaging game that begs to be explored. The environments are beautiful, and the detail is stunning. 4A really outdid themselves when it came to adding small touches that made the game feel like a more harsh battle for survival in an ironically beautiful world. Being set in the Moscow metro, there is even a level where you get to visit the surface and visit the Kremlin. Be sure to explore that level as you also get to visit Lenin's tomb through a hidden passage. I was exactly surprised by how well the developer made the game feel as if it's set in Moscow. I've visited Moscow several times and am Russian myself so I feel very at-home in the metro's tunnels alongside its inhabitants.<br /><br />Yeah, it's a good game.
5.0	sequels are never as good as the original. but, in this case, LBP2 blows LBP1 WAY out of the water!  plus, you get ALL of the neat costumes for sackboy and 4 avatars for PSN home. this is the best buy I've ever had.
5.0	This game is great, I didn't think twice about buying this game for my child because is rated safe for the whole family. It was packed very well and arrived in very good conditions.
5.0	This was easy to set up, works perfectly and is simple enough that even young grandchildren can play with it.  Great fun for the whole family.
5.0	Arrived on time, good deal.
5.0	Yep, if you are willing to take the time to learn what the game can really do this is one heck of a baseball simulation and tremendously fun at the same time.  There are some really essential options in this game that let you customize it to whatever realism and whatever difficulty you want.  for example, you can turn off the pitching Icon and the vibration so that you have to pitch on &quot;Feel&quot;.  It makes the game a very realistic pitching simulator and as a pitcher tires it affects the pitchers control.  Also, you can pick which fielders you want to control and which you want the cpu to control.<br />The hitting is too good to be true.  Very difficult and on the All-Star level it takes some serious practice and skill but that's what makes it so rewarding when you get a hit.<br />The statistics come out very realistic when you play Franchise and Expansion mode which is the meat of the game.<br />The most important thing though is what are you looking for.  This game is for the more mature and skilled gamers.  Children and fans of the more Arcadish games will hate this.<br />Seriously though, take some time to play with the options and tweak the game to the way you want it to play.  Also, this may sound strange but &quot;READ THE MANUAL&quot;.<br />PLAYBALL!<br />M the P
5.0	I don't understand why I have to review this, it was a gift for a benefit. ANOTHER WORDS I DONATED THIS! We have been through this several times and you don't remove it from my review list.  And this is not fair to the seller..........
5.0	Easy hook up and no issues on my old flat tube tv. Great for quick strolls down memory lane
5.0	I was nervous about buying them since it was an off-brand but they were perfect and so affordable! Highly recommend!
5.0	The game is in good condition and pretty much as expected. Not much else is really needed to be said.
5.0	Products was described as in the descripton.  Thanks again! Works great, fast shipping. THanks for the expansion of my xbox! Now I can download like crazy! woo hooooo!
5.0	I found this game to be totally awesome. The layout and multilevels make this game a &quot;thumbs up&quot;. The objectives are challenging and quite interesting not to mention the variety of  weapons that can be used for each mission. They got it right when they developed this game for PS2 and a Medal of Honor in game design is truly deserved.
5.0	Love this game it's so laid back and fun! Love how it's a open world and the customization options in the game.
5.0	Pretty fun I guess not better then mk2 and besides if some people like then it ok with me
5.0	I love this system. I have an xbox 360 and I love this one more. It's not so much the gaming aspect but the fact that I don't have to pay Sony in order to use the network benefits. I can play games and stream with Netflix or Amazon at no additional fee. Wake-up Microsoft!

5.0	This game is a nice, scary thriller and I loved it. It's story is well thought out and the game play is fantastic. It also got an 8.5/10 on gamespot.com so I would recommend this game.
5.0	Wonderful mouse. The Origin M903 mouse comes with a simple yet very customizable software that I enjoyed toying around with. There are multiple lighting customizations and five DPI settings, of which are customizable as well, each with a different color of the mouse wheel; same with the five customizable profiles but with the Redragon logo changing color. It is very comfortable, but takes a little getting used to. The top texture feels like something inbetween sandpaper and rubber (which weirdly enough, I like). There are actually five programmable buttons, unless you want to change the funtions of the mouse wheel button, left click and right click, but they are still very useful. It looks awesome in the dark as well. I would definitely recommend this mouse to a friend; it is worth far more than $20 in my eyes.
5.0	I purchased this for my son, he is 7 and he has gotten so much enjoyment from this product. The game is for everyone, you take care of your Miis and unlock content like new clothing, new foods, new relationships etc Miis can grow up have a family including mii babies in which the mii babies grow up to be adults. This game has a ton of fun playing experince for any one. I think my favorite part is creating your owns Miis and their personalities!
5.0	I own both Midtown Madness 1&2. I had Great fun with the origonal even though it had its problems. Bad physics, not the best graphics, ect. What I really love about that game though, is that you can just cruise around the city after the heat of racing. Midtown madness 2 has that feature and more. Most of these bugs are gone in MM2 also. And now there are 2 cities, San Francisco AND London, instead of just 1! The cities are true to what they look like in real life, too! It has many different modes of play. This is what they are:<br />CRUISE: Simply cruise around the cities care free, doing absolutley whatever you want, and you can learn the roads. GREAT FUN!<br />BLITZ RACE: Race along the roads finding your own way. Get through all the checkpoints in order and in time to win the race. You can unlock new vehicles by winning many of the races.<br />CURCIUT RACE: Race opponents in set courses throughout San Francisco and London.You can unlock new cars here, too.<br />CHECKPOINT RACE: Get through all the checkpoints in no particular order and get to the finish before the others. You can get new cars here, too.<br />There is one new mode, crash course, in which you must go through a series of tests, where you must practice an individual skill, and be good at it to pass! There is one big test after every 3 little tests combining all the skills you just learned, and you get a new paint job for a car after each Big test. And you get a new car at the end, too!<br />This is a very good game. These are the general PROS and CONS<br />PROS:<br />  1 Good sound track<br />  2 Two new areas San Francisco & London<br />  3 Five different game modes, including a new one, Crash<br />  Course<br />  4 Lots of Cars<br />  5 lots of Tracks<br />  6 Awesome Cruise feature, just drive around!<br />  7 areas true to how they are in real life<br />  8 good graphics<br />CONS:Can be a little glitchy, but thats about it<br />THIS IS ONE GREAT GAME!!!!!!!
5.0	Super fast shipping. Item just as described.
5.0	This is a really good puzzle game. The closest I can think of to relating it with another game in terms of gameplay would be Adventures of Lolo. The game could have been alittle better in as far as your characters action abilities such as jumping and weapons but it is still a great game. Toki Tori must rescue all his egg buddies that have been kidnapped and scattered throughout the game. Once you have grabbed a certain ammount of eggs back you advance to the next stage. Each stage is timed and you are given just enough tools in your possesion to complete a level at a time. The game does get really tough on your brain though making it a really challenging puzzle game for all ages.
5.0	My son loves these so I have to give it a thumbs up too!  He plays with them with the Skylanders ipad app, and by themselves so I like that he can play with them without having the app.
5.0	This is the best, very useful, and my grandson can find everything he wants because of the several products in one pack.
5.0	This is honestly the best game I have EVER played that is based on a movie.  Actually, Halo is the ONLY game out there that is better than this game.  Its the BEST.  If you are a fan or maybe even not.  This is the game for you.  You will be hooked on it for hours beyond hours plaing it.  ITS THE BEST!!!
5.0	What can I say? I love this kind of game to mix differents characters from anime series, It's like traditional fighthing game, with super powers and combos, for someone to looking a good fighting game this one is good.
5.0	I enjoy playing this with friends or by myself.  It met my expectations and I will be looking for more.
5.0	"I never purchased the PC version of Diablo 3 because I heard a lot of my friends complaining just how bad it was. I did play the \\""starter\\"" edition that blizzard offered for several hours and honestly it was as bad as I heard.<br /><br />For me the major problem was the controls. I was incredibly bored running the entire game clickity click click through the mouse. I knew from the very beginning this game was suppose to be on the console and not the PC.<br /><br />So I picked it up on 9/3 and I have had an absolute ball. The controller scheme is absolutely fantastic for Diablo 3. This is how this game should be played with a controller and NOT a keyboard and mouse.<br /><br />Graphically the game is fantastic. No auction house makes this game so much more fun too.<br /><br />The drop in and drop out multiplayer is really well done. My friends and I have been having a great time and I highly recommend this game to anyone except little kids. It is M-rated of course."
5.0	I am very picky when it comes to in ear headphones, but these are just fantastic. I purchased Sony's $100 wireless headset and these sound 10x better. Great bass, clarity, and the mic works flawlessly(PS4). Great pickup. Definitely worth the cheap price.
5.0	A great game where u want massive caos in ring...takes me.back to school days
5.0	Would definitely recommend this mic to everyone who wants to play any of the musical/instrumental games on the XBOX 360. Works great with Rock Band games AND Guitar Hero. Just the right amount of sensitivity to hear your highs and lows. I would MOSTLY recommend it to those who don't mind being just a few feet away from their XBOX 360s, as it is a USB Mic, so distance is limited, although the cord is lengthy enough, in my opinion. Lastly, it's worth more than what I paid for it for sure.
5.0	Packaged appropriately, advertised new and came in same condition. Works, girls would like this character. This is a Giant so make sure you have that game & portal.
5.0	i really like the Crime and investigation Game<br />hope i can find more game similar to C.S.I<br />and compatible with my OS X. Mountain Lion :)
5.0	This game is just AMAZING! It is so addicting its unbelievable. The online play is like WOW! You can have up to 16 players playing in one game online, and you can talk to ur teammates if you have a headset (worth $30). You can make your own clan or join a clan of someone elses, and have really fun clan wars or game battles. You can be a Seal or a Terrorist in every game online. The Seals have better guns (IW), but the Terrorists have PMN Mines. Crossroads is the most popular map, but my favorite is either Fish Hook or The Ruins. You can play the Single Player missions to get different characters for onine play. There are 12 missions which have a good challenge in every one of them. Playing with your friends online is just so much fun. I play like 3 hours a day lol. GREAT GAME! BUY IT IMMEDIATELY!
5.0	I love this game. I thought I would tolerate a less than stellar game as long as the Ghibli stuff was cool, but in fact the actual game design was fantastic and this game is up there with some of the RPG greats of old. Also, the pre-order bonus familiar I got from ordering this on Amazon was great as well. I maxed him out and he's become one of my favorites. Can't recommend more!
5.0	Purchased this for my 18 year old son for Christmas because he asked for it...and, of course, he loved it!
5.0	This Playstation 3 is great.  Everything I expected and more! And a really good price.  Recommend it to anyone looking for a PS3.
5.0	It works! It rose my K/D like crazy! Cant Play Xbox Without them. You Move Faster with them, and Your accuracy improves.
5.0	This was a gift and they loved this 3DS.  A bit pricey but given the quality of the item that is no longer being manufactured it was worth the price.
5.0	works on my gamecube so im happy
5.0	Got this for my daughter for Christmas.  We have spent countless hours since playing the game.  Its not just a typical side scrolling video game.  There are challenges looking for the hidden letters and puzzle pieces that keeps the game fresh every time you play it.
5.0	Baldur's Gate II together with Baldur's gate is a revolutionary game and it changes how computer RPG could be played.You can control up to 6 party members engaging in challenging battles and hard decisions. The quality of the writing and the customization is spot-on. The freedom in this game is also great which allows you to explore many inconsequential non-plot areas. This game packs all the stuff an RPG fan would love: endless quests, believable characters, deep customization, various fighting styles, tons of unique treasures, and an enthralling main storyline.Pick any aspect of the game and I am sure it would be great comparing to other RPGs other there.  And just a notion about this product, it comes only with 5 discs without manuals, reference card or art work.
5.0	"This game doesn't have hidden object puzzles and has very few inventory puzzles. What it does have is a lot of brain-teaser, math, and logic puzzles. The presentation is professional. The plot is brief, but provides a nice background to the puzzles.    If you are like me and just want challenging puzzles in your puzzle games without all the added fluff, then this game is for you. My only complaint is sometimes you are missing an important clue to a puzzle and the game doesn't always let you know. For example, I wasted a lot a time on the \\""colored laser\\"" puzzle before giving up and trying a different puzzle. Lo and Behold, when I solved that puzzle, I got the clue that makes solving the \\""colored laser\\"" possible. Why couldn't they not activiate the first puzzle until the puzzle with the clue is solved first?    Finally, I think the Snooker puzzle might be one of the best puzzles in a game ever. I strongly recommend not \\""cheating\\"" on this one. It was rather satisifying for me when I finally solved it on my own!"
5.0	I bought Madden 2001 and played it a lot.  It was good at first but then it just got boring.  I've played all the Madden games since and several of the other EA football games (NCAA football 2001-2004).  They never really improved.  The ESPN 2K games, however, get better every year.  Also, did you know that NFL 2K5 has a first person view mode.  IT'S LIKE YOU ARE THE RUNNING BACK AS YOU RUN.  YOU SEE WHAT A REAL RUNNING BACK WOULD SEE.  It doesn't get more realistic then that.  And to top it off it's 20 bucks.  So you can pay more, get Madden 2005, and play last year's game with the names switched around to match this year's rosters, OR, you can pay less, and play the best new game around.  ESPN NFL 2K5.
5.0	installed on windows XP with no problems but Windows 7 had issues with some of the games. these are the older command and conquer<br /> games but are still fun to play.
5.0	this is a great game it really took me back seeing my son play it if you love TMNT you will love this
5.0	I've been a HUGE fan of Animal Crossing since the Gamecube version. It has everything that I could have imagined and more! Its an absolute must have for any Animal Crossing fan!
5.0	Female gamer alert :)  I love this game. I first got it for free for being a xbox live gold member but had to buy the actual game since it is cheaper than buying the dlc seperate. For me what is great about this game is that you want to keep playing it after beating it. Not just for more achievements but for different outcomes in the game. The game is based upon your choices. To kill or not to kill, that is the question. You really become Corvo and can feel his emotions without ever seeing his face or hearing his voice.  You want Corvo to succeed in his mission to make Dunwall City great again.
5.0	I bought this game for my six year old son, who has played the Lego Batman and Star Wars games and enjoyed them tremendously. The previous reviewer is correct, this is a different game, but it is enjoyable in its own right. You have 90 levels to complete, each with items to find (minikit pieces, blue Legos) and as you find stuff and complete levels you unlock other items or levels. This is basically a mini RTS (real time strategy) game for kids, I would suggest at least six years of age. You have builders who can make you farms (to sustain population), towers (for defense), shipyards, castles (to make your kings/wizards/etc), barracks (to make soldiers), and so on. Each level sees goals that when completed usually lead to new goals. Once you have completed a level you can stay there looking for items you still have not found or you can go on to the next level. I helped my son a bit with the first few levels but he picked it up quickly and he loves the game. So do not expect another DS Batman, but instead this is a fantastic game in its own right.
5.0	Prior to purchasing this, I bought one of the $10 cables here on Amazon. It produced severe horizontal interference lines, and the left audio channel would cut in and out. I returned it.<br /><br />With this adapter, both display and audio are flawless.<br /><br />NOTE:  Though not shown or mentioned, the adapter comes with component cables (10 ft. I think). At least when bought new.
5.0	MDK 2 is one of the best games of all time!! I really love what was done with this game...the graphics, the scenery, the humor, the challenge are all top notch. This is definitely one to own and one to keep. Get MDK 2 without a second thought...you won't regret it.
5.0	still playing having a ball with game worth buying-more dlc to come!
5.0	I recently recalled fond memories of playing Black & White in my childhood and decided to order B&W2 from Amazon. I read the description which included a statement that partial proceeds went to charity and found the reasonable price quite reasonable. Seeing that it was listed as &#34;Like New&#34; I assumed that it would come with a few scrapes on the case and scratches on the disc but I was wrong. I could not have gotten a more spotless set of discs if I DID buy new (which was a large increase in price. My best Amazon purchase yet!
5.0	I was a little skeptical before I bought this, but gamespot.com and about every reviewer here gave this game high marks, so I bought it solely based on that.  I only buy games that are a lot of fun and have great replay value.  The four games I own are Castlevania: Circle of the Moon, F-Zero, Super Mario Advance, and this one.  I only regret buying Mario, as I'm old enough to have played the heck out of it the first time around.<br />This is one of those games where every time you look up, it's two hours later.  The tutorial is fun and essential.  The strategy is top notch and it's a lot more fun than PC games of the same genre.  You really feel like you've accomplished something when you clear a map by finding the weakness.  The music gets old fast, but the game loses nothing when the music is turned off.  Thanks to Nintendo for coming out with another classic.  It's been many years since they've done anything really new.
5.0	My son has them on his head more than he doesn't.  I wish I was exaggerating.
5.0	Finally have the one game to complete my Raychet & Clank Collection and tells how Ratchet searches for Clank. I call it the missing saga game for it tells everything Ratchet does to find Clank or where he is. Its a great game and yes, it could be a little longer but its has all the Ratchet and Clank action you could want. If you love the Ratchet & Clank games, this is a must.
5.0	These wheels work beautifully! I don't have any issues with the IR transmitter (I'm not sure if that's the name) that allows wireless play, as other people have complained about.<br /><br />These wheels appear to me to be as good as Nintendo issued wheels
5.0	Great story, Excellent music, never before seen graphics (at the time of it's original release)and tremendous replay value. I still play this game at least once a month. It will never get old. Can't wait to see what gamecube will produce
5.0	el prodcucto recibido es genial!!! les encanto a mis hermanos!!! vale la pena la compra, llegaron dentro de un buen envoltorio
5.0	My boys have been waiting for these two particular Giants for a while and they have finally arrived! Gamestop has Thumpback and Eyebrawl for $14.99.  Anything above that price is way too much!!!
5.0	I wish I had this with my first 2 ds games. This is great when the kids drop their games. I had two previous ds ruined because they were dropped on hard wood floor. This is a great idea for protection.
5.0	After reading all of the reviews of Microsoft's new sim: Combat flight simulator 3, I realized that this sim has everything I wished for.<br />Right now I own IL-2 Sturmovik and Apache Havoc. CFS3 is a hybrid (as I like to call it) of both of these other sims.<br />CFS3 has the ability to let you see the war go on and be affected by your actions(as seen on Apache Havoc). It also uses the DVC as a standard view cockpit(as seen in IL-2 Sturmovik).<br />I give a lot of props to those who gave there time into making this outstanding simulator.
5.0	Amazing price on Black Friday!
5.0	"Let's just get something out of the way up front: Dawn of Mana is NOT an action RPG. In fact, it isn't any kind of RPG. Nor does it have anything that could be conceived of (logically) as \\""RPG elements\\"". Mana fans might find this disconcerting, given that the previous games in the series were light RPGs mashed into an action/adventure core, but what we have here is something that aims to be a different experience entirely. Anyone who tells you the game is an RPG in which your level resets at the end of each stage is a very sad individual. Just because a game has \\""levels\\"" of something doesn't mean it's an RPG or meant to be taken as one in any way. Plenty of shooters and other game types have had levels of one thing or another, and that in no way indicates that the game had RPG elements. <br /> <br />So... <br /> <br />Much ado has been made of the gamut of problems that Dawn of Mana suffers from, and while most of these accusations are on at least some level true, your mileage will definitely vary. There are gamers who apparently loathe this game as if it had its way with their wives and daughters, and there are some, like myself, who feel it is unjustly criticized and can actually be quite a positive experience for many.  Part of the problem is the original release in Japan was far too difficult and often frustrating due to some design issues, but these have almost entirely been resolved in the North American release.  Don't let the general negativity fool you - this is by no means a terrible game. <br /> <br />The big issues? Firstly, the camera. We can all agree that the camera is terrible. You've played games with terrible cameras before, and this one is just like those were. Secondly, the control. Some say it's completely broken, some say it's fine. I say it's in the middle. It's perfectly functional, it's just quite stiff, leading to some occasional frustration before you've gotten used to its nuances. Thirdly, there are some minor inconsistencies when it comes to the game's radar and its objectives, but many players may bypass those problems altogether simply because they may not happen to get lost. Where some did, I didn't. Where others didn't, I did. Those elements could certainly have been improved, but they don't destroy the game by any stretch of the imagination. <br /> <br />As I see it, those are the game's major problems. If you feel you can get beyond those, give it a try. Renting is a good option if you have doubts. <br /> <br />So we know the bad, what's good? Firstly, the art. Everything is well designed, well animated, very colorful and full of heart, and oozes Mana from every pore. Secondly, the gameplay. While I initially felt that swatting enemies around with environmental objects was going to feel gimmicky and boring, I was proven wrong. Most levels are just big sandboxes in which enemies and objects coexist together, waiting for you to come along and introduce the latter to the former with a few good swings of your whip-sword or the kinetic energy from a good punch. Thirdly, the sound and music. The soundtrack is a beautiful thing well worth listening to, and the voice actors in the English dub do a surprisingly solid job. <br /> <br />Do you have any hope of liking Dawn of Mana? You certainly do. The best advice anyone can give you is to try it. Despite what seems like an overwhelming wall of negativity from those who don't like it, there are many of us who find it to be an enjoyable experience worth the price of entry. There's no guarantee you'll be able to get past the flaws, but these are minor compared to what you're hearing on the whole, and there's a perfectly good chance that you will enjoy the game as evidenced by the number of people out there playing and enjoying it right now. <br /> <br />Take a chance. You might be pleasantly surprised."
5.0	Item arrived in very good condition and on time! I had previously seen mounts that cost $40 to hold up something that weighs a little more than a pound!  This is the one you want!  Great price and it gets the job done!
5.0	This controller has a longer cord than other generics I've bought. Makes a big difference. Just too bad they always tend to get cord damage near where they plug in to the system.
5.0	I bought this game because I needed an adventure game really bad. This game simply amazes me. The levels are huge and you'll fall in love with the characters. Once you've bought all the powers you can buy multiplayer mini games. I've played rayman on 64 and this is ten times better. The graphics are unbelievable and the gameplay and camera angles are simply wonderful. It took me twenty hours to clear all the levels and I still have to go back and get al the stuff. Just buy this game you'll love it if you like endless adventure.
5.0	I have been using this for approximately 1 month playing CoD Black Ops.  I'm an old school PC player and as such was used to playing on a mouse & keyboard.  I found it very difficult to adjust to the PS3 controller and opted to purchase the frag fx to make playing the game more doo-able.    I have some sanyo eneloop batteries I use for the chuck & mouse that are rechargeable and I get a lot of hours before I have to recharge them, so the battery part doesn't bother me one bit.    The first thing I noticed was I could just plug in the usb connector into the ps3, turn on the chuck and mouse and the PS3 recognized it immidiately and It required no set up what so ever.  It is truely plug and play.    I love the wireless aspect of it, as I already have a turtle beach headset and didn't want more wires to deal with.    After a few hours of continuous play I notice I was starting to develop a hotspot from holding the chuck in my left hand around my middle finger.  The screws holes that are molded on the bottom of the chuck chaffed my finger for some reason.  I used some tape (on my finger) in the affected regions for a few days till I worked up some callous/resistance and now it doesn't bother me.    It took a while before I figured out what settings I was most comfortable with.  At first I used the ingame 10 sensativity with very low deadzone sensativity on the chuck between 2 and 1.  I liked it because of the more true to pc feeling it gave, but I suffered at longer ranges due to not being precise enough on aim.  I started slowly working my way up the sensativity on the chuck and now sit just above 4.      Slow mouse movements translate to short and slow cross hair in-game movements, and fast rapid movements translate to fast long movements in game.  It takes a little getting used to at this setting and I'd say it took me a good week to get really used to it.    The only issues I've come across is you are severly hampered when under the effects of concussion blasts, as you can not move the mouse continously (IE hold the joystick in one direction) so your at a disadvantage in that senario.  Using the mouse to drive the RC-XD also takes some getting used to.  I find picking up the mouse and moving left to right in a repeating fashion works best to keep the car turning in a direction.    For chopper gunner and hind using the joystick swap is the best option as using the mouse is very difficult to aim with those kill streaks because of the lower game sensativity when using them.    I've had mixed success with the rapid fire option.  You are unable to use the 3rd setting without jamming the gun (the game locks you out for using too fast a rapid fire for x seconds and you cant shoot the gun) settings 1 and 2 work just fine however.  I found setting 2 to work great for long range shots with ar's and lmg's but lack stopping power for close range shots.  More often than not I'll get beat on a 1v1 with 2nd setting rapid fire in cqc.  I've used semi-auto weapons with the 2nd setting and it does help, but the recoil on those with fast fire rates are generally attrocious.  I've also had limited success with very fast fire rate weapons and the 2nd rapid fire option, IE the 74u with rapid fire, the famas/aug in cqc but I still kill faster without it in cqc.    The button remapping was a feature I've really enjoyed.  A tip for the new users, you have to remap all the buttons at once as the controller is not able to remap 1 button, then exit the remapping mode and remap another.  Doing so will cancel the 1st button remap and only use the 2nd remap.  Here's what buttons I remapped.    I remapped my ads to right mouse click, my knife to square, my reload to pushing down the scroll wheel, lethal to l1 on the chuck.  This way the chuck has both tac and lethal on l1 and l2, knife is very quick where my thumb rests on the mouse, reloading is a quick finger press, and ads/fire all handled via the right hand.    Now If you tried to map each one individually it will just overwrite the previous map, so you have to plan ahead and figure out which key's you want to remap and do them all at once before exiting the remaping setting.    My KDR has gone up once I got used to the controls and used to the game itself.  I generally do between 2-4 kdr in tdm but I dont attribute that all to the controller, it simply let me play the game without the ps3 controller learning curve.    Having said that if you are a good mouse and keyboard user, and have used the ps3 controller or at least familiar with the joystick controlls, using the chuck will be second nature.  I actually like it over the wasd for movement because it allows for more precise control over movement.    I would reccomend this to people in my same situation who are used to pc fps and want to make the switch to ps3 without a huge learning curve on the ps3 controller.  If you are already good with a ps3 controller then don't bother with it.
5.0	My kids and I are having a great time with this game!  It is perfect for their age (10 and 8).  It's fun but not too violent.  The vendor was great.  We got the game well before the expected arrival date.  It arrived in great condition.
5.0	I wasnt sure what to expect from this new game, but it blew my mind. there are so many more options and games that you can do. definitely worth it and it keeps you entertained for hours. it also gets you alot more active than the first one. it has something for everyone as well!
5.0	This is the best Puzzle game I have ever Played. It's very fun and has great replay value, unlockables will keep you playing for hours ( Pictures, Extra Characters, and songs) Great game to buy new or used it'll probably be hard to find used so get it new.
5.0	I got this a while ago. And it works great on my Nintendo Wii U! I would recommends this for those who wish to uses a Gamecube controller on the Wii U.
5.0	Let just say that the sole reason that I owned a Playstation 1 was Tekken 1.  So I been following the game throughout its birth until the visually spectacular Tekken 6 to debut onto both PS3 and XBox360.  Let me say that it does not disappoint.  If you like HD graphics with amazing characters and costumes and all types of martial arts and fighting mechanics then this is a game for you.  Tekken Tag had been my favorite game but Tekken 6 wears the new crown.    Sporting 40 (has it gotten to forty??) that's amazing.  I personally like Alisa Bosconovitch.  New to Tekken is the story mode which not seen in arcade adds so much depth into the story and is so much fun.  Since I only been playing it for 2 days thus far...I have to say that I have not been as excited.    Negatives...hmmm...all other Tekken games NEVER..i repeat never have any delays in loading times.  This new Tekken has like a 10 sec delay loading from character to character after you defeat them so it slightly was a negative but doesn't change my opinion about the game at all.
5.0	Uncharted 2 is an excellent follow up to the original Drake's fortune. It is a little bit tougher than the first one. With some great graphics, an interesting story, and an interesting line of supporting characters. If you like Tomb raider games, you will love this series. It is the best PS3 exclusive. I am anxious for the next game in this series.
5.0	This game is amazing!  The sense of scale and escalation is more akin to a character action game like Bayonetta or Devil May Cry, not a simple 2D platformer.  The level design is great and really lends itself well to the unique scissor mechanics.  The visuals and presentation are really something else, taking on the looks of a puppet theater, but with a darker tone even if the content isn't super risque or anything.<br /><br />This game is proof that even when you think a genre has exhausted all of its possibilities, something will come out of nowhere and make it fresh again.
5.0	Nice stand. Perfect Fit.
5.0	I've only gotten into the GameCube games over the last year or so and am actively playing a number of games. This memory card has worked for me very time, where other 3rd party brands have issues. I've yet to lose a single game save and I have dozens of them across two of these cards.
5.0	"I loved this game. It seemed to be a little shorter in game play compared to God of War 2, but it was filled with much more action IMO. The game was very violent and gory, but like another reviewer pointed out, there is nothing like taking your vengeance out on a difficult boss that nearly got the better of you. I definitely think this is the greatest game I've ever played. I never played Uncharted 2 since I wasn't very impressed by Uncharted 1, so I can't really compare the two but it doesn't matter. The graphics of this game are phenomenal, the \\""puzzles\\"" that you have to strategically solve are creative and for the most part difficult (Hera's garden and the labyrinth block with pikes in the floor both took awhile), I loved that there were so many bosses, instead of most of the game is fighting the usual minotaurs, soldiers, and satyrs trying to get where you need to go. Instead there are tons of secondary bosses, primary bosses, and strategy/puzzles on top of the usual fighting (which don't get me wrong, is still a pleasure)...it just feels like a lot less button smashing in this one. The one beef that I have with the game is that the story took a turn for the worst near the end. However, the story was awesome and fluid up until that point (I think most people who've played will know the point I'm talking about). I sort of suspected they would have to do something like that to end it, but felt like they could have been a little more creative, especially since everything else has been second-to-none."
5.0	I'll never buy a subscription from the Xbox live store again.
5.0	I keep hearing trash-talk about this game and its successors. I don't know why. Excellent combat and control meet adaptive difficulty, cerebral puzzles, refreshing looks at many folkloric creatures, and a fascinating origin story. What minor peeves I have with it are my own, personal problems. If you're looking for a rip-roaring good time and aren't a purist about the Castlevania mythos, this is for you!
5.0	Great fit for my daughter's 3DS XL! She is thrilled!
5.0	Exactly what I wanted! Thank you.
5.0	I really like these chargers and if they ever make chat pads for the xbox one I don't have to take them off to charge my paddles.
5.0	Nice charger overall, this is easy to use and fully functional. I always have my controllers ready to play and game any time fully charged, not worried about the battery power. Great quality.
5.0	I have absolutely no complaints good story good characters good mini games just watch out twords the end thers one paert that might startle some people.
5.0	quality was better than i expected! sleek/premium look and feel to the case. very happy with the purchase. thanks a lot
5.0	Age of Empires is the best strategy/war game ever!  But you gonna need time to play.. coz takes some hours to play..! you know, until you make an army and kill you oponent..  but is very fun! and try the multiplayer game, and we will see if you have the best strategy.....   hope helped you.
5.0	I never owned this game but my sister did so I borrowed it from her. Let me tell you, I just LOVED this game to pieces. The first Kingdom Hearts game was great (very great) but there was one little thing you couldn't do in the first game, skipping the cut scenes. I loved the cut scenes but not being able to skip them was a little painful (mostly at the first battle with Ansem in Hallow Bastion.) The makers of Kingdom Hearts II did a fantastic job with the worlds especially the Lion King world Pride Rock.     I would be more than happy to give this game a 10 out of 10. Great scenes, voice acting, battles, and worlds. Oh, let's not forget music (thank you for making that music boss level for Ursula Kingdom Hearts people) and I'm really psyched up for Birth By Sleep to come out this summer.     Those of who have not played this game before, I suggest you do.
5.0	Exactly what you pay for, awesome quality with a nice design. COMPLETELY WIRELESS!!!!<br />Simply a great head set for the more serious gamers!
5.0	realmente este juego se la trae con sus imágenes y gráficos son magnifico del juego muy bueno, lo recomiendo a todos, gracias.
5.0	... it works great for working with normal office stuff too.  At least my wife claims it does.  Goes well with her back lit keyboard.
5.0	fits like a glove! easy to install and tough as nails! i would buy again and this is my second one
5.0	This is a great game. One very DEEP game. 2K put alot of effort and thought into Bio-Shock and it shows. Shadowing is amazing, weapons are balanced and the plasmids are just plain fun! Hopefully there will be some downloadable content cause I want some more action in Rapture.
5.0	Game looks fantastic! Just like the original, brings back great memories!
5.0	Great graphics, excellent sense of 'speed' and three difficulty settings (simple, realistic, simulator).  Planes look great and you can customize them to some degree.  This is the first game I've played online in multiplayer and it's a lot of fun - even when I get shot down by the other players!  Lots to do and they've released a couple of DLCs too.  After playing this I went back and purchased IL-2.  If you like these you should give Apache a try as well, same company but with a modern AH-64 gunship instead of WWII Warbirds.
5.0	I'm really enjoying the game. The combat is great, but it is repetitive. It reminds me of Dynasty Warriors. I can't understand all of the story yet, so I'm just going to talk about the gameplay and art. Let's get the fan service out of the way. There's a lot of fan service in this game and normally if something has too much fan service it'll usually get on my nerves. I've played nearly 30 hours of this game and the fan service is still funny. It's just so over the top that I can't help but laugh at the absurdity. Like I said before the gameplay is repetitive, but you unlock more combos as you level up and there are 3 modes for each character that have different movesets.<br /><br />TLDR<br />The art is fantastic, the gameplay is fun but repetitive, and fan service is way over the top to the point where it's just funny.<br />I love this game and recommend it to anyone that enjoys Dynasty Warriors.
5.0	LOVE IT! great product.  You peoples should buy.
5.0	"Titan Quest is an Awesome game!  Like all previous reviewers say \\""this is like Diablo II, only improved\\"".   <br /> <br />Definitely take the Nature skill and put points into the Sylvan Nymph - she kicks butt.  Max her points and the 2 skills above her.  She protects you well.  The wolves are a help too.  The Nymph and Wolves stay with you until their health runs out (a good many fights), not for a set duration like Diablo II.   <br /> <br />The hotkeys are much better. They sit along the bottom of the screen, right click on a numbered box and assign a skill from the popup.  9 & 0 are your health and mana potions, you can assign 1-8 as skills.   <br /> <br />The places you visit are so much nicer, not so dark and brooding like Diablo II.  Egypt, Babylon, Greece, and that whole region is so bright and beautiful.   <br /> <br />Don't get me wrong, Diablo II is Awesome.  I've played it countless times with all the characters and will be first in line for Diablo III.  Titan Quest is a wonderful and refreshing game to tide me over until Diablo III is released.  If you loved Diablo - Buy this game."
5.0	My seven year old has been begging for a DSi for a long time.  I was able to purchase this bundle as a pre-order and also recieved a $25 gift certificate, you can't beat that price.  We all ready have the game that was included in the bundle and my kids LOVE it.  Worth every penny and they can spend hours playing it.  Who doesn't love a good Mario game?      The green is sharp and unique and I'm really hoping it will help keep my son from losing it :)  We got him the Yoshi kit to go with it.  It looks great!
5.0	Great prices and products fast shipping A+++++&
5.0	great addition to the wii, family has a lot of fun and even get some exercise for the games, not all are played from the couch.
5.0	very nice, thanks for your assist happy new year for all you . . . . . . . .
5.0	fun like all Lego games only I'm still on the hobbit so can't really comment too much on this game not yet at least
5.0	[[VIDEOID:moJXSZSYWT0VSE]]In spite of the fact that it is not a recent game, it continues being one of the games with better graphs, faster, and mas addictive of the console playstation 3, I recommend it, his music performs the better thing, and if you have a tv in high definition, can be one of your better games
5.0	Ghost Recon 2: Summit Strike is a must have game for the xbox. This game is Difficult, thanks to some of the best A.I. programmed to date!  <br /> <br />Fan's of the original games in the Ghost Recon series will be somewhat disappointed at the game play changes, i.e. you now only have a single team of ghosts and you can no longer jump between any team members.  <br /> <br />Cooperative multiplayer is where this game really shines. The A.I. has been done so well that even a full squad of real thinking humans will have difficulty completing many of the missions. <br /> <br />This entry to the Ghost Recon catalog is a fine addition and is a must play for all the Ghost Recon fan's as well as anyone with an xbox that enjoys a very well made challenging game.
5.0	"Buy Portal.  Play Portal.  Love Portal.    The other games in the package are worth playing, if only to say you did it, but I'm not as big of a fan of Half Life 2 as the rest of the world is.  I don't play online games, so Team Fortress 2 has no appeal.  I do, however, love Portal.  Imagine, if you will, a science fiction short story in video game form.  You will think, you will question, you will laugh, and you will do it all in around 3 1/2 hours... on your first play through.    If you're not familiar with the premise, the game involves you moving through an obstacle filled environment using only your wits, a gun that rips a hole in space-time... and the trusty Apature Science weighted companion cube.  All the while you are instructed by a disembodied, somewhat malfunctioning robotic voice.  I won't give anything away, but suffice it to say that this voice steals the show.      Portal includes a few gameplay variations that add more depth to the fairly easy single player puzzles.  My favorite of which, doing each of the 6 chambers in the least amount of portals, kept me playing for close to 10 hours by themselves.  The challenge levels added another few hours and I've played through the single player just to hear the dialog a few times.  It's a marvelous game and a perfect example of what a game can accomplish with excellent writing.    The portal gun itself is used to great effect.  The puzzles range from intuitive and fun (\\""flinging\\"") to ridiculously challenging and fulfilling.  The creative range you have to solve the puzzles is huge and dwarfs even what you are capable of doing in games like Crysis or GTA.  The fact that the game is entirely non-violent is also a significant plus for me.    I would like to point out that Steam's failings are greatly overexaggerated.  When HL2 was first released, Steam did, in fact, blow chum, but now is harmless and even functional.  You can open the Steam menu in any game you'd like, giving you access to your friend's list,giving us PC gamers the closest thing to Xbox Live we can get, closer even than Microsoft's own Windows Live.  If you don't believe me, you can download Steam and try it with non-Steam games first to see if you love it or hate it.  When you've gotten over that, buy Portal and experience the greatest source of Internet memes since Family Guy."
5.0	"I initially purchased Call of Duty 2 and Perfect Dark Zero when I got my xbox 360.  We celebrated christmas a little early and I got Kameo.  What a refreshing experience!  I can't believe that this game hasn't gotten more hype.  It can be compared to a \\""Mario 64\\"" type of experience.  Now this game doesn't have the pure awe inspiring power of mario 64 nor is it as long but what it does have is the platform/adventure aspect that I love in so many games.  This game is just simply fun!  I haven't beat it yet but I heard its rather short around 10 hours which is already telling me that I'm going to be dissappointed when this great ride ends.  The graphics are amazing and seeing hundreds of Trolls running at you on screen is unbelievable and shows some of what is to come once the 2nd generation titles begin to come out for the xbox 360.  I love the water effects and the fact that I have to morph into different characters in order to complete certain objectives.  For example in one area a fire demon is attacking me so I turn into deep blue and spray him with water until I put out his fire.  Then I morph into pummel weed and knock him out with an uppercut.  My favorite warrior to morph into is this armadillo looking creature which rolls into a ball.  it brings back fond memories of marble madness and I roll him around and reminds me of sonic the hedgehog as I build up his spin move and go barrelling into enemies sending them flying like bowling pins.  This really is a fun game and such a nice break from firing machine guns and killing germans or sneaking around the facilites at datadyne.  I really highly recommend at least renting this game to see what else your new 360 has to offer.  I don't think you'll be dissappointed spending a weekend beating this game."
5.0	Classic formula. Pretty hard to screw up a pokemon game.
5.0	The first time I thought it would be hard to get used to it, but once you see all the ways that control can be used, you got in love.
5.0	Great service and great product...
5.0	I bought it last year for 360 and again for Xbox One and was not disappointed ether time great game.
5.0	Our girls (ages 20 & 23) spent most of Christmas afternoon dancing to this!  A great workout and loads of fun!!
5.0	Seeing as how most of the reviews for this item are back when HD-DVD was still in production, I thought it might be helpful to write a review after the fall of the HD-DVD format.  In my estimation, this remains a great value even today.  As you can see, you can pick up used versions of this unit for fairly cheap (I got mine for $20).  Microsoft continues to support the players, so even with the latest xbox update, you can rest assured that this unit will still work.  In addition, many of the HD-DVD movies can be found fairly easily for pretty cheap.  Most movies can be found for less than $5, many of them even 2 or 3.  Obviously, most people won't want all of the movies that were released on HD-DVD, but you'll definitely find a few favorites.  I've saved over $170 from buying HD-DVD movies verses Blu Ray.  There are even a select few that have yet to be released on Blu Ray.  As far as sound and picture quality goes, they are every bit as good as their Blu Ray counterparts.  Due to the xbox's capibilities, you don't actually get the full audio quality, but the difference is so minimal that you would only know if you had a $1,000 sound system and the two movies side by side.  The picture quality is amazing.  Most titles, you won't even need to find the DVD to compare, you'll know instantly that it's a vast improvement.  Since the drive is an extension to your xbox, most universal remotes will work with the play, pause, skip, etc. functions on the movies.  If nothing else, you can consider this an extra drive for your xbox to quickly switch from playing a game to watching a movie.  But for the dirt cheap cost of these drives, it's a wise investment.
5.0	While it has it's online woes, this game is simply the best basketball game out there and has been the one next gen game i keep coming back to day after day.
5.0	I have taught my 3 year old nephew how to play, and he loves I enjoy it also.<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Teri
5.0	I own two of these - one on a Mac at home, and one on a Windows PC at work. It is, in my opinion, an absolutely fantastic mouse for the price. I use it for programming and typical office/home use, not for gaming, and for my uses, it's a great mouse at a really great price. Note that the instructions are all in Chinese, but... well, odds are, you know how to plug a mouse into a computer. I use USB Overdrive on the Mac to get it to recognize all of the buttons. It works fine as-shipped on a PC.
5.0	We owned an original Nintendo DS for two years - we bought it right when it released in December 2004. When I first saw the DS Lite at E3 in 2006, I was thrilled. The game great handheld unit design - but lighter! Brighter! Tuned! It really showed that Nintendo had been paying attention to customer feedback during those two years, and had tweaked its unit to be even better than before.<br /><br />First, the weight. We always *loved* the design of the DS, with its folding top. As PSP owners, I can't tell you how many time that poor PSP screen gets dinged or scratched. We had to buy extra carrying cases for our PSP and get screen protectors. In comparison, the DS's clamshell design means the screen is perfectly protected when you tote it around in your pocket or purse. The only down-side was that it was a bit heavy. With the DS lite, they keep the protection of the clamshell and also lighten up the unit significantly. It really does help a lot.<br /><br />The screen brightness - with it being *adjustable* - is an incredibly helpful update. Sometimes you're playing outside in very bright light. Sometimes you're playing in full dark, staying awake in bed. There are all levels in between. If you need that brightness, you don't care if you're burning up your battery power. If you do NOT need that brightness, why kill your battery for no reason? Having that ability to adjust really means that your battery works as best as it possibly can.<br /><br />We play several games that use the microphone, like Brain Age, and it definitely helps to have it in the center. Usually you're holding the unit with both hands, centered on your face. To have your mouth pointed right at the microphone helps out greatly with those games.<br /><br />In general the DS system is a fantastic handheld gaming system. We have both the DS and PSP and we play both frequently. Many of the games on the DS aren't available on the PSP and are a ton of fun. The Brain Age / Big Brain Academy / similar games stand out as games we enjoy daily. There are many other games that use the DS touch screen extremely well, giving a full interactivity of gameplay. Yes, the PSP has better graphics. It's something that the DS compromised on. They have less detailed graphics, but more interactivity. Both are great for the games they offer. So for example we play flight simulator style games on our PSP, where the high end graphics matter, and we play puzzle / platform / thinking games on the DS, where the interactivity and plot is more key.<br /><br />I highly recommend the DS Lite for anybody who doesn't have a DS yet - whether you have a PSP or not. It's not an either-or situation. It's like having a stereo and a TV set. They're both great for their own reasons, and most people would enjoy having both.<br /><br />If you HAVE a Nintendo DS already and are wondering if you should get a Lite, it really depends on how much you use it away from home. The primary benefit here is the lighter carrying weight, smaller size and much better battery life. If you're carrying it in your pocket, purse or backpack every day, I would really recommend getting a Lite. You can always give your original DS away to a friend or relative as a present, or sell it on eBay. The DSs are still in high demand and would be much loved by a new recipient.tand out as games we enjoy daily.

5.0	Not really neccessary, 16gb is probably enough considering the vita has a max number of icons. But better safe than sorry.
5.0	If your computer can run it, this is a GREAT game / sim. Amazon was $20 cheaper than anywhere else. Flight Sim X Deluxe will keep you entertained for hours and hours.  There are plenty of expansion packs from other software companies, so you can make it even more detailed if you wish. I've added a stealth bomber and several other military aircraft & helicopters. Online play is great too.  I HIGHLY recommend this title.
5.0	Exceptional effort from Naughty Dog, Uncharted 2 is probably the first game to perfectly blend the gaming and movies media. From the first opening scene and to the ending 15 hours later - this is a game that starts on a very high note and never misses the beat. Uncharted 1 was a very good effort too and it's good that Naughty Dog didn't just create a quick sequel, but actually went back to understand what they did right and what they didn't. Story has been developed more, hand combat is actually useful and - as mentioned earlier - gameplay has been changed to fit a movie script more than a game.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and buy this game! If you ever played Tomb Raider or watched Indiana Jones movies, you will enjoy this game!
5.0	having this remote is so much easier than using the game controler for movies and other settings!
5.0	I enjoyed every level of the Mercenary expansion pack. I highly recommend it to and Descent fan who has not played it.
5.0	I got this for the Ps4 and to use with my smartphone.  To be honest, I don't have any other headsets to compare it to, but I think it sounds great.  Comfort is fine, doesn't feel too heavy, sized not too big or too small. just feels a little hot around the ears after a while.  It folds to make it more compact which is a really nice feature.  Wish there was a way to connect to my smartphone wirelessly but no big deal.
5.0	I've used this all 4 years in my Japanese classes. I majored in Japanese language and literature and having this shaved many hours off of homework. Was great when I didn't know how to read kanji or if I was looking up definitions! Plus it is much cheaper than an electronic dictionary if you already own a DS. I used it on the DS Lite and on the 3DS.
5.0	I have always wanted to play this game and I love the graphics and new swift sail that was added to the he version
5.0	My whole family enjoyed playing --the one time we tried it.  I'm finding that I just don't have the time to try to save my brain...or maybe I just can't remember!
5.0	producted came in perfect shape no issues
5.0	Great condition, shipped quickly. I love being able to play a game that I grew up with, the memories are awesome. This game does not disappoint.
5.0	I picked this game up the day I bought my Wii. I had the original X-box versions and I played both of the starwars games on it.  I was able to beat the first but never really had enough time to play the second. I was so excited to see the Complete Saga when I picked up my Wii.     The graphics are better than earlier versions. I have my Wii hooked up with component cables so that might make it a little better itself. I noticed it in the 1st door, Negotiations of Episode 1. If you look you on the floor when walking around you can see your reflection.     The game is much faster also.  When you are refecting blaster fire from the enemy it bounces back much faster. The Pod racing is Super fast thought they did make it a little to easy to beat Subulba.      There are also a lot of new things you can do and buy in the game. It added quit a few hours to the overall completion.    And of course. Using the Wiimote as a light saber. Ok it isn't all its cracked up to be.  It takes a while to get used to and even then I doesn't always work the way you want it to. I reverted to using the B button and every once and a while swinging the remote.      Overall all a great game with a lot of  improvments. If you have kids this is the game for them.
5.0	Four guns blazing fast,<br />Beautiful combination,<br />well done combo moves.
5.0	Awesome, son loves it. He waited and it was worth it. Can't get him off the wii<br />Good luck and have fun
5.0	Todo muy gracias, el regalo de mis ahijados... esta perfecto para ellos y toda la familia.. .. . . . .
5.0	I love this game u must get it!!! or else:-)
5.0	I bought this game for my 9 year old son and he has enjoyed it. It is good for both single play as well as 2 player battle.
5.0	I really really really love the Uncharted Game Franchise  I also love Naughty Dog. The graphics in this game is so Next Gen it's like your playing a movie I couldn't put this game down I had to play it over and over I'm in the process of getting all 3 titles but if you are a Naughty Dog fan I Highly recommend this franchise!!!!
5.0	"All the Zelda fanatics (including myself) had our worries when we saw the cel-shaded graphics Nintendo was bringing to the new Zelda title. But if I have learned anything about the BIG 'N' over the years it is to never doubt them when it comes to their various video game franchises. This company has proved time and time again they are capable of making games that not only provide fun, and entertainment, but continually push the limits, and they aren't afraid to try something new. Nintendo has single handedly redefined the Action Adventure genre once again with this latest Zelda offering \\""The Wind Waker\\"".  The game combines all of the elements that made \\""Ocarina of Time\\"" a hit (and widely regarded as one of the best games ever made), and improved on them significantly. For example: the control elements of this game such as combat are absolutely fun. I could spend days just fighting enemies (knights most notably). Most of the familiar weapons and accessories make a come back in the game including some new ones.  One of the greatest things about Nintendo's Zelda series is the fact that you don't have to be familiar with prequel titles to enjoy the new offerings.  \\""Wind Waker\\"" thrives as a standalone title, but also includes many characters, areas and even music and sound that will provide plenty of nostalgia for the seasoned Zelda vet. Sound and music in this game is on-par with other Zelda titles of the past. The themes are very upbeat, and continuously fit the mood of the current situation. Many musical tracks and sound effects make a return from games like \\""Ocarina of Time\\"" and \\""A Link To The Past\\"".  Nintendo probably could have done orchestrated score rather then midi which they seem to like using, but again the music in the game is gorgeous and I wouldn't touch it. And finally the Cel-Shaded graphics: they are absolutely BEAUTIFUL! Anyone who doubted this game will forget everything they said when they start playing it. The world comes to life like no other game Ihave ever played and is absolutely unrivaled in interactivity, and not only that but the world is HUGE. A cartoon it may be, but the realisim of this game WILL astound you. Bright, vibrant and beautiful the graphics are impossible not to appreciate. The game has few drawbacks some people may not appreciate that this game is not quite as hard as some of the past Zelda games, but it's all about puzzles and using your head, and in that aspect the game delivers again and again. Still others may not like using the wind waker which can be a minor inconvenience at times. There are also many side-quests in the game that have link racing from one island to another. Some don't like backtracking so far for so little, but it all helps bring the game together. Nintendo has done it again \\""The Wind Waker\\"" is the best game available for the gamecube and the biggest reason to pick one up. Buy this game!!"
5.0	The price was amazing ad my daughter is very happy with the product.  Thank you very much for selling this product to us.
5.0	We bought this as a gift for our son based on excellent results from exams<br />he is quite pleased and spends hours (only weekends LOL of  course and holidays)<br />I have  observed the quality of the game, excellent<br />Also  bought the the Fifa 2013, he's a happy camper
5.0	purchased for my grandson who loves rpg's,<br />these games provide a battle/conquest format<br />that enables him to fight and not get in trouble<br />with mom.
5.0	1st game in a long time (Maybe the only) That I actually didn't feel ripped off after paying full price for a new game. Trey and Matt put a lot of thought into every aspect of this game. Funny and fun to play.
5.0	Son says it was a tough game but he might be young for the game
5.0	I like this nifty little case. It's very simple and gets the job done and it looks good too. However, I'd recommend you just buy one at a store (gamestop, Wal-Mart, etc.) instead of ordering it.
5.0	Disgaea isn't for the player's new to this genre.  Though, some may be able to manage. <br /> <br />Disgaea is the story of the demon prince, Laharl.  After sleeping for 2 years, he learns that his father, the demon overlord, has croaked.  Throw in his wise cracking vassal and team of prinnies (Penguin doods) and you have the beginning of the game, which basically is loot castles for the time being and be a selfish little demon.  Along the way an Angel Trainee, Flonne, is sent to assassinate the king, only to learn he's already dead.  So after she evades the ragtag prince and his gang, she makes herself a new mission to learn if demon's can love.  Hilarity ensues naturally.
5.0	I was hesitant at first, because of the low price for these.  My original thought before I made the purchase was that these cables were going to fall apart when I plugged them into the back of my TV.  Well I was completely wrong.  These cables a very well made and the plastic around the main cable is very thick and sturdy.
5.0	this game is AMAZING. i literally play this game non-stop for four hours.(in a good way) this game is so fun and when you get to pimp out your mansion, it's great. you buy cool boats, and cool cars. great game
5.0	"Cooperative play was always something that was lacking in the earlier Mario games.  In earlier days, \\""multiplayer\\"" usually meant \\""turn based\\"" and was a huge turn-off for casual gamers.  With the reinvention of the \\""multiplayer\\"" concept into \\""cooperative\\"" play, the game provides a great time with die-hard Mario fans and casual gamers alike.<br /><br />The subtle Mario hints and tricks for die-hard Mario fans are a plus, and provide an extra dimension of game play.  Highly recommended."
5.0	A+++ great price & fast shipping
5.0	"Just picked up this game yesterday after reading the reviews on here and I have to say I am glad I did. To say that this game fully immerses you in the play would be an understatement. The controls are so intuitive, so after a few minutes of figuring everything out you'll be on your way to blasting....viruses? Whatever the heck it is your shooting I'll tell you its a lot of fun.    Also, as a \\""hardcore gamer\\"" I expected this game to be big on the colors, music, and explosions but lacking in story. From what I saw yesterday (granted I only played for about an hour) there actually appears to be a decent storyline in place. This game is exactly the kind of thing that Kinect was made for...if you are on the fence or if you have been waiting for Kinect to finally come out with something good go grab this game and play it; you won't be disappointed."
5.0	I attached the Advanced AV pack to my system last night and it really was like night and day. The S-Video connection to my Sony WEGA (non-progressive, non-HDTV) brought a much cleaner image.<br />However, the highlight is the TOSLINK optical connector. I moved an optical cable from my CD player to the Xbox Advanced AV pack (it's cool, the protective plug just gets pushed away - no little part to lose) and turned the Xbox back on.<br />I changed the settings in the Xbox audio to enable DD 5.1 and DTS, then loaded Halo. It's just incredible. Voices are directionally accurate, the overall sound quality is awesome.<br />If you've already invested in a compatible TV, receiver and an Xbox, the Advanced AV pack will double the quality of your investment.
5.0	This was a great little case. The games snap into place so they can't fall out when the case is opened. Very worth it!
5.0	Even with the graphics cards found in MacBooks and Mac Minis, this game works great. Simply lower the gfx settings slightly. It still looks beautiful, and runs smooth. I recommend it to anyone who's enjoyed the series in the past, or someone interested in the franchise.
5.0	Above my expectations, delivery quick....Grandson loves game.  Thank you for your service.
5.0	brand new with no issues, plays just the way i wanted it too. i loved this game, and i still do.
5.0	My boyfriend and I love playing this game together. Were so competitive and the different levels and carts and characters are perfect for us. It was a good few months of entertainment before we beat the game.
5.0	great game too bad the 4th is 3ds only
1.0	I got this to play my PS3 because my PS3 controller broke and this seemed like a more affordable solution.  ALL of the buttons are not mapped correctly. X is O, square is triangle, L1 is R1, R3 is start.  EVERYTHING is wrong and makes this useless. There is no way to fix it.  Waste of money.  Even if it was only 3 dollars.  That 3 dollars could have bought me a cheeseburger or something.  Thanks a lot.
1.0	"This may well be one of the best games of the year. For that matter it may well be one of the best FPS games to date! But I'll never get to experience it's full glory due to the crippling DRM.    The \\""security\\"" feature built into the game supposedly allows you to install the game on 3 computers. What they dont tell you is installing any new hardware, or even upgrading a video driver will cause an new license to be used. Even if they told you, there is no way to deauthorize the computer because that feature has not yet been developed... Wow. Thats pretty important to the entire DRM system right? Leave the honest customer an out? Well EA doesnt care about you. Heres how I spent my 3 install activations:    1: Install the game and run it one time. Game activates.  2: Buy new video card, install it, run game. Game reactivates again!  3: Loan video card out to friend, use old video card, run game, Game reactivates again!  ?: Put my new video card back in, run game, no more activations left.     Thanks EA! You just stole $30 from me! Thats what I get for being honest. So from now on I will be forced to either pirate games using this DRM, or just boycott those games all together. Either way, not another penny of my money will go toward anything with \\""activations\\"" based DRM. It only seems fair to steal a game from EA now that they have stolen $30 from me for a game I cannot play.    So what was the game like? Well, the menus looked nice, and the first 20 mins of the game was fun. Very nice looking, but I cant really say much. I didnt get to experience much of it. I recommend EVERYONE STAY AWAY FROM THIS TITLE at least until a patch is released to remove the DRM, if that ever happens."
1.0	Game does not work...Going to send back.
1.0	I bought these just two days ago from Target. The sound is incredible, I can not think of anything better than the sound on this headset. I used it on MW3 and BF3 for a few hours and then shut the PS3 off. I took extremelly good care and caution with this headset. Later on I plugged the headset back and there was NO SOUND at all. I triple checked all PS3 settings, I tried everything. The mic still works, but NO SOUND FROM THE HEADSET SPEAKERS!! I plugged it to my PC and sound do comes off the speakers but really low making it unusable. The AMPLIFIER VOLUME and CHAT functions do notwork either. This is definitelly going back to Target. I read all reviews of ALL other Turtle Beach headsets, and I agree the sound is top notch, it is IMPRESSIVE, but these products seem to have a very short life,(ALL MODELS SHOW POOR BUILD QUALITY, READ the REVIEWS), so I will look foward for the Sony Official PS3 headset for peace of mind.
1.0	I can't figure out the point of this game...
1.0	I could never get all four to work at the same time, as plugging in more than two devices would make everything stop working.
1.0	Bought came in today no cords. No controller just the system.... Sending back !!!!!!
1.0	This product never worked!  Power never made it to the Wii.  Then the connection to the Wii fell apart, with wires loose.  Completely unusable.  Retun policy was to use original packaging--a flimsy plastic bag that was unusable after being opened.  This product was not merely inexpensive; it was CHEAP!
1.0	I got this item as a Christmas present for my daughter. As soon as she tried to plug a controller in it broke. It won't even pick up the wireless controllers that came with it either. The seller contacted me about the item and when I told them about the problem they asked if was defective or if we broke it. When I told them it had to be a defective item because it short circutted as soon as we plugged in a regular controller, I never heard back from them. Save your money and buy something else from someone else.
1.0	It does not fit on the xbox and it says it will, even asked before we bought. Very disappointed with description and item.
1.0	THIS DOES NOT WORK.  I'VE TRIED ALL THE TRICKS OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND AS OF NOW.. I STILL CANNOT GET IT TO WORK.  THIS IS GARBAGE AND NYKO DOES NOT RETURN EMAILS OR CALLS OR EVEN CARE ABOUT THEIR CUSTOMERS!!! DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!
1.0	It came in the mail with cheap packageing and the screw portion was broken. I didn't see the yellow broken off yellow piece in the package or anywhere where I opened it. To cheap to return it so I will write it off. The orginal part on my PSP still kind of works so I will continue to just use that.
1.0	By far the most fun and stress you will EVER receive from a video game. Be prepared for 10 new bugs everyday, with 10 more waiting behind each of those 10.
1.0	I was very disappointed with this game.  I had never done zumba before and was looking forward to learning.  When going through the training tutorials they would start out uber uber slow and then about the 5th step in it would speed up to be so fast that there was no way someone new to this could follow the moves let alone learn them.  I gave up on the tutorials and decided to just start trying to do one of the classes.  This too was frustrating.  I expected it to tell you how well you are doing with the movements but it doesn't seem to register that at all.  I have tried using this game multiple multiple times and have gotten so frustrated every time that I have finally given up on it and I sold it at work.  Would not recommend this to anyone.
1.0	"For you long time gamers, you may recall a little game called \\""Spaceward Ho\\"".  It is amazing that after years of improvements in processing power, AI coding, video and audio improvements, this game is no more than a glorified, and far more expensive version of the old classic (which was a fine game for its time).  My advice, for those without the time to read all this, find a copy of Spaceward Ho and play that instead.  I was very much looking forward to a new space based strategy game.  The genre has been lacking for some time, especially with the intense focus on pure RTS types of games.  Sword, from the box and some of the articles I read, seemed to be that game.  My mistake.  The manual is poorly written.  I grant that it gives you information on each icon in the game, but as for getting things done, how to accomplish things and the relative benefits of one action or item over another, it is woefully lacking.  The combat interface is terrible, to say the least.  Controlling your own ships and seeing what is going on is difficult at best.  Your POV is limited to the picture from a single ship (yours or the enemy's) if your ship is in the wrong place to see what is going on (it mistakenly or randomly wandered off), oh well, guess you'll just have to hope.  The orders you have are very limited, and often are not followed by the ships you give them to.  The so-called 3-D combat is really nothing more than a 3-D picture on which you fight in a single plane, i.e., 2-D without the clarity of what the heck is happening.  Industry and planetary economy?  A few sliders and pie charts.  How much do you want to spend on ship building vs. terraforming vs. industry vs. income/research?  That's it.  Research?  I like the way the research tree is developed, one of the few benefits to the game.  However, there is no real information on what the research buys you (yes, weapons have little bar charts showing how great they are, but the bars don't relate to anything concrete, moredamage, but how much more, etc.).  Ok, I get green lasers instead of red, but how much better are they?  How strong are those extra strong hulls, how much faster will I make things with that industry improvement?  With no knowledge of the relative value of one improvement over another, it is difficult to direct research intelligently.  Ship design.  Looks pretty, but here the problems with research, industry, and combat come to roost.  You can't refit ships, so rebuilding your entire fleet may be needed whenever you make a major breakthrough (or is it?  how much better was that again?).  Building a sizeable fleet takes some time, and having it obsoleted every so often is a tooth grinding feeling.  How about diplomacy?  The options here are pitiful.  War, nothing (peace), non-aggression, and allied.  Little insight as to why one race will ally or non-agression with you when another won't and the classic problem of no apparent (maybe yes, maybe no) repercussions from a race breaking treaties with you (or you with them) are rife.  You can give some funds to allies only, but do nothing otherwise to influence those who aren't your allies, by direct choice at least.  Not worth the trouble, and I'd like the money and 30 or more hours I spent on the game back please."
1.0	My son bought this with some Christmas money and he loved it.  That is until he came to me the other day telling me it needed charging.  Sadly, it does not take batteries.  I fiddled around with it in the best &#34;I'm a dad, let me see what I can do manner&#34; but it was not to be.  Simply stopped working.  Money down the drain minus a few months worth of use.
1.0	This game went downhill after 2009 infinity ward forgot about its players and the multi-player is ruined. All the player online are either tenth prestige and use hacks or are a so called 11th prestige and are also hackers anyone who reads this review try the battlefield series it is a different expierience than call of duty and is a bit more challenging!!!
1.0	Don't bother with these cases at all.  While the price and ship time is good the quality is not.  Compared to the official Nintendo cases these are very poor.  The cases have trouble closing and the clear plastic that holds the cover art is thin and flimsy.  When I get around to purchasing some official Nintendo cases its safe to say I will just be throwing these out.  Very disappointed.  I like doing business with Amazon but this is a purchase I would take back.
1.0	My mother ordered these and came in paperback, wrinkled pages, and one of the books was upside down like they have been used! Not giving them as a gift and will be returned!
1.0	I wanted to like this game, I really did... but alas, I couldn't. There are many good aspects in his game, and it definitely deserves more than one star, but the creators of this game forgot the key part in video games that makes it entertaining: the player... by this I mean that you literally don't have to even use the controller throughout the game... where is the fun in that? Though it was entertaining, it was ineffective in interacting with the person playing,which Is what video gaming is all about. To look on the bright side, the story was great and the music was very inspiring, though repetitive.<br />What made me the least upset was that the game didn't let you lose the entire time, even if you messed up. I even tried to die a couple times... but I failed to fail. So basically, the game wasn't challenging. I was expec<br />ting a game full of choices, not a movie.
1.0	Took me a day to activate it because i entered the activation wrong , otherwise it's great. Also the uplay achievements don't work.
1.0	Well, having finished the game, I thought it only right that I share my opinion with those who might be ready to buy it.  I am THOROUGHLY disappointed.  I have completed the game in it's entirety in less than 3 hours of gameplay!  The graphics are decent, but not that good and certainly not cutting edge.  The cinematics are ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE.  It's hard to describe it, but they look almost foggy, as if someone smeared virtual vaseline on the virtual lens that was shooting them.  I didn't have any high expectations for this game because I thought it would be like most movie-based games --really, really bad.  Well, I have to say that it sinks even below those expectations.  I can't believe I paid [money]for this game.  I feel dirty.
1.0	I was so excited to hear this game would come out on Xbox, since I already have the PC game.  What a disappointment.  If you already have the PC version don't even think of buying the XBox game.  Completely slow and uncontrollable with a lot of functions missing, this game is a big disappointment.
1.0	Wouldn't work with Xbox 360 without some add on attachments and online connections.  Should have said that in bold print. I sent it back.
1.0	This is the worst game I've ever played to date! It plays and feels like it was made on a micro budget and is more homemade than a polished product. Avoid even if you can get it for free!!!
1.0	The instructions seem simple, and the design foolproof. The only problem is when you try to use the little &#34;scrape pad&#34; they give you, which is a folded piece of cardboard that rips and scratches the soft plastic screen filter. They have effectively sabotaged their own product.<br /><br />I contacted Amazon seller &#34;game-ware&#34; and they wouldn't refund despite the circumstances. I was offered another for half price, a very bogus trade for a bunk product, in my opinion.<br /><br />I ordered another since it seems to be of good quality. Will be using an alternate &#34;scrape pad&#34; this time around.
1.0	This controller is bad. The day I received it, it was bad. The controller was not working as good as i read it was. You have to move the cable a lot in order for it to work. Also when you play, the controller can get u mad because it disconnects by itself in the middle of anything.
1.0	"First of all you'll need a video card that supports pixel shader 2.0 or higher or you won't see many of the eye popping graphics featured in the screenshots, such as water, weather, your \\""good\\"" alignment effects, sun and moon, ants, the list goes on. <br />That being said, thats all this game really is - eye candy. <br />It only resembles the 1st game on the surface. Once you get into it you find out that its been \\""dumbed\\"" down - ALOT. <br />The first map will have a tutorial on how to move your mouse left. Then it will teach you how to move your mouse right. Then Up. Then down. And thats just getting started on moving the mouse. You'll spend parts of the following 2 maps on tutorials as well that you can't bypass. <br />As for gameplay, the creature has lost all personality. Its now more robotic in nature as your training involves petting (or slapping) it to move a slider bar which determines to what degree it will or wont do something. Its basically \\""set it and forget it\\"" You cannot teach it miracles anymore. You simply purchase them. You cannot control it in fights with other creatures like the first game. They duke it out on their own while you just watch. <br />The entire belief system is gone and your influence ring is now determined by your most outer edge buildings. <br />You either spend all your time building cities to impress nearby towns to join you or building an army to take them over by force. <br />Neither method is challenging and gets boring very quickly. There are only 3 unit types for armies and they are limited to move, attack, defend, get on walls, and disband. There was some strategy in the first game but you wont find it here. The enemy AI is horrible. It simply sends out wave after wave of platoons to your city walls whether it had the resources for them or not. It will also ignore you when you attack their towns unless you get close enough to the actual platoon itself. The enemy will also constantly taunt you endlessly. Many of the featuresthat were promised didn't make it into the game and there is no multiplayer. I waited for this game for 4 years and its a huge disappointment and a step backwards. Unless you enjoy a game for its graphical presentation well over its gameplay, length, and replay value, save your money and avoid this title."
1.0	the speakers went out after 6 days
1.0	this product appears to be very cheaply built.  when attaching it to the controller it broke.  It was a complete waste of money
1.0	I pre-ordered this game back on October 24th and it said I would have the game by the release date of November 9th. I still never got my call of duty black ops hardened edition and it is now November 17th. Just because of this I will never pre-order another game on amazon. They do not ship as promised and do not provide feedback in the event a shipment date has slipped. Unreliable online store.
1.0	It doesn't work on my modest 2.8ghz p4 with 1.5 gb ram machine.  Buy at your own risk.  It also gives errors of the same type I have to many other users according to the forums.
1.0	This game doesn't seem to work with the remotes, the nunchucks, or the balance board.  I'm doing what it tells me to, and nothing happens on the screen.  Right now, I am sitting at my computer typing this review and Jillian Michaels is telling me I'm doing great (the remotes are on the floor next to the balance board, which is five feet away from me).  After I threw my remotes, I decided it was time to check the reviews.  I am at least thankful there are other people with the same problem and that my wii is not broken, the game just sucks.  However, I am sweating from flailing my arms around trying to get the game to respond to what I am actually doing.
1.0	One reviewer wrote that if you just read the directions you'll be okay. But I read the directions many times and the memory card still wiped out previously saved games. After playing Grand Theft Auto 3 for four hours the memory card was no longer recognized by the system. In the four hours that I was playing it worked fine. I ordered this card because I thought I was getting more for my money(16mb) but all I got was aggravation and disappointment. I'm shipping mine back and looking for a real playstation 2 memory card.
1.0	After using this my Xbox One refuses to turn on for more than 15 Minutes save your money and time and Xbox one and buy something else.
1.0	Watch out you will have to pay 49.99 to play online .
1.0	I was very disappointed. None of the five controllers worked. I am still waiting on UPS to pick up the product to send back
1.0	Unable to install because they didn't include the product key...There is a comic book, information on everything batman, but no product key??  Looked all over.
1.0	And it stinks.  Decent graphics, impossible game.  Don't buy it, because you'll just get frustrated.
1.0	"I purchased this Xbox from amazon, they shipped me a console with the old Falcon chipset and a manufacturer date of early 2008. BE WARNED THE \\""NEWEST VERSION\\"" tag IS FALSE. I called amazon, and they shipped me a replacement which was also a old Falcon chipset still manufactured in early 2008. Just so it is clear, if you order this from Amazon you are NOT GETTING THE NEW VERSION despite how it is listed here. This version \\""The falcon chipset\\"" is prone to the red ring of death error, and I would reccomend you stay away from it and go buy a console from a physical store. After talking with amazon, it was evident they did not understand the difference between the chipsets and didn't understand that what they were selling was not the newest version by any means. The customer service individual i spoke with assured me they would remove the \\""Newest Version\\"" tag after I pointed out the error, but chances are that it will not be removed.<br /><br />Here is how to identify which version you are getting:<br /><br />The Box has a small rectangular cut out, where  you can (with some slight manipulation) make out two peices of information. 1) manufacturing date and 2) voltage. While yes, you can estimate which version you got by the manufacturing date the voltage/amperage is the easiest. This number is found right above the \\""Made in china\\"" found within the left portion that rectangular cut out. Xenon and Zephyr models have 12v and 16.5A. it looks like this on the box (12V...16.5A). The Falcon and Opus versions have 12v...14.2A. Keep in mind, from my experience and research all of these models are prone to RROD, and run harder and hotter than the \\""newest version\\"". The newest version coined \\""jasper\\"" can be recognized because while it too has 12v, it's amperage is at 12.1A.<br /><br />In short:<br />12v...16.5A :not jasper<br />12v...14.2A :not jasper<br />12v...12.1A : JASPER, the newest version.<br /><br />EDIT: this review is no longer relevant, I will leave it here for posterity."
1.0	This Game I thought was pretty bad. The controlling of the guns is stupid and the graphics are pretty bad too. I would not recommend this to anybody.
1.0	DO NOT BUY DIGITAL COPY FOR LAPTOP THROUGH STEAM!!!!  IT WILL NOT WORK!! I have purchased the game and will not start after uninstalling and reinstalling. Ubisoft finally told me that MOST laptops will NOT be compatible regardless of the graphics card being used. Steam does NOT warn you of the laptop compatibility issue while purchasing the digital copy. They have refused to give me a refund. If anyone has this similar consumer complaint please contact me on this forum and we will join together to make a Better Business Bureau complaint and force them to give us a refund. The lack of customer support in the PC gaming world will kill the market for PC gaming if we don't force them to treat their PC gaming community better, and with respect.
1.0	I bought this thing, maybe its my doing but the cd that came with is useless wasted my money for nothing i'm buying the original from microsoft see if it works I bought an 320 hd.
1.0	It didn't match our console
1.0	Super simple & slow game. may be worth $3 new. NO more than that.
1.0	These headphones have a hissing noise in the background that quickly becomes annoying. There is also feedback when.using the mic.
1.0	I got the Wrong Game -.-<br /><br />I got the first game and not even both disc lol. Real Clever lol
1.0	Forget this one.    There's no way I'm buying a game with a DRM virus.  There are better ways of wasting your time and money than supporting a company that will do this.
1.0	the graphics are great but the gameplay is not at all like the other super mario brother games. i think this game is the worst in the series. it goes from easy to extremely hard and after a while u get bored. lets just say i wouldnt want to buy this game. the only reason y it got one star is because the classic mario arcade game is included.
1.0	The Game has great graphics, the best that I have seen in a while.  It probably has a great storyline.  The game (Stand-alone) would warrant at least 5 stars in my humble opinion. It does not stand alone though,  it has a parasitic program attached to it called STEAM.  This leech program has just completely ruined my opinion of the game and has caused me to lose all respect for Bethesda.  I can understand needing to control copyright, or possible having a 3rd party checking service.  Yet, to have to run an online service to play an Off-line, single player game is just absolutely ignorant.  Actually, if any good lawyers are reading this, I see the makings of a good class action lawsuit here.  Software that is unwanted, unneeded, and in my case and others case, harmful to my system and wallet, but forced upon unsuspecting gamers. If you have to pay for your bandwidth, this game will end up costing you extra.  It kind of reminds me of microsoft latching explorer onto windows and forcing it on people.
1.0	A very representative sample of online gaming culture, no purpose and distorts perception and views of the young generation.<br />Not recommended AT ALL.
1.0	"Beware that the latest model of Wii, the \\""Family Edition\\"" that is currently bundled with Super Mario Bros. Wii is not compatible with this adapter. More specifically, the latest Wii lacks Gamecube support altogether, there are no Gamecube controller ports or memory card sockets. That's not a fault of this product, however it is a critical detail for new customers.<br /><br />There is another product on the market that lets you plug PS2 controllers into the Wiimote, it's just called a \\""PS2 to Wii Converter\\"". I would look into that instead."
1.0	EA needs to get out of gaming. I waited to buy this until the price was under $20... I paid $16 for it, and I still feel I paid too much. The single player career mode was completed on maximum difficulty in about 3 hours, and the multiplayer mode is completely worthless. Save your money, ban EA Games.
1.0	Huge disappointment. I don't think any of the patches will fix this game as they have fundamentally ruined the total war game experience.<br />I eagerly awaited and preordered this game. I have been playing it since I got it. Holding out hope that it would improve. But last night after a weeks holiday I came back to it, and decided it was so boring that I went back to Shogun 2. That made me want to right this brief review. I do not understand why they didn't keep the Shogun 2 framework and then historically adapt it for Rome 2.<br /><br />Instead they have dumbed down the game. There is no strategic planning required. The yearly turns and lack of family tree make politics meaningless. The AI is pathetic. I do not think they will be able to fix these items with patches.<br /><br />Glad I went back to Shogun 2, as Rome 2 was making me think I was getting to old for games. Now I know the fault is with Rome 2, not me.<br /><br />I will not be pre-ordering again. Advise you to save your money if you have not yet bought.
1.0	One of the main reasons I purchased this cable over others on Amazon was the fact that it used black bands on the casings that would make it easier to quickly identify the video vs audio cables (specifcally the red). I didn't want to have to trace the cables to figure out which was which. The item arrived and had solid colored connector casings defeating the purpose of spending an extra dollar. It was also a different brand than listed and had nickel plated connectors as opposed to the gold or copper shown (although, in all fairness, the description didn't say what kind of connections were used--but they were visually different than what I received. I'll be posting pictures to this listing.<br /><br />I decided to see if it worked to see if it was worth the effort of exchanging it. The cable was DOA. I did a decent amount of testing to make sure it couldn't have been anything else (testing other things in the TVs component port and trying the standard composite cable to test the PS3).<br /><br />I'd recommend looking for a different cable. This one seems to be sub-standard and you'll be taking a gamble on what you get.
1.0	I bought this item for Christmas as a gift Dec. 18th! I still have not received it! I WANT MY MONEY BACK!
1.0	There's only 1 reason to buy this hunk of junk: The game(s) you plan to play have ZERO use for the UP direction on the D-pad. If any game uses the UP directional pad, expect it to be used EVERY SINGLE TIME you press LEFT or RIGHT. Forget trying to play Street Fighter. Forget trying to play Killer Instinct. Forget trying to play Mortal Kombat. You want to move right? Oh, you just jumped right. Need to back away slightly? To bad you just jumped 6 feet away from the guy. Need to perform some kind of special combo that requires ANY use of the D-pad? Good f**king luck.<br /><br />Save your money, save your nerves, stay away from this horrible knockoff.
1.0	I don't play multiplayer games. So keep that in mind:  i am offended when i spend 60 bucks on a game, only to find that, even though i have the originial disks, i must create an account in order to play it. Sorry, not worth it, i still have an old copy of steam clogging up my desktop. My copy is going back - and what really pisses me off is that all of the upgrades have to download before they tell you tat you need to create an account- so here i am, an hour and a half from where i started...  Update, i decided to log in to origin, but for three days now i have uninstalled, reinstalled and atempted to get this program to run.. I'm not a novice by any stretch, i've written flight simulators for a living, but this has me baffled. It doesn't work well, and is going back.
1.0	It suck get Xbox one ps4 just did horrible with the design I bought that for $800 for nothing Xbox one again will be the best gaming console
1.0	Buying this game is the one of the biggest mistakes any gamer could make. I can't believe that Ubisoft has dreamed up such a stupid DRM scheme that requires a constant Internet connection to Ubisoft's servers in order to play the game in single player mode. I will never buy another Ubisoft game if it is embedded with this draconian and stupid DRM. Its clear that Ubisoft doesn't care about their honest customer base at all.
1.0	I bought this game, played it for 10 mins, then put it back in the box. I was actually physically upset about how bad this game was. IT was a total waste of [..]
1.0	I don't know exactly why it is, but usually memory devices for game console made by 3rd-party manufacturers are inferior in quality. They are cheaper, of course. However, I experienced a couple times of complete data loss from 3rd-party memories from the time of PS1. The situations were all the same: both 3rd-party and genuine memories were inserted to console all the time, yet only 3rd-party one failed. <br /> <br />Not all 3rd-party memories will fail, of course. Even memories from same company show difference. However, since I haven't experienced data failure from genuine memories yet, I do recommend you to buy genuine memory, rather than to test your luck.
1.0	I got it said it was a little used their was green marker on it won't turn on front piece is popped out looks like he got it from the trash I want a refund or a new one
1.0	First of all, I'd like to warn people to rent this game. DO NOT buy it. There is a very good chance you will be dissapointed if you do buy it (luckily, I rented it). I can still remember when Eidos was developing this game. They stated in interviews that this game would 'take the franchise in a new direction'. Well, this game did do that...unfortunately, it was the wrong direction. Tomb Raider: AOD seems like the most unfinished game I've ever played. It's almost as if the creators figured that they'd ruined it enough so they just threw it on the shelves hoping that no one would notice the MAJOR (and I do mean major) flaws:<br />1. The controls are TERRIBLE! When you push forward on the analog stick, it takes Lara at least a second before she starts moving. I didn't know if it was possible, but these controls are even worse than the original Tomb Raider games.<br />2. At certain places the game will slow down. This gets to be quite annoying. We have games with great graphics such as GTA: Vice City or MGS 2, which have NO slow downs...and yet some how, the creators of AOD couldn't find the time to fix this problem in the game.<br />3. Sometimes, the game will freeze, forcing you to restart your PS2. <br />4. The camera can become very annoying, as you constantly have to adjust it.<br />These are just a few of the many flaws in this game. The story, which consists of Lara being framed for a murder she didn't commit, is quite good, but it's not worth playing this game to see the story. <br />Tomb Raider: The Angel of Darkness had great potential, and you can see it while playing the game. Unfortunately, the game was rushed out (probably to help advertise the new movie) leaving all these terrible flaws and control problems in the game. If only Eidos had been a bit more patient, and worked harder to improve these errors, this game might have been really good.
1.0	This is not cool. The plastic must be to think our something. After I spent many attempts to get this on right, the dang thing was to think to register my pin. The on is nice though. Nice size and color and feel.
1.0	the directional pad and sticks are very cheap not worth the money. plus buttons are cheap too. not worth the money.

1.0	Proper crap dose not play on uk consoles not happy
1.0	I must have gotten a bad cable too.  Like another review said, I'm seeing lines through the video (but only when there is sound), and humming though the audio.  The lines move and wiggle with the audio.  It seems that the audio and video are interfering with each other.
1.0	my game pad only lasted five seconds because when i pressed on the L2 button it broke off and went inside and it`s not dual shock it dose not even viberate at all this is a poorly made controller
1.0	doesn't fit my stock 360 controller properly cheaply made not worth the plastic it's made of. sending back cool idea executed poorly
1.0	If u want to buy nintendo controller, buy the original controller. I already threw this controller in the dumpster. Quit working after 2 mos and I barely using it.
1.0	I ordered a xbox 360 version of black ops 2, but i received a ps3 copy through the mail. not pleased.
1.0	yet another listing for a hacked version of a game.<br />a quick google search will tell you THIS IS NOT an official Pokemon game,<br />but a mod for FIRE RED!<br />DO NOT BUY THIS!<br /><br />c'mon amazon! this is like the 5th illegal listing I've seen today!
1.0	This game seems on the surface like another covert-ops-stealth-infiltration game, a la Metal Gear or Splinter Cell.  The key difference between Metal Gear or Splinter Cell and this titles is that Metal Gear and Splinter Cell didn't suck.    The controls are very crappy.  I often found myself running in circles trying to get into the perfect spot so the stupid little green icon would come up and let me DO SOMETHING.  The plot is more cheesy than a fifty pound block of Wisconsin Cheddar.  The 'voice acting' sounds like something taken from a soap opera... and a low-budget soap opera at that.  Add to that some horrible programming bugs that really should have been caught during playtest (the only voice prompt given to me was 'great job, move on to the next area'... even as I was shot and dying...) and you're left with a sorry excuse for a knockoff.    Bottom line... save your money and get something else.
1.0	Information said it was cleaned and in working condition the arrow key pad was loose and the left joystick sticks to the right. Waiting to hear back on a return see how they handle it. Will redo this review if they set things right.
1.0	This was by very far the worst boxing game ever. I mean the a fight is always sceduled for three rounds. but it hardly ever goes more then one. It's way to fast paced. Most of the fighters in this game you probley never even heard of. NO Lenix Louis, No Evander Holyfield or anybody. Except ofcoarse Iron Mike. But you can't fight as him until completeing almost impossable tasks. Like beating the whole game with some [bad] back yard boxer. You can't even fight as a middle weight or anything. The create a player mode only realy goes into detail with your fighters looks. You can't customize the fighters speed or strenth. If you realy want a boxing game go out and buy a much much better game like knockout kings 2002. That is unless you just love a seemingly impossable, unrealistic type of game.
1.0	I have to say that it is so difficult to give this game a rating that is one-number.  There are such epic highs that made me literally laugh out loud with excitement for the experience.  Then there are such awful lows (particularly the ending) where I honestly can't believe that the developers made writing and design decisions that led to the final product.  In the end, I have to go with the lowest rating possible, because I think the story is too important to me to allow the amazing gameplay and fun factor to outweigh the crappy conclusion.<br /><br />With regards to the fervent criticism about the ending I will say the following... I can't speak for everyone, but for me the horrible reaction I had to the ending was a complete surprise.  It wasn't as though I played it, thought about it, and then decided 'oh man, I'm really disappointed'.  I played it, became somewhat confused and disappointed towards the end, and then as soon as it concluded I actually felt like something went horribly wrong.  I was almost asking myself 'did I break it?'  To me this kind of unsolicited doubt is the surest sign that the ending was not received the way it was intended.  I doubt Bioware intended for us to be staring at our consoles in shameful derision.<br /><br />Some gamers are either a) genuinely pleased, b) immune to bad endings or c) are so willing to defend the 'artistic freedom' of the developers that they will make neutral or even positive comments about the ending.  I would actually be quite happy to be one of those people, but for me the ending was ACTUALLY that bad.  Don't buy this if you think you might share this disappointment... or at the very least shut off the console to spare yourself.
1.0	I received this game with nothing in the packaging. I will be doing a little more research next time
1.0	I bought this game and can only get 1 player to play it is suppose to be a 2 player game but can't get the second player to come on. If anybody knows how to help i would be greatful. <br />thanks
1.0	Blizzard has no idea what they want to do with this genre.  Over run with bots, forced into defensive specs... its just so depressing...
1.0	I bought two of these, and the down arrow stopped working on BOTH within two days.  I noticed this long before I read all the reviews that told of the same problem, but when I saw the reviews I realized that it was the product itself.  Amazon took it back (I think, because it's been 5 days and I haven't gotten a refund yet), but my friend has the wireless pad and says it's terrible.  I don't want to spend a crazy amount of money, and I want to buy new pads from a reliable dealer.  What should I get that works for Xbox? And do the simple Intel Dance Pads work for Xbox?  If someone could write a response review,  that'd be great.
1.0	I only give this one star because I had to return it.  I'm sure it may have been a fun game, but I neglected to notice when I purchased it that it requires KINECT on our Xbox.  So, I never took it out of the package and sent it back.  My only suggestion would be that it would be helpful if after you click &#34;buy it&#34;, it had a pop up that let you know it required additional equipment.
1.0	It cause me to shoot my dick off.
1.0	SOE is one of the worst online gaming companys that exists. This is a last ditch effor by SOE to suck as much money out of the public before this games goes under. <br /> <br />SOE does not care about the customer base, only how much money they can put in their pockets. DO NOT BUY!!!!!!
1.0	Would NEVER recommend this game to anyone and here is why:<br />1.Boring campaign, poor storyline and extremely repetitive game play.<br /><br />2.Bugs. I got kicked out of the game when simply reload a check point. Had to restart the game. Also, a big BUG on killing bellec mission. You stuck in an infinity loop and can't kill him no matter what.<br /><br />3.Controls. Simply bad. Especially during combat.<br /><br />Maybe you could buy this game at $5 but anything more than that you are paying too much.
1.0	The main reason I purchased this game was to play football, I was very disappointed when all it had on it were a bunch of side games with no actual team against team football.  I still have not tried all of the games but from what I have played the tracking is terrible, THIS IS NOT A KINECT ISSUE! I say this because Adventures and Kinect Sports are great, and track very well with what you are doing.  I wish I would not have spent money on this game, The graphics are much better than most of the other kinect games, but I think that may be why it falls so far behind when it comes to gameplay.  Kinect is new technology and this game is full of some great ideas for games, they just need to keep working on it.
1.0	Would Not work for my pc. Very disappointed
1.0	Awful. I have never complained about my boyfriend gaming until now. The BF bought a PS4 and needed at least one game. So he buys WatchDogs. It's a horrible game. It actually bothered me enough that I bought him battlefield 4 for PS4 and planned to use this game disk as a coaster and the case it came in as a nail polishing surface. The plot is extremely boring, the missions are far too easy, and the graphics are meh. It's just not a good game.
1.0	It lasted maybe two or three days and was dead.  The cable is the thinnest wire I've ever seen on something like this and was promptly shorted/broken.  It was cheap enough that it wasn't worth the hassle to bother returning it.
1.0	This game is amazing! I can't play it for more than ten minutes without it force-logging me out of Xbox Live, though, so I would be better off not owning it. I've had it for months, and I haven't even seen the end of the third mission, which should be maybe an hour into the game if you're taking your time. The bug, which remains unresolved, is called &#34;CATERPILLAR&#34;, and disconnects Xbox 360 platforms when there are other people in a mission instance. There are supposed fixes, but none of them have worked. You're on the internet now, so just buy this for PC if you don't have an Xbox One.
1.0	Ok, so I watch The Biggest Loser and was extremely excited when this game came out.  I just KNEW it was going to kick my butt because Jillian's name is on it. OMG was I ever wrong!!! I even read all the negative reviews and still purchased it. This game might offer some kind of workout, but since the controller doesn't register with the Wii, you don't even know what you are doing or if you are doing it correctly.  I was extremely disappointed.
1.0	This game is strictly for someone who never played Dead Rising 2. I was under the impression that this was dead rising 2, but strictly from Franks perspective. This is just a cheap modded version. I expected different missions completely, but this is just Chucks journey minus his daughter. A lot of the times the dialogue doesn't even make sense, because they were to cheap to re do a few of the lesser lines in the game.   If no Frank West kept you from playing dead rising 2 then you should get this (even though that is a stupid reason). But if you beat and loved Dead Rising 2 and want to get this game I have one word of advice for you... DON'T!
1.0	I give the game 1 star because it is somewhat fun the first time through Normal. By the time you get into Nightmare, though, it becomes obvious that:<br /><br />1) Loot is sorely lacking in fun itemization<br />2) Loot has worthless stats<br />3) Loot is nothing more than bag-space-filler<br /><br />Carrot-on-a-stick game with nothing but rotten carrots does not a fun game make.<br /><br />The game was designed around the RMAH and it shows.
1.0	I am roughly three-quarters into this game and am calling it quits. You cannot save your progress but must depend on &#34;save points&#34; at specific places during the game. This fates you to having to play the same mission over and over and over and over... until (if) you succeed. Due to the tedium of having to repeat the same missions I set the game play to &#34;easy&#34; just so I could accomplish any forward movement through the game.<br /><br />Worse is that if you die, the game throws you back at some random origination point on the map. This requires you drive/run/walk over huge stretches of territory just to get back to the point on the map where you last died in order to continue.<br /><br />Another time I fought my way through a mission but needed to log out of my computer. I thought it would save my progress to that point so I could pick up where I left off. Nope, I had to play through the entire mission, including waiting through those agonizingly long cut scenes again.<br /><br />The game punishes you for playing it; the tedium of repetition of missions and the extent one must go through to get back to where you were should you die, is a huge disincentive for me.<br /><br />The other issue are the graphics; I cannot afford to buy the latest, fastest computer every time a new games comes out. I actually have a two year old &#34;gamer PC&#34; and Nvidia video card, yet I had to set the graphics on the lowest level or the game was too stuttering (laggy) to be playable.<br /><br />And don't even get me started on having to have to log into UPlay to even open the game.<br /><br />It was fun up to a point then the frustration of repetition and tedium has taken it's toll. I am abandoning the game unfinished.
1.0	Did not fit my xbox 360.
1.0	joystick was messed up
1.0	This is one of the most boring games.  From children to adults I don't know a single person that enjoyed this.  It's not like the board game.  There are little side games and everyone was really tired of pressing A constantly.  Such a waste of money!
1.0	I bought this yesterday from our local Toys R Us after reading about others' negative experiences in trying to get it from Amazon, and I'm really disappointed so far, because my PS2 won't recognize it.  It's frustrating, to say the least.  And now that I've opened it, I'm sure that TRU probably won't take it back.  Waste of money.
1.0	It's sad people buy amiibos just to resell it!
1.0	The D-pad left direction stopped working after using it for 30 minutes.  This controller is essentially useless.<br />Waste of money.
1.0	This game does not work. If you look up the support site on Ubisoft for this game you'll see many complaints of the game freezing immediately on all available platforms. It is completely unplayable. It freezes 10 seconds into the 1st campaign mission and requires a hard boot of the console. There is no way to play it. This may be the very last time I will ever buy a Ubisoft title. Ubisoft is quietly raking in the $$$ and not responding to the issue.
1.0	"Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided, launched as an enthralling and unique game. Apart from the obvious fact that it was based on Star Wars, the game was unique because of it's economy and crafting, it's player cities and excellent interface. For the first few months of Star Wars Galaxies, it was magical. It was the only time since Ultima Online that I truley felt immersed in an MMORPG. <br /> <br />Months passed, and the cracks in the system began to present themselves. Star Wars Galaxies is a victim of buisness - it was rushed out too early and is still suffering from this today. The system had inherent flaws - a small handful of professions were useful - Rifleman, Combat Medic, Doctor, Teras Kasi, Swordsman... the armour and buff systems ensured that Player Vs Entity (PvE) combat was quite a mundane experience once you discovered armour and buffs. <br /> <br />The \\""Combat Revamp\\"" was announced. A great idea to simply fix the flaws in the system - it made sense, and was anxiously awaited. Unfortunatly, by doing so, Sony Online Entertainment managed to alienate itself from it's customers - SOE has never been known for its (Frankly, absolutely atrocious) customer support, and now every single concern or problem was met with \\""Wait for the CU\\"" (The combat revamp got its name changed daily, for unknown reasons). <br /> <br />People started to grow bored of the game, although the economical and social parts were still flourishing. Whilst PvP was a game of \\""Slap the DoT\\"" (Damage over time) and PvE was simply a variable of time taken to smack something into submission, Roleplay and the economy/crafting were flourishing. My guildchat was regularly full of people chatting, and visiting places, new content, and generally enjoying the game, regardless of the combat. <br /> <br />Then the Combat Upgrade hit. What a dissapointment. The previous hopes of fixing the problems were dashed into the ground - instead came along this horrible, laggy, WoW/EQ-ripped off system that alienated crafters moreso and was generally unwanted. Many people quit, but lots still stayed with the game, it was still playable and combat was more enjoyable, admittedly - although the general interface feel and the loss of what we had grown to know SWG as being was a letdown. <br /> <br />Fast forward past two Episode Three cash-in expansions, Rage of the Wookiees (Which managed to turn space into an idiots playground with completly O.T.T ship stats) and Trials of Obi-Wan (SOE's blatent disregard of the Starwars timeline is for another rant ;) ), and the New Game \\""Enhancements\\"" were announced. Completly un-asked for, completley unknown of, they hit SWG days after ToOW (Trials of Obi-Wan). Completly ruining the economical and social parts of SWG with an absolutely ridiculous and user-unfriendly interface, and removing Item decay and the general need for crafters, it added \\""Exciting, Twitch-based Starwarsy combat\\"" - which translated from P.R speak is \\""Mindlessly click the NPC as it runs around at stupid speeds\\"". Its NOT a Starwars shooter. It is an eye-examination, and even more tedious than that. <br /> <br />Star Wars Galaxies began with a flawed combat system and an excellent, one of a kind economy and social system. <br /> <br />It was then changed to have a working, but not as good as the originals underlying systems, combat system, with a slightly tarnished economical system. <br /> <br />Then comes the NGE. Enter the headache-inducing, user-unfriendly, downright unplayable combat, economical and social systems. <br /> <br />Well done Sony Online Entertainment. You managed to wreck a game from the outset, beginning with releasing it before it was ready, and then steadily demolishing it."
1.0	"I can't believe I have to rate this game so low, I loved every last installment of the series. When I saw the previews for this game I was excited in thinking all the little bugs and issues would be fixed and that this would be a nice call of duty expierence. Nope. Thers still lag, host migration, and \\""how did that not kill him\\"" moments. The maps are way too big, about three times as previous, which would be ok but not for 6v6 teams. I don't know if its the health or the guns because it feels like you're playing hardcore but with hud. I loved sniping in mw3 and bo2 but in this game there is no advantage for the one shot kill as every gun kills you in an instant. They completly destroyed Infected(one of my favorite game modes) by giving you only one gun to choose from, a short range, low ammo, Bulldog. I don't really mind that they changed search and destroy to search and rescue, but it would of been nice to be able to choose. Cranked is an amazing game mode, but I often find myself exploding after running around in these huge maps trying to find someone to kill to stay alive. The whole character customization is one of the best thing to evolve from the cod series but taking out the ability to create an emblem, and subsituting it with a patch system weakens it. The bullets sound like rocks being thrown at a brick wall and the hit detection feels like you couldn't even hit the broad side of that wall. I am in no way a casual gamer, but this may be the only cod that doesn't get scratched up in my xbox."
1.0	After MW3 I was hesitant about buying another Call of duty game, but after waiting about month, I picked up Black Ops 2 for the PS3 and it turned out to be a very bad decision. In this review I will only talk about the multiplayer because I cannot stand COD campaigns, and the zombies mode is extremely repetitive and easy.<br /><br />I have been playing COD since COD4 and never have I wanted to give up on a COD game this quickly. Black Ops 2 has some good idea like the pick 10 system but the execution is terrible. This game doesn't even require skill, the only thing that determines how good you are is your connection. You will win all your gunfights if you are the host or if you have a good connection to the host and you will lost all your gunfights if you have a bad connection to the host. This game becomes so frustrating when you aim down your gun, shoot 5 bullets in someone and then insta-die because of the bad lag compensation. I don't care how good you are at shooter games, you can't win a gunfight when you are a second behind your opponent.<br /><br />I used to love Call of duty games but this game is a complete piece of crap, and the sad part is that Treyarch(developers) don't even admit that there is a lag problem, even when the forums in the official Callofduty site is filled with complaints about it. Every since the original Infinity-Ward felt Activison, the Call of Duty franchise has gone down the drain. I would not recommend anyone to get this game because of the lag, if Treyarch eventually releases a patch to lessen the lag I will update this review, but at this point the game is just way to frustrating to enjoy.
1.0	This controller is no good. It has bad turning ability, thebuttons are confusing, and if you have small hands it's evenworse. It's not worth buying.
1.0	I ordered this controller because it was cheaper. When I got it, I was disappointed. Pressing L3 to run is impossible to do and there is friction on the joysticks. I would recommend just paying the extra money for a real controller. Save you a lot of trouble.
1.0	What a piece of trash. I'm not even going to waste anymore of my life on it which is why this review is so short.
1.0	I have not played any other Settler games but jumped on this one as it looked very promising.   This game has proved to be boring and repetitious, every scenario starts the same and you have to sit around and wait for goods to pile up in the storehouse before you can get on with the task at hand.   By contrast, in the Stronghold games (Firefly) for instance the missions start with varying degrees of money or resouces, often against your favour which means you have have to rely on your smarts to win.  Not so with Settlers. But the absolute worst aspect of this game is the fact that it is very unfriendly towards your system, especially if you have an Nvidia graphics cards. I run a GeForce 7500 LE with 512mb and the latest forceware,(and the latest game patch)the game will shut down the computer after max 10 minutes gameplay. Go to the Ubisoft Settlers forum and you will see page after page of complaints regarding this issue. One guy claims the game actually broke his graphics card!   The game was obviously put on the market WAY too soon, it is not nearly developed enough. It is as if Ubisoft is using the consumer as beta-testers. I'm sure this has been done before but that doesn't make it any better. Bad business.
1.0	this game isn't the movie lord of the rings if that's what you're looking for, its just a bad game with bad fighting and bad everything else. get the other version with the movie lord of the rings on the cover.
1.0	Horrible game, after months of high expectations.  Assuming you are one of the lucky ones that the game actually installs and loads...be prepared for a glitchy mess of a racing game.  Stick with Forza.
1.0	Worse than you would have thought.  Seriously, stay away.
1.0	I will have to say, I'm an avid user of Razer products having bought the Taratula keyboard and Abyssus mouse.  Unfortunately, the Onza does not live up to Razer's reputation.  From day one I had issues when the analog sticks as they would not reset to their home position even after being configured over and over again.  I was told that I'd have to pay to ship the controller for replacement or send Razer a picture of the cord cut on the controller would work as well.  I'm sorry, I can't cut the cord on this thing and I'm not paying to have it shipped.  Just over 6 months now since I bought it and the rubber on the analog sticks is nearly worn away, the d-pad sticks constantly in spite of remaining clean, and the tactile buttons often press twice.  I'm not sure what kind of tournament this was supposed to be played in, but I'm already looking for a replacement rather than deal with Razer again.
1.0	I've gone through 11 fights in legacy mode and haven't seen a cut, bruise or drop of blood from anyone.<br /><br />The dynamic punch fraud on the right joystick is a nightmare. As a button smasher the game is entertaining for about 5 minutes.
1.0	Horrible purchase. It seems legit and of course cheap but like they say you get what you pay for. Can't use controller unless its plugged in by the USB port so technically it's not 'wireless' also the analog flickers without me touching it. Overall? Bad purchase
1.0	Having been an adult Neopets addict since the web site's early beginnings I really expected more from this game. From a RPG veteran's standpoint the graphics are very primitive, but that's because it was created for the PS One and had a late release.    You really need to download a free guide online to navigate the game because there are sidequests, hidden secrets and many things that will stump you along the way.     Things in this game can be annoying depending on your patience level. If you aren't a jumping game fan it can get frustrating. And without listing any spoilers I will say there are aspects of this game that will drive you crazy until you figure them out. If you are a Neopets fan you know that's the norm but some kids new to to the genre might not have the patience for this game. It sure tested mine.    The boss fights are fairly easy until chapter three (for me it was forget getting past the Hissi without a cheat.) It's really more about strategy and which character you use.    Overall it was a good attempt at a first game for Neopets and it fit in with their online storylines but I prefer their website. It's a good game with a lot of play hours if you are still enjoying your Playstation 2 and want to add to your collection.
1.0	did not work, I ordered two and both didn't work
1.0	Do you like games with really awful controls? Then definitely get Zelda Skyward Bored...I mean Sword. Do you like reading dialogue instead of having characters actually speak it like adults? Get this garbage then. If you want one of the truly worst games released all year, you should buy Zelda. It truly is as awful as I said it is.
1.0	This is not a cod. The campaign is good. But the multiplayer OMG. the truth is Killstreaks suck, guns suck, spawn system suck, and many more. If you kill some then you would mostly get killed by someone. I'm telling you're gonna go back to cod ghost. It's far better than this crap.
1.0	Sent yellow light..doesn't even light the screen up at night. My kid just plays during the day. A Very disappointed kid.
1.0	Keeps Freezing !!! HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO FINISH THE GAME IS I KEEP DYING BECAUSE THE FREEZING PARTS !!!!
1.0	This game is damaging people brains.  Stop playing and start living life is what one can conclude after the hype is striped away and you see this game is about war and mass murder as sport.
1.0	This game can be a lot of fun, and younger kids find it quite entertaining. That is, they would if they were allowed to play. Both my children are over the 10yrs requirement of the game; however, they are not allowed to play online, because Electronic Arts prevents children from using their accounts online. So the people EA is marketing this game to are not allowed to play. Do they expect I will create adult accounts for my young kids to use, violating both EA's terms of service and Sony's? It's not clear to me how they anticipate children will be able to play without violating their own policies. It makes me think they are marketing this dishonestly. If you have young kids, and you use parental controls to  guide their activities, then stay away from Plants vs. Zombies: Garden Warfare.
1.0	Don't be stupid and buy this overpriced garbage.  Search the internet, you'll find hundreds of people complaining their adapter just quit working after a few months.    Mine was purchased in 12/2006, and it died about a month ago.  There are cheaper alternatives out there apparently.  Or buy a used one, but don't throw $100 away.
1.0	This might be an excellent controller, but i'll never, ever buy it.  Terrible company that treats their customer like dirt.   AVOID them.
1.0	This game runs absolutely horrible on the 360! In the first few hours of playing, I had a headache.    If you have a reasonably decent PC with a good GPU then consider picking it up for that. There's even a benchmark program out there for free so you can see how well it will run on your PC first.    The gameplay and story are great but the technical issues on this platform make it unreasonable to play.    I even installed to the hard-drive and the game was still performing very badly.
1.0	Out of sheer laziness, EA decided to omit several stadiums. My favorite team's stadium is a generic bowl. Your's might be, too. <br />Doesn't EA know the charm to their previous games was that every team was given equal treatment? Now they just pick a select few college teams' stadiums. Major disappointment. That's no regard for the fans of the series. <br />I also am disappointed on control the player has over DBs. It is nearly impossible to defend the deep pass. <br />After two days, I'm selling my copy back.
1.0	Dont waste your money.  I bought because the PS4 sticks are slippery if you have any oil on your thumbs.  These are a tiny bit better but I wouldnt call them grips by any means.
1.0	"I tried playing the trial version of this game on a desktop computer, and it seemed OK, so I bought the full CD version from Amazon for my wife, who likes to play games on her little Samsung netbook.  After installing it, I got a message that \\""Gemsweeper has encountered a problem and needed to close.\\""  I followed all of the developer's suggestions to try to get the game to run, including installing direct X and so forth, but it wouldn't work.  Since I have another Samsung netbook, I also tried to install it on that one, with no luck.  So I wrote to [...], who packaged the game, and received this reply:  \\""It's possible this game does not support the resolution of a netbook. Please contact the developer at the link below for further support.\\""  So I contacted the developer, [...], and got this reply:  \\""If you bought the retail version, then you can 1) contact the company listed on the package of the game for help and support, 2) send the game back to Amazon and get a refund.\\""  I'm not going to return the game because it's too much trouble, and anyway it works on my desktop."
1.0	This product is cheap and is not a good deal at all. the sticks broke and cracked after only a week of use.
1.0	The charger itself doesn't function correctly,  the red and green lights seem to be pretty random and don't let you know accurately when the batteries are charged.  The batteries also won't let two of my controllers connect to the xbox 360 (it will power up the controller but the controllers won't synch up to the xbox, even when they've been previously synched.) though it works with one of them.  The batteries aren't compatible with other battery charging units, either.  The seller even replaced the entire unit and batteries for me, free of charge, in the hopes it was just a fluke, but it wasn't.  I wouldn't recommend these to anyone unless you enjoy frustration and disappointment.  The only positive outcome of all this was the seller was very courteous and professional about the entire thing.  I just wish I would've known beforehand that these were absolute junk.
1.0	Save your money its a waste. Good for a week or to the. It peels off
1.0	The game provides no growth as far as building buildings or upgrading your armies. You can play each civ once and be bored. The way you use each civ is the same, they do not have unique attributes beyond naming the armies and buildings something different.  I guess if I never was to play an rts I would like it, but since i have games like Rise of Nations, etc. to compare it against it falls very short.  If you like lord of the rings and have bought all of the other games, then by all means go out and buy this one, but if you like a good rts this is not one of them. BTW: One resource to collect, and about 8 units to build, it even sounds boring:)
1.0	This game is still bad. I bought it after I quit this title for two years and the same dinky game play ... same glinches in the game .. I dont know y people think this is a good game. Konami is still trading on the good name that his game made for itself 6 years ago .. but since 2005, this game has sucked and still sucks.
1.0	The core concept of this game is pretty neat with 4 players vs. a powerful monster, but it feels like the concept of making money from DLC also influenced the design of this game. For $60 it feels like you're getting half of the actual game; you basically get a meager 3 monsters to play as and a handful of characters to team up with. Sure, you can get more monsters and characters to make it more fun to play,  but it will cost you, a lot of money in fact. This is an otherwise decent game, but the DLC practices at play really make it a bad one to recommend.
1.0	The first review of this game pretty well sums it up. To add to the frustration, I get to a point in the game after studiously following the flags that mark the trail and end up at a dead end. That's it! No mountain top, no end of the ice-fall, just a dead end. I called Mount Everest tech support who omnisciently told me to reduce my graphics speed (which I did but then couldn't even see the ladders to cross the Icefall) or upgrade my video and sound cards.<br />Please don't waste your time on this game. The company who made it obviously didn't. There's a reason it's marked down astronomically.
1.0	My daughter can't play this game. It's too hard for a 5 1/2 year old. Usually her big brother will play games with her but he says it's a boring game. It could be that she's just too young and will like it later. I hope so!
1.0	Good: <br />Few fun games but they're nearly the same game over again.  There are 3 street fighters and 3 ghost and goblins. <br /> <br />Bad: <br />Control is horrid.  I think this is more of the PSP's fault than the game.  The D pad is horrible when making moves that require alot of circular motion.  Doing fireballs is near impossible.  The analog pad is actually worse.  The d pad allows quick movements from axis to axis, not the analog pad. <br /> <br />There is no difficulty settings on the games.  You're stuck with the hard settings.  The loading times are also riduculously long.  When you change opponents, there's about a 20 - 30 second loading wait. <br /> <br />This game is not worth your money.  Buy the other capcom collection, it's a lot more fun.  You can change difficulty settings, infinite continues and they're actually more fun. <br /> <br />Save your money and pass on this one.
1.0	"Just save yourself the $10 and buy the remote by itself.  These \\""games\\"" are barely worth the paper and packaging it came in.  Use the $10 you save towards any other worthwhile game."
1.0	The description said it fits Xbox 360 and it didnt . Very dissapointed.
1.0	The package was half open when I took it out of the Amazon delivery box.  The chuck toggle is so loose you can't stir with it and the remote is buggy.  Someone either messed this up before they sent it off or it's a reject they are trying to make money off of.  If you want another Wii remote just go to your nearest Wal-Mart and pay the same for the same product.  At least if there's a problem you can take it back and get a functional replacement faster then dealing with this mess.
1.0	"This is the second white PS3 controller I've bought from Amazon. The first was less than 20 dollars so when it turned out to be fake I thought NBD and threw it away. I ordered this one thinking all was well. I ordered it from Battery Exchange Fulfilled by Amazon. The controller I received was from LDI Limited. When I opened the package, The controller was in what looked like OEM packaging so after I opened it I threw away the packaging. I opened it at work, and we take out the trash at the end of shift, so there is no way I'm getting that packaging back. Onto the controller, the left analog stick and housing are scuffed. There is a little divot in the rubber of the grip where some of it has been taken out by being scuffed. The tag that should have FCC ID and all the other product tagging on it only has \\""complies with IDA standards DB102988\\"". There is no reset button. That little pinhole on the bottom of the controller goes to nothing. And of course if you plug it into your PS3 to sync it, the 4 lights on the front of the controller blink rapidly, but it won't sync to the PS3 so now I have a circuit board with blinky lights housed in white plastic that looks like a PS3 controller but is actually a 45 dollar paperweight. Very, very disappointed. Even more so at myself for not taking the extra precaution to save the packaging. What's even worse, Sony's official site redirects to here to buy a controller.<br /><br />Edit: October 23, 2012. So I bought ANOTHER controller, because you know I really wanted this white controller. This time directly from Amazon LLC themselves. This time it wasn't counterfeit, awesome. Except, it doesn't work. Doesn't charge when plugged in, and doesn't sync to my PS3. Really Amazon, get your act together. Have you seen how many reviews there are for the counterfeit controllers? REMOVE THAT SELLER FROM YOUR SITE. And get some better QA. Currently in chat with your customer service, we'll see how things go."
1.0	Doesn't work!! the disk was cracked in the center. the only good thing was that it shipped fast but IT WAS BROKEN!!
1.0	Returned it, the pin end didn't fit the Xbox, was too big. Not fair to rate somethingi returned. Not fair
1.0	Do not buy this. I bought it because I thought it would be best than using batteries, how wrong I was! It says it's charged but it's not, I left them in their socket for days and it lasted me about 15 minutes of gaming. Lamest product EVER...Buy rechargeable batteries (AA batteries) instead. Don't loose your time and money on such a terrible product.
1.0	the game start very sltow and you expend alot of time learning about the character moves<br />i was disapointed about this game
1.0	The cans literally snap off of the headband.  They are made of cheap plastic.<br /><br />After a little over a year I noticed them being lose.  Both sides were cracked under normal use.<br /><br />They don't leave my computer desk.  I put them on while gaming and take them off when I'm done.  That's it.<br /><br />Now I have each can wrapped with electrical tape to try and squeeze a few more miles out of them before they completely fall apart.<br /><br />My original Pulse cans (that I gave to my son) are still going strong.<br /><br />The sound quality difference is negligible for gaming when yoiyu compare the two versions.  The bass rumble thing is a joke.  I never use it.<br /><br />Save a few bucks and go for the original Pulse cans.  Stay away from these because they don't last.
1.0	I bought one since the item I saw had one decent review but now that I've looked around there are a whole bunch of different items exactly like this for sale and they all pretty much have bad reviews with similar problems as me or no reviews at all.<br /><br />First off, when it works it works well enough.  The problem is it kept resetting the thing every time I pressed a button.  Often it would just turn off and own't turn on again unless you pull the battery and reseat it.  The solar panel is purely for looks since the battery isn't rechargeable.<br />In case the battery was dead I bought a replacement and upon putting installing it it worked for a day.  After that day it started to reset over and over every time I hit a button again often times not turning on at all.  Again.  I pitched it after that.<br />AVOID it!!!  This thing is a piece of cheap Chinese junk.
1.0	"hello i bought TOMB RAIDER ANNIVERSARY and found it to be very hard to deal with, it is very hard to get pass some of the levels, When you have to get LARA to move keyboard wise its difficult and it can be frustrating, sometimes when you get a level you have to pick up objects and treasures and they can be a pain to get to, thats my problem and thats why im stuck, stuck in MADIAS PALACE the flaming pillars, its bad enough being a handicaped person with a slightly bad left hand which makes it a little harder to make the moves and get to the treasure but i think even a normal person with two good hands would find this game a little hard to deal with. Im still having trouble getting to that treasure, getting pass the boss creatures is just is hard and they have one called the \\"" ADDRENALINE DODGE \\"" which i cant perform at all. GRAPHICS wise it looks good but like i said making certain moves is hard and game can be frustrating, and i cant even finish my game. I really DONT reccommend TOMB RAIDER ANNIVERSARY its to hard to deal with. THANKS ---MIKE  A PC GAME"
1.0	I loaded this on my computer and played for a while then my computer crashed.  (It has never done that before.)  I spent a lot of time cleaning up my computer and my computer recommended returning to a restore point.  When I did, my computer removed the program for Fashion Solitaire.  I am using Vista.  I really don't want to put this game back on my computer for fear that it will crash again.  At some point I may try it, but for now I am very disappointed.
1.0	Headset was dead on arrival. Did not work. Returning
1.0	I was surprised to play a Megaman game that sucked that bad! The characters from the original are still cool but man... the newer characters and the newer plot just make the game so weird. It is more difficult, more &quot;beat around the bush,&quot; a lot more fighting which gets really annoying after a while, and too many things going on at once. If you like that stuff go ahead and get it. I was thoroughly disappointed when I bought this game... I thought it'd be better than the first. What was I thinking?!?!
1.0	i never recived my wii. its been over a month and i would like my money back!! Im very angery!
1.0	This game freezes during game play or sometimes I can't even play because the disk will come up as unreadable. For the past 3 years I have had this problem with EA Sports NHL games. Every other game I have works perfectly.
1.0	This adaptor came broken, missing an entire prong. Suppose to be 3, came with 2. Doesn't work at all.<br />Doesn't work
1.0	the discs won't play! &#62;:(
1.0	The product aspect is good .<br />But no working in my psp and another one. Im not satisfied with tris product. Thanks
1.0	This game turned out to be a real disappointment. EA Sports really dropped the ball. The only support for this much in need of a patch game is the online community. I am not very optimistic about the union of Nascar and EA Sports.
1.0	Wrong item was received had to return
1.0	A $20 card should be worth $20 and not more. Valve already earns enough money through the market and taxes players pay.
1.0	I ordered it brand new. half the parts of the collection is missing. The bomic books is missing the serial number is used. The Hero click is missing<br />I need a refund this is the 2nd time this had happened on the same item ENOUIGH
1.0	Overview: A ton of wonderful ideas, but incredibly shoddy execution. Don't buy it unless it receives some serious patching.    At its most basic level, Alpha Protocol attempts to take much of the gameplay of Mass Effect, such as the 3rd person shooter/rpg hybrid style, cover mechanics, and the dialog system (it even looks like ME's radial menu), and add stealth gameplay and a more branching story. Honestly, the basic design of Mass Effect meets spy thriller is interesting. Unfortunately, the game is brought down by incredibly flawed and erratic execution.    Before we talk about the horrible, lets talk about the merely annoying. First, my most minor complaint is that Alpha Protocol has fairly bad graphics. This is fairly unimportant, however. Second, Alpha Protocol has very stiff, clunky controls. It is simply unintuitive and clunky. That holds for most of the UI, as well. Third, Alpha Protocol on PC suffers from its console-centric design. In particular, the mini-games (hacking, lockpicking, etc, which are an essential component of completing missions) are not very responsive to the keyboard and mouse control system. This is especially true of hacking, which is incredibly awkward when using a keyboard and mouse. If the above were the only problems, Alpha Protocol would get 3.5 stars and would definitely be worthwhile. As I said, the previous complaints are things I consider minor. Also, the skills your character can invest in are not well balanced.    Now it's time to discuss what went horrifically wrong.    First, the enemies AI is erratic and bizarre. Distant enemies will come running straight towards you, not firing a single shot on the way, punch you in the face, and then slowly run away. They will run in circles, like a dog chasing its tail. I only got a B in my AI class at college, and I'm pretty sure that I could program a better game AI. Actually, I think my cat could, as well. Seriously, the AI is bad.    Second, stealth and cover don't work. More precisely, they don't work consistently. While in stealth mode, I could sometimes sneak alongside an enemy and they don't notice, other times I'm behind cover on the other side of the room and they spot me. Basically, enemies stealth detection is random and unpredictable, and it makes stealth mostly unplayable. Meanwhile, the cover system is really wonky and makes maneuvering in combat range from annoying to impossible. Because of these two flaws, it is excruciating to attempt to play a character that isn't an assault rifle wielding shock trooper or grenadier.    That covers the biggest or most annoying of the technical flaws. On the bright side, they all seem like they could be fixed via patching, excepting the graphics. On the downside, the game is simply terrible until it gets fixed, and who knows when that will occur. Basically, the high level design is intriguing, the story is interesting and there are many bifurcation points, the cast of characters is delightfully colorful, and the voice acting is well done... but the game is entirely unplayable because of clunky controls and broken systems, and the interface is poorly designed, unintuitive, and makes doing anything that isn't a conversation annoying.
1.0	"The game was very buggy and the hit detection is broken for a few races.  I was able to fire directly though other players just because they got close to me.  I attempted to resolve the issue with the gms.  They couldn't be bothered to help at all and even when a solution was presented they were unwilling to help.  Saying it was \\""not company policy\\"".  DON'T BUY THIS GAME.  (ps it will be free to play soon anyway)<br /><br />5 Stars for Amazon though"
1.0	This headset didn't come with hardly any of the features it advertised. It doesn't have actual surround sound, the microphone quality is terrible (you sound like you're talking through a gasmask), the headset itself is extremely uncomfortable and heavy, and the software required for running the headset came with bloatware. I would much rather have purchased a Gamecom headset of any kind.
1.0	My cables came in wired wrong. Very disappointed  with this product.
1.0	After hearing about the adjustable resistance on the thumbsticks and looking for a controller with mappable buttons, I pre-ordered the Onza TE immediately. After waiting for a ridiculous amount of time, I finally got mine a month after they started shipping them out and I fell in love. The rubberized coating is comfortable and the trigger pull and button presses felt right. That is, until the sprint button (R3) stopped working. Like many other people (just google it), my controller suffered from the sprint button randomly cutting out. I tried getting around this by mapping the R3 press to the mappable right bumper, but that just cut out as well. What resulted was the ability to only sprint for a second or so. So I went ahead and RMA'ed it, paying $14 in shipping and handling only to wait another month before my replacement controller came in. Lo and behold, the same issue happened again IMMEDIATELY. Adding to the problem was the fact that my right trigger wouldn't always register when depressed. So I came face to face with a question, should I just pay another $14 in shipping and handling costs to get a replacement that (cross my fingers) works (essentially paying for 2 razer onza controllers)? I decided it wasn't worth it. Quality control at Razer is horrible. They replaced my faulty controller with a more faulty one and made me wait a total of 2 months in the hopes that I would get a controller that worked. Quality control at Razer seems to be a general, widespread problem there. It's just the luck of the draw in getting a peripheral that works. I bought 2 death adder mice from them years ago and one just stopped working a month after purchase while the other one is still going strong.  In other words, buyer beware. You might get lucky and get a controller that works, or you might just get an overpriced doorstop.
1.0	This was open when it came!
1.0	I bought this for my grandson for xmas.Took it out of box to use it.Would not charge at all.I want my money back!!!
1.0	The game is a crap-shoot.  You might be able to play the game in its entirety without a crash.  If so, count yourself lucky.    From the ten minutes of the game I did manage to play, the game seems fun and the story seems interesting.  However, I can't seem to get any farther than that without the game crashing.  In addition, if I try to load a saved game, the game crashes my PC.    You may have the best game in the world, but if you can't play it, what's the point?
1.0	I was super excited to receive this item. However, I have not been able to get it to work. Apparently, the server is overloaded, and after some digging through forums, it may not even work for the game that I bought it for (ACNL).  I'm very disappointed in this product, and I advise others not to purchase it. I read many of the positive reviews, and was led to believe that any error that could happen would be an error on the part of the user, not the product. However, I have no control over the server and can't believe that this company is charging money for a product that depends on the use of an unreliable server. I will be asking for a refund.
1.0	Just causes my xbox 360 to freeze.
1.0	I wasted so much money buying these downloadable games. I have a brand new gaming PC and they won't run.
1.0	I love spending a ton of cash on a piece of shi_ controller that the rubbers tares apart after a couple weeks and the R1 and L1  buttons start sticking after a few days.
1.0	I was very impressed but the graphics for this game. It was very much like watching a movie in most places and I agree with several of the other reviewers that there are no other games like it on the market. Sadly, that is the end of my positive statements on this game. Parts of it (particularly the traveling parts) are quite boring and tediously repetitious, not to mention that the horse is difficult to control. In fact, many times, it was just easier to run to where I was going rather than fight with the horse. However, once you find a Colossus the gameplay becomes extremely difficult. Don't get me wrong, I appreciate a challenge but this game is repetitious and far too difficult to be truly entertaining. Sad to say I feel like I wasted my money.
1.0	The developers probably put as much thought into this game as I put into what to have for dinner last night. Which wasn't much!!! Don't waste your time or money. This game sucks so bad I would probably stay away from any game this company makes. I believe there called ZOO.
1.0	Worst Final Fantasy ever.
1.0	I thought I would give this game a chance because of some of the more positive reviews people wrote on it, BIG MISTAKE! I like these types of games,but this one is just down right boring and I wasn't pleased with graphics of this game either. So don't make the same mistake I did and buy this game.
1.0	Wish I had been made aware that this game would not work on my newer computer.  The box looks great....
1.0	o OS: Windows XP Sp3, Windows Vista Sp2<br />  o Processor: 2.4 ghz multicore recommended<br />  o Memory: 1.0 GB or more<br />  o Graphics: 256 MB, Shader model 2.0, ATI 9600, NVidia 6600 or better, recommended Shader model 3.0<br />  o DirectX®: 9.0c<br />  o Hard Drive: 3.5 GB<br />  o Sound: DirectX 9.0c compatible soundcard
1.0	so it looks super awesome because the controller is gold but dont buy it.. save ur money and buy gold spraypaint at walmart... my joystick stuck after 2 days and made the games annoying difficult to control and this product was brand new fresh out of the box when i purchased it... stay away
1.0	We used it once and it started smoking and smelling like burnt rubber.  Unplugged it immediately and took it outside to cool down.  Once cooled down, I opened it to see what happened and found the cheapest wiring and soldering job you could imagine.  Absolute poor quality and thank goodness I we did not leave the house with this POS plugged into the wall.<br /><br />Simply threw it away and went to gamestop and bought a way better quality unit for about the same price as I paid for this cheap charger.
1.0	This decal really was a downer.  It looks like black and white berber carpet, not carbon fibre.  I have a lot of real carbon fibre, so obviously I'm a fan of it, and bought this to get the look on my PS3.  Wasted my money.  The makers of this decal should look at some real carbon fibre and then look at this decal, they look nothing alike.  No one would even guess that this is supposed to be a carbon fibre looking decal.  This looks more like the fabric of a suit that might be worn by Beetlejuice.
1.0	This is just some kid trying to take your personal information and money. DO NOT BUY. All the so-called Xbox Live you get is just him creating you an account and using the free month from microsoft on the account.
1.0	I can't belive they tried to charge anything over $5-$10 for this! This is the deffinition of highway robbery, don't fall for it.
1.0	Like many other reviews on this site, my thoughts are pretty much constricted by EA's simply idiotic decisions regarding DRM. Even many of the music studios got over their objections to MP3s and relented from their obsession with DRM - why can't EA?     All it does is hurt legitimate customers. The pirates already found a way around before the game even hit the shelves. By making legit customers into criminals by default, EA makes their product unacceptable. Get over it and you'll get customers again, EA.
1.0	Controls are clumsy, game is not challenging at all, even if you choose  the difficult level it is ridiculously  easy. The baddies say the same thing all the time, you encounter the same obstacles over and over very repetitive. Indiana moves like an ape.<BR>The only challenging aspect is that you cannot save the game where you would like and combined with the clumsy controls you need to repeat over and over again the same non challenging actions.<BR>Please do not waste your money.
1.0	This is by far the most broken game I have ever attempted to play.  There have been 3 patches and the game still crashes to desktop within 3 minutes of playing.  This is the most glitchy bug ridden game I have ever seen.  I wonder if they ever tested this game on pc at all.
1.0	This game sucks.  It was released in May of 2006.  I bought it in 2008.  Since I had purchased a state of the art PC in Feruary of 2007 with a top notch video card, I felt satisfied I would be able to run the game, but NO!  It causes my PC to freeze and lock up when I play it.  I contacted the publisher and was instructed to download and install all the latest video and audio drivers (which I did) and my PC still froze when I was playing this game.  I updated my DirectX drivers from 9.0 to 9.0c (the latest version for win XP users) and still no help.  According to the publisher's own utility, my PC has more than enough power to run the game, but it doesn't run for long without locking up and forcing me to reboot.  I have installed and played several other applications and high end games in the past two years (even WoW) and none of them have locked up my PC like this POS game.  I loved the earlier version of Heroes of Might and Magic (III & IV) and they worked great on my PC but they were published by 3DO.  This game (Heroes 5) was written and published by Ubisoft, who apparently doesn't know how to write a successful interface.  Since I had to open the box to install the game to find out it wouldn't work on my machine, I cannot return it for a refund.  My advice:  avoid all Ubisoft games.
1.0	This program freezes after only a few seconds of gameplay in the campaign mode, requiring a cold boot of the computer to regain control of the OS.<br />Here is my system specs:<br />XP Pro SP2 with all upgrades from the Microsoft website<br />AMD Phenom 9500 Quad Core<br />GeForce 8500 with 512 MB RAM<br />3.3 GB system RAM<br />Realtek Audio integrated 7.1 sound card<br /><br />For whatever reason it just doesnt work on this system. If you have a similar system, you might want to stay away from it.
1.0	Before anyone buys this game, they should be prepared for the following: 1.) terrible lag times (and I have an extremely good system and connection) due to buggy programming 2.) sub-par &quot;3D&quot; graphics that move terribly 3.) Constant system crashes 4.) deaf Customer Support 5.) at least 5 program-driven error messages per hour. Take it from someone who tested the product numerous times, and then disposed of the game: if you want to join UO, run Ultima Online: Rennesaince instead; it's still available,a and you'll be MUCH happier with the performance and graphics.
1.0	Spyro Enter the dragonfly is the worst out of all its previous games including gameboy advance. it takes forever to load, it is difficult to control spyro, there is a lack of new characters and being able to play as different characters, like in spyro 3. There's only one boss in th entire game, the game is too short - it has only 9 levels, unlike the previous series - over 25 and 4 worlds. Overall, I thought that the game was easy, boring and very uncomfortable, Universal has ruined this game and its rival Crash. This game really suits playstation 1 than PS2, yeah.. the graphics may be well developed, but the comfortability is what counts.
1.0	I didn't buy this game at Amazon but I had to leave a review because my experience with this game is super-negative.  The game didn't set up at all and did not run.  One of the requirements for this game is that you must have NET Framework SP1 installed on your computer. If you don't, the game will try to install it onto your computer from the CD. I had NET Framework 2.0 SP1 installed but when my computer updated to NET Framework 3.0 and 3.5 from Microsoft, the updates eliminated the NET Framework 2.0 SP1 and replaced it with NET Framework 2.0 SP2 as well as with NET Frameworks 3.0 and 3.5.  The game could not install NET Framework 2.0 SP1 from the CD.  Then I I found out that the various versions of NET Framework must be installed in the order in which they were developed.  So I tried to install the game without updating my NET Framework to the updated 3.0 and 3.5 versions. The game then encountered an error and still did not run.  Stuck, I emailed Pollux/Paradox Plaza for help 5 months ago but no response.  I have already spent a great deal of time researching how to fix the problem. I also tried using the method used by one of the reviewers from above but that didn't work either.  My computer is running Windows XP SP3 so my OS should not have been a problem since the game is made for XP and Vista. I also don't think that it's a good idea to not update your NET Framework to the latest version. Even if I wanted to spend many more hours trying to figure out how to fix the problem, I'm not a techie and don't know how to begin - beyond what I have already tried to learn. At this point, I don't want to continue questing for the mythical fix anymore.  The sole contribution of this game is to make my garbage can heavier tomorrow.  Money down the drain. :-(
1.0	Guitar was broke. Sucks.
1.0	I'm a fanatic about RPG's, from Asherons call to MUD (many user dungeon), and another MUD player told me to get Everquest. I installed it, and it took AGES to connect. It's the slowest game I've ever played, and you have to wait to go into another area. The bad thing about it is the speed. The  graphics are not all that bad, but I don't recommed this. . . :(
1.0	The game itself is great, my daughter loves it.  The pad that this comes with in this bundle is useless.  It eats up batteries like nothing else.  Getting the pad syncd up with the WII is pretty much impossible (took us an hour and about 50 tries before it worked).      If you want the game, get the game alone, do not get this bundle.  Go buy a pad separately, this pad is useless.
1.0	Went through multiple installation attempts, each time the update was installed via USB and the PS4 would restart and the system would crash. Tried several WD Greens, 2TB, 3TB, and a 4TB WD Red. Tried formatting to eX as recommended. Tested drives in a PC and they work just fine. Took everything apart and re-seated everything to the same results.  I swore I would never buy another product from Nyko after their inter-cooler burned out the video board on my Wii, and now I know I never will.<br /><br />Even just in the install loop that I was getting stuck in, the unit runs EXTREMELY HOT. The ps4 is clearly not made to be having this additional power being drained. Even if the product works for you as advertised, I'm willing to bet it will shorten the life of the console. Heed my words, stay away from this terrible product.
1.0	the wire sucks and breks really easy, it takes forever to solder the wires to the circut board, wires have to be exact perfect length. its just to much work and not worth the time and money. Unless you know someone who works on circutboards or knows how to solder really well, you should not buy this mod.
1.0	Do not buy this controller, period. It simply does not work. Although the controller is built well and is sturdy, the problem is the USB dongle. It constantly loses its connection with the controller, and you can't play for more than about 30 seconds without having to reset the entire apparatus. Obviously, this makes it completely useless for playing games.    In addition, the battery on my controller never worked right from the outset. It states up to 27 hours of uninterrupted power, but on my unit the charge would run out after 10-20 minutes. I had to use the controller with a USB cord connected to my ps3 at all times, and even then I could only use it for about 30 seconds before the connection would get interrupted. By the way, there is no customer support and no way to get a refund. Buy a sony controller and do not waste money on this, or you will regret it!
1.0	I bought this game several years ago, but I only now got around to installing it and trying to play it. I have Windows 7 OS, and it won't play on it. Tried several things to get it to work, including running it in compatibility mode for both Windows XP and 2000, but nothing helped.
1.0	"Whatever you do, PLEASE download the PC demo first.<br /><br />If you're any kind of a DS1 or 2 fan, you will find that this game offers nothing in the way of similar game play, customization and to some extent the characters themselves.  There is absolutely no depth to this game; look around the reviews, people are finishing it in one night.  I couldn't dream of doing that, even in a week, with the previous games.  If I drop down $50 for a game, there better be at least 40 hours of game play.<br /><br />There are many other reasons this game is an epic fail and the other reviews state them in detail. I will simply agree with them on major points and say co-op multiplayer is a joke with its limitations, the graphics are lack luster and the limited character choices and their development is shallow.  Last but not least, AT NO POINT will you feel you are playing a PC game.  Make no mistake, this is a console game ported to the PC and if you must play this game, please do so on a console.  There is no point and click, there is no interactive HUD and the controls make you feel like you have two left arms or something. Heck there's even text that mentions \\""your controller.\\""<br /><br />I was so looking forward to this game, but at least the PC demo saved me from wasting my time and money.  I hope you do the same."
1.0	Okay well I bought Blur first and man, I never knew a racing game could be less fun.<br />I hated it. You couldnt even play online multiplayer without coming in less than 7th in a room of 20. I mean my best was 7th and then mostly 12 or 13th place. It sucked! Its like the front racers didnt even play with the power ups just raced. Now how is that fun? Plus the loading times to replay a race you've just completed is loooong! And drifting? Are you kidding, you mean go fast then turn into a guard rail and watch as everyone passes?<br /><br />I traded for Split/Second and WOW that is what I wanted in an arcade racer.<br />Its like a roller coaster ride. Blast Ac Dc's Thunderstruck while you race and enjoy! There is so much you can do to get ahead of your fellow facers. And dont listen to the rants about rubber banding cars. It keeps it fresh and you on your toes plus its no worse than burnout.<br />I'd give it a complete 4 stars but the graphics are just a smidge blocky. Other than that, gorgeous and fun. OH and I have a killer surround system and the sound of Split blows BLUR out of the water. You actually get the feeling of speed in split second. Cheers.
1.0	So I Sent it bACK Don't know how good the actual game is, I hope to try it one day.
1.0	We used these while I was in the army.  With a range of about 150 foot and the fact they blast for only a few minutes, these  flamethrowers are  not  much good to use on the enemy....We  mainly used them to BBQ with especially if you approach your meat<br />(that is cow, goat, etc from the side so they can't see you and run a way.  So I give it one star as a weapon but 5 stars as a BBQer
1.0	The game in itself is entertaining, however it did not come with CD keys, nor can they be found on the CD's, they are necessary to play in the multiplayer mode. I have written various emails to Ascaron, the makers of the game, in order to solve the problem, however help and/or solutions have been non-existent. Reccomendation: If you want to play multiplayer, look for a different game.
1.0	Sorry to say but it was not very good at all it didn't work in England on my son Xbox 360
1.0	I bought this product and I received it with a charger that didn't charge and the left bumper was broken. I returned it
1.0	"Where do you get that kind of ego? 1). \\""Raining Blood\\"" and \\""The Number of the Beast\\"" are classic songs by classic bands. Iron Maiden and Slayer are NOT satanists at all. 2). If you have such bad things to say about this game, why did you even allow your children(I'm assuming you have children) purchase this game? I think someone's a hypocrite. 3). Don't ever try to push your beliefs onto others. If you were a true Christian, you would know that Jesus tried to teach us to have an open mind. I know as, in fact I'm a Catholic. 4). Stop trying to put down other's religions. \\""If you are a satanist, then you would feel right at home with this game.\\"" Here's a recommendation, SHUT UP!!! Nobody cares what you have to say. 5). Expose the Lies, Guitar Hero never lied about this game. So therefore you have nothing to expose. 6). For being so rightious, God will surely throw you in the lake of fire. Then you can meet Satan yourself you hypocrite. 7). Finally, this an awsome game. Very fun. Oh yeah, one more thing, nobody has to agree with everything I just expressed"
1.0	3 days now and not even the tutorial works, still.<br /><br />Consistent issues logging in to their servers, creating a game, or even resuming an existing one.<br /><br />Don't waste your money on this!
1.0	I already own the official Microsoft VGA cable, and when we added two more Xbox 360s to the family over Christmas I knew I needed an extra VGA cable to my son's room.  I placed the order before Christmas, so that I would have everything I needed.  I tried to save money by not buying the official Microsoft cable and that was a mistake.  The images are blurry... and there is definite ghosting on all of the letters.  Maybe the people who are satisfied with this cable got lucky, or maybe they don't know what they are missing.  There is a night and day difference between this and the official cable.
1.0	DRM is a terrible method of copyright protection; Will Wright and publishers have gone way too far.  I will not rent my games!
1.0	Unless you have supernatural powers to rival those of your enemies or like to lose, don't waste your time on the game.  This shouldn't be called Stealth Patrol, there's no stealth involved.
1.0	This adapter only worked on one of the games on Wii Resort.  I will return the motion adapter and purchase a new remote. I specificaly looked for one that I thought was made my Nintendo, but it is clearly made by a different company. We also purchased ping pong paddels, which are useless if the motion adapter doesn't work.
1.0	It came broken. Charger port is broken and wont charge...awful product
1.0	Absolute junk.  Box says charge for 1 hour before using and I've tried charging for up to 2 days in multiple USB ports and no matter how long I let it charge the controller won't turn on.  Tested 2 different controllers. I guess the Nyko seal of quality on the boxes don't mean much.
1.0	This item did not work, however the seller refunded me promptly.
1.0	You really only need to read the title.  I would however like to welcome Bethesda to the list of companies I won't buy software from.    Sorry, Bethesda I'm not a criminal and sure as hell won't pay you money to treat me like one.    I really, really, really regret pre-ordering this game back when the word was cd check only but no DRM.  Should have waited.
1.0	Worst thing ive ever bought from Amazon. Total crap.arrived defective ...broken. But as they say you get what you pay for. Well actually I didn't. 10¢ would be adequate
1.0	Never ordered this...don't understand
1.0	Did not work ,eye doesn't read disc
1.0	Product broke while trying to put on.
1.0	Picking up this game I couldn't wait to get my hands on it.  First off steam didn't have preload available so I had to wait til it actually came out before I could start downloading it.  I think I clocked about 5.5 hours on hard mode for the story.  Probably one of the least immersive games i've played in my life.  There were things you could do in the first that you couldn't do in the second.  The power upgrade options were pretty cool but you could have beat the game without them tbh.  I'll be thinking twice before I buy from that developer again.  As other people have said the story is very predictable and there are really no exciting moments.  The one good thing I can saw about it is that it was pretty bloody but other than that don't waste your money.  RENT PEOPLE!  The only reason I'm giving it a star is because it did advance the story.
1.0	I got this on games on demand. It has to be the worst game I have ever played. The multiplayer matches you with people who are much higher levels. As a result they have guns that kill you in one shot, and you have a gun that can not even kill them in a clip. Also there is no way to find people to play co op with, which is needed because the later missions are hard. The campaign is fun, but nothing is ever explained in detail so the story is not intriguing. Do not waste your money on this game, buy something else.
1.0	I have a Nintendo Wii and wanted a few games I saw wii play and thought it would be fun. There was a very brief description of the game when I got the game I found out its an instructional game. If there was a better description of the game I would not have purchased it this so called game is meant to help you get used too using the controler the games are basic weak and not fun to play :-(
1.0	"Ok, let me be the first to say this game is a waste of time.  I not only wasted [money] on this game, but I also wasted 60 hours of my life with it.  I spent a good 10+ hours TRYING to get the extra \\""Sidequest\\"" stuff, but only to result with jack to show for it. <br />I then got tired of all these ridiculous sidequests and just ended up facing Sin.  Beating Sin, I viewed the end which isn't very satisfying one bit.  WOW, spending another 5 minutes listening to \\""Suteki Da Na\\""  Which is also very annoying..."
1.0	Would not recommend buying this product, the pictures are really low quality
1.0	The Wii U Console is difficult to set up with &#34;Error&#34; nonsense when updating.  It also doesn't come with hardware to run the most basic of games.  (Remote).  Many of the games are primitive and not all that responsive.  I would avoid this system.
1.0	I thought the lighted drum sticks were a great idea, and initially I was really happy with how they looked and how they felt - they felt nicely balanced and I liked the heavier feel than the basic wood drum sticks.  But like others, I noticed how much louder they were than the basic sticks, how they rattled and such, and they both stopped lighting properly after only a few days of use.    When Rock Band 2 came out, I ordered the ION Premium Drum Set, which has pretty solid drum pads.  One of these lit-up sticks snapped in half within a couple of hours of playing on the new set.  I sent 'em back.    Nice idea, but poorly executed in my opinion.  If they come out with a better set that isn't as loud, works better and is more durable, I might be willing to try it.  Otherwise, I'm just gonna stick with the wood sticks for now.
1.0	"The USB light never turned green (which should indicate that it's charging). It never stops flashing red (which indicates that it's searching for a receiver). It never syncs with the thumbpad. Be careful when purchasing this item. Some have claimed success, others have not. Unfortunately for me, I'm in the \\""have not\\"" category."
1.0	this is about the cheapest looking game i have played graphics are terrible i wanted to return the game but they would not let me,if your a child maybe Super Nintendo has way better graphics than this junk.
1.0	This is a review of the 360 Version with Kinect.<br />Trust me, save your money and put it towards the Zumba DVDs, you will get much more satisfaction out of them. The tutorials are a joke, no real instruction. The menus are a nightmare and difficult and frustrating to navigate with the Kinect. It does NOT recognize your bodily movements, in addiction to that, the video of my body on the screen had a 1 or so second delay which was distracting, as well as it cuts off half your body, so if you're using that to try to match to the instructor, it's impossible. I found myself doing the exact movement perfectly (I have done the DVDs many times, I know the movements), and it would say I was not doing it at all. I even reconfigured the Kinect to no avail.<br /><br />I'd say it's okay as long as you're not worried about matching the movements or having any kind of instruction on each movement like the DVDs do, it pretty much plays like a workout dvd with no vocals and pretty colors.<br /><br />It appears it was hastily thrown together to embrace the technology, and it doesn't do it well...at all. Which is unfortunately because Zumba would make a great game if done properly like Dance Central was.
1.0	"I really wanted to like this game, but my purpose of purchasing it was to \\""work out\\"".....not dink around for 40 minutes working my way through to the work out.  Be sure your clock is set right too!  The program worked me over the same routine over and over again and seem to get lost.  It could seriously injure a person because of this....especially in the knees!  I'd rather slip in a DVD and be done with a safe,effective work out in 30 min. flat.  Also on activites that require you to lay down, it doesn't correct you, you can just sit and relax and it says \\""great job\\""! (such as sit ups, push ups)   So it's on the shelf dusty and I'm out looking for something better...."
1.0	I bought this charger as a replacement for a broken PSP charger.  It will not even plug into the PSP.  The plug is too long to fit.  I am very frustrated.  It was cheap, so just believe that you get what you pay for.  It will cost me more to send it back and get a refund than it was to get it in the first place.  Don't waste your time on this one.
1.0	It doesn't look good and doesn't fit, i returned the product and the money has still not come back after more than a month
1.0	My computer is good and my internet access is more than adequate. This game took forever to load and it took forever to download the latest version. It wouldn't work. None of EA's suggestions worked. I'm selling it.
1.0	No dedicated servers for the PC version is a bad move from Activision and Infinity Ward, this is the first time I will not buy a Call of Duty game and from now on I wont buy anything from them.
1.0	To give justice to this game, you need to split the review into two parts: the first 95% of the game, and the last 5%.<br /><br />For the first 95%, this game is BioWare's magnum opus. They hit a sweet spot with a Third Person Shooter mechanic with RPG elements and great storytelling of the Reaper War. The action is visceral and well paced. Mechanically, the weapons are fairly balanced and fit a good variety of play styles, as do the classes. As promised, characterization has been improved, cutting the party down to a possible five members, or a sixth with the From the Ashes DLC. As a result of this slimming, each character feels far more fleshed, and you feel less stressed about learning everything about them. Only two of the characters were not returning faces from the previous two games. The story itself provides a three-act narrative with side quests centered around building a coalition of forces to defeat the Reaper threat and construct a mysterious superweapon called the Crucible that offers the best chance of eliminating the reapers for good.<br /><br />I have mixed feelings about the multiplayer integration, which functions as a multiplier to your single player war assets. For example, if you play a lot of multiplayer, you get a better multiplier, and thus do not need to collect as many war assets. The co-op multiplayer missions themselves are fun. Refreshingly, there is no 'deathmatch' style play, to keep with the theme of a united front that the narrative of the Single Player campaign is trying to tell.<br /><br />From here on in this review, I will be covering the last 5% of the game. This will contain unmarked spoilers, because it is impossible to defend the one star rating without revealing them.<br /><br />The final battle of the game takes place on Earth, in London. The last piece needed to completed the superweapon was moved to Earth to make it easier for the Reapers to protect. This section of the game is an amazing, action packed mission leading upto a final desperate charge to reach the piece. What looks to be a bittersweet ending where you sacrifice your life to save the galaxy is stolen by a deus ex machina. As Shepard passes out from blood loss, he's lifted on a platform up to another area, where you meet a ghost child that gives you three choices: Control the Reapers, Destroy all Synthetic Life, or turn everyone into Organic-Synthetic hybrids. Even forgiving the Deus Ex: Human Revolution style push-button ending sequence, the end result for all three endings leaves the Citadel destroyed by your hand, and the Mass Relays destroyed by your hand. Many, including myself, come to the conclusion that this invalidates every choice you were given beforehand. With the relays destroyed, galactic civilization loses its travel system, leaving a massive interspecies fleet (some of which have incompatible biologies) stranded on Earth, and everyone else cut off for the near future.<br /><br />This is of course the center of a firestorm right now (3-15-2012), and may change in coming weeks/months. But until then, I suggest this game as a rental, not a buy. You will love the first 95% of the game, I can say with certainty. But the finale itself will leave you sour, and your view of the series as a whole changed for the worse.
1.0	Carried a buzzing sound on the Red Audio cable.  Colors were of poor quality and had glitches. - Random color flashes.  Brand New 42 in 3D Plasma so I doubt it's the TV.  Threw in trash, ordering the ones built from Sony on Amazon.
1.0	I bought this expecting Mortal Kombat 2. Instead I received disappointment.
1.0	Do you all wanna know the real reason why companies use securom and have set install limits? it's not to stop piracy...it's to stop the secondary market....where (A.) a gamer finishes a game and is done with it...lends(or)gives it to a friend to play(instead of buying it themselves)....or (B.) To prevent gamers from returning or reselling games.....(EB/Gamestop stopped accepting PC games for Trade/Credit years ago)..... Game companies know they can't stop piracy.. if it's obvious to you it's obvious to them....so instead they stop the perfectly legal secondary market...which cost them millions.... Just look at the console market.....game companies lose millions to their games being sold used at gamestop and other retailers....    also I only buy EA console games used.... gamestop deserves my money more than them...(lesser of the 2 evils)      Spread the word!
1.0	I am a sims fan but this game system is no good for new computers.. if you have an older computer go ahead..
1.0	The game is hilarious and fun, but there are numerous smaller glitches from frame rate to freezing.  Early in the game freezes were cured with a reload.  I am towards the end of the game and have just finished the Canadian missions.  My parents come out to punish me in the middle of the day and send me to my room.  When I hit 'X' on the bed the mother opens the door, no words come out of her moving mouth, and when the door is closed it freezes there.  I tried the other three reload points and all of them have frozen here.  $60 and at least 10-14 hours of searching every nook and cranny of the game and now I can not finish it! I have the game updated. Appearently PS3 and 360 players have had the same issue as noted on Obsidian's Stick of Truth forum.  In 20 years of gaming I have never experienced a game ending glitch!  I will be contacting Obsidian for a refund.
1.0	STICK TO THE PC VERSION! The playstation Sims will do your head in. The PC version is a MILLION times better. The controls are annoying and the 3D look spoils the fun by trying to look too realistic. <br />The ONLY decent thing on this version of the Sims was the tasks. I found that quite fun for a while but its wasted on this version. <br />This isnt even fun to play on. It just annoyed me and I went straight back to the PC version with the expansion packs. Apparently the PC Sims 2 will be designed like this and if so I will NOT be buying its rubbish!
1.0	If you parents have a cell phone and an adaptor for it and you usually charge it up in the car---use the adaptor for the house outlet from the cell phone and use it for the Game Boy Color because most of them are the right size but not all work.
1.0	I WANT MY MONEY BACK I GOT A HEADSET INSTEAD OF THIS HOW DO YOU MESS THAT UP...REALLY DISAPPOINTING  I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE
1.0	I Bought it Only For trophys but when i played it i Discovered that harry potter game is so bad !!!!
1.0	Just wanted to point out that even though the description for this game says it works with Win95, 98 and ME, it does not work with ME. At all. It doesnt crash lots or run slow under Millenium, it just does not work at all.
1.0	"Not really a fun game, buggy as all get out. Halftimes are over the top but in a glitchy junky graphic kinda way. And the fact that there isn't a \\""white college football\\"" always makes me see this as some kind of reverse racism. That's like having \\""Native American Casino\\"" games, or \\""Trick the Polish Guy\\""... just seems like the whole premise for the game is to get pro-black people to buy the game based on what it's supporting and not the game itself."
1.0	I bought this game thinking it would be good.  I liked 1 and 2 but after that the game play got very complicated.  This game is so complicated to play.  I'm not one to spend hours on PS3 but you have to for this one just to learn how to shoot and use your suit right.  I got to the point to when I said forget this and I traded it in.  It took 15 minutes to start playing the game.  Really 15 minutes.  I timed it. Other reviews are right there are too many cut scenes and YES the game play is hard to use. I don't want to spend hours learning how to play the game correctly.  Here simple, this button is shoot, this button is change weapons, this button is targeting.  Why be more complicated than that?  1 and 2 controls were the best.  They have lost me here completely.
1.0	The gun is well made, it just doesn't work with the game.  The shoot button in the game is the B button and can not be changed.  When the remote and nunchuk are put in the gun, you want to use the Z button as the shoot button, since it is right where a trigger on a gun supposed to be located.  Instead you must use the B button which is located up on the barrel of the gun.
1.0	Download code for the game is busted, who else wants compensation for this cluster?    UPDATE: Well, code worked at 9PM Pacific (Midnight East Coast), so looks like Microsoft DID NOT give us the Zero Day edition with the bundle, just the standard edition, what a joke!
1.0	I thought that this game would be fun, after purchasing it I am very wrong. There is nothing about this game that is interesting. The Wii Sports Version is %100 better. To name just a few things that are horriable it does not matter how you move the wii controler because the ball always curves, you cant aim because the people are always in the way, your scores never save no matter what you do and all of the girl characters are wearing next to nothing not a game for little ones. I would not reccomened this to anyone in fact I will tell people never to get this game it is aweful just stick with the Wii sports version.
1.0	[[ASIN:B000FKBCX4 Spore]] I have 3 computers in my home and I waited many years for this game only to be let down by the awful DRM, the game itself is great, but the restrictions are insane.. you will only be able to fully use spore on one machine,,, yep, you better hope you don't need to change your OS or buy a new pc, no multiple accounts with online access allowed here, what's even worst is the manual clearly states being able to create multiple accounts up to 3. It seems like EA is out to ruin another great game with their crappy DRM restrictions, I advise to not buy spore until they address the public with a fix, this is false advertising, if you create another account you will be given misleading errors like your key is invalid and such, you have been warned.
1.0	be careful! this is not a vertical stand. it is a vertical srand! it says so right on the box!
1.0	Just doesn't seem to work at all. Appeared to be in good condition. Cheap price made it not worth the effort of returning.
1.0	It doesnt hold onto the controller good, and the buttons dont respond half the time.
1.0	Ea has a problem with quality control.  The hr monitor was broken on arrival and without it the game is useless.  I didn't open the game up immediately after receiving it so I can't return it since the return time has passed.  Seemed like an interesting alternative to outdoor exercise, but I guess I'll never know.  I guess it's back to triathlons for me.
1.0	Don't buy Spore, Crysis Warhead, or any other EA game that includes DRM to copy protect their material.  One reviewer had it right when he, or she said that EA is treating all customers as potential criminals by utilizing this draconian method to insure their programs will not be stolen.  I don't know about the rest of you, but I don't really like being treated as a thief by a huge corporation (the reversal is more like it) or the idea of software downloaded to my personal computer that I CANNOT EVER REMOVE.  Nor do I like the 3 time installation limitation built into the game.  After which you have to pay more money to install the game if you run past you installation limit.  I'm not a lawyer, but that doesn't even sound legal to me and it certainly doesn't smack of good business.  It really disappoints me that a huge company like EA is so paranoid that it resorts to this kind of heavy handedness when I was looking forward to playing both Spore and especially Crysis Warhead.  The honest gamers who make up the majority of your customers, EA, are the people who suffer for the pettiness of the few.  Now I won't go near these two games and neither should you!  A clear and resounding message needs to be sent to EA that gamers will not be bullied!  The best way we can do this is to simply NOT BUY their contaminated software.  It's a shame that the producers of these games will suffer from lack of sales because of EA's unwillingness to properly address this issue, but a line must be drawn.  Don't step over it by purchasing this game.  Don't give in!
1.0	If you played any of the ps3 cod then there is nothing new on this one, not even graphics, it is basically and expansion from any ps3 cod. don't waste your money
1.0	Would not install, sending back
1.0	I have had this cable for less then a month, and it is already having issues. The wires in the cable are breaking causing disconnects as well as popping and cracking noises in my headset audio.
1.0	was a European game and not compatible with my United States PlayStation 3 downloaded songs. disappointed with this purchase. A lot of time and money wasted
1.0	The fighting is simplistic, the camera does not accommodate the player's movement well and there just is nothing good enough about it to keep me playing.  I do not like it at all.  Games have been done better than this for many years now... it almost seems like it was a class project for one of those video game schools you see advertised. Just have to face up to an expensive mistake and not compound it by wasting more of my personal time trying to glean some fun out of it.
1.0	Graphics are poor, Music is not original, way too many crashes to desk top.  Game locks up when you hit a big jackpot, then you have you use to use task manager to exit game.  When you restart the game all of you winnings have dissappeared and your bankroll goes back to the installation level.  Masque really cheaped out on this one, not to mention their rush to get this out for Christmas without correcting the bugs.  I own all of their previous slot games simulators and this is the worst effort by Masque so far.  I wouldn't have given them any stars for this but my mouse rolled over the one star and they will not let you delete it.  Save your money on this one and avoid it.
1.0	The head of the charger ripped off after three weeks. It is now completely useless.
1.0	I'm grossly unsatisfied with this product. I bought it to have a working controller for Super Smash Brothers Mele and after about four games, I noticed I couldn't grab anyone -- my Z button was not working at all! A friend of mine is going to try to open it up and fix it, I'm not going to bother with Nintendo trying to fix it because this was ridiculous.
1.0	I purchased a used copy of the game, but could not register it.  I have reordered a new copy (which I probably should have done originally.)  Caveat emptor if purchasing a used copy.  The customer service is truly a maze and it was impossible for me to get to Tech. Support.  So my low rating really reflects my frustation with totally inadequate support access.
1.0	never, I repeat NEVER port a game that was meant to run on DirectX 9 to DirectX 10, this game has more bugs than paris hilton has STDs! Online mode isn't even PLAYABLE because its trying too hard to be something its not, please, PLEASE, just buy Halo 2 on Xbox, or if you only have a PC, Halo: Combat Evolved, then get the Halo: Custom Edition download. It still has a great community and an awesome online, and the newest patch lets you play it without a CD!
1.0	Got the item packaged correctly in the box.  It will not come on at all and does not charge at all. Hopefully I can get a full refund and just get the Sony one I should have got in the first place.
1.0	This this thing is horrible it just blinks and doesnt even pair. I went on nintendo to find out if i was doing anything wrong but it seemed that i was doing everything right but it finally hit me that it wasnt me but the controller. ITS A PIECE OF JUNK. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY. THE PICTURE SHOWN IS NOTHING TO WHAT OT REALLY IS.
1.0	This is the WORST GAME EVER , i am serious , flash games on the internet are more fun then this.  This game sucks like hell, DONT BUY IT.
1.0	Don't buy this product it is a waste of money. All it is is the plastic casing and some components to make it look like a memory card, but there is no memory at all
1.0	ordered cd version because internet service in my area is at best terrible.. hughesnet  satellite.... installed cd's onto computer and game wouldn't launch... said inproper installation and to try reinstalling.. uninstalled and tried to reinstall..game would not reinstall from cd's.. had to download from uplay.. after trying to download for 2 weeks, e-mailed uplay ( no way to call them) asking if they could wipe my account, so i could reinstall from cd's.. answer a week later (great cust service ha-ha) answer was negitive... after another week of trying  to reinstall, i finally managed to get 85% of game downloaded when uplay account did some kind of update and wipe out my progress... i'm now back at square 1, looking at another 3-4 weeks of trying to download this game. .. for people in areas with marginal intertnet service, these games that require an internet hookup suck...
1.0	This product would be good if you are using any console except for the PS4.  The idea of this product is basically plug in and play which is not the case.  When you buy this product no matter what console you are using you will have to have a computer to download software to use this device.  Once you download the software you will hook up the device to your computer and select which controller that you are wanting to use.  At that point you will unhook the device and plug it into a USB extension cable (which is what they recommend but do not include with product) after that you will plug you controller of choice in and play.  All of what I have described is not the reason that I'm giving this one star.<br /><br />If you are a PS4 user trying to use another controller you will still have to do the above steps but there is more that is required which you are not told about prior to buying this device.  The PS4 sends an authenticating code every thirty seconds to make sure the controller is linked to the console.  To make this product work properly they require you to have the device hooked into your PC, hook the device into a USB extension that goes to your PS4, then you will hook up your DS4 controller into the device.  Now for your controller of choice that you want to use instead of the DS4, they require you to run a USB cable from that to your PC USB port.  Then it works....kind of.  If you are playing a shooter it is common to use L2 to aim down your sights and R2 to fire the weapon.  With this device if you pull both triggers it will do nothing.  You can ready your gun separately, you can fire your gun separately, but you cannot do both at the same time.  Now the company is aware of this flaw.  So they made a post of how you need to edit GPC script in the Maxaim AI plug in to make this work properly.  I tried.  I really tried to do everything that they said to do.  I spent about four hours for three days trying to research online on how to make this work.  I give up at this point.<br /><br />If you just try and plug it into your console and play without using the computer it will work for a short time.  It will only work for an eight to ten minute period at which point you lose all control and you have to disconnect the controller and reconnect.  Not fun.<br /><br />I contacted customer service to try and get this fixed.  At which time i was met with sarcasm and an I'm smarter than you attitude.  I emailed their customer support approximately five times.  They never answered my questions in the emails and they only directed me to post my support questions on a forum.  I would have done this.  But being that I've read other posts with the same questions in that same forum with no answers, I decided not to waist my time.  For this reason I give this a one star rating.<br /><br />Now if you are any other console customer other than PS4, this will actually work good from what I understand.  I have not tried it.  From what I understand Sony has made things difficult for third party companies.  Another thing I will mention is that this company over time may figure out how to update their product and actually work on PS4 without all these problematic steps.  My recommendation to any potential PS4 user at that time is to make sure the is a product video displaying this so you can see it before you buy.  So for now, I will be waiting to see if there is any other way to use a different controller of my choice on the PS4.
1.0	i bought it a month ago and it has already overheated so bad it warped itself a bit, and was very much a fire  hazourd
1.0	I do not have the 360 version of this game, but before posting this review... I made a choice : Review the better console (PS3) version or review the 360 version, well..    Really, Capcom? REALLY? The Emma has played lots of Zombie games, but never a game as BOORRRRING as Dead Rising 2. Run around casino, hit zombies, LOADING..... watch cutscene, LOADING.... Repeat. Installing this game does not fix loading times.     Now I'm going to list every Zombie game I'VE played that is BETTER than this mockery to the Survival-Horror genre :  #1 - Left 4 Dead  #2 - Left 4 Dead 2  #3 - Zombies ate my neighbors  #4 - Plants vs. Zombies   #5 - Dead Space  #6 - Dead Space 2  #7 - Call of Duty : World at War  #8 - I MAED A GAM3 W1TH Z0MB1ES 1N IT!!!1    Loading....    #22 - The House of the Dead  #23 - The House of the Dead 2  #24 - The House of the Dead III  #25 - The House of the Dead 4    Loading...     Loading.......    #78 - Zombie Revenge  #79 - Stubbs the Zombie    Loading...     Loading.....     #136 - That Borderlands DLC pack    Loading.........    #177 - Heussdhvblah    177 Zombie games that are BETTER than the Dead Rising and Resident Evil series. The Dead Rising series sucks and has always sucked. If this game can get a 8-9 then the standard for making a GOOD game has deteriorated. Capcom must've paid reviewers to rate this positively. There's no way this is a good game.  Everything Capcom is now condemned at The Palace of Wisdom. Good day, sirs.
1.0	Horrible the A button doesnt work and the cord is extremely short not worth it at all oh well
1.0	I installed this on two computers. On one, the graphics completely don't work. While there are ways to fix this, they basically involve cheating and revealing the whole map. No no no. <br /> <br />On the other computer, the game runs at a snails pace. I have to wait 3 minutes between ACTIONS. ACTIONS, not TURNS. It took me 7 hours to advance 20 turns. This is NOT an acceptable rate. <br /> <br />Yuck. Don't buy it until there's a patch.
1.0	MY SON BOUGHT THE XBOX 360 SYSTEM LAST YEAR.  AFTER 8 MONTHS, THE 'RED RING OF DEATH' SHOWED UP.  AS PROMISED UNDER THE 'GREAT 3 YR WARRANTY' FROM MICROSOFT, HE RETURNED IT, POSTAGE PAID, AND WAS SENT ANOTHER ONE.  IT WORKED FOR A MONTH, AND THEN HAD TO BE RETURNED. WE ARE NOW ON OUR 4TH XBOX.  IT ARRIVED TODAY, AND WOULDN'T EVEN TURN ON.  AFTER CALLING THE ROBOTS AT TECH SUPPORT, I ASKED HOW MANY TIMES DO WE HAVE TO GO THROUGH THIS CHARADE BEFORE THEY SEND US A NEW SYSTEM, NOT A REFURBISHED ONE.  THEIR RESPONSE WAS, 'I DON'T KNOW'.  NOW I AM AWAITING A CALL FROM ANOTHER SUPERVISOR, WHO WILL JUST GIVE US THE RUN AROUND AGAIN.  PLEASE DO NOT BUY XBOX 360.  GET A WII OR PLAYSTATION.  A WORD TO THE WISE... .
1.0	I know a lot of people have been hating on this game, but I have it a try and found that they were correct. You can play it only when EA feels like gracing you with the chance to, because heaven forbid you play a solo game without their watchful eye hovering over to see every move you make. Skip it. Buy an old sim city, like sim city 2000. You can play it any time you want, it actually works, and it's probably dirt cheap by now, unlike this one.
1.0	I won't go into detail because so many others have covered it. The design decisions made were fantastic - after a few hours of playing with the controller it feels like a no brainer that it'll be your defacto controller from there on out.  And then six weeks after you purchased it the analog sticks start doing weird things, and you love the controller so much that you assume it must just be a random fault product that you purchased. So you go out and buy another one right away.  And then six weeks after that, the same  problems arise.  Do not buy this controller - I pushed two friends into buying them and they also had the exact same issues. Unless you're prepared to buy new controllers on a routine basis, the awesome design of this controller doesn't make up for it's cardboard quality.
1.0	WARNING: Dont buy Trophy Hunter 2003 from Atari! I just bought this game and I was sooo disappointed! The graphics are HORRIBLE and makes the game really unenjoyable. Also the game is really slow like when you move around or try to walk or anything like that! And my computers up to date on all of this games requirments!!! So dont get Trophy Hunter 2003! Its a waste of money! I suggest you go out and buy Rocky Mountain Trophy Hunter 3!!!!I promise you'll enjoy it more than this game!! I have also heard a lot of complants on the horrible graphics and of how slow the game is!! <br />
1.0	The item did not work on my device 😔
1.0	The combat system in this game is sad, slow and clunky. In a the modern age of better, more smooth combat systems, this one is depressingly bad. I can typically tough it out for an interesting storyline, but I had to put this one down. Definitely not recommended.
1.0	I agree with the other reviews. With great excitement I waited for this product to be released, and within ten minutes it was clear I would never again be using the disc. Terrible user interface. Poor animation. Very frustrating experience. A total waste of money!     Tomorrow morning I'll happily be using my old yoga routine in Wii Fit Plus.
1.0	I am a HUGE Metal Gear Solid fan, and I have every Metal Gear Game.I thought woah a new Metal Gear Game.So I got it, I didnt want to play it for an hour.It is reduced to a card game,a pethetic card game, and the story lines take you about 50 minuts.This is mostly reading, not a game.
1.0	This game is very cute and has a variety of mazes, searching-type activities, and the crucial jewelry-decorating section that is necessary in any Barbie game that somehow overlooks fashion and makeup, but my 7-year-old completed the entire game inside 20 minutes, including installation time. It was far too easy, and I can't see her ever playing it again. Unless your child is under the age of 5, I wouldn't recommend this game, at least not until it ends up in the Bargain Closeout Bin at your local retailer.
1.0	Like many here I've been playing the Civ games since number 1. my machine meets all of the rec specs and I've installed the patch but I still have major crashes and freezes. My install and play discs are also mislabled. While that is a small thing, when you combine it with the obviously less than steller testing and QA, I think we should all get our money back and you can bet the house that I will not be rushing out to buy the next hot title Firixis puts out.
1.0	just plain horrible! the graphics are the worst! I would not recommend anyone buying this game!
1.0	"I really had high hopes for this game. Samurai. A Shogun gameboard. Strategy and real time action. I am very sorry to say that this game is pretty atrocious.<br /><br />First, the plot. There are 2 sons of an ailing shogun. One is the diplomat, the other is the warrior. Whoever takes over Japan gets the magic sword and the rule.<br /><br />In essence this is one of my favorite board games, Shogun, done on the Nintendo DS. A map of Japan, divided up into provinces, is randomly scattered with four types of forces. There are your units, your brother's units, a third lord's units and random bandit zones. There are also grey areas that can be taken over without a fight.<br /><br />To take over a location, you can either fight, or try to negotiate. The idea is that you go, then your brother goes, back and forth until someone takes over the whole area. Now here's the ironic part. I did my first play-through as the negotiator. I hardly EVER won a negotiation. I had to fight my way through the provinces one by one. It took about 2 hours to win the game. So then I played through as the warrior. He won pretty much EVERY negotiation.<br /><br />Also, while the brother did go once, after that I plowed straight through and he never went again. Why? Because I pretty much won every single battle, in both playthroughs, meaning I could keep going. It was that easy.<br /><br />When you battle, you randomly get one of several mini-games. Maybe you're firing arrows at archers. Maybe you're firing arrows at archers ... on a ship. Maybe you're moving little soldiers around on one of 3 map sets, against enemy soldiers. You have the option of splitting your soldiers into groups and doing tactical work - but why bother? You always win simply by massing them into a group and plowing at the enemy one by one. I've never lost.<br /><br />The AI is awful. I've seen enemies stuck on a wall. I've seen my own forces stuck on a rock. One time, my forces teleported across a body of water. My favorite has to be the \\""gate\\"" minigame. You're supposed to destroy the gatehouse to open the gate, and then go in and fight with the soldiers inside. However, you can pick off half of the enemies with your archers, without them firing a shot. Even better, somehow some of your guys can slip THROUGH the closed gate. Apparently this is so unbelievable to the enemies that they don't see you at all. You can walk up to them, one by one, and slay each one without them moving a muscle. You can win the entire level without a scratch.<br /><br />The game gets very tedious very quickly. Since you always win, there's no challenge at all. Since the missions are all the same, you know exactly how to win one as soon as it loads. Luckily, I suppose, you can win both sets of missions (i.e. both brothers) in about 4 hours. Once you do, there's nothing more to do.<br /><br />Rent if you must, and only if you want to play minigames for a few hours.has to be the \\""gate\\"" minigame.

1.0	"i just got my game and i have spent over an hour downloading the game and some program called Steam.  I just clicked the icon and now i am waiting over 10 minutes while i have to go through \\""Steam\\"" to start the program.  This appears to be a scheme to get me to sign up for their data base just because i bought this program.  Not Happy.  John A. Carlson"
1.0	This game is garbage. It is one of the most boring games I have ever played. Terrible controls, garbage story, terrible glitchy online gameplay.
1.0	Due to Atari rushing this product out the door, the consumer is left with a horribly buggy game that had the potential to rival BG2, NWN, etc. I have no problems with the engine itself. The help files are minimal, leading to some confusion, but once you get the hang of it, it's quick and intuitive. Sadly, nothing else about this game can be described as quick.<br />To start with, it's laggy. Scrolling on the overhead map is a chore. Many spells and features do not work properly, do not work at all, lead to critical systems errors, and so forth. Check out the game forums sometime - it's a laundry list of serious problems that make gameplay difficult or impossible for many users. These bugs are not only on low-end machines, either. Even with a 1.7Ghz with 512MB of RAM, this game crawls.<br />Most the bugs have nothing to do with system at all. Fundamental problems with spells, quests, etc. dwarf these other problems.<br />Currently, there is no *offical* patch coming from Atari. The work involved in making this game playable would be enormous. For everything good about his game - and I was hoping to enjoy it - you will find five things that make you want to throw it out the window.<br />If this game is patched and playable, I'd give it a five. As it stands, it's more frustrating than enjoyable.
1.0	If you are used to REAL FPS, then don't buy this... Just sucks.
1.0	"I should have read the reviews before i purchased this game.  there are so many bad points to this game. the long review above says most of it. the only other item i would add is the game lacks creativity.  when most developers run out of ideas, they come up with lame ideas like \\""lets take away an ability and make the user run around in circles to get it back\\"".  this game has a few turns like that.  too bad, $40 down the drain."
1.0	I vacuumed over my son's wired sensor. GameStop only had this one that takes batteries. I am replacing the batteries every other day. Who the heck wants to do that. This thing costs $20. Why would they not add a plug to it. I'm going to find a wired one for my son TODAY!!!
1.0	They sold me a damaged controller. The R3 button did not have the plastic cover and do not work. Just felt cheated.
1.0	While I think this is a fun game, the DRM means you only have a limited amount of time to play it before your disk doesn't work anymore.    Thus, all these 1 star ratings are well justified.   Hopefully EA will wake up to this eventually.
1.0	Stick it back to them.<br />STOP preordering,and STOP buying games as soon as they come out.<br />DO your homework/watch reviews,and get all the info you can about a new release.Whats another week gonna hurt?<br />Once they start feeling a drought in their pockets,they'll start listening to gamers again,and giving you quality games WORTH 60 BUCKS.<br />And without any underlying/hidden factors.<br />But at this rate WHY SHOULD THEY?<br />If people are stupid enough to hand over their hard earned money MONTHS in advance,for something they've never even really experienced.Why should they?<br />ITS THE ULTIMATE HUSTLE and the NEW AMERICAN WAY...WAKE UP!
1.0	I can't believe I wasted my money on this game. Even though I beaten the game. But it just pathetic that it had no items such the shield item,speed item or any other items. The best sonic game I like is sonic unleashed.
1.0	A longtime friend bought an Xbox one and this game recently.  He came over last night with plans that we were going to play the campaign portion in cooperative mode.  We were very disappointed<br /><br />First, the game is only in 720p resolution on the Xbox One.  REALLY!?  Why buy a new, top of the line system and game and then only have 720 resolution!?  They're coming out with 4K tvs, and this system and game can't even do 1080 resolution!?  What a joke.<br /><br />Second, This game handle cooperative play in the campaign.  Again, REALLY!?  That's just a lack of effort on the manufacturers part.  That's terrible.<br /><br />Third, I have very fast interent.  This is a new, top of the line gaming system.  Why did it take about 45 minutes for the game to install and update?  I could have downloaded the whole game from STEAM on my PC faster!!!<br /><br />I'm glad I didn't waste my money on this game, and am sad that my friend did.  This is supposed to be the newest, latest, greatest out there, and It's a joke...
1.0	As someone who was trying to fly through their Christmas shopping, I was super excited to see this deal on the controller and nunchuck combination. I bought three, without really reading the product description, or reviews since it had four stars-- my fault entirely-- but when I got them, I realized the mistake I'd made by doing that. First off, they were NOT actual Wii remotes, but a knock off brand. I find it a little bit ridiculous that they're allowed to use a picture of a real Wii remote when that's not what you're getting at all. Secondly, even if I'd been aware that the product was a small, cheap looking replacement, the remotes were bright purple, not white. I'll be returning everything and hoping to get my money back. This was a seriously irritating experience.
1.0	As soon as it connects to my XBOX 360 it shuts off. It works fine if you leave it unconnected but what's the point of that? I sent it back and got a full refund from Amazon.
1.0	The biggest limitation of this game:  You HAVE to navigate the grid using the D pad, and not with the stylus.  If you have played Sudoku, you know you're jumping all over the screen.  Imagine having to click-click-click all the way to a open space.  This feels like a quick port from another platform, rather than a DS game. <br /> <br />Don't waste your money on this one.
1.0	"I urge those who are considering this game to play the demo before buying - especially fans of this series.     EA has decided to \\""fix\\"" what wasn't broken while taking away or ruining design features that helped the player to judge important things like distance, terrain, and velocity. For example, the putting gauge will sometimes fade away before one can use it - I guess in pressure situations - it's completely unclear though. Anyway, this can leave one stupidly knocking a one inch putt off the green. This is actually easier to do then one might think since players have no real way of judging how far to bring back the putter to achieve the proper putting distance. I found that even the slightest touch can knock it to Timbuktu. I suppose someone can make a case for this on the most difficult pro setting or something, but not on the easiest setting. To me it just seems foolish and ridiculous since nothing like this could never happen in real life and hasn't in the history of mankind. And it's never even happened to me on any earlier Tiger Woods games.    Also the very helpful shot flight view has been eliminated in favor of a quick camera jerk to the proposed landing area. This is not only a needless and harmful change, but the information it eliminates can be extremely useful on some holes.      I could go on, but play it for yourself. After all, some people like needless change for change sake or software that goes from being very user friendly to being unnecessarily confused and difficult. It's just not what I'm looking for in a game or what this title deserves."
1.0	I was in Best Buy checking out Red Alert 3 and when I read the back of the box it said it uses DRM which limits you to a single installation.  No thank you!  Not only because it installs unremovable software that prevents disk copying but because when I installed Farcry 2 which also uses this DRM software it requires an activation PER USER, even on a single computer.    I have 4 children so we're always mixing up who plays one which computer and always upgrading at least a computer per year.    Not thanks EA.
1.0	DRM is a show stopper. I doubt this game will work for me after a few years given my habit of new hardware purchases and system snapshots. Like others have said, this game is for rent not sale.    The EA Spore DRM is a bit reminiscent of the Sony root kit. It installs software that you definitely don't want or need. That software can work in superuser space, meaning it can do whatever it wants on your system. And there is no uninstall for it. In other words, by installing Spore, you install a piggy back Big Brother.    Please don't support this product. Great game. Lousy distributor.
1.0	"I feel a need to share my experiences regarding this system in hopes of preventing someone out there a lot of anguish. I own a video game store and started out selling these consoles. Yobo has a great idea here, and when the unit works, it is generally pretty faithful to the original. Unfortunately, the word \\""quality\\"" is not in their vocabulary. I'll give you some statistics from my own experiences in selling these. I started out with 10 consoles. Three didn't work straight out of the box. Each console comes with two controllers, times 10 systems = 20 total controllers. Of these 20, 5 didn't work out of the box, another 12 broke within the first week or two of use. The 'D' pad controller is what breaks on them. Four out of twenty total light guns didn't work out of the box. The unit comes with no paper work or warranty information of ANY kind. We, however, had a warranty through our distributor so we were able to get replacements on the defective parts. However, out of all the replacements I got back, about 50% did not work or broke within the first week or so. My distributor even told me a story that one unit blew up and burst in to flames when it was plugged in! I am not alone in my experiences with this unit. Our distributor told us that it is an ongoing problem that most people have with Yobo. We have since discontinued selling this product, but are still having to replace parts for customers. If you are looking for a system that will play NES & SNES games, try the Retro-Duo system. So far, from my experience, it seems to be much better quality and it will also accept the original SNES controllers. Additionally, I have never been able to get a response from Yobo regarding any of these issues, so you will unlikely have any sort of recourse from them. I hope this information saves someone out there from all the grief that I have endured from this company.  Good Luck"
1.0	Worked great for a month.  Excellent interface, good learning tool fun to play.  However, the cable always stops working.  I can usually excuse this if it happened once, but two cables stopped working on me.  UBISoft should get their act together and put a more durable cable, especially if they are going to charge 30 dollars for an extra cable.
1.0	Although the game was kind of fun, it was really short and took me less than 3 hours to beat. The highest level you can get to is 25, and after you beat the game there are no special features, like starting over with everything you have or getting to be a supersaiyon the whole game! Also the supersaiyon ability only raises your speed, you don't even get stronger! Overall, the game isn't one to waste [$$] on. I think if it went down to about [half price] then you might want to consider it. <BR>  P.S. Your Kamehameha wave goes half way across the screen and<BR>       disappears!
1.0	Let's get some things straight.  I have read all of the other reviews and have noticed how much people have been praising this game.  My opinion is quite different.<br />Sure the game has some great features like the Franchise and Expansion modes.  The Expansion mode is fun, but only if you're interested in a team of mostly no-names who you can't trade because nobody else wants them. The game's got all the updated lineups and the graphics are impressive.  The players actually do look like the players in real life and it's complete with all the trademark batting stances, etc.<br />However, the game play is very lacking.  Akklaim did a great job with how the game looks but now with how it plays.  Take for example the first two games I've played in my season.  A 9-7 win and a 13-4 loss.  Roger Clemens is too tired to continue after four scoreless innings? Michael Tucker hits three triples and a double in one game? Chris Singleton hits three homeruns? These things just don't happen, nobody can deny that.  It's just not realistic.  <br />Batting is difficult.  You have to slam down on the button to swing.  Most of the time all the guy will do is check swing at the pitch.  Fielding isn't any easier.  The players move slow and awkwardly towards the ball and then don't throw it to the base you tell them too.  Plus there is a delay between when you push the button to throw and when they actually do it.  Stealing bases is impossible as the directions in the instruction book don't actually work.  <br />The gameplay of this game is definately not 'All Star' caliber.  It's more like a minor leaguer trying to tread water and not succeeding.
1.0	Wouldn't work when it got here and not worth the hassle of sending it back.
1.0	Download the free demo. This was one of the few (non-RPGs) I stopped playing midway through. The controls are unresponsive and the track is quite unforgiving.
1.0	EA still hasn't managed to put decent gameplay into its arcade title. this game might look like football in screenshots but it doesn't even come close to feel or look like it when you play it. go get a title from konamis Winning Eleven / Pro Evolutions Soccer series (WE6I or PES2). They are near perfection in terms of gameplay and realistic behavior and nothing comes close to them.
1.0	I opened the controller, but it would not connect to the xbox 360 console. It just kept blinking. I did everything, but in the end the controller did not work. I know it is not the console's problem cause I just got it a week ago. I'm disappointed.
1.0	We could not get through the intro/tutorial without the game crashing.  We installed patch 1.05, but that didn't help.  We updated the PS3 software that didn't help.  We turned off our Internet connection.  That didn't help.  We tried going to the Disney Infinity website to report the bug, but their website was not working so we couldn't report the problem.  The website wouldn't even let us register.  Mickey should be very, very sad and embarrassed.  If you are going to rip off Skylanders, you should a least make a game that works.
1.0	Ok, first of all, its a very short game, even thou i purchased it to have a game to play with my friends, but i received a big surprise, the game was only for 1 player, i can describe that with only 1 word, STUPID, i mean it doesn't make sense to have a racing game only for 1 player, what's next? soccer for 1 player?  Hey guys really this game sucks!
1.0	What a piece of s*** this console is.. Opened the box followed the instructions and everything spent 4 hours calling Sony and all they told me was faulty internal and HDMI port really... Really Sony returned the whole thing and the games I purchased to Amazon (they were great)
1.0	Unbelievably bad game. No season, no roster management, the homerun derby is boring...I have a 6 year old baseball game for original gameboy that beats this garbage hands down.   Don't waste your money.
1.0	I ordered this memory  card new for the ps1 games I had.  It was not  new, as stated, no packaging  and it did not work.  will never order anything from this vender or amazon again.  i feel i was taken.
1.0	This is one of the worst game's I have played in my life.DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.It looks like it like it would be a fun game right?Saten takes many forms.This game is sooooo boreing.3DO screwed up.It is my bad luck that 1 is the least number of stars I could give it.This game totally sucks.
1.0	Wish I had my $60 back i would buy a game i could actually play. Internet connection is required to play the game and EA's servers have been down almost since the launch. Don't waste your money on Sim City.
1.0	They came to me broken
1.0	Neither the car charger or the wall charger is working, while the original nintendo charges perfectly. So im thinking about returning them although they r cheap
1.0	If your game requires you to use the buttons on the controller and nunchuck these gloves will not work for you.
