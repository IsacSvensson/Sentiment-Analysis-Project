5.0	The handles are important, now my kid doesn't grab the sides of the bowl which means little hands stay cleaner.<br />The pee guard does a great job.<br />My thirty pound kid fits in it well.<br />It's a simple product done right.
5.0	This cart cover is the best! I previously had bought another sort and was very difficult to use and didn't cover the sides of the cart.<br />Love the color and super washable fabric. It is sewn together very well and Covers all sides of the cart.  It is large enough to fit large sizes cart as well. Nice safety harness both around the cart and on the inside for baby. It also has little pockets to hold toys,snacks, etc. for you or baby. Very pleased with this purchase. Only wished it had come with a carrying bag, but I use a cloth shopping bag for it.
5.0	I absolutely love this seat. I bought 2 for my 3 1/2 year old twins and I couldn't be happier with the quality. I also love that you can harness up to 65 lbs in this seat- that was a major selling point for me. Easy to install. Only downside is this seat is a little heavy and bulky but in my case the seats are very rarely removed fro the car so that isn't an issue for us. However it might be something to think about for someone who will need to transfer a seat from car to car.
5.0	"We just purchased this dresser along with the matching Park West crib and we could not be more pleased!  The dresser features two top drawers that swing out so you can stay close to baby while changing.  The drawers are spacious, of solid construction, and do not feel flimsy on the track like some options we looked at.  The walnut finish is gorgeous and I love the black trim on the bottom.  This piece is a great price for the quality and overall look.  The dresser is the perfect length, approx 40\\"", for a changing pad and safety railing (included). And the dresser was shipped fully assembled so all we had to do was put it in the nursery.  I highly recommend the Park West nursery set!"
5.0	Brought a smile to my sister's face which was the whole purpose of the purchase.
5.0	I love this I can't wait until my daughter is old enough to play with this !! It's is not too big not too small just right size
5.0	Best car seat on the market! Steel frame and narrow enough to put 2 side by side.
5.0	Bought for our 2 year who destroys the back of our seats. Easy to install and have worked wonders!
5.0	Wow! I don't know why they're not shouting from the mountain tops that this product is made in the USA. It's found in very small print in the description. I can't remember the last time i saw an everyday baby product such as this made here, unfortunately. Anyway was very pleasantly surprised to see the 'made in usa' seal when i received and knowing how good this product is in general, as are all the other gerber/NUK sippys which have been the best sippys we've found, knew i would be buying only from this company in the future..all the other sippy cups we've tried from other companies haven't been as good. Great price! is actually leak proof! and well made, this a def good buy.
5.0	"Great purchase; captivates attention and is a great way to spend \\""tummy time\\"" - the kids are enthralled by the noise and lights! Love!"
5.0	Love the Baby Dee Dee! It successfully helped our then four month old transition from being swaddled since the bottom portion still feels contained but allowed her to safely have her arms free. The snaps are helpful when maneuvering it onto a sleeping baby and the fabric is the perfect balance of soft and breathable. Only downside is that it can't be used with the car seat or swing.
5.0	Nice texture and not too hot! Have washed at least 30x and have not shrunk nor lost their stretchability.
5.0	I am so happy with this purchase.  I originally bought the pink sparkle one, but had to return it because the box didn't include the screws.  After reading all the reviews, I finally decided to give this one a try.  The green mat helps keep my baby in place, so no sling is necessary.  In fact, I like it more than if it did have a sling with it.  I started using this tub when my daughter was 2 months old.  She's 4 months now, and I'm still loving that she can grow with it for another long while.  The little water toy is wonderful for rinsing the shampoo out of her hair.  I would definitely recommend this product.
1.0	Like another reviewer mentioned, this product may be a health hazard--the water reservoir for the steamer has a coating that flakes off and smells metallic after a few uses. This is DEFINITELY your run-of-the-mill mineral deposit or limescale. This is the coating of the reservoir that is coming off. Another reviewer has already posted a picture of the issue and I have just posted one as well. If you already own the Brezza, I would advise that you inspect your water reservoir closely. If you're considering purchasing one, I would steer clear.
1.0	I wish I would have never bought this product. It was very long, so I couldn't open the cabinets/drawers on either side of my stove. Because of this, I had to remove the stove guard any time I wasn't cooking. I could deal with this (I guess), but I had the product for about 5 days before my 12 month old daughter broke off the cheap plastic bracket that I was required to attach to the oven door. The next day she broke the other bracket leaving the stove guard without an anchor on the bottom. To add insult to injury, the foam adhesive that was on the back of the useless plastic bracket was really hard to remove from my oven door. I had to scrape, use Goo Gone and then a Mr. Clean Magic eraser to get the stupid thing off.
5.0	We tried several different bottles with our breastfed newborn twins including Born Free, Dr. Brown (both regular and wide neck), Tommy Tippee, MAM and Playtex. While they could take all of those bottles they struggled with nipple confusion and feedings were a bit of a fight. These bottles were a lifesaver!<br /><br />PROS<br />-Cut down on gas<br />-Great for breastfed babies<br />-Not a lot of parts to wash like some other bottles<br /><br />CONS<br />-Hard to see measurement markings
5.0	Doesn't Leak Even up side down.  Took my twins 10 months old only 2 minutes to figure it out.
5.0	Great for saving toys from falling out of stroller or car seat!
1.0	My least favorite diaper covers. I'm selling mine off. The fabric is so thin you can see right through it. It's also the ONLY diaper cover in my collection that is prone to staining around the elastics. Sunning and lemon did not help. (EBF baby)
5.0	Much better than the first bottle brush I had (that rusted after 2 months of using it). I love the suction cup that allows it to stand on our sink. It makes it far more sanitary. I will definitely be purchasing this one again after it wears out! (Although, I've had it for 2 months and it's still in mint condition!)
1.0	Very difficult to adjust the harness..I should have looked for another type..not what I expected...i wouldn't recommend it to anyone
5.0	I read a lot about the anxiety people have about losing their Fitbit because it is so small. I ordered the first set for myself and found a lot more uses than I had intended! First I feel secure that I won't lose my pedometer with the safety clip attached to my shirt. I use two to clip a small laundry bag on the front of my treadmill and store the tv remote and phone so I don't have to get off the treadmill. I also clip the Fitbit with the safety leash to my scrunchie in my hair when I am in the bathtub or hot tub. Then I ordered another Fitbit for my girlfriends birthday and another set of the safety leashes for her. I think they are great!
5.0	bought it on behalf of someone, but it did come with rave reviews that's why my friend wanted this.
5.0	This bottle was just what I needed for a baby shower I was giving for my daughter in law...I filled it with  animal crackers and made a guess the amount game with it... very good delivery....thanx
5.0	Loved this item for my grandson. It makes bath tub so much fun and easier for my daughter they love it too.
5.0	This organizer has lots of pockets to fit a variety of objects.  I was happy with the adjustable strap on the top and didn't even need to use the bottom strap.  I even had room to put a spare change of clothes in it for my toddler so I don't have to keep hauling them around in my diaper bag.  Great idea!
5.0	just what we needed to keep the puppy on our side of the office at our business.
5.0	By far this is my favorite stroller. I have a newborn and toddler and it is perfect for my needs. The storage underneath is quite large. My favorite feature are the six different seating positions. If my toddler falls asleep I can easily recline the seat to make her more comfortable. It really is a smooth ride too. It folds down seamlessly, but it is tad bulky for my trunk. But it doesn't bother me.
1.0	It worked fine for the first 24 hours, and then the sensor quit working and the light remained lit all the time.  I had attached it to the wall with the double-sided tape that came in the package, and when I removed the night light from the wall, it damaged the wall.  See photos.  I live in a rented apartment, so I'm going to have to pay to have the damage repaired.
5.0	Exactly as described and easy to wash off.  A MUST for parents of toddlers.  Only downfall is that unlike the JUMBO crayons, these will break easily.  Wish they made the Jumbo crayons easy to wash as well.
5.0	Your company is one of the best companies I've ever had business with. They serve the public with integrity and good will. ..
5.0	My grandson loves this walker.  He was only 4 months old when he started to use it.  It was easy for him to move around in it.  He loves the music that it makes when he touches the radio on it.  Great product.
1.0	This item absolutly disgusts me. Not only are black women YET AGAIN depicted as loose, unintelligent (the usage of ebonics is such a 20th century pitfall of our civilization), now there is a wig depicting the plight of a black woman. Making it 'OK' for little girls to emulate a skank who can't make good choices therefor having a child out of wedlock and making it ok for young boys to want to have unprotected sex and father children they can't take care of.  I am going to encourage people NOT to buy from this seller and buy into the americanized propaganda of hatred.
5.0	I went back to work full time at 12 weeks, knowing that I was going to have to pump b/c I work 12 hr days.  at first I was using a hands free nursing bra, but that became time consuming and cumbersome. I happened to stumble upon this product while meandering through Amazon and it is AMAZING. I love that it means I don't have to change clothes every time I need to pump (4-5 times a day) The built in bra support isn't fabulous, but the fact that it's a nursing tank and a pumping tank combined (and one that actually holds the flanges in place at that) well make up for the bra parts of things.  I agree with other reviewers, you need to buy more than one of these.  I only bought one at first, but since I live in them during the work week, quickly decided that purchasing a couple extras was absolutely necessary rather than washing and drying every night.  Thanks Rumina for a great product!
5.0	Love knowing that it's all one piece. My baby really likes this pacifier. We tried several different kinds, but she only wanted this one.
5.0	This calendar is beautiful.It comes with lots of stickers and places for photos on each month. The best part is the pages are full scrapebook size and are perforated for easy removal when the year has passed which will make a scrapebook easily, even for the craft challenged. The graphics are very nice and the size makes it a piece of art and part of the room's decor. Well worth the money
5.0	These bibs have held up to some pretty messy meals and come clean with no stains. That's a winner in my book.
5.0	My granddaughter love this!  She gets excited to see the balls go down and it colorful makes her giggle and seems to be built good.
1.0	We got this cover to replace our original Quest raincover we had lost. It is an original MacLaren accessory and supposedly fits the models Triumph AND Quest - but it runs about 1-2 inches too loose for our 2008 MacLaren Quest. I have to use a clip and fold over to tighten it, otherwise it would just slip off the front of the canopy. We haven't been caught in a downpour yet, but my improvised solution might not be rain proof.
5.0	I gave this gift to my grandson for his new baby.  I just love getting the pictures every month with his age.  These stickers are a great idea.
5.0	The precious planet jumperoo is far and away my baby's favorite toy in the world. He is delighted with the toys, music and jumping action. The bright colors and animals are wonderful. He also has a hand-me-down exersaucer which he finds BORING! If you're trying to choose between the two - go for the jumperoo.
5.0	These stick well, but my daughter (16mos) can pull them off if she is left unattended.  I just make sure I keep an eye on her while we are at the table.  The patterns are educational and colorful and my daughter responds very positively to these placemats.  There is adhesive on all four sides which is nice and this product offers peace of mind because I know her food is going on a clean surface.
5.0	These are the only pacifiers my little one would take! We had tried the soothies and she just couldn't hang on to them-they kept popping out! These are much easier for her to keep in. She can soothe herself to sleep in the middle of the night now! Happy mama.
5.0	I really like this product so far.  I put it in my diaper pail and then just wash it with my diapers every time I do a load. It seems to be holding up well and serves it's purpose nicely!
5.0	Bought these for my niece and nephew.  Being twins, they spend a lot of time laying in things.  This has changed my sister-in-law's life!  They are 2 months old and are fascinated by them.  They pretty much fit on anything (Snug-a-bunnies, moses baskets, car seats, bouncer seats etc).  Great product!
5.0	My family and I loved it!!! It arrived in good condition and on time. It does NOT have a bad smell.
5.0	Yep, he's stuck on this pacifier. So I have no idea what will happen if this company suddenly goes off the deep end. That makes me want to start stockpiling as I type.
5.0	Truly lovely!  I bought it as a gift for my granddaughter, and my daughter loves it, it's pretty, feminine, and not something everyone else has.
5.0	I started potty training my daughter at 18 months and after a couple of months of training, she was in big girl undies. I put this in her car seat to protect it. Early on, she had an accident in her seat and all I had to do it wash the piddle pad and everything was like new! With only one accident, the pad is still like new. I love it!!!
5.0	I read many reviews and finally registered for a competitor's pump, but when I saw Dr. Brown/Simplisse advertising soft, flexible breastcups and found this pump on sale, I didn't pass it up. With iffy reviews on every pump, who could choose confidently? According to the instruction booklet, the first pumping might not yield any milk. It didn't. In fact, I pumped about an ounce total for the first five pumps. Now I get 2-3 ounces per breast. I recommend buying a hands-free pump bra too because it allows you to relax during pumping. Relaxing is paramount! If you watch every drip with cramped hands (and only fill an ounce) and can't scratch an itch or blow your runny nose, you'll be miserable and hate pumping all together. I never used another style of pump, but I find this one gentle, effective, and quiet enough (hey, it is a machine).
5.0	I was searching for a good video baby monitor for weeks. I had an audio-only baby monitor, but it's a pity I could not see the condition of my son, e.g. his sleeping position, whether the blanket is in place, etc.  Unfortunately, most video baby monitors are either analog (interference) or without the talk-back feature.  My old audio-only monitor is analog and it has quite a bit of interference, but it has a good feature: two-way radio for talking back to the child -- a feature that I feel very important.      This 2.4GHz Digital Wireless Baby Monitor System with Night Vision meets all my expectations, at a very affordable price comparatively.  It works immediately out-of-the-box, no interference, clear audio and video, good night vision, and I can talk back to my son.  The voice activated alarm and video works pretty well. Only one small complaint: it wakes up from sleep mode and turns on the video/audio for only a brief moment (like 5 seconds) which is too short, it would have been better if the duration is like 30 seconds or configurable; but it's not a big deal - I can always turn off the sleep mode immediately with a touch of a button.    I highly recommend this baby monitor.
5.0	I bought this duck because it had many features i looked for, which were the duck is submersible in body of water and shows temp. with slightest drop of water on the bottom; has three nice changing colors (blue for cold, green for ideal, and red for hot) that help indicate best temp for the baby; and sturdy/strong feel. You wont go wrong with this product, will last a while.<br /><br />However, one thing that i may say i did not like was the slightly large range in acceptable temp. for the baby (96-102 F).
5.0	I wish I had known about this bra with my first born and also before I bought another Medela for my second.  I love that it is adjustable so you don't have to buy another one after some of your baby weight comes off!
5.0	I love it! I ordered it to specifically have on a trip from Montana to Louisiana and it was a great investment. My son is a little small for an 8 month old and sitting in the restaurant high chairs his chin barley came above the table if we were lucky. This puts him at a good height and right at the table with us. It was a little difficult the first time (I didn't read the directions)  but after that it was a piece of cake. Wish I had ordered 2 so I could have one at home and one in the car!
5.0	works awesome! Absolutely recommend it!
5.0	These flanges work perfectly with my spectra s1 pump, which is amazing since spectra includes size 24mm flanges with their pumps and they only work with wide neck bottles. These flanges work great and also fit perfectly with my medela bottles (to pump into) and my medela adapters for when I want to pump directly into bags. I would definitely recommend them.
5.0	Absolutely great organizer. I use it as cosmetics holder and it works great.
5.0	Absolutely the best. Can take anywhere for piece of mind. And spying on other kids too! Easy two way communication.
5.0	This walking toy is absolutely adorable! Both my son and I enjoy this toy. The crocodile's tail/back half of his body wiggle from side to side as it moves along. As it swings from side to side, it makes a click clack sound. The sound isn't obnoxious either, and I don't mind it at all. I actually think the whole thing is really cute. The string is plenty long for my 1 year old to pull and move with. The picture is a bit deceiving, as it the green of the crocodile and the string is not nearly as neon. I don't mind this, and I am actually happy that is was muted in comparison.
1.0	Disappointing. Its not sturdy enough. It feels like its going to fall anytime. I wish it looked exactly like in the picture.
5.0	Great spoons!  We've tried other plastic spoons and the food slides off easily.  These plastic spoons have just the right texture so that the food doesn't slide off before it makes it into baby's mouth.  Need to buy more!
5.0	My testers, ages 10 and 4, loved Squeez'Ems right away. We found them simple to use and easy to clean. They're especially great if you need to take drinks on the go or in a lunch pale and you've run out of juice boxes, or if you'd like to get away from using juice boxes altogether. You can also use them for semi-liquids such as apple sauce or yogurt. See my review with video here: http://wp.me/p4L1Zf-3f .
5.0	Love it for days out with the baby. We use it on the back of a City Mini and it fits perfectly. Holds quite a bit and is easy to install and uninstall quickly.
5.0	My daughter received this item for Christmas. She really loved this item and it is also very cute and sturdy!
5.0	I can rinse these in the sink and let them air dry. Great for if you don't have in unit washer/ dryer. The Seuss print is a nice gender neutral choice.
5.0	Love this bedding set! The colors are soft but not too pale and the paisley is adorable! My girl is nine months and it is still holding up strong. I have used the  blanket quite often and washed many times in cold water. The colors have not faded. Overall, it's a great buy!
5.0	Love that this car seat is safe! It is also very comfortable for my little one! I would recommend to anyone.
5.0	My twin toddlers started daycare recently. I was using permanent marker to mark everything, including sippy cups, lunch box containers, etc. One wash through the dishwasher and everything had to be relabeled each time. I purchased a few types of labels, but these are my favorite due to the self-laminating feature. They are easy to use, when you remove the strip to laminate the label, your writing doesn't smudge and the labels stick very well. I labeled several items and they have been through the dishwasher several times, no problems at all - the labels work great! I will definitely be buying more.
5.0	Love love this tec plush for my toodler
1.0	I tried to like this product. I followed the directions, and it simply would not dissolve in water or witch hazel. It just stayed as oily globs no matter how much I shaked. The smell was nice, and I was looking forward to using it, but since you aren't supposed to use it full-strength, I couldn't have concentrated spots on some of my wipes. I purchased a much better solution that uses many of the same ingredients from a local merchant, and I am very happy with it. This useless stuff is on it's way back to Amazon!
5.0	I absolutely love this mobile. When my son was young I used to put him to sleep by keep turning this on with the remote. It worked great he was sleeping in no time. I received 2 of the wind up mobiles for my baby shower but never really used them . I put them on the crib but they are mostly for decaration. This is the best mobile ever. My mom said she wished they had something like this when i was a baby!!! lol
1.0	I purchased this for the same reason everyone does: it's cute and makes diaper changing easier cause don't gotta put their legs in pants.<br /><br />Sadly this is probably the worse purchase I ever made. It zips in the bottom and has button straps. At first before LO was born I thought it was a great idea. Until I actually used it on her. Putting it on her was horrible! She hates it. I have to put this over her head and it's so thick that it just covers I too if her face! It doesn't even scrunch under her head like how her body suits and other sleep sacks do. She hated it! And then when I finally get it down it's too small!!<br /><br />It says for 0-6 months! my LO is only 2 months! LO wears size 3 months clothing so she's not one of those extra big babies. This has a design flaw. It would be so much more useful if the zipper was down the middle like the Carter's sell sacks instead than have it only at the bottom. It also made changing uncomfortable for her because we have to roll the sack up and it causes a big bulge under her lower back.<br /><br />Total waste of my money because LO couldn't use it at all!
5.0	Very effective. Was pleased that I could properly secure the closet doors and keep my little one out. Highly recommend
5.0	EASY ASSEMBLY. NO SHARP EDGES
5.0	This was an open box item, but was still inside a plastic bag and good as new.  I bought this for my little cold natured chihuahua so she could be elevated off the drafty floor.  She loves it!  It is low enough for her to get on and off easily and looks nice in the living room.
5.0	This play yard is sturdy and easy to set up.  Amazon was where I found it to be the cheapest.
1.0	Very disappointed in this product for the price.  The sound on this item did not work when received.  This product was definitely NOT worth the money that was paid for it.
5.0	I have three children ages 5, 3 and 12 months.  I bought the Alpha Omega seat for my oldest, loved it, and when I needed a bigger seat for my second child, I bought another one.  Now I need yet another seat for my youngest and will purchase one for a third time.  Some great features are the extremely easily adjustible height position (all others are clumsy), the removeable base for booster function.  It also has a wide age and weight range, rear facing up to 40 lbs, front facing in the booster function up to 80 lbs. (the law in my state says 8 years old or 80 lbs in at least a boster seat).  I was reading some of the other reviews and must say to get any car seat securely in the vehicle, you must sit in it.  If you go to a safety check point, this is what they will do.  Also, I have been an ER nurse for many years and have seen what car accidents can do to children in substandard seats or children secured improperly into their good seats (this happens more often than I can say).  I totally recommend this seat for safety conscious parents, and that these same parents get to a car seat safely check to have their seat properly installed.  As a sidebar, almost all of my co-workers in the ED that have small children also have this seat for many of the same reasons!!.
5.0	When baby proofing our cabinets, I noticed my daughter had a tendency to still manage to get her fingers in the door when facing a normal child lock.  These locks fix that problem.  As far as she's concerned the cabinets that have these installed may as well be just ornamental.  She doesn't even try to open them anymore.  They keep the doors completely closed and locked.  The magna-key is easy to use.<br /><br />My one caveat is that they are a bit fiddly to install.  And with certain types of doors, there may be bits of metal in the corners that interferes with the locks.  But overall, I'm very happy with these.  Be sure to buy a spare key though - just in case.
5.0	I bought this as gift for a new mother.  She said it is great and she is glad she put it on her gift registry.
5.0	The best creative harness in the world. It keeps the child safe and within your sight. It feels soft to the touch so that it doesn't hurt the child. This is really helpful when shopping. Recommend this to all mothers and fathers.
5.0	I just bought this for my 1 year old and have used it a few times already. It has worked out great and is very sturdy. We have received a lot of compliments on it. I really like bringing it into a restaurant rather than using their gross highchairs. It is pretty easy to set up too. We brought it to use for my son's 1st birthday party and he got cake and frosting everywhere on the fabric but it all washed out easily. The price is great too!
5.0	Be careful when installing the drop side.  You may need help with this step to make sure that everything is aligned properly and that the plastic tabs (at the bottom on each side) don't get stuck the wrong way.
5.0	We got received this bag as a baby gift from my sister.  It is great.  Yes it is big, but it holds EVERYTHING!  I also have the smaller bag for short trips to babysitter or church but seems like I can never fit everything I want in it.  So many little compartments to stash things.Worth every penny!
5.0	If it weren't for these amazing anti-finger pinchers my daughter would not have any fingers! She's at the terrible two stage and slams (or tries to) doors with serious intensity, but thankfully bc of this item the doors just bounce back after only a slight movement! I also use them to keep my front door open when it's windy out!
5.0	This is a great rocker and bouncer!  Why buy a bouncy seat?  For the same amount of money you buy this rocker that will stay with your baby from birth to 2 years at least!  I love it!  The toys on the bar are engaging.  The vibration is perfectly soothing!  And, the kick stand is great for smaller babies that are taking naps.  A must buy for any baby!
5.0	I love it and best of all baby loves it
1.0	"I've been reading a lot of reviews on bottle warmers.  Some heat up bottles in 1-5 minutes.  Well I have a way to make it even quicker without using a warmer. Assuming you're using formula (this won't work for breastmilk) this is what I do.  I used to buy the liquid formula which took forever heating on the stove.  Now I buy the powder formula.  I keep on the kitchen counter a pitcher of sterilzed water, the powdered formula can and a glass measuring cup.  When my 3 month old starts fussing for a bottle I pour the water in the measuring cup and put it into the microwave for 15 seconds. I only put water in the microwave, not the formula. While it's in the microwave I get the bottle ready (which I keep out of sight).  By then the water is done.  I pour it in the bottle, add 2 scoops, shake and I'm done. It takes less than a minute to make a bottle for my son.  Just about every night I wake to his \\""beginning\\"" fusses, which are more like moans.  I get the bottle made right before it turns into a full blown cry!!! Plus I don't even need a portable warmer because I can put more water in the microwave for like a minute and store it in a thermos.  So it's still warm for when I need to make a bottle.  Again I pour, add 2 scoops and shake!! Makes life so much easier.  Don't waste your money.  And Babies R Us sells a 2 lb can of baby formula (powder) in their brand (especially for baby) for $12.99.  If you've tried it and you don't like it because of the bubbles once you shake it add one tiny drop of infant gas drops.  Works wonders!!! Just passing info along.  I don't like it when mom's spend money on something that could go better for something else, like cute clothes!!! or diapers!!"
5.0	I wish I had these for all my kids! Got them for my youngest whose 3 months and ended using for her and my toddler since they are so nice! Great buy!
1.0	I have a square standup shower and find it hard to prop my leg up high enough to shave my legs with relative ease.  I thought this would be a great solution.  It falls right off the wall, every single time I put any pressure on it at all.  When you stick it on the wall and test with your hands, it seems to hold.  But the moment I put my leg up, NOT even putting all weight on it, the thing pops off and falls to the ground.  The idea is great, but execution is worthless.
5.0	We keep a box of these downstairs and upstairs at each of our diaper changing stations.  At each diaper change we use these bags to place our dirty diapers and wipes and we keep a trash can in our garage that we throw the dirty bags in.  Much better than using a diaper pail and keeping dirty diapers in a room.  We also keep some in our diaper bag.  Love them!
5.0	I bought this for a baby gift.  When I asked the mom what she could use for her already 6-7 month old baby, she said she was interested in a walker.  She basically left the selection up to me, but did mention that her little boy was not a &#34;light-weight.&#34;  Other walkers I looked at had lower weight cut-offs.  I described the Safety 1st Safari one to her and she liked it.  Well.... now that I've received it and given it to the baby, I know it has made a real hit!!  He almost immediately began moving in it, and now is reportedly scooting all over the place.  Also, the price on amazon was far better than at my local store!
5.0	I'm good very satisfied.
5.0	I love it! Very fast shipping!
5.0	I got this toy for my 7 month old baby boy. He enjoys playing with it a lot. Very good toy.
5.0	Fast shipping. Works perfect and is light for our hot weather.
5.0	The set was better looking & more functional than I thought it would be!  It was a gift to my granddaughter & she loves it.
5.0	My son loved the gym. We would go to sleep with it and we knew when he woke up because we would hear the music.  My son is 16 now but I could remember the music.<br />It is a must have
5.0	I can't even get over how absolutely adorable this is! It makes me want to starve myself for six months just so that I can squeeze into it. That's a little dramatic, and I'm never going to do that, but! I would totally wear this. If it was an adult size.<br /><br />It is a one piece poodle skirt outfit, and my absolute favorite thing about this, besides everything is not underneath the poodle skirt, there is a lining that will protect your little girls skin from the material of the tutu.  But, the material of this tutu doesn't seem to be the regular type of tulle... its really soft, which I have never seen before on a tutu. Maybe I haven't paid close enough attention to the ones for little girls, but the ones that I have always had, when I was a kid and a ballerina, they were always just so itchy.<br /><br />There are 3 layers of tulle, and each layer is sewn on with a double stitching with a line across the top with the shiny decorative additions. In the tutu, there is the only glitter through it on the top layer, which is just fine because I think adding any more throughout the rest of the outfit might be a little overwhelming.<br /><br />The extra ruffles that are sewn on, the pink, on each layer has a really nice strong stitching throughout it I definitely would be confident in knowing that a little girl could wear this and still be able to play without it getting ruined.<br /><br />As for the top, I love that the decorative shiny doesn't go all the way around. And that it's a really soft cotton.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this to parents who have beautiful little girls who like to be a princess, ballerina, or even just love to play dress up. This is absolutely adorable, and has the perfect amount of poof in the tutu... its just adorable...<br /><br />I received this product at a discounted rate for an honest review.
5.0	You can use them on almost all toys, I just recommend that you wash them before you use them as babies tend to put them in their mouths.
5.0	perfect and nice stroller！！！！
1.0	When this was delivered, I just knew my boys would love the Toy Story theme on it.  Unfortunately they haven't yet seen it.  I opened the package and the smell on this was so strong, it was overbearing.  I was going to the basement anyway so I brought it downstairs to air out.  It was weeks later and you could still smell it, albeit not as strong.  It makes me wonder what kind of toxins there are to produce this smell.  I've held onto it too long to return it but I doubt it will be used.
5.0	We have been using these bibs for almost 2 years!  We bought one boys and one girls for our twins and they have really held up great.  I don't put them in the dryer but occasionally one will get in there with no problem.  I really like the inside out pocket so the food doesn't get stuck in the seam. <br /> <br />Highly recommended!
1.0	Please do not buy this crib. I bought 2 of these and the brackets holding the mattress base are TINY and the base always tends to slip off of time. Many times the mattress has collapsed. Luckily my child was not in it otherwise he could have suffered serious injuries. There is a design fault that endangers life and still these guys have no moral qualms about selling these cribs.
5.0	OK so nothing is perfect it cant fly , do my dishes or change the baby and it could use an optional shoulder strap .. which I spent 5$ and bought . Otherwise this bag rocks. its sturdy , functional , organized and pretty.I carry so much in it.. here is the list.<br /><br />6 Standard Dr. Browns bottles - 2 in each outside pocket 2 in each inside end pocket<br />10 size 2 diapers<br />1 pkg pacifier wipes<br />1 travel container butt wipes<br />1 kushies large changing pad<br />2 sleepers 2 onsies 1 pair of socks<br />1 tube butt cream<br />1 bottle gas meds<br />1 good size round jar of glycerin suppositories ( poor baby has intestinal issues)<br />1 battery powered formula mixer<br />2 round formula dispensers<br />2 pacifiers ( daily use )<br />2 pacifier holders<br />1 emergency ( storage ) pacifier<br />1 wet bag<br />1 emergency spit up cloth<br />1 daily spit up cloth<br />1 baby key ring<br /><br />AND I STILL HAVE ROOM Yay!<br /><br />yes the bag costs more but I can find everything I just listed .. without looking.<br /><br />buy it
5.0	It was purchased as a gift, it has noy been used yet, but the recipient was excited about it.
5.0	We live in an apt. so space is always an issue.  I wanted to get a highchair for my son, but didn't want to clutter the small eating area in the kitchen.  Wow, when I saw this new product I decided to give it a try (especially since the cost was so low).  I've been using it for 1 week and I love the convenience.  I keep it strapped to a kitchen chair and find it easier to feed my son rather than using his rocking chair or infant car seat.  My weak back is also happy.  I also love the fact that I can now feel more confident about inforcing family dinners at the table. <br /> <br />My son is quite active so feeding on the lap is by far a bad idea.  We are going to visit family in FL next month and I'm so thrilled that I can bring this product along.  Thanks Fisher-Price . . . . you've done it again!
5.0	My baby is really good at escaping from swaddled, but still startles herself awake when she isn't swaddled.  We ordered the Woombie when she started escaping from her Miracle Blanket every time.  It worked out great!  She can't escape from it, but she can wriggle her hands up to suck on them through the fabric, which she likes.  It is still tight enough to keep her from startling awake.  It unzips from both ends which is great for diaper changes.  We haven't had any problems with the zipper, it's under a soft cover with a snap and does not bother her skin.  I recommend buying two, one to wear and one to wash!
5.0	These muslin blankets are fantastic! Although soft out of the package, they continue softening with use- 11 mths in and they are simply luxurious. The prints haven't faded at all, and although definitely worn in, they show no signs of wear- not a single loose thread. Initially, I used these to swaddle our newborn, and they've been subsequently used to cover babe when nursing in public, to block the sun/wind in the stroller or car seat (I drape the blanket as a canopy), to lay him down for diaper changes (they wash very well), and of course as great snuggley blankets. They are lightweight enough to use in the sweltering summer heat but work just as well as an extra layer of insulation under a heavier blanket in winter. I have several other Aden + Anais blankets that come from their &#34;boutique&#34; line (i.e. much pricier), and they haven't worn nearly as well. Although the prints are a bit more attractive, the edging on those has shrunk significantly creating an oddly puckered shape. If I could think of a reason to buy more muslin blankets, I would forego the boutique and repurchase this 4 pack.
5.0	It is very good the size , weight and how to use it also how to arrange bottle equepment every one can use the devise
5.0	We didn't use any pacifiers with our eldest since we are a natural, breast feeding family.  Then our youngest was born and started teething at two months. This was the only thing that brought relief to her mouth and my breasts ( which she tried chewing).<br /><br />You can stick them in the fridge or freezer to cool them!<br /><br />Only con is they are the same color as our hardwood floors, so the are difficult to find if dropped.
1.0	I have some of the older Avent cups that have three pieces to the spout and they never leaked at all. So when I bought the new spouts I did not think that they would leak either but I was wrong. Avent has changed there spouts to just two pieces and the air hole leaks fluid after your child begins drinking from the cup. I thought it was just my old cups so I went out and bought new cups and they do the exact same thing! I really thought these were great products with my first two kids but now with the third I am second guessing the quality of the products.
5.0	"For 2 weeks I was searching for umbrella stroller and I could not find the one with all important stuff for me.<br />I wanted:<br />- big canopy, which will cover even back of the seat from sun<br />- recline padded seat (not wood board cover by material like all umbrella strollers has, or just material between pipes)<br />- big basket under<br />- cup holder and tray for baby (there is even one cup holder for parent)<br />- easy to fold<br />- light weight<br />- straps over arms (my baby is climber)<br />- stable foot rest (not just piece of rubber)<br />And I found all of it in this stroller, only problem was that was not folding like umbrella stroller. But after checking regular umbrella strollers from Chicco or The first years Jet even Ignite I decided to risk and buy online Countours, because has great reviews and has everything what I want only folding was the issue. (I will fly for vacation and need stroller there)<br />When I saw the box in which the stroller came, I was excited, it was easy to put it together and now I'm in love. I'm so happy that I risk to order online even I knew the folding is not the way I wanted, but now is not a problem at all. It's small and will be ok to take in airplane.<br />About the tray for baby, some reviews says that it's to high, it could be for younger baby (under 1 year) my son is 15 months and it's just right for him. Also I'm glad there is no window in canopy like some umbrella stroller has because when the sun is above there is no cover for baby's head, this canopy it's easy to fold down and see what is baby doing. And last thing to write is, that it's not that short handle, I'm 5'7\\"" and it's just like another strollers.<br />I just love this stroller *****"
5.0	This potty is awesome- especially for boys. You need the built in splash guard and good size. My 3 year old loves it. I couldn't be happier and the price is great!
5.0	I had to split the words into groups so my little one could pick from a smaller pile-otherwise it was too many pieces to go through
5.0	I purchased this for my 8 month old ... A definite upgrade from her carseat/carrier combo ... We will get a long use out of this !!! Not to mention how cute it is !!!
5.0	Easy to put together, rings make them easy to hang onto.  Good price.
5.0	Great product - just what we needed for our daily walks in the city.  It fits the stroller great (we have a baby jogger mini and regular size too) and it keeps our 15 month old toddler nice and cozy.  It's machine washable, and adjustable so when we're ready we can lenghen it.  You can also zip open the hood and roll each side back, so it's nice to have that option.  We expect to use it for several winters.  Highly recommend this product.
5.0	I started cloth diapering my daughter when she was 16 months old and loved the switch. However after the first few weeks she developed a rash that I determined wash from the detergent I was using. I bought this based on the reviews it recieved and because I was told it is good for babies with sensitive skin. I have been using it for a few weeks and it is great. Her rash started clearing up after the first few washes and is now gone. This will be the only detergent I use from now on.
5.0	These trees are really nice so easy to put on, great instructions and minature sample had to buy two sets because i wanted 4 tress as they are not large- so far it has stayed up well looks great
5.0	Soft and thick and durable.  Handle the numerous washings kids sheets get well.  Really like this brand of sheets for both my toddler and soon to be baby girl.
5.0	I bought this for my daughter. She uses it on her son's stroller. She said of all the gifts, this is one of the best.  Very strong and will hold multiple items.
1.0	We have been trying different bottles, nipples, you name it with our now five month old to get him to take expressed milk. We forked over big bucks for this nipple, only to be disappointed. Because baby has to suck to milk out, you cannot even get a drop out to tempt them into sucking. Over priced, you bet. Over glorified, yep. Save your cash and try elsewhere.
5.0	i wish i had known about these with my first baby! i have flat nipples and my babies have a really hard time latching. these work wonders and really saved my breastfeeding relationship with baby#2! plus you get two for the price of one medela !!
1.0	Does not function. Poor quality. It can fall apart in first time use. Decided to return right after opening the package.
5.0	Pumped for four weeks in hospital with preemie who had to be fed through tube, this was a sanity saver!!!!
5.0	Loved this must have when my little one started teething so had to purchase for baby two. The squeaker is fun but makes my dog think it is his!  A little expensive compared to store prices.
5.0	Love this seat! So does my 4 year old daughter! One of my favorite features is the flat bottom, I can install it to where it feels like it's part of the car. It doesn't budge. I highly recommend it for it's comfort and quality too.
5.0	Great alternative to the more expensive ones.  Works just as well!  I use this on a City Mini GT and it's perfect.
5.0	My mom ordered this through me for her great granddaughter and she and my great neice were very happy with the purchase.
5.0	Works awesomely.  Had to buy this following my daughter taking a huge bite of wood off her crib and almost seriously hurt herself.  Put these on, she stopped playing around and chewing.  Very soft, fits my Graco Lauren very well.
5.0	Couldn't live with out these things!!  Sure beats trying to pick up the pacifier or toy when our little guy decides to throw them.
5.0	This changing pad cover is very soft, and fits the Summer Infant changing pad perfectly.  It is easy to wash, and easy to put on and take off.  I would recommend getting two (especially at such a great price), so you always have a clean one available should the other get soiled.
5.0	It really did serve my purpose,doesn't lick and my baby loved it so much....I highly recommend it,.....easy to wash and assemble
5.0	This is our first audio monitor for our 6 month old little angel. Actually I didn't have any good option on VTech products but most of them said they really liked it so I want to give a try and I never regret it. We are very impressed with the sound quality.
1.0	"We have purchased 3 inflatable snug-tubs from Kelgar. The infant size tub was fine, and still works okay after 2 years. However, the slightly larger toddler size tub has a slow leak. The first one we bought had a very slow leak; after 9 months it turned into a fast leak, so we bought another one, thinking we wouldn't be unlucky enough to get another defective one twice in a row.     Wrong!!     The second one arrived with a slow leak in the same place as the previous toddler size snug-tub. At first it was so slow, it just meant we'd have to reinflate it once in a while; then you have to reinflate it more and more often until finally it won't last through one bathing without going limp. After the second flop, I decided to just send the leaky tub back to Kel-Gar and ask for a free replacement. They never responded to my friendly letter. When I finally called (took me a while to get around to it; I kept thinking that surely a replacement would be arriving any week now!), they were totally unhelpful.     The woman who answered at \\""Customer Service\\"" kept interrupting me to tell me that they do not accept returns, and any problems have to be taken up with the retailer. Way to stand behind your products, dudes!     Then when I called the retalier (Right Start) just now, they said that it's not their responsibility to handle a replacement, it's the manufacturer's-- BUT at least this customer service person was polite and said she's ask her boss and look into it more, just to see if there is anything they can do.     I'm really surprised that Kel-Gar cares so little about their image with the public and about providing pleasant and helpful service to their customers, especially repeat customers such as myself. I mean, come on, how hard is it to throw a piece of plastic that weights about 8 ounces in the mail to keep a customer happy??     However, since that is their attitude, you're better off buying an inflatable tub from a real-life (non-virtual) retailer with a decent 90-day return policy, such as Babies-R-Us or Target, so that if a leak develops you can physically take it back and get a replacement. That's what we'll be doing from here on out.     So long, Kel-Gar. The tub was \\""just ducky\\"" but your service was DOA!     Update: No go on the replacment. Big surprise.    Although not quite as cushy as this tub, I would highly recommend getting your baby or toddler the PRIMO EuroBath instead. We got it after having to give up on inflatables, and it is roomy, comfortable, and DURABLE, unlike Kel-Gar's products. 4.5 stars with 750 reviews on Amazon- you can't beat that!     [[ASIN:B000056OV0 PRIMO EuroBath Pearl White]]"
1.0	"This item arrived completely tarnished (large black and brown stains) on the inside, the handle of the cup looked like it had been chewed on and the \\""gift box\\"" it was packaged in was ripped and falling apart. I am so disappointed with this item and, to make matters worse, the baptism I ordered the gift for is tomorrow."
5.0	I never write reviews, but I have to write something for this manual pump. It is really fantastic!! It saved me when I was traveling last week. It is so convenient and very efficient, out of my expectation. I highly recommend it for mom who travels a lot.
5.0	I really like these bowls.  My son can tip them over but I have rarely noticed him doing so, and he throws everything!!  My husband teases that they look like dog dishes but I think they are the perfect size for my son.  They do well in the dish washer and are bright, fun colors.
5.0	"Unlike other reviews, this car seat base fits perfectly snug. I checked my vehicle's user manual to make sure I had the car seat in the proper location (I do not have a LATCH system)and I also watched an instruction video on YouTube that was published by Safe Kids USA. I got this base in a travel system and there is nothing flawed or faulty about it. The ONLY thing this base doesn't feature that others do is a \\""lock\\"" to snap over the seat belt, but it's perfectly safe without it. I even had my husband try to wiggle it and it didn't even move a centimeter."
5.0	These swaddle blankets are thicker than others (I have the &#34;For the birds&#34; set too), which is great for colder weather. The thickness also keeps my baby in place better than the thinner blankets where she can wiggle out or roll to the side sometimes.
5.0	Way better than the Bumbo!  My daughter used this for several months instead of the 3-4 weeks she could use the Bumbo.  Plus the tray allows her to play not just with the mounted toys (which is great because she can't throw those out of reach!) but to have other toys on the tray.  Plus, this always felt really secure to me.  I didn't worry about her tipping it over or trying to climb out because she was very entertained and it has a nice broad base.  I used to put her in the superseat on the bathroom floor while I took a shower.  It's not the best for feeding, from my perspective, because it's really hard to clean the tray with the creases and curves.
5.0	I just bought this car seat from 1800diapers and got it for $199, minus $20 discount and ordered 7 pm Tuesday, arrived Thursday afternoon with free shipping, great service!    The manual being attached to the seat is good and bad at the same time, I really would have liked to move it more in to the daylight to read it better, but alas could not because it was attached.    I literally could NOT tighten the straps the way the manual said, and I was following the instructions but it simply would not tighten at all - my solution?? REMOVE the seat, tighten the LATCH straps by looking to see how short they might need to be to be tight, then spend the next 5 minutes or so kneeling on the seat to push it back tightly into the seat cushion and pushing the clip onto the LATCH from underneath - painful, but effective as the seat is in so tightly with the upper tether that it moves at most a half an inch, which is way better than the previous seat I had (only reason I changed was because my daughter outgrew that seat by 3 years old and was too young to move to a booster).    So, all in all, this seat is great, it's a lovely pink that my daughter thinks is cool, it's very wide (so if your child is a little over average size they still fit), it fits into a PT Cruiser easily using LATCH, and it goes into the car as easily as any other car seat I have had - took about 30 minutes, which isn't too bad.    I recommend this for anyone with a child who is simply not ready or trustworthy enough to be in a seatbelt - my daughter can unclip a seat belt - she cannot undo this or any other 5 point harness!    Highly recommended and even better I got it for $179.99 including delivery - merely because it's pink!
5.0	I bought this bundleme for the car seat. In winter it can get to -25 celsius at night and coming into a cold car is one thing, but having something fuzzy bundle your little legs is nice. My son is 18 months and can't give his opinion vocally, but he doesb't kick it off. It's pretty easy to put on and couldnt probably be transfered easily to the stroller, but we haven't gone out in the winter yet with our stroller.
5.0	I used the primary colors in this bumper to set the tone for my son's room.  Navy and bright green with white have created a great contrast.  I washed the bumper when it arrived and had no problems - did not fade or come apart.  Ties work well to secure into place - fits my Pottery Barn Kids Kendall crib perfectly.
5.0	I registered and got the pink horse first, and baby loves it so much that I got the blue in case something happens to pink!
1.0	I have been looking forward to doing this kit since before my daughter was born. To chronicle her first Christmas, we decided to finally make this ornament using her handprint when she was 8 months old. Unfortunately, it wasn't what I'd hoped it would be. This isn't as easy as you'd think- I found the &#34;rolling pin&#34; to be a little too small and flimsy to adequately do this (I'd suggest an actual rolling pin), but I followed the instructions. When it came time for my daughter to place her mark, no matter how firmly (and gently) I pressed her hand into the clay, it didn't make any noticeable impression. I tried three times, each time rekneading the clay, rolling it out, etc. The best imprint I got is the one you can see in this picture. I ended up tossing it in the garbage, because you couldn't tell AT ALL what this thing was supposed to be.
5.0	"The blue super strong hooks make this a 5 star review.  I am not using this item for toys but rather for my products - I have zero shelving in my bath/shower so this is a simple and awesome solution!    Took a bit of elbow grease to flip the (blue) hooks into their \\""super suction\\"" mode.  I have about 4 normal sized fairly heavy products in there (shampoo, conditioner, face wash, etc.) and I hang my hair towels or a wash cloth on the hooks. It is not going anywhere!    The clear suction cups did not work on my tile which seems pretty plain, hardly textured. Did not hold up with all those products but probably fine for light toys.  The fabric loops of organizer are looped into the clear suction cups so you have to cut the clear cups off (not the loops) if you do not want to use the clear ones. I didn't want to cut anything so I just smooshed the clear ones underneath the blue ones for extra support.    The sellers checked in with me frequently to make sure I was satisfied and ready to remedy if I wasn't. Another 5 stars for them."
5.0	My daughter is only 3 months old, so I haven't gotten to use the bathtub without the sling in it, but so far I love it.  It doesn't leak (at least not yet) and it is perfect for giving her a bath comfortably.
5.0	Perfect size for my 2 year old in his toddler bed. He was so excited to have his own pillow. Seems like a good quality.
5.0	A little small for a kindergartener, but it worked and he loved it.
5.0	My daughter LOVES these water toys! Got them about 6 months ago and she ALWAYS plays with<br />them first. Best part is they haven't devolped any gunk on them like some bath toys do.
5.0	My granddaughter loves it. She not only likes to look at herself but also likes the little bugs on the sides. It sits up nicely so I can put it at the edge of her activity mat when she is on the floor.
5.0	This is so cute for our son's nursery that is whale themed. I like that it's not made out of paper, but still very light to hang on one nail.
5.0	must have for post op bbl
5.0	So soft and cuddly. Great size for travel. Great for 6 months and up. The rattle sound is light and not as annoying as other rattles.
1.0	My son would not eat from these nipples. The taste must have matched the horrendous smell. He made a face and refused to drink. I tried soaking them in dish soap and ran them through the dishwasher. Nothing helped.<br /><br />It was an even worse situation because of our vacation. I bought them to use with premade disposable bottles. I ended up having to buy extra bottles while on vacation so I could use the nipples from them<br /><br />It was a huge waste of money. I unfortunately bought the 25 count bag and paid a dollar a nipple.<br /><br />I definitely do not recommend them. I suggest buying cheap Parent's Choice bottles from Wal-Mart since they're $1 a bottle and they fit.
5.0	This organizer is so cool.<br />It is super heavy duty and easy to clean.<br />It has lots of space and pockets!! There is even one for you cell phone!! How cool is that!!<br />It has other uses besides the stroller, I latch it on the back seat of the car so that it is easy to reach and it keeps all your stuff so organized!!!
5.0	Very reasonably priced and practical.  It works essentially the same as those expensive ones.  Easy to clean and sturdy stands.
5.0	I really wanted one of these but didn't want to spend the forty bucks on the other brand. This is perfect if you have a baby in the winter.
5.0	These bags work well and together with the bin they go in, they make for the most pleasant diaper handling system we've used.  Between our babies, we've had just about every popular diaper pail system.  This one effectively seals the smells in and is easy to handle.<br /><br />Just don't be lazy and keep trying to cram diapers in there once the thing is full.  The extra space at the top of the bag is intended for the stink clinching mechanism.  Buy in these 30 packs and you're getting a very good deal for a very effective product.
5.0	"My son had a great deal of difficulty latching on during breastfeeding, and after many trials and tribulations, we switched full time to formula. Unfortunately, he had trouble latching on to bottles as well (he had an extremely stubby tongue at birth, apparently), including all of the fancy, expensive kinds. Finally, I stumbled upon these and in sheer frustration, thought, \\""What the hell, it's worth a try. They're so cheap compared to every other bottle.\\""<br /><br />Thank goodness I did. He loved them and had a very easy time drinking from them (I attribute that to the small nipple size). At the time I found them for a bit over a dollar each, and was able to buy a lot to cut down on how much I had to bottle wash as well. These were a huge lifesaver for my family, especially my son, and I highly recommend them. The caps are awesome for keeping the bottles from leaking and the bottles themselves are surprisingly sturdy. I put them through heat dry in the dishwasher probably a hundred times at least, and I had no issues whatsoever.<br /><br />Give these a try before you go for the spendier bottles."
5.0	This doll was beautiful!!!! it was not cheaply made and my niece adored it. thank you!
5.0	We used a Medela pump at the hospital and were given basic supplies to take home with us.  However, when the pump proved uncomfortable, these flexible phlanges made pumping with a Medela pump much more comfortable for me.
5.0	I purchased this item for the bottom of the staircase. I was happy with the extra-wide opening, as it can be difficult to carry laundry and such up the stairs through a narrow opening. It is anchored between the wall and the staircase spindle and has been very resilient. It resisted dogs trying to escape through it as well as children trying to escape, too! The top piece locks securely for extra safety, but it is easily undone if your hands are full. It's a great purchase.
5.0	Great product!  My child fits all secure and it does not take up space in my house.  I love the fact that it adjusts to my baby as he grows.  It has a nice finish and very practicle.
5.0	I was not sure about the multi-size diapers, but this worked great. It fit our skinny little newborn perfectly fine. It has leg gussets that prevent blowouts, and the snaps are easy to use.
5.0	This was a great way to keep our 2 year old from climbing up on the sink and balancing on her stomach while trying to wash hands.  It's easy to pull off when we have guests or when I'm filling up the humidifier, and it was nice to pick from a few colors to match our bathroom.  For seven bucks delivered, hard to go wrong.  So far the durability is fine but we've only had it for a few weeks.  Even if this only lasts 6 months, that's probably long enough as we only need it in that awkward phase when she can climb onto the sink but can't reach the water while standing normally.
1.0	I just want to reiterate how bad these cups are. Liquid leaks from the straw and there is a huge pool of milk aronud it. As we all know; formula is not cheap and it's frustrating to find a quarter of it outside the cup! Save your money and buy another type of cup.
5.0	I went though 3 baby carriers and I love my Ergo best. My daughter is 9 months and we still use and love it. When you have a child nap time can prevent you from leaving the house, but having the Ergo allows my daughter to take  naps when I am out doing errand or taking a walk. Another great feature is that it is comfortable. Other carriers hurt my shoulders, but with the Ergo the weight of the baby is distributed evenly throughout my body. Another great feature is the snap on hood. The hood protects the baby from the sun and gives the baby proper head support. Buy it and you will be satisfied.

5.0	Very simple which is why I love it!
5.0	excellent stuff, a must have if you are travelling with car seat.
5.0	I started using the Halo SleepSacks several months ago, when my son grew out of being swaddled.  It was a great transition from the swaddling- he's free to move his arms & legs around, but still seems to feel cozy & stays warm.  It's been a nice addition to his sleep routine- when we put him in the SleepSack, he now knows it's naptime or bedtime and starts to settle down.  Most importantly, it's very safe- the SleepSack fits well so as not to ever cover his face, no matter what sleeping position he settles into.  The cotton material is soft and durable (having withstood many washings so far!).  All in all, we're very happy with this line of wearable blankets!
5.0	I got this toy for my baby when he was 6 months old.  He is now 11 months and still loves it.  At first he just held on to it and looked at it.  Now he waives it around, moves it from hand to hand, pulls on it, shakes it, and drags it around with him everywhere.  It also doubles as a teether and he loves to chew on the cars and has learned to manipulate it to reach the back teeth to relieve some teething pain there.    The toy is adorable and is possible to easily attach to his carseat or stroller with a toy holder so that it won't get lost.  It is great quality and so far withstood months of constant play and teething action.  It is also safe as it is painted with non-toxic paint and made in Germany (and not in China - like most toys out there).
5.0	My seats are very well protected
5.0	Made in Germany! Excellent!
5.0	I love this pump sooo much! I pump on the highest speed setting and the lowest suction and get 4.5 oz out of each side in one sitting! I love the ability to choose my own suction/speed levels it makes getting the most milk a breeze. And the closed system makes cleaning easy and I love that milk doesnt get into the tubes.  Love that you can use it with batteries to walk about the house, I use a pumping bra to hold them on while I get stuff done. The noise it makes is minimal, but it kinda beeps a little which I dont mind. Dont forget to get your manufacturers rebate from (...) they have 50 dollars off through the end of summer 2011
5.0	The tub toys are fabulous. They are bright and cheerful and the perfect size.<br />Quality and price are both Fabulous.
5.0	Great choice and would recommend buying. My baby loves it and falls asleep in it
5.0	I have a 15 month old grandson who is very curious and always wants to open the oven to see what's cooking (or not).  I'm always right there, so it hasn't really been a problem, but I decided to do something about it before it became one.  This was easy to install and works great and keeps my grandson from getting hurt.  I would highly recommend this product.
5.0	Worked Perfectly! Apply with adhesive and finish joints with real mortar for the authentic look. Be sure to match your colors.
1.0	"I made a review of this tub back in August when my child was a month old, AND when we only used this tub a few times.  I felt compelled to come back here and edit my review to share the problems I have encountered with this tub and to urge you to buy a different brand.<br />When my daughter was small, comfort wise the tub was terrific.  Now that she is three months old she already seems cramped in there.  Her little toes get caught in the mesh and she can't stretch out her legs.<br />The other thing I keep running in to is that even though it is fabric, she is still sliding!  I have to constantly keep pulling her up to the top.  <br />The drain plug is nearly impossible to push in...I have to have my husband do it before he leaves for work because I can't push it in myself, it doesn't fit right.  And even for him it's a struggle.  <br />Speaking of the drain plug, in order to unplug it to drain the water you have to remove the mesh liner which is a hassle with a baby sitting on it...and add to that a baby the keeps sliding down and getting her toes caught in the mesh.  See my point?<br />The liner is wearing really thin and has shrunk to where it doesn't fit properly.  And I have never thrown it in the dryer.  AND, to add insult to injury it stinks!!!  I absolutely can't get rid if this really gross smell the fabric has no matter how often I wash it.  It's been that way since day-one but I chalked that up to it being \\""new\\"".  Well, it's almost 4 months old and it still smells gross.  <br />My advice, there is better out there.  I plan on \\""retiring\\"" this one and getting something else."
5.0	I've used the older design of the momma natural wave bottles, (round shape with green caps), and this bottle. My sister's breastfed baby went back and forth between breast and the round momma bottles with no problem.  So I did the same with my baby. I bought these purple bottles for daycare. These bottles come with #3 size nipple but I use my #2 nipples instead for a slower flow since she's still breastfeeding.  The purple bottles are much easier to clean and carry than the round version.  My LO is 7 months. We introduced the bottles at 4 wks so she would take a bottle when she started daycare at 12 wks.  Our pediatrician recommended this.  This is the only bottle we've used and have had no problems.  I did puncture a nipple while cleaning it too aggressively.  Just don't push your cleaning tool through the nipple hole.  My LO never had colic or reflux issues.
5.0	This is a perfect friend for a baby to hold onto while the pacifier is in use.  Good for tactile stimulation and for keeping track of pacifiers if baby should spit it out at any point.  Soft and cuddly... great idea!
5.0	Item continues to meet my expectations !! Two capsules every hour of intense bike riding !!
5.0	The pillow is a perfect size for my little guy and just the right fill...cushy enough to be comfortable and he already loves cuddling and squeezing it. Overall, a good value with fast shipping and excellent service.
1.0	What a waste of money.  No suction and it comes loose at the slightest touch.
5.0	Bought this for my 6month old daughter...she is now almost three and has never gone a night without it. We cut the pacifier off when she was about two but she still loves it! Quite durable too, I've put it in the washing machine many times and is still in good shape.
1.0	Not dried after bathing
1.0	I must admit that I was a bit disappointed when the mobile arrived at my house.  I thought that this was the mobile that I ordered, but when it arrived it was a totally different one.  Unfortunately I threw away all of the packaging so I was not able to return the mobile.
5.0	My 18 month old son loves this little monster! It's adorable and super kid friendly! The only complaint I have is that there weren't instructions on how to remove the lid. Once you get the hang of it, it's super easy to do, but the first time was a nightmare. I couldn't tell if the top didn't come off, or if I was going to die trying. Thank goodness for Google!
5.0	Long but sturdy and Baby loves as lying on it. Perfect. Make sure you check if it will fit your diaper chg table. I doubt it fits any.
1.0	I initially fell in love with this stroller with my first child. When I only had one infant in a carrier LOL On paper the B-Ready had everything I was looking for. Planning on having a second I also purchased the second seat and lower adapter. Along with an Uppa Baby snack tray for the child seat, purse hook and a parent organizer for the handle bar. All a must to make this stroller useful if your out for any amount of time. After using it almost daily for 4 years, I HATE IT. And here's why..<br />-FOLDING: 2 handed fold is a pain in the A as is, you have to remove the second seat or stroller board to fold it (they say you don't- you do), it is hard to fold even when it only has the main seat. Sometimes it doesn't fold right bc of the front wheels and you have to unfold, reposition and do again) It does not stand on its own when folded so you have to fold it and put in in your vehicle in one motion. But it is SO HEAVY its ridiculous, I weigh 106 lbs so I struggle with a 45 lb stroller (n that's with no kids in it). The frame is all marked up (and so is my bumper) from getting it into my QX56 SUV which is flat in the back (could not imagine this thing and all its pieces in a car trunk) BTW it takes up HALF the back of my gigantic SUV bc it is so wide. And forget putting it sideways or anything else, it will fall over the second you let it go and it is so heavy and awkward the fight is not worth it.<br />NAVIGATION: It is bulky and hard to navigate through stores because it snags on everything due to the back wheels being so much wider than the stroller. Imagine constantly being jerked to a stop because you get caught on everything you walk past. Not to mention I run over my older daughters and mom's feet (and everything else). They literally have to stand 8-12 inches away from the strollers inner frame to not be run over by it. The depth perception it gives off is very misleading and dangerous if you have smaller children who hold the frame or even walk close to you.<br />ACCESSORIES: The padded seat bar was destroyed within moments of the first use by my then 6 month old teething daughter. I quickly replaced that with the Uppa Baby Vista snack tray. The second seat is a waist of money. My daughter is 3, weighs 28 pounds and is to big for the second seat on the bottom. Her head sticks out over the top of the seat. I had to take the canopy off of it but it still isn't comfortable for her. Switch the kids? Yeah, the &#34;restraint&#34; buckle is no match for my 18 month old son who wants to explore EVERYTHING. And being the chair is 6 inches off the ground he is gone in 2 seconds. Oh and if he is sitting its because he is taking everything out of the basket and throwing it out of the stroller...<br />DESIGN FLAW 2: You can't wash it. Of course I have the Silver coloured one. It is so stained I put a blanket over it out of embarrassment. And we're not dirty people, its just basic kid wear and tear. Fruit snacks, leaky sippy cups, free cookie samples in the mall, etc. It doesn't come apart easily and the pieces you can get off will not go into the washing machine. (I have a Maytag Bravos 4.8 cu ft with no agitator- everything fits in it, expect this) And I refuse to buy a new $150 main seat because you can't clean it. WORST YET- The bottom buckle where you strap in the baby is sewn into a little pocket type thing that collects snacks, etc in it and again, you can't wash it, it is so gross digging stuff out of it. God forbid you have a baby/child that throws up on in this thing- or into that buckle pocket!! OMG you might as well just throw it away and buy a new one. Or have your husband pressure wash it LOL<br /><br />Sighs.. did I mention it squeaks? Oh yes. The frame squeaks so loudly when your turning or pushing it slowly its embarrassing. Kind of sounds like a squeaky door hinge but louder. It's actually woke up my son before..<br /><br />Anyway. In short. On paper it fits all criteria and sounds like amazingness. And it is great if you are super strong, have a huge vehicle and only one baby who sits still and doesn't eat in it. But in reality, its horrible to actually use for older children or multiple children OR for long term use (don't expect this to be a hand me down or resale item). I would suggest a stroller that has a stronger, lighter frame and an even wheel base. I'm replacing my B-Ready set up with a Mama's and Papa's Urbo2 with a stroller board. *FINGERS CROSSED*
5.0	My daughter and nephew love this toy! Best Buy yet!
5.0	Got this for my grandsons first birthday. His mother reports that it &#34;is the coolest thing&#34;.<br />She says loves it.
5.0	These bibs are great. They wash wonderfully by hand in the dish pan with the dishes and hung to air dry.
5.0	This purchase was a great buy. For only $100 we got a very reliable monitor that gives us clear picture, good battery life and excellent night vision. The power saving function is too complicated so we never use it. If you have it plugged into the charger you won't need to use this since it only saves your battery when not plugged in. Overall, this monitor is worth the money!
5.0	Very pleased with my purchased had this type of gate before. Lasted for many years expect this one to do the same.
5.0	"I LOVE THIS SWING.  MY MOTHER GOT IT FOR ME AT A GARAGE SALE ALMOST COMPLETELY NEW.  MY DAUGHTER LOVES BEING IN IT.  THERE IS ONLY ONE \\""CON\\"" IN MY OPINION.  IT GOES THROUGH BATTERIES WAY TOO QUICK.  THE SWING TAKES 4 D BATTERIES AND I HAVE TO REPLACE THEM EVERY MONTH.  OTHER THAN THAT, IT IS A GREAT SWING."
1.0	The sateen sheets are thicker, but do not have the silk like texture or sheen. I purchased these sheets as an alternative to silk sheets for my 10 mth old baby girl. She has super curly springy hair that looses moisture and gets matted with regular cotton sheets. Baby is too young for silk bonnets and satin pillow cases. These sateen sheets did not help at all and are no different from regular crib sheets. I will bite the bullet and purchase silk crib sheets.
5.0	Recaro car seats are the bomb.  I only wish that this one had tensioners on both ends of the latch belt.  Then again, the model that costs more (which I bought for my other car) has that feature.
1.0	I really love the tranquil turtle and use it with my son every night! I was excited about this one but it's not as good. I don't like that fact that I have to stream with an electric device to it.. Already kids are exposed to so much electronic transmission.. This is just unnecessarily exposure.
5.0	Relatively easy to install. Guys at local fire/rescue station praised this brand and model--that's more than good enough for me.
5.0	I love love love this stroller. We have a baby jogger x3 summit that we used before this one and have no complaints. I bought this one to travel on a plane/ through an airport with and it was easy to lift and carry one handed. It also has all the features you really need - 5 positions, beverage holder, the wheels are pretty versatile, has a carry strap. It is a little tricky to fold it and unfold it one handed and carrying a baby but not impossible and worth practicing. Biggest point for me was that as soon as my son (6 months at the time) sat in it, he loved it!  It sits up more Han the baby jogger we have so he can see and swing his legs. He seems much more comfortable in this one than the jogger as well. He actually enjoys riding in this stroller. I've made this one my primary stroller and only use the jogger and the car seat adaptor now for when he's asleep in the car seat. Worth every penny!!!
5.0	These were a winner with my 17-month old who has only recently been obsessed with pouched food (&#34;Pow! Mama, Pow!&#34;).  It's gotten harder to get her to sit down to eat a meal or snack, but if you toss some ingredients in a blender and dump into a pouch, it's like magic!  I read many reviews and settled on this set, which was the perfect starter kit to test the waters to see if I felt the pouches handled and cleaned well, and if she liked the sip'n caps.  The soft caps were a win with her, she easily learned how to use them and it slowed down her consumption to make the pouches last longer.  They were great for us too, because they act as a valve to prevent the over squeezing that used to leave puree all over her, the floor, the stroller, etc.  The pouches themselves clean well with a bottle brush, the design allows you to flush it with water easily, and the cap cleans well with a smaller nipple brush I already have.  Some commenters noted that there is a ridge along one side of the zipper seal that can trap food, but I've found that if I insert a bottle brush and pull it back out against that ridge and go side to side a bit I've been able to clean out anything that gets trapped there.  I like the size terms of portability and storage, but I think my daughter's ideal serving size would be about 50% bigger, especially as she grows.  But at least it's super easy to open up the pouch and refill it when she asks for more.
5.0	This has been a great item we purchased when our baby was 5 months old. She still will sit in it today and now while she is gaining control of standing and will be walking shortly this has helped her we noticed in her balance and control of. <br />She loves all the toys especially the spinning wheels and lighted noise/sound makers. I like that you can take off some of the toys and she can even play with them seperately. This looked like the best Saucer out there and from the way our baby still bounces in it (10 months old) and the ease of transporting it to Grandma and Grandpas houses it is a 5 Star in our book.<br />UPDATE: (...) Our little girl turned One and she still has this in her nursery set up. This still continues to be useful to her in her beginning to walk. It is so wonderful with the stablizers it comes with to stop the rocking motion. It has continued to entertain our child from a standing viewpoint and I think we will leave it in her room for just a little while longer. Great Product as I said! A MUST HAVE!
5.0	I love our Joovy Kooper.  I am the type of person that obsessively researches before I purchase something.  I needed a stroller that was not such a pain to keep in my car and use for every day stuff.  My giant Graco and jogging stroller are too much of a pain to haul around for everyday use.  I finally narrowed it down to the Kooper and the Baby Jogger City Mini.  After testing both in a store, and reading tons and tons of reviews, I decided on the Kooper and couldn't be happier.  It folds compact, but does not at all give that flimsy umbrella stroller feeling when in use. It is really sturdy and seems very well made.  Also, the storage bin on the bottom is much larger and more accessible the bin on either of our Gracos, the jogging stroller, or even our double jogger.  I can fit my purse and diaper bag in it with no problem.  My husband was not too happy to see another stroller come into the house, but now will only use the Kooper and loves it.
1.0	Similar to AmyW's experience, I also received this product damaged, twice.  Each time, it was the same middle wooden panel that was completely cracked and splintered-- no hope in salvaging this with wood glue and nails.  The actual shipping box the parts came in looked in great shape, so I guess I'd have to blame Davinci for it's poor packaging.  Amazon was great with the return/replacement and even had UPS come to the door to pick it up (the box is about 80lbs, so it would have been a huge hassle to drop it off).  Huge disappointment, as we waited a while for this product since it was back-ordered in January.
5.0	My daughter likes it a lot.
5.0	We bought this seat for our granddaughter when she was an infant.  Worked great when she was an infant and she still uses it to date (she's 18 months old).  Awesome purchase and I would recommend it!!
5.0	Works great and saves us the space that our high chair used to take up.  Much easier to clean than a high chair as well.
1.0	I tried this product based on the convincing positive reviews.  I am very disappointed.  This thing is so hard to operate one-handed.  I don't like to leave the baby on the changing table for even a second, and with this device you have to have both hands to push diaper in, and then twist.  I just set the diaper half way in now &amp; hope that I remember to push it through, and twist it when I have a spare minute, but it's a pain.  I know a bunch of other mothers who also have used the genie, and were not impressed.  I wish I would have taken their advice in the first place.
5.0	Beautiful colors, no smell upon opening.. Have had it for six months now and they still look new
5.0	Smells delicious! Haven't used a lot but girls seem to like already!
5.0	It's amazing, the color is very nice and it looks like it's the perfect length. I owe another brand's necklace but it's ridiculously long. It also came in a little pretty bag, so if you want to gift it you don't have to worry about wrapping.  I definitely recommend these pretty necklace and bracelet   I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest review.
5.0	these are the greatest toddler spoons ever! Their little  hands can work this kind of spoon so much better than regular spoons!
5.0	Great High chair my 3 kids have them at their houses we bought one for the grandchildren when they are over
5.0	used this for office for computer that sits on a reception desk, to block computer air vent on top from getting any spills, we give cup of water to clients at check out (health and wellness center) and feared water would accidently spill so this is a nice guard between counter and top of computer.
5.0	Hood. A bit expensive.
5.0	Gives you the perfect support when breastfeeding. I am even taking it with me when I visit friends and family so that we are most comfortable when breastfeeding. I also slept on it a couple of times when the little one was in the crib for his nap. So versatile as well, I love it!
5.0	Perfect!  Exactly what I wanted, excellent quality and lots of pockets to keep everything organised.  I use this for my dogs grooming tools, brushes etc. and it works perfectly.
5.0	my wife absolutely loves it
5.0	Swaddle blankets come in handy for so many different situations! I love these Lambie & Me swaddle blankets because they are made of organic cotton muslin, perfect for any season. I had an August baby in the Texas heat so it was nice to use these blankets to cover my newborn's carseat since they are soft and breathable.  We continue to use them to lay down on the grass to play outside or use as a nursing cover. Unlike other cotton blankets that tend to pill and disintegrate over time, the more you wash these Lambie & Me blankets, the softer they get!
5.0	my children are safe again. The sun was attacking them and this stopped it.
1.0	It took me over 3 hours to try to get one screw in and still couldn't get it.  Besides that, it had a snack tray attached that couldn't come off.  I HATE those things.  What purpose do they serve.  I just went to the church and got back the one I had put there for my special needs girl to use for feeding and brought it home instead--why have two high chairs you hate, when you already own one.
1.0	"After drilling all the way through my cabinet, I realized that the plastic drill bit stop had slipped up on the drill bit.  Throw that POS away and just wrap duct tape where you would have put it.  News flash Safety 1st.....save a penny and don't include the POS plastic drill \\""stop\\"".  Then, rewrite the directions suggesting that the consumer measure the depth of the door, subtract 1/8 of an inch and place a piece of duct tape at that measurement from the tip of the 9/32 (which is a pain in the a$$ to locate) drill bit.  How about modifying to a nice common size like, say....1/4 inch?  Time to wipe out the Research and Development Department and start over.  I'll expect my compensation in the mail for this little tidbit.  This isn't an inexpensive option for child safety, so put a little thought into it.  Morons!  That being said, after finally installing it correctly, it actually works pretty well.  Oh yeah, drop down the side of the door about 4 inches.  My cabinet had a metal plate near the seam that interfered with the magnet, so I had to move it lower."
5.0	I received the bumpers very fast and put them up! I love them. In fact I'm going to order some more. Baby proofing is never done when you have a rambunctious little toddler. I thought they were a great size and not too obvious looking on my furniture. Thank you!
5.0	The buttons and fabric are very firm, good quality I know these will last a long time!!
5.0	We bought this gate to block our 10 months old son.  It's very lightweight and easy to essemble.  It only took us not even a minute to figured it.  For the price, this is a really sturdy gate, my wife wasn't convinced at first (because it is soooo light), so, we highly recommend this gate for parents who's looking to buy one.  You can buy few gates for this price compared to the expensive ones.
1.0	"I am giving it one star because I was not able to use it. It may still be a decent product.<br /><br />I purchased two bassinets to go with my twin ion. One from amazon and one direct from valco. I received two bassinets that looked great but did not fit the twin ion. The paperwork said \\""twin ion bassinet\\"" but the bag with the bassinet in it said \\""tri mode bassinet\\"" These strollers have different parts but the bassinet looks the same. When I called to get a return number from amazons seller, the man on the phone said that they do not sell twin ion bassinets. He refused to give me a return number and I had to call back and get another person on the phone several times. The reason they refused to give a return number is because it had been over 30 days. I ordered the ion and bassinets at the same time. The bassinets arrived but the ion took over a month and I did not know they did not fit until it was too late to return.<br />By the time I straightened this all out the baby was too old for a bassinet. lol It was a bummer!<br /><br />I decided to do a review to let you know you should call and speak to someone directly before making this purchase. You might not get what you are ordering. Have your twin ion product number ready when you call. It will make it easier to match The bassinet to the stroller."
5.0	Makes a great travel pillow!
1.0	This product was recalled in 2009 and does not seem safe for children.<br /><br />Google &#34;Babybjorn Babysitter Recall&#34;<br /><br />Review the CPSC site and the information, images, and product model numbers there.  They match the specifics of this item.
5.0	It fit perfect on my 2015 Rouge!
5.0	Perfect for a small baby...the stuffed animal lays on the baby and the pacifier is just the right size for his little mouth! We had a monkey and had to get a second in case it was lost b/c our baby loves it so much!
5.0	I never thought I would see the day that I would be reviewing bibs. I had no idea how important bibs would be in my life before my son was born! He started solid foods a couple months ago, and anyone knows what a mess that is! I bought some other bibs for feeding time, but they were sort of like a vinyl tablecloth material with fabric around the neck, and very hard to clean. I am a bit of a germophobe, and I never felt they got clean.  I was on the lookout for something waterproof and easy to clean. These are exactly what I was looking for!   I got them about a week ago, and I LOVE them. I bought the boy assortment, and though not exactly as pictured, they are very cute. One has blue with circles, one is green with airplanes and trains, etc., and the other has brightly colored cats and dogs. I love all the designs. I can't say enough about the quality of these bibs. Nothing so far has stained them, and they are super easy to clean. You can throw them in the washer, but I just use a little dish soap and hand wash them and hang them to dry.  They dry REALLY fast. Since I have 3, I can use a different one at each feeding, but even if I only had one it would be dry by the next feeding. I like that the velcro strip is long, so they will grow with my son. I can adjust these to be small enough so the food doesn't get under his chin and through the neck opening and onto his clothing, which happens with a lot of bibs because of the neck hole being large.   I also looked at the Baby Bjorn soft bib. I couldn't decide which, so I asked my husband's opinion and he thought the Baby Bjorn looked weird, so I decided on these.   I am SO glad I bought these.  They are definitely worth the price. I would recommend these to anyone! I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE them.
5.0	My little one loved these more than any other pacifier.  They are very lightweight and the orthodontic advantages they advertise are great.
5.0	Nice to having to store a full size high chair, but you get all the same benefits from.  Very easy to clean up.
5.0	Exelente producto muy funcional
1.0	We have had problems with the stroller and the car seat.  The stroller is extremely hard for me to open, it never seems to click.  Also, while taking a walk in my neighborhood the other day, one of the wheels just fell off.  We were on a flat sidewalk and it just fell off.  I was a half a mile from my house and not happy.  (We have only used it for 3 and 1/2 months.)  We also had installed the car seat and it seemed to be in correctly.  The level indicator indicated that the infant car seat was level in my Explorer but when I took it to my local police station to have it safety checked they found it was not level at all and that the indicator was not accurate.  I would not buy this again if I could do it over.
1.0	These are cute, but that is the only good thing I can say.  I read the mixed reviews, thought I'd try the product anyway, especially liked the idea of stainless steel.  Don't.  Those who say the cups leak are correct.  Those who say they are really hard to drink from are correct.  Those who say this is a great product, I believe are planted by the Thermos company.  They have some great products, I don't understand why they can't make a proper sippy cup when plenty of other brands can!!!  These are expensive. I wasted my money, don't waste yours.
5.0	Love this stroller best I have ever bought
5.0	Work well, and get the job done.  Enough said about that. Good nipple for parents trying to breast feed and bottle feed.
1.0	Dear Parents, DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!<br /><br />Waste if money, waste of time! I would give it zero star. Temperature is never the same, reading is always low (35.5C)  while  my son is burning with fever (39.5C) . Spend the money buy a Braun one.
1.0	When we received this item..,quality so disappointed,doesn't look new at all and on the top of that,this item it doesn't come in a seal package,it smell,and a lot of fingerprint look on the surface of the item.Please don't purchase this disqusting item.The only reason I purchased it because not made in china...
5.0	A must for your Boon Grass drying rack. Nipples fit on this accessory very well. I love how it looks also.
5.0	Wow! This works amazing!  Well worth the cost!
5.0	I bought these for my 2 month old because he has such busy hands and is always rubbing his eyes and ends up with scratches all over his face. These are the only mittens that actually stayed on him, even with such busy hands.  All other mittens we have come off right away. The designs are super cute too! The fabric is nice and soft.  We love these and would purchase again!
5.0	our daughter loves her lamby. This is her third. She keeps losing them! I always have to have a back up one just in case. Cant sleep without it!
5.0	My older kiddos are 18 months apart and always want what the other has. So I was thrilled to see this car in pink since my son has the red one. It works great. My kids are happy.
5.0	Such a great item to held prevent flat heads!  Our 4 month old twins lay on these when I put them on the floor under their activity gyms.
5.0	I'm shocked at all the bad reviews on here, so I wanted to throw my two cents in.  We have three of these cups and I was very skeptical at first.  My kids are 4 and 2 1/2.  It took them a couple tries at first to figure out how to drink out of them......but they both figured it out on their own without any help from me.<br /><br />These are their favorite cups and they both ask for them daily.  The cup itself was much thicker/stronger than I expected from a &#34;as seen on tv&#34; product.  The seals are solid and they turn the upside down all the time without any spills.  I let them use them while sitting on the couch without any worries.<br /><br />Now, realistically, if they turn it upside down and bang as hard as they can on the table (which they have done), it will have a few drops escape.  However, my kids try this with every cup we have mad this is the first one where they had trouble getting it to spill out.  The cup can lay on its side for hours and nothing will come out.<br /><br />The biggest thing for me is that it won't actually spill out completely or dump out......but the no leaks when it is on its side is a huge plus for me.
5.0	Works great for my 21 month old toddler. A little short for her but she does not seem to mind. She has plenty of room to grow into it. Stays put well on upholstered dining room chairs. Easy to clean. Would recommend this product.
5.0	Awesome product, adorable!! My daughter loves it and it looks just like my adult ErGo. Highly recommended for kids that love carrying babies.
5.0	We had our Mimi the Sardine lunch bag for almost two years.  So far we love this one, and I'm just hoping that it holds up equally well.  There is more than enough room for my preschoolers lunches, and we also use it to pack snack and water bottles for park trips.
5.0	Very light and easy to pick up. I have this mattress for two babies and really like it.
5.0	My baby is not born yet but so far I love it. It's portable, the cherry color looks great, to build it you will most likely need two people but it's not rocket science. If you want something small and cute go for it, it's worth the money and saves lot of space.
5.0	Back seat passengers need a good reliable beverage holder and this is it. Thank so much for this product. I get lots of compliments.
5.0	Works great, very soft.  Love it!
5.0	was a bit hesitant to buy this for my 3 month old son, because of the price. It was the best purchase decision! He loves it! best part it doesnt have any lights or sounds and he is still amazed by it! It is he favorite. and two months later he is still enthralled by it!
5.0	Bought this for my son when he starts potty training, he's not there yet but has aleady started using this stool when brushing his teeth.  Its very light so he will carry it around the house and sit on it too.
5.0	Great product! We have a few of them in the apt. It keeps our kids safe and our minds sane.
5.0	I ordered the Babyprints frame and assembled everything according to the directions.  They were easy to follow and the print of the hand and foot (I was able to squeeze in both) came out really well.  When I went to put the frame together, it was not working.  I contacted customer service at Pearhead and they sent me another one and it arrived the next day.  The customer service representative was extremely helpful and it was by far the best customer service I have experienced!
5.0	We used to have a sun shade before, a branded one with the suction and can roll up, which didn't last long. Ever since, I haven't bought another one. The weather here in SoCal has been in the 100's in the past week, even went to 107 Degrees Farenheit last Tuseday!, and, since my daughter goes to school and we can't stay at home and wait for the sun to set, we have no choice but to endure the super hot weather. Thankfully, the Shady Baby came in the mail in the middle of the heat wave so I had the chance to take advantage of trying it out.<br /><br />First of all, I love that a pack comes with 2 sun shades. It was very easy to install and took me only about 5 seconds to put it on our window with just 1 hand! I love that it has no other parts which can break and, we have a Dodge Avenger and the Shady Baby fits perfectly on our rear window but no room to open the window anymore. It's fine with me since my daughters doesn't like their windows open anyway. It's also very easy to put away and folds into a little nice circle. The pouch, which is included, fits on our side door. The Shady Baby reduced the sun's glare but didn't interfere with my driving. I can still see outside my rear window clearly without compromising our safety when I glance at my blind spots.<br /><br />I love the Shady Baby and I love how it kept our car cooler. :)<br /><br />*I received a free sample to inspect, try and review however, all opinions are unbiased, honest and my own. No other form of compensation was received.
5.0	My daughter is 9 weeks old and I bought this sheep for her to put on her car seat. She LOVES this sheep, and loves her car rides while she listens to it. I even purchased a nature sound machine for her to listen to while she sleeps at night. She is sleeping 7-8 hours already!  Thank you cloud b
5.0	Worked very well for my granddaughter
1.0	When I bought this there werent any online reviews but I was really excited to hear my baby. Im two weeks into the third trimester and I still can't pick up anything. Yes you hear some little things, but even in a quiet room your breathing messes up anything you could hear. You basically have to hold your breath and be satisfied with a few wooshing noises.  For the price I wouldnt bother buying it again if I was given the chance.
5.0	Got these for my son's first easter, he's almost 9 months. Wowza, they are so cute!! Much cuter on than in the picture. He wore them today with a white onesie and all I thought about all day was how cute he looked. I told my husband I want to buy a ton more and just have him wear them with white onesies every day.<br /><br />I'm really happy with this brand. They stayed up on his chubby little thighs all day. And they didn't cut off his circulation, there were no rings around his thighs or ankles, and he wore them for about 12 hours. I had a pair of BabyLegs for my first son and I remember that they did leave a ring, and fell down!<br /><br />I'll definitely be buying more My Little Legs!
5.0	Just finished taking care of a little girl 3months to 3 yrs she love all the baby einstein toy that I got her.
5.0	My daughter loves this! It fits perfectly over our tub spout which is a pull down converter. This cover can stay on the faucet at all times. Does not have to be removed to pull down the piece that turns on the shower.
5.0	I had this brush for cleaning bottles, and it worked great.  But, I'm all done having babies and happened to use this one day to clean my muffin pan - and since then, use it solely for this purpose.  The brush works perfectly to get right into the bottom edges where I had a hard time reaching with my regular kitchen sponge.  So now, I just let the pan soak in water for a bit to soften the muffin bits, and then use this brush with a little soap to scrub everything out without any hassle!
5.0	Quick delivery, product as described.
5.0	My friend is a Snoopy fan and he just got a car, so It was the perfect gift.. His face lit up when he saw it !!!!
5.0	i like this brand ，it's very good and beautyful，so i choose this brand 。but i wish this can more discount and cheap。
5.0	"I received this item as a gift when my daughter was born and she loved it so much that I had to buy another one just to have a spare on hand. It's high quality, very soft, a great size and she sleeps with it every night.  It's so much nicer that many of the cheaper ones sold at Babies \\""R\\"" Us.  I highly recommend Angel Dear blankies!"
1.0	To many parts. Was not very easy to use at all.
5.0	My daughter received the smaller infant version Leachco pillow as a gift.  She has used it everyday, takes it with her wherever she goes.  My grandaughter is growing out of that so I searched for one larger and decided on this one.  She LOVES it!  It is still a bit large for her to lay in but I tuck a large blanket around the inside and she fits perfectly.  She has more room and is very happy and content.  We have her favorite toys attached to the side velcro tabs that she can easily reach, it's very comfortable and she loves it.  If you love the infant version, you will love this as well!
5.0	Working out very well, and the baby enjoys sitting in it so it must be comfy for her.
5.0	Great chair for the price.    The wood is nice to look at and feel.  My six month old fits great in it (on the third rung down) and appears very secure.    Considering I bought this (including shipping!) for under half what a Stokke Tripp Trapp plus accessories would have run us, it is an excellent deal.  The quality may be a bit lacking, but I can turn my head to the fact that I needed to wedge a few pieces of paper into the slot to secure the upper seat (was very secure until we switched foot platform locations, to be close to the black bar).      I would buy it again!
5.0	This is soooooo soft that I when I am cold both of us cuddle with it in bed.
5.0	This ring sling is wonderful, the fabric is soft and moves easily through the rings. The fabric feels very supportive from newborns through toddlers.<br />I borrowed this chimparoo ring sling from BWI RockWest's lending library and was very pleased with the quality and ease of use
5.0	I got this for a friend's daughter as a shower gift.  She love's it.  It was easy to put together and she says it's so sweet.  The perfect baby shower gift.
5.0	Love that these are 100% cotton. They are durable and well-made. I highly recommend these for new babies too young for real blankets.
5.0	Philips Avent Manual Comfort Breast Pump is a good stuff  I think I will buy again or let my friend to buy it
5.0	These are my favorite inserts of all time!  I don't need to use 2 different kinds of inserts with these guys, and I haven't had any leaks yet
5.0	These tub toys are simply adorable. My granddaughter is getting lots of enjoyment out of having them float around in her bath water.
5.0	"Just got this gate and it has made me soo happy.  I got it as a detourant for our dog from having access to the whole backyard; since we rent and need something mobile. I didn't like him \\""going\\"" all over the lawn or bringing mud into the house after a rain, so figured this would work to keep him isolated to an area I want him in.  I placed it open from one area of the house to another, so I don't expect it to hold him if left unattended but he sees it as a barrier and hasn't tried to push through yet. He's use to gates in the house. It's a thick plastic (won't rust in the winter months)and perfect for what I wanted it for! . . just might need a couple extensions."
5.0	Don't even use the all plastic sippy cups!! Go straight to these....Helps when you are out at resturants too. Just order them a water with a straw and lid while you are out and they will drink from it no problem!! Total life saver for the family on the go and easy to clean !
1.0	These are not the same as the blue aspirators they give you at the hospital.  They are made of a harder, less flexible plastic.  I soaked it in hot water and then filled it with hot water to see if that helped and all it did was make the bulb stay compressed afterwards.  This did not suck ANY mucus out AT ALL.  These Safety 1st nasal aspirators are the only option available at WalMart and Shopko and they are a complete waste of money.  It's about as effective as sticking a q-tip up your baby's nose and hoping it will suck out the mucus.
5.0	I'm glad that I bought this. It's worth the price. You can mash almost everything to make fresh baby food!<br />I used it everyday with fruits and vegies and feed my baby straight from te bowl.
5.0	dora big birthday adventure
5.0	Great chair. Serves its purpose.
1.0	This sticker for your wall is not one big sticker, all the pieces come separately. It comes with a big sticker sheet you put over the heart and tape into your wall. After that you have to peal the tap off of the wall so the sticker will stick. However, the problem is- the sticky tape you are taking off is stickier than the print its self therefore you end up having to peal the print off one by one and sticking it in your wall. I have a clean wall and fr rashly painted wall- my print fell off right away, wouldn't stick. I have target wall stickers all over the rest of my house that have never came off, before you buy, make sure you're aware of other places you can buy the same print for better.
5.0	That's really all I can say! It's bigger than most mats and you can adjust it many ways. I love it and so does my munchkin!
5.0	I have a 4.5 month old that at 3 weeks was diagnosed with severe reflux and colic.  After battling meds, breastfeeding, hypoallergenic formulas and hours of crying these past months, the GI doctor and I really felt like the reflux wasn't the problem- it was all GAS due to a problem with his sucking-swallowing reflex.  So today I ran to the store to get this to give it a try after reading the reviews.  I did it just like I was suppose to and nothing the first couple of tries.  I was so upset and so was he.  I knew he needed relief... so after ten minutes I decided I would give it another go.  Did all the massaging (we already do that) and tried again... whistle, whistle, toot, toot and a little poop!  He laughed!  He was so happy!  I tried a couple more times and definitely was able to release some gas! I did have to move it around a tiny bit.  I didn't want to irritate anything so I was really careful, but that's when the gas came out.  I proceeded to put him down to bed right after since it was bed time and no intense screaming and he went right down!!  Normally I have to bounce him for at least an hour- two minutes of bouncing!  I can already tell this may not work every time, but I bet it works more times than none if you keep trying.  I would be careful if your baby has any kind of full tummy though as I can see how this could get very, very messy!!<br /><br />I bought this at buy buy baby so I could get it faster and used a 20% off coupon... well worth the money.  I plan on sterilizing them as others have done.
5.0	I bought these covers for my changing pad in green and I plan to buy them in lavender. They fit very well and I plan to buy more in the future. I wish they came in packs with mixed colors because there are two of the same color in one pack.
5.0	Wanted something for travelling that would not take up too much room in my suitcase, and it works. Will definitely buy again
5.0	My son loves this set. He really enjoys learning to feed himself
5.0	Great product, easy installation. You can optionally turn the lock off for times where you need to be in and out of the cabinets a lot.
5.0	Im a first time mom , i was planing on breastfeeding , so i did tons  of research on what i would really need , and i came across Bamboobies , the reviews were outstanding so i decided to take a risk and try them... they are the best purchase , money well spent . Im deff .going to keep coming back c: thank you Bamboobies for saving the day :D
5.0	My wife and I bought a new car not too long ago and, with leather seats, we definitely wanted to make sure that the seat was protected from our crazy children. They destroy everything. Kids are mini tornadoes that do not care about anything nice. Thankfully, these car seat protectors have saved my precious car from food, drinks, blood, snot, tears, and any other mess that you can possibly imagine.<br /><br />These seat protectors are literally magic. I feel bad for anyone who had issues with glue sticking or the item not working properly. My advice to anyone who has issues with them is to replace them with the exact same product and try again. They are amazing and I would not recommend any other product.<br /><br />I feel bad that some people are saying not to buy this product, because I can't tell you how many times it has prevented some serious internal frustration of having children. Now I can just let them throw food all around the back seat and not worry about my leather getting messed up!
5.0	"This portable crib mattress was a great fit for the Arm's Reach Co-Sleeper I purchased it for.  I was given a hand-me-down co-sleeper that had been gently used, but I thought the sleeping surface was too hard. This mattress is very affordable and gave enough extra padding without being dangerously \\""too soft\\"" for a newborn.  There was a small gap along the length of the co-sleeper where the matress was a bit smaller, but I bought a draft stopper that you would use on a window/door that fit perfectly and eliminated any chance there could be a gap to get stuck in.  As for the vinyl cover - I am glad it is so easy to clean up and I just use a waterproof lap pad between the mattress and sheet to cut down on noise and mess!"
5.0	My daughter uses this for nap time at daycare.  She loves it.  We wash it once a week and has held up great.  The blanket is very soft and cozy.
5.0	I bought this car seat for our 8 month old son and we love it! He is so comfortable and for the first time does not cry in the car. If you have a car this chair is a bit bulky and you might find it a bit hard to put the baby in it. I make it work but having an suv would be preferable. Love the material, the added side impact feature, and the comfort. Think lazy boy for babies.
5.0	I have been using an Avent breast pump for almost 5 years on and off with the birth of my three sons.  I purchased these as extra since I work 2-3 days in a row and don't always get a chance to wash everything.  Starting in 2011 breast pumps and parts qualify as medical devices and the cost can be submitted for reimbursement with your flexible spending accounts/health care spending accounts (pre-tax funds), so don't forget to keep your receipts! I already submitted mine and have been reimbursed!
1.0	these are cute. fit nicely. but are not waterproof and don't even think for a second they will work as overnight diapers!!!
5.0	These pacifiers are adorable and I was relieved to see that the packaging does specify that they are BPA free.
5.0	I got this to have a handy way of keeping the bottles out of the way while they dried.  It turned out to be a perfect storage place as well.  Such a simple item has helped me tremendously.  (It travels well too.)
5.0	The product I received was very good quality. I have purchased 3 because I lost one and I always need a spare. Sleeping at night would be torture for my daughter without this little guy.  I have washed and dried it many times. The back part is &#34;satin like&#34; so it will snag but that is to be expected when it is taken everywhere (as in our case.)
5.0	I'm very happy with my purchase the gate works exceptionally. I would recommend this gate to a friend if needed.
5.0	Looks flimsy but it did the job.  I have a toy rack (light shelf with lots of plastic bins) that I needed to secure, so I was able to loop the strap to one of the bars that hold the bins).  It's a good product to tie things that you can't screw into.  I wouldn't attach anything heavy or anything that would be deadly if it fell on your child.  But for a little plastic bin shelf that you want to keep from plopping on your kids head?  These brackets work fine.
5.0	AWESOME Everyone with a child needs one. My 2 year old has no problem with it and my 5 year old loves it. I love not having to put a stool by the lightswitch
5.0	Perfect size for my 2.5 daughters first pillow!  I would definitely recommend!
5.0	Perfect mirror to see baby in backseat. Large size, easy to install and adjustable! Would recommend to others.
5.0	My baby had cradle cap for months and this was the only thing that got rid of it! Definitely worth it.
5.0	This serves its purpose. I like that it's reversible
5.0	This bag is a great carefree way to tote just about anything from a quick stop at the grocery store to flea market finds. The outside pockets work to hold cell phone, ID, wallet, keys, bottles of water, etc. while the roomy inside will hold books, bags, blankets, etc. and it's machine washable and you can easily have it monogrammed. The straps are long enough to comfortably stay on your shoulder too. You are effortlessly organized.  I now take this bag w/ me on all of my weekend errands.
5.0	These bibs were for a cowboy themed shower and were perfect in the matching Trend Lab tote...very pleased with them.
5.0	Grandson loves these.  Got for Christmas.
5.0	If you're going to buy a Serta mattress for yourself then why not for your incoming little one. Not sure if everyone uses the safety strap but its there.  Other than that this is super comfy for your munchkin and guaranteed to last for more than one child.  There are generic covers you can get for those accidents.
1.0	The adhesive fell off, and lock with it p, on 2nd use.<br />I realize the ratings say not to use over a certain temp., but it is for an OVEN.<br />They need to upgrade adhesive that can handle standard cooking temps.
5.0	This nursing necklace was very beautiful and soft! Made very well and has been a nice addition to mine and my daughter's nursing experience!
5.0	Our neonatologist recommended these preemie nipple for our breastfed baby due to the slow flow nature of them. Makes it less likely that baby will begin to prefer bottle over breast.  We haven't had any trouble with our son going from breast to breast milk in a bottle.
5.0	I made my son pasta and he took it to preschool and although I ended up eating it because he was too busy playing,  it was still warm 3 hours later when I picked him up.
5.0	I have been using the duz-it-alls for 2 months now and they are my favorite burp cloth! I love that they have the soft fleece on top so when I wipe my baby's face it isn't rough against his skin. And they hold so much more than my flannel burp cloths and receiving blankets. I also use a couple regularly as diapers on my newborn, well he's two months now, but I've been using them since he was born. They work well, no leaks and they will fit longer than small prefolds so its a bonus for me. Definitely recommend this product!
5.0	Great bag for traveling.  Cheap and easy to use.  I'd recommend to keep your stroller from getting damaged or dirty while traveling onto a plane.
5.0	Purchased it as a Christmas gift. Came in a timely manner in good condition and as advertised.<br />It was exactly what the person I got it for wanted and they were thrilled.<br />Thank you
5.0	She says it is perfect for the price.  I am not sure why a 1-year old needs a backpack, but wife says she can put his toys in it.  Have yet to see this happen, but he looks super cute with it on.
5.0	My 4 year old daughter can't where this enough, one of her dolls is always along for the ride.  The quality is the same as something an adult would be using.  Very happy.
5.0	These are fantastic bibs for use while your child is eating or snacking. They are particularly valuable when you're not using a high chair or booster seat.<br /><br />One of the nicest features is the ability to adjust the neckband. Since babies and children grow so quickly, it's nice to see a manufacturer design something that will be of use for just a short period of time.<br /><br />I've found that the spill pocket works exactly as designed, which means that all of the food that your child spills, ends up in the tray, not the floor. This is great, since even when using a high chair, I've found that a lot of food particles miss the tray. The fact that this bib remains so close to your child's chest, virtually eliminates any possibility that food particles will miss the bibs receptacle. It works perfectly, even when your child is moving all over the place.<br /><br />The bib is constructed of food grade silicon, thus there's nothing toxic that could harm your child. It's very well designed, rugged and easy to clean under warm or hot running water.<br /><br />The bottom line is that this is the perfect solution to everyday spills. You can easily bring these into a restaurant or use anywhere you desire to keep an area free from spills.<br /><br />Sample provided for review.
5.0	Starting using this kind of pacifier with my son 4 years ago and we decided to use them for our second since we never had complaints. Designs on them are wonderful and very durable. My kids teeth are perfect
5.0	Loved it super funny hat
1.0	I wish I could write a review. Simply put I can't because the company terminated my order after accepting it.  They state the gate as titled is no longer available through them or any other vendor. They did not go ahead and suggest a replacement gate to suite my needs.  I was simply left with an extension I hand received from a separate vendor, with all the hassle of returning the extension, shipping and refunds.  What confuses me is why was my order accepted in the first place and my C/C charged if they knew they had no way of filling the order?  I was given no clear explanation or apology for taking the order in the first place.  When I appealed to Tomy directly to pointed me towards a alternate gate they declined.  I find this odd to say the least.<br />So in a way I have had no experience with this product , but it was not for lack of trying on my part to purchase a working gate designed to fit my needs.  There is a similar gate provided by a different vendor the R2C - this gate seems very similar to the Tomy - hands free gate. The above mentioned R2C is marketed for animals not babies.  The target demographic is a dog owner not a new mother.  I am a pet owner and only went into the area of Baby gates because honestly there is far more to chose from and many different price points.  I sadly have been disappointing,  both a Carlson Extra wide Gate I did buy, it broke only 2 months after purchase.  So, then I tried again to purchase what seemed to be a solid product, but was denied the chance.  And yes I ended up with an extension for the Tomy Hands free gate, that the vendor did not want mailed back- even at my cost, in fact the vendor refused to receive it or credit me a refund. So bottom line I have purchased one gate that did not last 2 months of use, combined with two separate types of extension pieces that each vendor wanted nothing to do with once it had been mailed to me.<br /><br /> I have spent a fair amount of money at this point and have a broken gate,and 2 unusable extensions to show for my effort.  Some of this could have been avoided completely if only Tomy had never taken my order- for a product they no longer support. I would not be in possession of two separate useless extensions for one thing.  Had I been given correct information about the gate they never planed to send,  I could have made a different choice.  Tomy company allowed me to think - through the status of my order on Amazon - that it was simply a matter of a back order, not an order that was never going to come through.  I sat waiting patiently for my order to arrive, it was only through calling Tomy directly to ask why was the shipping taking so long that I was told that my order had in fact been canceled .
1.0	Terrible for 2 year olds. The bar is right in my child's face
5.0	Absolute the best  washcloth I have ever seen.thinking that I may by more
5.0	Got two of these so soft on mattress and definitely absorbs all vomit, pee and poo. Easy to wash and put it back on.
5.0	My son is 2.5 years old and after experimenting with countless sippy cup designs, this was by far the best of them all.<br /><br />The lid holds very firmly, even when held upside down or even dropped countless times.  We do not even use the optional cap feature shown in the picture.  It doesn't really drip, even when held upside down.  Just be aware though that if it is shaken alot upside down or held upside down where the bottom has contact with a surface, a small amount may dribble out, but even this is extremely rare.  This makes it an excellent cup for the transition from bottle to cup and has worked extremely well for us.<br /><br />It is BY FAR the easiest and quickest sippy cup to clean as it doesn't have the straws or other contraptions to take apart.  you basically just take off the lid, scrub both sides, and wash the cup as normal.<br /><br />Overall, really well designed, yet simple sippy cup.  Sometimes keeping it simple is better.
5.0	I was a little scared to buy this adapter after I read some of the reviews, but I'm glad I did it works wonderfully! Exactly as it should directions on how to place them are on the adapters themselves very self explanatory, took 1 min to place on to the stroller and and super easy to remove. Would recommend it.
1.0	AFTER FIVE CHILDREN AND NUMEROUS DEVICES, MY WIFE AND I DECIDED TO ORDER A MONITOR WITH VIDEO CAPABILITIES.  WELL, WE COULD NOT HAVE CHOSEN A WORSE DEVICE THEN THIS.  IT IS VERY HARD TO USE<br />AND AFTER A WHILE IT STARTS TO BUZZ.  GRANTED I HAVE LITTLE OR NO PATIENCE BUT THIS WAS A TERRIBLE PURCHASE ON OUR PART.  WE ARE RETURNING THIS.  TOTAL JUNK
5.0	We bought this blanket 6 months ago. Back when we ordered it the merchant had a misleading picture posted in the product description (which they corrected since) causing some bad reviews due to mismatched customer expectations. This is a small blanket 40&#34; x 60&#34; made from two sheets stitched along the perimeter: a sheet of decorative satin (polyester) with geometric print on it and a sheet of sherpa fleece (the softest fleece around nowadays). We are not washing the blanket very often (some other reviewers said they wash it twice a week, - we don't), so it holds up great so far. It is surprisingly warm, given how thin and light it is; when my 16-months old naps during the day (@winter time) she objects to any additional layers (she kicks them off), and prefers to nap just with this soft blanket over her. I love the colors - they are non-aggressive and calming, yet bright. Matches nicely with my baby's cherry-colored crib and turquoise jersey sheets. The pattern on the satin side tastefully matches the other items of the Cocalo's Capri set. Probably not worth the original price of $35 though - realisticly, it is a small satin-lined fleece blanket with satin trim. :)
5.0	Great detail and quality. Very pleased.
5.0	I absolutely adore this company….. Two of my cousins just had babies and I bought them both this product…. They loved them. Nicely done….perfect shower gift. Shipping with amazon prime was super fast and everything was packaged well.  VERY VERY NICE PRODUCT!!!!! And ever so cute!!! ~~~ caitie xoxox
5.0	The border is great it looks good and wasn't to difficult to put up but do be wary it is not peel and stick border like i was hoping. Still rating as five star though because the border is of great quality and looks great.
5.0	It's wonderful for saving water if you're on a well, and it made it wonderfully easy to get at my daughter to wash her without wrestling with a baby seat.
5.0	This is a great product! I used to have a standard puppy playpen, the kind made of wire. My puppy figured out how to climb out of it at about 12 weeks old. I put a border around the top and he climbed around it. I put a lid on the top and he climbed under it. All the movement scratched the floors and annoyed the downstairs neighbor.     Not so with this playpen! The bars are sturdy and the base is well-built. Even with a hyper puppy inside,  the rubber feet keep the pen stationary on the wood floor. Because there are no horizontal bars for his little feet to catch, he simply cannot climb out. The gate is moderately tall, so there's no way he's jumping out either. Even when he gets bigger, he won't be able to get enough of a running start to hurdle over it. Best of all, since I don't have to have a lid on his pen, I can reach in and give little Max a pat on the head every time I walk by.    One caveat: if you care about the color of the pen, you should know that Amazon sent me a taupe pen, not a white one as pictured. I need the thing too much to do without it while I return it and wait for them to send the right color, so I'm stuck with taupe. Oh well!
5.0	I love the facial wipes. No messing with cloth and I don't like to use diaper wipes on kiddo's face. I also use them as diaper wipes when I am on the go, since it is smaller than a diaper wipe package.<br /><br />Amazon is way overpriced on this. For about half the price, you can get them online at Walmart ($8 for four).
5.0	My son loves this!! It's his favorite teether!
5.0	My daughter is approaching 2 years of age and it was time to purchase a more light weight stroller.  My daugher is a bit on the small side so it was hard to find a stroller where her legs were not sticking straight out and the harness fits her properly.  This Britax stroller was the only stroller that fit her perectly.  She likes it for the most part (considering she dislikes confinement of any kind).  The stroller is easy to assemble, fold up, and store.  The added diaper bag is handy.  It is quite large and holds all the items you use for a day at the mall ;-) <br /> <br />K.

5.0	My grandson has been wanting to feed himself.  We watched in fear whenever he grabbed a fork.  Not with these.  They are very safe for a little one learning to feed himself.  The fork won't stab food, but at least it won't stab him or anyone sitting by him either!  They are easy for him to hold.
5.0	This is exactly what I was looking for.  My son has tons of fun splashin around in the tub now!
5.0	Love this stuff... bought 6 of them ! Great to organize the freezer and works with both medela n lansinoh bags.
1.0	I really wanted to use this bumper for our daughters crib but it Does not fit babyletto skip crib, great idea and great product other wise.
1.0	Does not work if your deadbolt is not straight up and down.
5.0	I absolutely love Best Bottom covers!! By far the best covers out there!!! The double gussets are important and because these covers are double layered they are durable. The snap in insert is genius. I even use the covers with other inserts because I love these covers that much. My only complaint is that I wish the snap in inserts were thicker because having to use more than one insert makes the snap part bulky and seems like it would be really uncomfortable for my baby when she lays down. I bought the stay dry inserts and only have to use one but the other regular micro fiber ones I have to use 3 (which they recommend) and its just way to bulky at the snaps. Other than that these are awesome and the price is well worth it!!!!!!
5.0	I love these disposable bibs. They are cheaper in price than bibsters, and just as sturdy. Maybe not as large. They work great for transportation, or for daycare. I send these in with my children, at school. Great alternative to the plastic bibs. I would say this is a must buy.
5.0	This bassinet is sooooooo easy to snap onto the Britax B-Ready stroller and looks great.  It is fairly light.  My favorite feature is that the pad comes out so you can place a bassinet sheet on it.
1.0	Too weak to provide adequate suction.
5.0	Used on a pumpkin head to look like a baby for a fall baby shower! Super cute! The mom it was for can use it for baby when he arrives too!
5.0	We were looking for a new toy for our then six month-old daughter, when a kind stranger recommended the Triangle as one her child had found entertaining.  We looked closer at it and realized just how much was going on in this toy - each side has multiple different actions, shapes, colors and activities, and there are spinners, rattles and mirrors too.  In essence, you gain five sides of activity, and can extend the entertainment value of the toy by periodically rotating it for younger kids so that it always presents something new.  As they become stronger, they begin to discover that it can be picked up and shook for added interaction, and will also begin rotating to different sides themselves. <br /> <br />While it is just slightly on the large size for easy portability, when we did have room, we were sure to pack it for trips as this one toy provides far more entertainment than carrying multiple others.  Plus, it is well made and very durable.  Now at 16 months, our daughter still carries this around as one of her favorite toys.  We love it and she does too!  We'll certainly be hanging on to this one for the next baby!  A tremendous value!
5.0	"I purchased this pump because I didn't want to buy the expensive Medela system. I was weary a bit because it was a big investment but I tried it anyway. We bought it before the baby was born because we knew for sure that we were going back to work full time. Just out of curiosity, I rented a Medela from the hospital and tried it for a week. It did not have the silicone cups, just horn looking hard plastic cups... Ouch!!    I started using it around the fourth week after my baby was born. I went back to work at the six week mark. I work in a male dominated workplace so it was in the begining, a bit embarrasing. But the pump was very quiet and because of the double pump, it took about half the time. The pump is so quiet, I pump in my daughters room in the middle of the night and she is none the wiser. We also have our baby monitor close to the outlet that I use to pump and my husband doesn't even stir in his sleep.     The different pouches that it comes with keeps everything neatly organized. It uses the ABC system. A for accessories, B for breast milk and C for Cups. It all fits neatly in the tote bag. Very cute. It even has little letter keychains that go around each pouch. Very nice touch.     The pump has 5 each settings for speed and suction strength. I recommend going slow and low until you get used to pumping in general. The flip cover for the tubing can be removed if you want. You can do one or both at a time. If you're going to express one at a time, I suggest lowering the strength so it won't feel like you're being tugged. The silicone breast shield has a \\""flower\\"" design that helps massage and makes it feel better while expressing.     As your child gets older, your child will naturally demand more. As this happens, I increased the strength and not the speed. I now pump at least twice a day, every four hours, while at work, and once at 2am. My baby is turning 6 months on a couple of weeks, and I am very happy about my pump. The replacement parts are very easy to by and cheap. Simply go to their site and search for what ever part you need. (You can find part numbers on booklet that came with the pump). If you do not have the book, no problem, just search the website for pump amd then parts.     Good luck to all you moms out there!!! Remember, breast milk is still the best for your baby at least until 6 months of age."
5.0	The lock stops built in my window s were broke,so these took care of that and are stronger. I recomend
5.0	I sent TWO packs of these plus a pack of the boy's bibs to my granddaughter to cover everything she has in her closet.  They help keep her dry and mom out of the laundry room.  Great colors that compliment all of her outfits.  Great purchase and I would gladly do it again.
5.0	My grandson passed away from SIDS and this is a product that i wish i would have known about. Now my granddaughter is here and she has worn it in the hospital and then when we brought her home. I love this produce. It is light weight and easy to use, just be careful not to change the settings when you turn it off or take it off the baby. Happy Customer.
5.0	This bib has been great for our 3 month old baby for use with spit up and drool.  It does curl a bit in the wash but straightens out with some gentle tugging.  We'd be buying these in bulk if they were not so pricey.  Definitely better than the bibs with all of the decals.
5.0	I have read many reviews about the dye leaking off the purple flower.  My daughter always has it in her mouth and I haven't had any problems yet.      She is now 1 year old and still loves it.  She has had it for the past 8 months.  There are so many fun toys to play with.
5.0	I personally love these awesome bath toys.  I think that the suction cups stick just fine sometimes you have to get them wet or really smash them on to the surface of what you are sticking them to but they definitely stick.  Lots of fun and worth checking out if your kid loves to play in the bath.
5.0	Works well. Going to get the snuggin go too, our little one has out grown it already!
5.0	My Godchild loves her little desk and is enjoying it.
5.0	Great toy to help baby wind day from a busy day
5.0	I bought this for my son's room.  It looks great and holds a lot of dirty clothes.  I would buy this again in a heartbeat.
5.0	Works exactly as explained. Super easy to click in and out.
5.0	nice color (ok for boy or girl) and fits changing pad snugly.  I've washed a couple times and holds up well so far.
5.0	I liked these, also thinking in adding some appliqu&eacute; or embroidery to them. Make them unique!
5.0	Cute! Hit of the party. Good product...great price...quick shipping. Trifecta!
5.0	Wife bought it, she likes it
5.0	I looked everwhere for a pooh bear and decided to check amazon. I should have just checked here first because this little guy is super cute and was exatly what I was looking for. Soft and fuzzy and just all around cute. A super product and a nice gift.
1.0	"It has NO PAGES, just the front and back cover. What you see on the Amazon site, with the book opened up is ALL there is. Even though there are \\""taggies\\"" as if there were multiple pages, there is nothing else there.  It crinkles and is a teether, but $5  for this is ridiculous. And it shouldn't have been called a book---rather a soft toy."
5.0	I received it fast. I liked it so far. Cooool. I recommend it to anyone who is looking for such a thing in good price.I received it fastI received it fast
5.0	Easy to use. Great gift idea for grandparents for Christmas.
5.0	I love these! I primarily store homemade body butter in them
5.0	We have previously gotten the Fisher Price storybook for the iPod/iPhone/etc., and our one-year-old loved it.  When we had the opportunity to get an even sturdier and childlike iPhone entertainer, we took it.  This one is actually more useful than the storybook because it seems to be a LOT more protective.  I never feel like my electronics are in danger of water damage (drool!) or breakage.<br /><br />The apps are free and fun (they also have companion ones online for kids old enough to use the computer).  They are educational, but also entertaining.<br /><br />Overall, this is a good product and well worth a chance.
5.0	Made homemade burp cloths for some friends and it was perfect.
5.0	Been reliable for a few weeks now and it works great! Video and sound is very clear. I love how I can talk back to my son when he cries for attention. Can't think of anything negative about this camera!
5.0	I bought this for my Step-daughter, who is 10, and my two year old saw it and loved it!! Needless to say I will be buying another one soon! It is sooo cute!!
5.0	Great wet bag! Great product
5.0	This has become my daughters favorite toy - she recognized Elmer as soon as she opened her Christmas parcel at 19 months.
5.0	My son has several food allergies, including some uncommon ones. I use these at restaurants to help ensure he won't accidentally come in contact with an allergen.
5.0	These are great storage bottles and are compatible with the Medela Freestyle breast pump. I needed a larger bottle because I was overfilling the 5 oz bottles with my first morning pump. This price is half what the other retailers charge. The company ANB Baby is real standup as well, when my shipping took a bit longer then expected they responded to my email right away and comped me for shipping. All in all a great buy.
5.0	Purchased this recently for baby #2 because the other set we had was a definite girl set (#2 is a boy)... love love love! the colors are so pretty and can go for both boys and girls. The fabric is REALLY soft and my baby loves looking at the graphics on the bumper. The bumper has 2 different fabrics on the sides. The solid blue is a corduroy textured fabric and the graphic, featuring birdies, trees and leaves, are a soft cottony fabric. Sheets and quilt wash well too! We use the quilt for tummy time.   we are keeping this for possible baby #3!
5.0	This is perfect for when you come home with a new baby.  We just had our first child and things were so crazy at first with just getting used to the baby we could not keep feedings straight.  This timer helped us so much until we could get used to her feeding schedule.  We still use it so we can let the doctor know how long she's going between feeding.  We never really used the other options on it but it's well worth the money for the feeding one alone.
5.0	Love these hangers. They are the perfect size for baby clothes, and going strong at 2T sizes. The velvet keeps them from slipping, and they don't break as easily as tubular plastic hangers.
5.0	I needed something for my two yr old grandson that would be a step up from his big bulky baby seat.  It fits the car seat so much better, is lighter, and easy for him to climb in by himself, wh ich is a huge relief for my back.  I love that the arm rests fold out of the way so he doesn't have to climb over them to get in.  It seems pretty cushy and he loves it.  Plus, still has 5-pt harness, easy to adjust tightness, and graduates later into use with just the car seat belts when he is older.  Fair price, too.    8 months later:  I'm having a hard time getting the  shoulder/crotch-straps long enough to buckle up my grandson, now that he has a winter jacket on.  Having to use the adult  shoulder harness system although he is below the recommended weight limit.  It's a cinch to put him in that way,and he seems securely buckled in,  but I'm a little nervous about going outside of the recommended weight guidelines!  Other than that, I still like the seat and so does he.
5.0	I really hated the look of this product when I put in on my registry, but all the choices seemed ugly and this did seem to have good features.  Looks aside, my child loves the chair.  As a newborn, the vibration feature was great and he found it very soothing when agitated. He seemed very comfortable to fall asleep in it. Now that he is 3 months, he will just stare at the bumble bee and smile and coo.  He does look up at the thing above.  I think sometimes he is looking at his reflection in the mirror and othertimes I think he is watching it spin.  I do wish the music would play longer because sometimes he reacts when it stops and he is not old enough for the feature where they turn on when something is touched.  All in all, I think it was worth the money.
5.0	The trek bag of okidog is prefect for moms who want to keep it light and comfortable.<br />The bag is amazing and you can put there 1 day supply to all of your babies needs.<br />I am a fan of Okidog products, I bought my friend one as a present- she loves it as well.<br />It very comfortable, easy to clean and great fabric!<br />also looks good! There is an easy and safe way to plug it to any stroller, there is a kit you get with it that fits all.<br />Bottom line- i recommend this bag!
5.0	This thing is awesome! I was grossed out by it when I first heard about it, but decided to give it a try. It works way better than the bulb syringes. My baby has a runny nose from the pollen and this gets everything out so she can breathe better.
5.0	I bought this for my new grandson.  He can now set at the table with the family and eat.  Good height.
5.0	Wouldn't call this &#34;large&#34; but I really like it! Love that it has spaces to write beside each picture
5.0	This item is made well and is very fashionable. I get many compliments on the container.  The price was great!
5.0	Perfect for babies that don't like silicone nipples.  I've had the paci for a month now and my child prefers to gum it down.  It better than nothing and it is still intact.
5.0	Great my wife and I both use it but small would've been perfect size.
1.0	I bought these for my 10 months old so she can crawl around without hurting her knees. It is a bad design. Doesn't work at all. The padding is too thin. Don't waste your money.
5.0	Perfect fit ! As of the day of this post Im still waiting for my Grandson to come into this world and test the mattress himself!
5.0	I can put anything in here - cubed bread, fruit, hard veggies or crackers, even ice cubes! My baby loves these!
5.0	This baby carrier is my favorite! I've used the ergo and wrap styles and this one seems to work the best. Especially during hot weather, this is not as hot as using other types because it's much less fabric. Would definitely suggest for mild weather. Also very comfortable, just need a little practice in positioning and how it works.
1.0	"The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends NO screen time for children under the age of two: [...]    This is a complete waste of money, but more importantly, developmentally inappropriate.  I already have 3 year olds entering my preschool class who are spending time on iPads and I see the negative effects daily.  Fine Motor problems (moving an object across the screen requires little fine motor strength), attention problems (frequently changing images create an inability to focus on a still object), vocabulary acquisition problems (less person to person conversations has a huge impact of vocabulary acquisition), perseverance problems (no need to solve the problem, it will just tell you it was wrong and go on to the next one), tracking problems (the eyes need to be able to track objects across a large space as they develop)...just to name a few.  Please scroll on pass this one.  Your child will not be \\""getting ahead\\"" by having an IPad in front of them as an infant or toddler. In fact, it could be detrimental."
5.0	I love this thing. Ordered two and use them with my cloth diapers, can throw it right in the wash with them.
5.0	This lunch box is perfect! It is really good quality, and worth the 5 bucks. The lunch box isn't to small nor to big. It's ears has loops so you can attach it to your belt. The zipper is also good quality. The pink plastic is durable and can easily be washed by hand with a sponge.
5.0	I bought the pillow not because I'm pregnant, but because I'm overweight and my bed is uncomfortable. I tried sleeping with my legs propped up at night, but it wasn't working and I had gotten to the point where I could not sit up or stand in the morning. I would have to roll to my side and pull myself up. I decided to look into some sort of pregnancy pillow (since they're made to support women with large bellies!) and the reviews of this pillow were so great, I decided to try it. I love it! I can prop myself up in bed and use my laptop and it doesn't make my back and shoulders hurt. And when I sleep, I put the two arms of the pillows together and lie on top and I sleep so well! I did notice that I end up sleeping on my back more, and my neck and shoulders are sweaty in the morning. It can get warm. And, it does take up space in my bed. My husband has room to sleep next to me, but he has to climb if he wants to cuddle. But, the cons are minimal compared to the good night's sleep that I am getting now.
5.0	This is the second gate of this style that I have purchased.  I have one at the bottom of the stairs and this one is at the top of the stairs.  Some other reviewers have had issues with the template not lining up or issues with the gate coming out of the wall.  I personally have had neither of these issues on either gate.<br /><br />A huge plus for this gate is how easy it is to size it to any opening.  I also love the way you can set it up as a one way gate or a two-way pass through gate.  As for the mounting, the gate is only as strong as the mount.  Both of my gates are mounted to studs behind the drywall.  This is the best mounting option as it requires a lot of force to pull the screws out of the studs.  If you mount this gate in drywall with drywall anchors then this gate will become a lot less secure.<br /><br />If you need a strong, secure gate for your stairs and have studs to mount it to then this is the perfect gate to have.
5.0	I keep this on hand to clean out sippy top lids and the occasional bottle for my grandchildren.  The plastic ring keeps the tools together and I just leave them in the little tray that I have for kitchen sink gadgets.  They have held up fine, although I don't use them as often as one might (like if you were the mother not grandmother of these children).  If anything goes wrong with these brushes, I'll let you know.
5.0	Quick and easy install... about 15 minutes was all it took (with a powered drill).  The design is such that it did allow us to place it at the desired hight - which has helped keep the puppy in/out, just as we'd hoped.
5.0	I needed a gate for an odd sized doorway and looked at all of them at least twice. This gate was a great bargain with the extensions included(which is expensive to buy separately with the other gates). I have found it to be very sturdy with no movement or realignment when it closes. I didn't want to use hardware to install it and have never had a problem with the bar on the bottom. I installed it with my 9 month old tugging and climbing on me with no problems. It has a good appearance and is easy to operate(visitors figure it out after 1 or 2 tries). I have received many good comments by visitors and I am very glad I picked this one.
1.0	I did not like the Mommy's Helper Safer Grip Portable Shower Arm because it only stayed on the surface for a short period of time. In short, the shower arm doesn't stick.
5.0	"Now that my baby thinks throwing his toys and cups are a fun game I decided to invest in some straps. All of the cutesy designer toy straps seemed too pricey, so when I found these (IN PACKS OF TWO!), I decided to snatch some up! I am so glad I did. They aren't \\""cute\\"" but they sure aren't ugly, and my creative munchkin can't pull the snaps apart which means no more playing \\""fetch the toy\\"" for me!"
1.0	Unclear that this adapter does not fit older model of Uppa Vista Stroller. There is no alternative adapter available for the older version.
5.0	We absolutely LOVE our Baby Swing Sling and were amazed at how quickly we received it! So thankful we got it before the weekend! It's so handy to throw in the diaper bag and take to any park with swings, no more searching for baby swings or waiting for the only baby swing at the park. Our 1 year old absolutely loves it. He's safe, secure and very comfortable!
5.0	I bought two, one for each of my twins. Great purchase, we use it everyday! I wish I had bought this back when we first had introduced solids! I didn't purchase until they were about 10 months old. It does a great job at catching everything that misses their mouth, unlike the pocket bibs that we've used in the past. It will catch liquid too. I love that I can rinse it under the water to clean in between uses and throw it in the dishwasher at the end of the day. The only downside is that I have to be really careful when puting it on my daughter, her hair is pretty long and will get caught up in the closure if I'm not paying attention.
1.0	This was my first baby monitor I purchased - I am not pleased to say I will be returning it ASAP.  There are a few major design flaws with this unit that I can whole heartily say that it was not designed with parents in hand.  The best features on it are the quality of the picture.  It feels as if it updates at about 10-15fps.  Not too fast but not too slow either.<br /><br />Now the bad stuff;<br /><br />You cannot disable 'alarms' (ie if the baby makes a sound, it notifies you).  The system is inept to block out ambient noise vs other noises.  So the end result with a low fan noise in the background is a constant spam of alerts.  Why oh why did they not just add a feature to disable that alarm or provided some noise cancellation for the microphone?<br /><br />This alone completely kills any way to use this without having the unit completely be a crippler to its basic idea - to monitor the child and be alerted once there is an issue.  I will be getting a motorola one asap.
1.0	I loved this monitor for the first 2 months but now it won't take charge. I pretty upset by this because now I have to buy a new one and it definitely won't be this brand!!!
5.0	This product worked great! However, my son destroyed it ha! He couldn't resist grabbing the foam blades and chewing on them :) definitely not the products issue, and I find it quite funny! But, when it did work, it did the job!
5.0	Love this product! Was exactly what I wanted. Have used them before with other babies. Love the colors and patterns
5.0	"This has been my son's favorite toy BY FAR (from 3 months to current 15 months). He loves his \\""Mr. Bee\\"" so much I had to buy a second one just to be sure I had a back up in case anything happened to the original."
5.0	Very good and high quality item, Includes several useful bags for many baby's staff.
5.0	"My daughter is obsessed with her Little Giraffe blankies.  When I saw this I just had to get it.  She's still very young and hasn't \\""attached\\"" to a stuffed animal yet.  But I have a feeling all of that will change after Christmas this year!"
5.0	With a last name of Bacon how could I not get this for the grandbaby! It basically is a novelty item! Appeared to be good quality! Was a gift so I have not opened it or seen it used!
5.0	We received this potty chair after going through one of the big huge ones (which don't actually help any more with training than a little potty) and also another compact one that (like the others) all seem to come in white and no matter how much you clean it, it is stained, which is gross (and very visible to your guests.)  It has great non-slip material on the bottom and seems to fit kids booties of all sizes that come to visit.
5.0	I love the gumdrop pacifier and the clip makes it much easier to keep track of them! This is a great buy!
5.0	I purchased these for my grandson that loves pops but they are to cold for his little fingers.  He loves them!
5.0	"As with everything else we conscientious parents/grandparents (yes, I realize that I'm not the only psycho researcher out there), I researched booster seats religiously. This entire process took me about 3 months when I realized that my second daughter is insanely large for her age and she would be outgrowing the car seat momentarily. The funny thing is that I own a Marathon and a B-Nimble stroller and worship them both, so the Frontier 85 was the front runner right out of the gate. However, I didn't want to be hypnotized by the Britax brand (although I totally am), and let \\""the greatest booster seat ever\\"" allude my grasp; hence my journey began.<br /><br />I don't putz around either. I gave some lower end seats an honest investigation, because you never know where you may find a precious gem of a surprise! But alas, I didn't. Then I moved on to familiar territory: Clek, Recarro, Diono just to name drop a few. I knew two things going in: I want a 5 point harness and the best bet in the unlikely event of an accident. The Marathon (Cowmooflage) that we have owned for 3 years, is an incredibly safe and thoughtful chair, so it made sense to just upgrade to the Frontier (which is also Cowmooflage).<br /><br />There are 2 points that I would like to address that other reviewers have made complaints again. Unlike the Marathon, the tightening on the LATCH system is only one sided. However, Britax has cleverly instructed us to pull the slack through the slot near the bottom right of the seat. I just installed this seat today and it is remarkably easy to do. I'll teach you a trick. Don't pull the slack straight out towards you. Kneel on the seat with all of your weight bearing down, and pull the slack in a straight line hard and to the left. Kind of like a lawn mower but in the opposite direction. When I lifted my knees, the seat didn't budge, not even to \\""give\\"" from releasing my body weight. This puppy won't move an inch, Just like the Marathon. For reference, they are bothinstalled in a Saab 9.7.<br /><br />The Cowmooflage material is the only material however that is not like a thick shiny tent-like material that I'm just not down with. I've actually never seen or felt a seat with similar material, but it stays cool when it's supposed to and vice versa. You can tell it's expensive.<br /><br />This brings me to my final point which is the price point. Don't even flinch. As soon as you open the box, your anxieties will be released. This seat feel $300, no doubt about that. My 3.5 year old daughter's face lit up when I opened the box and she said, no kidding, \\""Cool!\\"" There are 2 built in cup holders- seemless, no less so nowhere for gross things to fester. Consumer reports and parents alike rave about this seat. keep your kids buckled for as long as humanly possible. If they're older, use the booster mode or park farther away from their school. Kidding. Kind of.<br /><br />Bottom line, if you're on the fence, jump.<br /><br />Safe travels to you all..."
5.0	This little bag is perfect for my pump parts - I use a medela.  It's perfect for when I'm pumping while out of the house and can just toss the parts in here.  This can be used for so many different purposes - very pretty, washes easily, repels water, love love love it!
5.0	This is by far my favorite bottle brush. It cleans much better than the bristle brushes and fits into the Tommee Tippee bottles much better than the other bottle brush wands.
1.0	my grand daughter had this teether, she loved it until I noticed the paint coming off. I took it away immediately. So it sits on the shelf. What a waste of money. I never saw a teething toy that had the paint come off in my life. I hope it was not toxic. Maybe it would make a good dog toy.
5.0	Other than the obvious (you can step on it and reach higher places), it is very sturdy piece of furniture made with a renewable resource.
5.0	Great price and good quality! Just what I wanted to carry my son in and easy to figure out all the different ways to carry.
5.0	Great car seat for my grand kids, easy to adjust very comfortable.
5.0	The nosefrida is way easier to use than the bulb type snot suckers. Our kids complained less and it definitely sucked out more snot. I highly recommend this for babies of all ages. Just make sure you clean it after each use, otherwise the tube will probably get very dirty and be harder to clean later.
5.0	I love these.  I hated the bags because they always seemed to leak and I could never get them to stand up in the freezer so  I wouldn't have frozen milk all over the place. When the bags did leak the bag would stick to the freezer and I wouldn't be able to use the milk anyway.  I bought these when I had my second child and have used them mainly to store milk but have also used them during feedings.  I have not had any trouble with them leaking. As for the problem with writing and marking off on the container I went to office depot and bought labels which I can peel off after it has been used.
5.0	"My 8 month son and I assembled this quickly.  I'm petite but he's really the handy one.  The high-chair came with all the tools needed.  Excellent wood quality, and sturdy chair.  With a year-and-a-half of usage, I have the following recommendations:    1.  Use an anti-skid rubber mat, like the one you find in the kitchen aisle of Target, to place on the seat.  Otherwise, because the seat is just a flat piece, your child may slip or have a hard time staying in the seat.  I have my brother to thank for that suggestion because when we first used this chair, my son was small, like me, and he didn't (and still doesn't at 23 lbs.) have enough weight to keep himself from sliding off.    2.  I may somehow have a professional carpenter or someone who knows how to use a saw to cut back some of the arm rest so that I can slide the chair closer to the edge of our dining table.  I studied it, and there's an unnecessary extra length on the arms that the tray would still work if we cut if off somehow and sanded the edges down.  My brother has the TippTopp Kettler chair and the arms on that one is perfectly sized where they can have the high-chair flushed against the table.  This extra long feature makes it hard for my little one, as tiny as he is, to reach the table and to be able to eat like the rest of us.  Note, this suggestion is only if you choose not to use the tray.  With the tray, it's just perfectly measured.    3.  Always wipe the tray down afterwards.  This is a nice wood piece that you wouldn't want to stain, if you plan on keeping it for future generations.  Oh, by the way, I love the fact that this can be used up to like over 100lbs (or more).  I haven't had a problem with keeping the tray in perfect condition, and we've had it for 1 1/2 years now.  And even the straps are easy to unassemble to clean.    4.  I would have liked to see the foot rest come out about 2-3\\"" more.  My son, as short and small as he is, already has outgrown that feature, so it seems that he doesn't have much support for his legs.  Maybe the manufacturers can take back some of the arm rests and put it into the foot rest :-)    5.  We purchased this item using Amazon Prime, where things are supposed to ship FREE for 2-day delivery.  Of course, with this item being made of solid wood, it was considered a heavy item and Amazon charged us $20+ for shipping.  One of those small fine prints that gets you down after all the excitement of finding that perfect piece of furniture.  However, Amazon was great, in that, they assured to refund every penny if I wasn't completely satisfied.    Thanks, but I'm glad I didn't return it because our family love it and are glad we were able to find it at Amazon.  This is definitely a keeper!"
5.0	Perfect fit,great material
5.0	Our daughter is quite tall so had to upgrade earlier than expected, but this carseat was perfect with the head rest and infant insert
5.0	fantastic bib, comfy, although at times my 2 year old likes to spit his water into the bib to watch it pool. easy to clean.
5.0	Love em, love em, wife loves em, we love em! Very easy to use and compact! Pricey, but works well!
5.0	[Posting review w/ my husband's login] I am so glad to receive these bags as a gift from my husband. Our bathroom used to be scattered soggy toys around. These bags dry really quickly and hold a lot. I didn't have issues with strings like previous review. The ones I received are great quality. I also enjoyed the fun bath pdf sent by the seller through email. Definitely recommend it!
5.0	I wish I had known about this product sooner.  It gets out anything you would want to get out of a little one's nose, even the stubborn, hardened boogies.  I'm not going to say he loves having me poke around in his nose with this, but he tolerates it much better than the bulb syringe. I would definitely recommend it.
5.0	I bought this for my grandson, he loves it, It has worked great in helping to potty train him
5.0	BOUGHT THIS FOR MY TWEEN DAUGHTER'S BEDROOM RE-DO.  SUCH THE PERFECT TOUCH!  WENT FROM LITTLE GIRL PINK ROOM TO TURQOISE AND BLACK &#34;BIG GIRL&#34; ROOM.  THE 3-LIGHT CHANDELIER CREATES A LOT MORE LIGHT THAN I THOUGHT.  THE ROOM IS 10 X 10 AND THIS WAS THE PERFECT SIZE.  WE BOTH LOVE IT!!!!
5.0	My daughter would roll off of a mattress placed on the floor when we would go visit my inlaws.  This has a sling like effect that keeps her from rolling and in her bed.  Love this.  I put it and a small sleeping bag in a rolling duffel and now have a bed in a bag.
5.0	After receiving this blanket as a promotion, in exchange for my honest and unbiased review, I can tell you it is the BEST baby blanket I've ever felt.   I have 5 kids and have used/tried/felt every one of them on the market. This is big, soft (VERY soft), plush, pretty, etc. I cannot say enough good things about it.   My kids love snuggling with it.   It comes in a reusable plastic zippered pouch. It is the perfect blanket for a shower gift, first birthday, even a baptism gift.   I can't wait till a boy ones comes out!
5.0	Great seat!  We got two of them for our twins, and they are fabulous so far!  They seemed big and bulky when they arrived, but once assembled, they were great.  They boys are comfortable in them and we couldn't be happier with the purchase!
5.0	I am formula feeding my son, so we have a ton of bottle's to wash and sterilize. In the beginning we were doing it the old fashioned way by boiling them in a large pot of water for 5 minutes. Yeah, that got old real quick. We decided to break down and buy this sterilizer, and boy are we glad we did. 5 minutes in the microwave and you are done... with out warming up your entire house in the process! It was been a lifesaver... especially when we went camping. My parents have a trailer with a microwave in it, and the sterilizer fit in there perfectly, making bottle making a whole lot easier!
5.0	I really like this baby bag, it has plenty of room without being too cumbersome and very bright and colorful!
5.0	The Growth Chart comes with cute accessories to mark measurements.  It is made of very good quality materials.  Car- designed chart goes great with car-themed room.  Great product!
5.0	Perfect goods, fast delivery, satisfied customer.
5.0	Love these handy little wipes!
5.0	These bags are the best! They are big enough for even super poopy diapers (my son is in size 5) and they smell really nice. The opening is big enough so you don't have to wrap a super yucky diaper into a tiny origami shape to get it into the bag. I put wet and poopy diapers in these and then just toss them in my kitchen trash which I empty every night any way. They contain the smell pretty darn good. The handles are perfect for a double tie and then toss. Can't recommend enough!
1.0	"To all consumers, please do not fall into the evil marketing scheme of this product!  Some people may be inclined to purchase this product because of the Winnie the Pooh theme but that is the only way Safety 1st can get by with selling this sub-par product at approx. $89.99.<br /><br />Along with the other items that Safety 1st has produced with the Winnie the Pooh theme, and I unfortunately bought/received as a gift, this Bouncer is no different.  For your sanity, and most importantly, your child's safety do not buy this product.  Here are my chief complaints to include, but not limited to:<br /><br />1. There are no recline positions for this bouncer, you get an awkward semi-bucket seat, which will sag as your baby grows.  The material will come back to shape after a washing, but one use, and it will sag again.<br />2. The toy bar (if that's what you want to call it) can easily be removed and barely stays attached to the bouncer.  It has actually fallen on my son a couple of times.<br />3. Now I'm not an unreasonable person, and had realistic expectations for a bouncer.  But, for $90.00 do you think Safety 1st could have installed a music on, vibration on, or both on functioning switch?!  You get one setting, vibration and music on, or completely off.  For one, the music is annoying, repetitive, and the sound quality is awful.  (No I'm not expecting Pioneer speakers in my bouncer)  But you can't have either or, it must be both, and I heard that awful music in my sleep for months!<br />4. The follow-on complaint with the music/vibration of this bouncer.  At 3 months, my son started kicking when he was in the bouncer, and the music started skipping, the vibration didn't work, and that aspect of this bouncer was destroyed.  One mighty kick from my 3 month old and it was never the same.<br />5. The vibrations that were supposed to be generated from this bouncer were a complete disappointment.  Maybe the trembles I felt was from the theme of \\""London Bridge\\"" blaring atan uncomfortable volume, I'm not certain though.<br />6. That head insert shaped like a bear head is completely useless and will provide no support to your child.  Its padding is flimsy and thin and serves no purpose at all.<br /><br />I despise this bouncer, and I hate this company for putting out garbage like this.  Do yourself a favor and stay away from this product."
5.0	Sweet little notes, perfect for a short note!
5.0	I HIGHLY recommend this stroller!  It is so convenient, lightweight and actually folds smaller than my Graco Metrolight! (without the canopy)  The steering alone should make this stroller an award winner.  I had my newborn in his carrier on the front and my 35# 3 year old riding on the back and was 'driving' through a rainy parking lot with ONE HAND holding an umbrella with the other.  There was NO STRAIN to steer or push AT ALL!  It is incredible!!!  The basket is of course not ideal, but I didn't expect it to be, with all the other features it has, that was not a priority for me.  My older son actually prefers to ride facing forward with his feet in the basket anyway.  It clears up the handle bar to hold my bag that way, too!  Anyway, I LOVE THIS STROLLER, it is a MUST HAVE!!!  I have NO regrets!!
5.0	This Playtex sippy cup is leagues above our other Avent magic cup.  I avoided it at first because it looked slightly goofy, but O! sweet sippy!  It doesn't leak at all, the valve and top are easily cleaned, 7 ounces is a good amount of juice, and our baby uses it easily.  He chews on the mouthpiece in his spare time...and I think it's plenty soft enough for him.  Like some others have mentioned, it might be nice if it were graduated so I could keep track of his intake.  The cup is fantastic.
1.0	Many times I tried to put my daughter on the seat, it moves! I tried to put her on very careful, it still moves. Though the cushion is soft but it does not stay at the right place. Not a product I would recommand.
5.0	Good quality fabric. Strong clip to keep attached to babys shirt. Fits all Pacis. I would reccomend this product to all Moms
5.0	For the price, quantity, and quality - great bibs! They're absorbent enough to catch drool and any liquid food run offs, but the waterproof layer isn't bulky nor crinkles upon contact. The size of the bib is also good for large coverage area. The velcro is very secure, and I haven't noticed any chafing on my son's neck. After 2 months of use and washes, they still look like new!
5.0	I love this wet bag!  It is the perfect size and keeps the smell down SO well compared to my last wet bag (which was waterproof but single lined versus double).  I love the handles and it is so easy to just sling in the wash with my diapers.  Although the washing instructions say not to, I just put it on the same hot cycle as my diapers and I haven't had any problems so far.  It does take a little bit longer than the diapers in the dryer (I have also had no problem with it going through the dryer) but that is no big deal.  If I had to voice a disappointment it would be that the zipper catch is a bit small and therefore sometimes tricky to grasp and open the bag if you have your hands full of poopy diaper, but once you get the hang of it, it is only a small annoyance.  This wetbag is my favorite.  I have two now (one in monster mash) and I just switch them out as one gets full.  They are wonderful and I wish I had discovered them sooner!
5.0	I gave to a friend for a baby shower and her and her husband loved them and said they were perfect for the closet. They hung them up already and they looked really cute. They were smaller than I imagined but perfect for nursery.
5.0	i have been through so many strollers since i started having babies 12 years ago, this is my best purchase so far. i searched the net for a light weight, i had the aria with my 6 year old, it was just worn out, so i updated. it took about 2 minuts to put it together, the color is much better than online. i love the harness, my 7 month old can move about as he likes. the sunshade can be pulled all the way down infront of the baby which is great for when the sun is hitting in an annoying angle. its very smooth to push, very light weight, and wow, one hand , click, and its folded. love it... i have only had iy a month, so i dont know about bits falling off, hope not... if its like my 2002 aria  then it should be fine.
5.0	These were perfect for my baby showers dont cross your legs game!
5.0	While these are pricey, I think they're worth it. They absorb spit up with the best of them and often double as a lap blanket, changing pad, bottle drying towel and all around multipurpose cloth when traveling. They have been washed dozens of times and look brand new.
5.0	The lamp is beautiful and I got there on time
5.0	Comfortable and practical for travelling.  I would much rather carry my single breast manual pump to work or travel.  It's light weight and no noise when you're pumping.  This is discreet and works great for moms on the go.
5.0	I love this thing!!! My son is 15 months and loves to splash, and wash his hands.... especially in the toilets!!! It's his favorite!!! Well, not anymore! These seat locks work perfect for us. We have them on all the toilets, never had a problem with them, my husband put them on (I'm married to an engineer) and they never came down yet, never broke or anything and they get abused a lot! The older kids(3 and 4 yrs old) learned the trick really fast, the problem was when my in-laws came over to babysit one night and we forgot to explain how to unlock the toilets! Extreme measures were taken, but still they couldn't get the lid open. We now printed out using instructions to open the toilet and taped them on all the toilet lids, to avoid such accidents in the future :))
5.0	Works great and keeps little hands away from the chords. The product is exactly as described and fits it's purpose. I would recommend this to other parents.
1.0	Very disappointing. Doll was very small for the price. She was also damaged when I got her and had to send it back. The company was good about it but I was disappointed since I wanted to give it to my granddaughter Emily for Christmas.
5.0	Good product. Lot of locks takes time to adjust. But overall a good buy and satisfying experience.
5.0	I have a Christian friend having twin boys so I made blankets and burp cloths with the blue and green material. She will love them.
5.0	My review of the FastAction Fold Jogger stroller:<br />Its size is fairly large when you open it up and get the wheels connected with the 2 in the back and 1 in the front. It's not very heavy weight when pushing it to jog or walk though, so you should be fine to run at your own pace. The handle isn't too high up or too low, so it will be just right to run with. It has a canopy built onto the front where it can keep the sunlight from the baby. It also reclines to a laying position or sitting.<br /><br />Some features of this stroller are:<br />- It accepts all Graco Click Connect infant carseats with a secure one-step attachment<br />- One second, one hand fold has an automatic storage lock and is self standing when folded<br />- Air filled rubber tires offer suspension<br />- Locking front swivel wheel provides an easy transition from daily strolling to jogging<br />- Multi position reclining seat for baby's comfort<br />- Deluxe parent's tray features a unique smartphone cradle for your phone or MP3 player, 2 deep cup holders, and a covered storage compartment<br />- Extra large expandable canopy with peek-a-boo window for child<br />- Extra large storage basket to hold all your essentials<br />- Reflectors for added low light visibility<br />- Child's tray with cup holder pivots or removes with no fuss stroller entry<br />- Convertible 3 or 5 point harness grows with your child<br />- Stroller is good for children up to 50 lbs<br /><br />Measurements and weight of stroller:<br />Weight: 30 lbs<br />Length: 40&#34;<br />Width: 24&#34;<br />Height: 42&#34;<br /><br />Folded diminsions of stroller:<br />Folded length: 39&#34;<br />Folded width: 23.6&#34;<br />Folded height: 15.3&#34;<br /><br />Care of the stroller:<br />- To clean stroller frame, use only household soap and warm water.<br />- NO bleach or detergent<br /><br />My review of the Click Connect 35 infant carseat:<br />It's a really high quality infant rear facing carseat. It rear faces from 4 - 35 lbs. It's fairly heavy to lift, but you will keep the base of the seat in the car and use the carseat carrier as a way to carry the baby around place to place, as well as a carseat in your vehicle. This carseat is part of the FastAction Fold Jogger Click Connect Travel System.<br /><br />Some helpful information about this infant carseat:<br />- It helps protect infants from 4 - 35 lbs<br />- Click Connect technology offers a one step secure attachment to all Graco Click Connect strollers to create a travel system that can be customized to your needs<br />- Top rated by leading consumer magazines and publications<br />- Rigorously crash tested to meet or exceed US safety standard<br />- Safe Seat Engineered (safeseat engineering includes side impact testing, testing at 2x car seat standard, and testing to extreme car interior temperatures)<br />- Side-impact tested (In addition to meeting or exceeding all applicable US safety standards, the SnugRide Click Connect 35 car seat has been side impact tested for occupant retention by the harness system)<br />- EPS, energy absorbing foam for effective impact energy management<br />- Convenient, LATCH-equipped stay-in-car base with on-base level indicator for hassle-free installation<br />- Stay-in-car base with 6-position dial adjustment makes proper installation easier<br />- 5-point, front-adjust harness helps you get baby in and out<br />- Removable infant head support cushions baby<br /><br />The measurements of this carseat:<br />Depth: 30.7&#34;<br />Width: 18.7&#34;<br />Height: 15.6&#34;<br />Weight: 7.5 lbs<br /><br />To unbuckle harness:<br />- Lift the lever and pull the shoulder harness straps to loosen the harness<br />- Tilt the top of the buckle toward the child's abdomen<br />- Press in at the top of the red button<br />- Pull tongues out of the buckle<br /><br />Care of this carseat includes:<br />- Do NOT machine wash seat. It should only be wiped with a mild soap, taking care to not soak the material. NO bleach.<br />- Metal and plastic parts may be cleaned with mild soap and water<br />- Buckle may be cleaned with a damp clothh.<br />- Metal and plastic parts may be cleaned with mild soap and water<br />- Buckle may be cleaned with a damp cloth
5.0	After reading all of the reviews about how hard they were to open, I was surprised to find that wasn't the case. It only took two seconds to open it the first time I tried. I think some of the reviewers might have been doing it wrong. You have to press the button and pull the right side out at the same time. It doesn't seem to go as smoothly if you try to pull on the left side to open it. I have had these for about two months and have had no issues.
5.0	Quality of fabric seems to be very durable (very important) easy to 'install'. Looks nice and neat and very organizable. A+
5.0	Great Quality and Great service! Would use them again, and recommend them to all of my friends. Just great overall experience!!!
5.0	These are very soft even after multiple washes and the colors are still bright. Great drool catchers! Nice alternative to having a bib on my teething babe all the time.
5.0	We've had this monitor for almost 3 years now and it still works great.  In a new place it takes a while to find the right channel but on the right channel it works wonderfully.
5.0	"I bought this for my 20 month old son who was ready for some more challenging toys.  He loves the keys, and works hard at figuring out the locks, but can't quite do it yet.  He enjoys trying though!  Each of the six doors has 2 shapes that fit in that space-- one simpler shape that goes through the door, and one more challenging shape that goes through the little \\""chimneys\\"" on top.  I spent a while the first several times helping him orient the harder shapes properly.  He's still working at it, but this toy is cool enough to hold his attention, so he's motivated.  He'll focus on it intently for 15 minutes, which is just what I was hoping, so to me this is money well spent!      A couple of caveats, though these are not flaws in the toy, just things to be aware of when giving it to kids on the younger end of the age range: first, since my son can't unlock the doors by himself yet, he pulled on them to get them open, and I think this would break the little plastic workings of the locks if it happened too often.  So now I unlock the doors for him when I first get it out, and he's happy to open and close them and try the keys in the locks.  We'll keep working on that part.  Second, I let him play with it on his own after a few sessions of sitting with him the whole time, and he got frustrated and picked it up by the handle and swung it around!  Scattering shapes all over the den and almost whacking me and himself in the head.  This is a rather substantial toy so that was not too cool. :) So you may want to make it a together-time toy for the younger ones."
5.0	I had to write a quick review because I am in love with our new nursery.  We purcahsed the Starlight collection and all the matching accessories.  It's a really sweet set for our new baby boy.  The quality of the product is excellent.  Highly recommend!!!
5.0	I've had this drying rack for over 2 years and I love it. It still looks as good as the first day, it's very easy to wash by hand, and looks great in the kitchen. Once my children outgrow their bottles and sippy cups, I still plan on using it to dry miscellaneous cups and what-not. Love it!
1.0	I used just one time. it broke down!!!in bath!!!!  so I disassembled it, and found a little thing in a motor,removed them.then it works.  I guess the motor is a very cheap thing. if someone has troubles like me,check motor.(disassembling is very simple..)if you consider buying it,don't buy it..
1.0	My son absolutely loved this toy, but one morning while playing on the carpet with it, the wooden ring shattered into 4 small chunks for no apparent reason.<br /><br />Being a typical 1 yr old, my son grabbed a small piece of wood and stuck it in his mouth and started gagging on it. Thankfully my husband was there and quickly removed the piece before my son could choke on it.<br /><br />Please be careful!
5.0	Amazing product!  No matter the amount of the bottle (ounces), it always comes out perfect.<br />I love that I can just pour the water directly into the opening and not have to fill anything else.
5.0	Great product. I bought for my 3 month old. They fit her perfect with room to grow. I prefer this band to the thin ones that tend to leave lines
1.0	I bought this bag to protect our City Select with 2 seats. I read the instructions on how to load all the components and even put the directions inside for future reference.  The bag ripped the first time I traveled with it.  I returned the bag, got a replacement, lined the entire inside with duct tape for extra reinforcement in preparation for our next trip.  Bag ripped again.  I push the stroller to the gate with the bag loosely folded underneath, go through security, pack stroller in bag according to instructions,  and gate check.  Looks like I will be checking out the Bugaboo bag. Extremely disappointed considering the cost of the stroller.
5.0	Moms I really recommend this I purchase it when my baby was 9 months old now he is 30 months he still wears it quality is perfect thank you very much
5.0	Was looking for a soft, but not cloth, product my 8m old could hold and chew on.  She loves the soft material and the look of the fish eyes.
5.0	The spoon/fork are perfect.  My 23 month old has wanted her own fork for months but I was concerned about the sharp prongs.  This fork is rounded and slightly in a spoon shape so she can still scoop and also poke her food with the prongs.  The plate is &#34;as advertised&#34; - the lip of the plate really does help push the food back into the spoon/fork as my toddler learns to scoop / dip food onto her spoon and feed herself.  She's very &#34;i do it all by myself&#34; and this product has been perfect.  My elderly grandfather could also use this plate as he is having trouble scooping his food now so I plan to get him a couple of the plates.
1.0	These bags are basically a piece of fabric with a zipper sewn at the top.  They are very small.  There is not water or moisture proof barrier for items like baby carrots.  Items will get stale very quickly because there isn't a liner, so even your fishie crackers aren't going to taste good.  These would be better with a PUL liner (fabric used in cloth diapers) in them.  You would be better off repurposing a makeup or cosmetic bag from the dollar store that is lined for wiping clean.
5.0	Can't live without this sound machine!
5.0	I purchased this seat for 2-1/2 year old with the intent of this being her final car seat/booster seat. I absolutely love it and so does my daughter. The color pink is a bit more muted than in the pics, which I personally was very happy to see. A sturdy seat with easy to tighten straps and extra comfort pads. I was truely amazed how easy it was to adjust the harnesses to get the correct height - no more wrestingly with unhooking, threading, & rehooking straps. In my opinion this is a great value. In this case you definately get what you pay for.
1.0	DO NOT BUY FROM THIS COMPANY!! Closed up shop after months of giving open order clients the &#34;run around&#34;. Not issuing immediate refunds either. COMPANY SHOULD BE BANNED FROM INTERNET BUSINESS!
1.0	I bought this for my 2.5 year old bc she constantly bites her nails or shirt. She (and my son) loved it!! However, in less than 5 hours, she had chewed off the head AND the tail end into very dangerous pieces!!!! Do NOT recommend!!!!!!
5.0	Ok let me start by saying my daughter is a princess and she lets us know that. She hates being put down, hates the swing, hates anything that is not on her terms. She LOVES this car seat. After reading the reviews I almost didnt get this one, but it was so soft. So I got it anyway. She doesnt cry, her head doesnt flop forward or to the side when she falls alseep either. She is 5 1/2 months and again hated her infant car seat. So I would recommand this carseat.
5.0	Great and easy to use and they look great. for the nursery.
5.0	These were very cute and good quality. The only thing is that there are two ship themed bibs then a random I love my grandma. Love our grandma but would've preferred another nautical bib.
5.0	Love that I can see my lil ones with the night vision. I just wish you could sync any of there other monitors
5.0	Exactly what i wanted
1.0	I received 2 of these for my shower.  They are horrible.  They smell no matter how many times a day you empty them and the refills don't last very long at all and are very expensive.  I ended up throwing both of them out and buying a good old-fashioned diaper pail which works wonderfully.
5.0	I bought these for my mom because she loves owls. This was a really adorable set and the &#34;owl always love you&#34; made it even cuter.
5.0	When I needed a temporary crib for a few months I didn't want to invest a lot of money but wanted something that at least looked good and this exceeded my expectations.  Not only does it look good, it's a great quality for the price.
5.0	Three month old has loved Jacques form the start. Best of the all the Lamaze toys we own.
5.0	This item seems to be accurate.  Don't use it much, really only needed it of our initial project.  It does let you get readings in close proximity.
5.0	"In the car, at church meetings, around the house, at the grocery store, in the stroller, this is the perfect way to give your kids a snack. My two girls ages 2 1/2 and 15 months use theirs every single day.  We have done multiple cross-country drives (15 hours +) with the girls, and the Munchie Mugs always save the day.  Definitely worth the price. If you are a busy mom, these \\""mugs\\"" are a life saver!"
5.0	The product arrived promptly and in perfect condition and was exactly as presented in the product review, I have only used it once with a 3 month old grandchild who enjoyed it. I look forward to many other times of fun with grandchildren with it in the future.
5.0	Have the red and green one.  Have had it for over eight months now.  This is one of my daughters favorites, which is funny because she does not like pacifiers at all.
1.0	False advertising. We only got one. Boo!!!
5.0	fast shipping. Great product
5.0	Great night light. My son loves it.
5.0	We were looking for a seat protector that would stand up to active children stepping all over it as they got in and out of the car into the carseat. It fit perfectly on the seat of my Toyota Highlander and looks pretty nice. My interior fabric is light tan, but I am not worried about color transfer because the back of this seat protector is even lighter tan than my seats. Would definitely buy again and highly recommend!
5.0	These are so adorable
5.0	I love my tablet cover.  When I ordered I pushe the wrong key and ended up with a black but I am happy now that I did get the black.
5.0	I got this blanket for my yellow lab to cuddle with. He hasn't put this thing down since I gave it to him a few weeks ago. I have had it for over a month now and the item has not torn or fraid from either him chewing on it every now and then or putting it in the washing machine. This was a great purchase and I plan on buying more in the future. Super soft and not cheaply made!
5.0	This proved useful for when I have to stay inside & get some work done in my home office, and my 7yr old son is playing elsewhere in the house or outside.<br /><br />It's a pricey item, but considering that you can use it for so much more than baby monitoring, I think it's a good investment.
5.0	my grandson loves it!!!! and so does my daughter and son in law for play time and clean up
5.0	Holds well on the shirt and it looks great too
5.0	A must have with a newborn baby. I couldn't do without. Best $25 dollars I ever spent.. every new mother must get this baby gadget
1.0	If you look at the picture it shows the pad height is almost to the edge.. but NOT. It is only 1 inch thin which no where it was mentioned. Came in rolled in a small box which is still not straight yet after 20 days. Forget about the cost of it. Also, they need to put full descriptions of the product well and change the picture and put the real picture. Buy it if you don't care about the thickness and price.
5.0	I've had a Chicco green stroller since my first son started using it at 2 years of age.  He is now 6 years old and my second son uses it and he's now 2!!!  I've babysat and they have used this same stroller as well.  I have brought it with the family all over the US and internationally for vacation and it's been a life saver!  It's been and still is an excellent stroller with it being lightweight, durable, and has a carrying bag for travelling which is an excellent idea.  You HAVE TO get this stroller!!
5.0	Love this convertible car seat. Recaro makes superior products. Yes, it is heavy and &#34;bulky&#34; but I would much rather have a hard time moving a car seat around then seeing my baby in the hospital, or worse.<br /><br />We have had the ProRIDE for over a year and a half and can not say anything bad about it... It comes apart so everything can be washed/vacuumed out. We have checked it while flying at least 20 times, the airlines have these HUGE plastic bags, it does barely fit and the base has to be in &#34;non-recline&#34; position, but it's not a huge deal. I love that my son can sit in it while we are waiting to check bags without it being at all tippy....<br /><br />There is now a new model out to replace this, that has a cup holder. I wish this one had one and don't think we need to pay for a whole new seat JUST to get one. My son typically tucks his water cup in between his legs. We plan on upgrading to the high back booster in about a year.<br /><br />I would recommend the ProRIDE to ANYONE!!!!
5.0	"We bought this for our last Disney cruise and it worked well.  It's compact and easily fits in a stateroom without folding up.  It's narrow enough that it doesn't get in the way when meeting someone in the hallways.  I'm 6'4\\"" and felt comfortable pushing it.    I highly recommend this stroller if you're going on a Disney cruise (or any cruise for that matter) and looking for an inexpensive option."
5.0	Love this stroller... Would definitely buy again!!!
5.0	LOVED THEIR SERVICE...ON TIME...THE CRIB IS LOVELY A LITTLE HARD TO ASSAMBLE BUT OK...I RECOMEND IT LOTS OF TIMES...<br />GORGEOUS & ECONOMY.
5.0	Absolutely love this diaper bag! It's stylish yet functional. I'm able to fit all of my baby essentials plus a lot of extras. It's also large enough for me to hold my wallet, phone and keys so I don't need to carry a purse. The shoulder strap is great when you're not able to keep the tote straps on your shoulder. The outer material is also very easy to clean. Although not as secure as a zipper, I've come to like having magnetic button closures for two of the outer pockets, simply for the ease of access, plus they're deep enough where I don't worry about anything falling out. I was also concerned that the drawstring insulated pouch wouldn't keep my daughter's bottle cold, but it actually works quite well. I have three other diaper bags that I received as either gifts or purchased myself and this has become my day-to-day bag for my six-month old. I could also see myself using this bag after I no longer need to use it as a diaper bag.
5.0	I have zero to complain about.<br />It fits the mattress with ease, I wash hot and dry medium at least once a week, looks like new. Had it for a year.
5.0	Love this bag. There are 2 medium pockets and one large pocket on the inside. I use the mediums one for my wipe case and the other for the diapers. I use the large one for an outfit burp cloths and bibs. In the middle I have room for my large medicine bag, my daughter's rain jacket, snacks and any other extras. On the outside are large pockets I use for bottled sippy cups books and toys. I havevwent through three diaper bags before I found this one which is my favorite. It also has click straps to attach to a stroller handle. Haven't tried it yet but very neat feature. The material is somewhat plastic and easy to clean but I find it to be a soft material. The traps are it's only downfall for me. They are very stiff and font stay of my shoulder well but it's not a problem for me because I don't care my diaper bag around like that. I always have somewhere to set it down. Over all fantastic bag and worth the money.
5.0	Works great, all one piece which is different from Medela flanges but works just as great!!
1.0	This bag is a vinyl tote bag. Not worth the money, no flap for the pump like is shown on some of the other bags. The cooler is nice and the extra parts are ok, but not worth the cost.
5.0	Great to keep toddlers out of drawers or cabinets!!! My son is very curious and wants to open and shut everything. I needed something for the living room end tables, and this worked great. Also ended up using them in the kitchen and bathroom, to keep him away from the cabinets we keep our cleaning supplies in.
5.0	Our 8 month old loves sitting in this tub in our bathtub. He fits great in there, and sometimes will even lay back on the back part of it to rest his head. There is plenty of room for some of his favorite bath toys in there as well. It comes with a hook, so we just hang it on a rail in the bath tub, and it drys out completely by the next day. I read some reviews that said it wouldn't dry out for them, but so far that hasn't been a problem for us.
5.0	This product looked perfect for what I wanted.  Blue and white, complete wrap around, quick closures - no zippers ,  Perfect gift thought I. It would have been had I read the label and the size that I ordered.  Too too big, so I gave it away.  Ordering from the other side of the world is too big a hassle for just one item (to replace it)....sorry I really don't know how it fit etc...but looked good in the packaging.<br /><br />BJ
5.0	These are so beautiful! The girls love them and the horses are a very good size. I was glad to find something so girly and country at the same time.
5.0	Not something I would use,haha. My daughter wanted this so I ordered it. She loves it.
5.0	As soon as this came in the mail, I loved the way it was packaged so formally as if it were a gift. I love the variety of colors and the softness of the washcloths!
5.0	A SUPER SOFT AND COMFEE CHAIR FOR A TODDLER!  FITS COMFORTABLY UNDERNEATH TABLE WITH CHILD'S LEGS UNLIKE PLASTIC MODELS!
5.0	Gave as a gift, needed to use for two babies and worked perfect.
1.0	This item did NOT work how it was displayed! Highly disappointed! It didn't hold anything and was sturdy enough! I returned it!
5.0	Organic, washable, and great colors and patterns.  What could be better?<br /><br />My baby loves this little toy, and I don't feel guilty by letting him chew on it because it's organic and baby friendly.  Better yet, when it gets slobbery I just throw it in the wash and let it air dry.  It maintains it's shape, the rattling sound and has been a toy that our little boy keeps with him at all times.  Great for newborn and up!
5.0	Love it it fit perfect in my baby girl bassinet. .
5.0	Mrs. Steve in Hawaii says:<br /><br />Works great! Accurate reading (tested against another thermometer) I sometimes watch a 1 year old so wanted an accurate, safe, and non invasive option to keeping an eye on his temp.  No more fussing trying to get a thermometer into one of the other two places!  Kids love ear thermometers more than the adults do!<br /><br />I found a coupon code for this product on the internet that got me a small discount on the price and they requested (but not required) that I would leave a review whether it was good or bad.  I would buy this product again even without the discount.
1.0	I got this monitor because I want it to use it with my newborn. First the plate part is way too hard and if your baby moves even a little, it will sound off the alarm. My baby was never completely still. The manual and instructions are very difficult to figure out. My whole family is college educated and it took several of us to get it to work (independently without the movement sensor). The reception was good and I liked the night light. The 2 walkie talkies use rechargable bateries, which charge on the base. The child unit does not, and it takes 4 AAA, which lasted less than 10 hours!!!!!! (brand new baterries) If you baterries die the alarm goes off and wakes up your child! I was looking for the manufacturers number to call them....to see it is maybe defective. Could not get the manufacturers info or web site anywhere! I'm extremelly dissapointed and feel like I wasted so much money on this thing. Just bought a $30 monitor system that I'm much happier with.
5.0	Very good value, love the parent console that comes with the stroller, wish the handle bars are a bit sturdier though
1.0	I always read reviews first. But found this chair at a store for $12 and was pumped about finding a cheap simple booster.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />straps to connect to chair are a joke. They tighten then as soon as you tug on the booster they loosen completely.<br /><br />The &#34;belt&#34; for the kid is nearly impossible to get into. You have to stick their leg through it. Which was hard even for my tiny two year old that actually wanted in it.<br /><br />There is no grip on the bottom so it slides a lot.<br /><br />Pros.<br /><br />Good height<br /><br />I can still push chair under table.
5.0	I got these as a gift and loved them so much I bought more!
5.0	Perfect. They finally got it right.
1.0	WARNING! This is not a very well constructed device. It is  shabby , not sturdy at all. I have no confidence in this seat at all to keep anyone secure.
1.0	I ordered this sheet. I was so excited when I got it because I am a first time expecting mother, so I put it on my mattress and threw away the packaging. I then realized the sheet I got looked nothing like the one advertised. The one I received has no pooh bears on it and has only honey pots, bees, and blue and green circles. It is not nearly as cute as the one I bought. I will keep it because I already threw away the packaging and it is not worth the hassle, as I plan to buy multiple sheets anyway. However, it is annoying to order one thing and get something else entirely.
1.0	Liked monitor features... Unfortunately hand held monitor broke within 2 weeks. Summer Infant did not stand behind there product. Bad customer experience. I dropped the monitor from a height of 2 ft onto carpet. Should that really cause the monitor to break? Not if it's a quality product! Because I dropped it, the summer infant warranty was voided. Come on Summer Infant!!! You are making a baby product to assist sleep deprived parents. Of course we are going to drop the hand held monitor! It should not break from a 2 foot fall!! Customer service treated me rudely. Treated me like I was trying to scam my way into a free monitor. Customer rep tried to console me by mentioning that cell phone warranties are also void if dropped. That's TRUE, however cell phone companies make a quality product that withstands minor falls. In fact I accidentally knocked mine across the room, and I repeatedly drop it all the time. It still works. Customer rep offered to sell me a new monitor for $120... Now why would I spend more money on a crappy product? No thanks. Bought a Motorola monitor and can't be happier!
5.0	Soft, baby likes them.
5.0	Dr Brown's bottles are quite different from what I fed my kids with. They do reduce the amount of air in her system.  Pink is such a nice color.  Love the new concept.
5.0	I love these sippy caps with our Lifefactory glass bottles. I can easily regulate the water flow by twisting stronger or looser the sippy cap. My son used to chock with all other common plastic sippy cups, but he rocks with this one! In addition, our bottles with these sippy caps (twisted tight enough) never leak in my diaper bag.
5.0	I enjoy it.  Well made stuffed animal and nice reminder of one of my favorite Christmas shows. :-) Thank You.
5.0	The product was everything that I knew it would be I brought it for my two month old grandson who has discovered his feet and loves to kick so I knew this would be great to help him with his first developmental skills, and yes he loves the bright colors and he tries to reach for the bee and lady bug, he is very stimulated by the little bugs and he gives himself lots of excise.  However, in the many years that I have shopped at Amazon this is the first time that I have ever received the product that was not the same as the picture and the description didn't say that the design would be different than pictured. I spent a lot of time looking for the right design for my grandson, the one I received was the black and white stripe which I didn't want, and the product was not in its original package it was in a zip lock bag so that was very disappointing, but since I had looked for this product for long and was eager for my grandson to have it I just washed it and he loves it. So the product itself is great cannot take that away, but the presentation of this product was very bad and misleading, Disappointed in my go to online store this time.
5.0	For a fitted this is a wonderful purchase.  Fit my baby from newborn to 12 lbs - she is skinner/longer.  Washes & drys very nicely.
5.0	I purchased this cradle as a baby shower gift for my niece & nephew's baby, they loved it!
1.0	doesnt stay on our spout or squirt water out of the top
5.0	This fabulous. My newborn daughter loves it. We like to have her nap in different places/ rooms to be near us. This is perfect. It folds up very easily. Its is super light but still provides great support. Per some of the other reviews, I watch to make sure her head is in different positions and that she sleeps in different place like her crib/ our arms as well to avoid the 'flat spot'. The rocking is a great bonus when she needs just a little soothing. Also the back pocket is just big enough for a little hand sanitizer and a burp cloth.
5.0	Everything I expected them to be. Much more comfortable. Less pain. Faster let down and over all pumping time .
5.0	Item arrived quickly and was as ordered...baby and mama both love it!
5.0	I just got this blanket and love it!!  It is a med to light weight material, good sized, and soft.  The birds are colorful and I just know my little girl is going to love it.
1.0	I bought this from Target, and I wish I had read the reviews here first. Don't waste your time. It just sags, and it will be returned soon. Enough said!
5.0	I purchased this for the arrival of my new grand baby. It was a great price a loaded with a ton of great features.
5.0	I was looking for a small food processing item to puree/chop fresh spices, vegetables, and fruits for smaller meal portions, that wouldn't take up much counter space, and where clean up would be a snap.  This item is all of that!!!  I use it daily to chop up/puree fresh vegetables, fruits, and spices to put in sauces, shakes, yogurt etc.  It's the right size for small amounts of food, clean up is very easy, and it doesn't take up much counter space.  I am still experimenting with it, but so far I love it.
1.0	I wish I had actually read the reviews like I usually do for products purchased via Amazon. Unfortunately I trusted the picture that was shown for the product and was excited I had found a match for the exact play mat I had picked up at a consignment store a couple months ago. To my dismay, once the package arrived, I found that the product is NOTHING like what is shown. Yes it is a play mat, but it has 5 tabs instead of 4 which makes the tabs smaller and as a result they will not fit with the current mat I already have. So needless to say I will be returning these. I'm not sure what I'll do, as my little one really needs a larger play area. I'm really disappointed that this product has not been updated. I added some pictures to the product so that now others will be able to see what they will actually get and hopefully won't make the same mistake I did.
5.0	"This is an excellent compliment to our Easywalker Sky.  The steering is amazing on this stroller, the overall design is excellent for taller parents and you cannot beat the fold.  The stroller is a little heavier than a traditional umbrella stroller; however I still don't consider it bulky/heavy.  While the basket is not easily accessible from the back, it is plenty big and you can easily access it from the side.  I would highly recommend this stroller for an older baby (say 7-8mo+) and am not at all bothered by the lack of \\""creature comforts.\\""  The sun shade is much bigger than it appears in photos but not as big as the City Mini.  Frankly I think my son would go crazy with the huge shade on the City Mini as it would obstruct his view.  The seat back is very tall, allowing for a lot of room for your child to grow into this stroller.  All in all I think you can't beat it for the price."
5.0	My son loved all the animals and liked the lights and things to play with on the ground to he began to roll over with this product.
5.0	sent it as a gift, and my granddaughter loves it!
5.0	Our little one came home from the hospital and fell right asleep in this bassinet. It is light weight and easy to move around. It fits perfectly in any area of the house and wonderfully portable. Wish I had had it for my first baby. It is at the perfect height. Hope he uses it for a long time.
5.0	I have been Cding or about 3 months now. I've bought MANY different kinds, much to my husband's dismay, and I can say with certainty that these have been the best non-wahm diapers I have tried. They are trim and fit my chunky, 18.5lb 5.5 month old great. And comparatively speaking, they are very affordable for being such a great diaper. I have BumGenius 4.0 which are good but with a chunky baby it's tough to get a great fit. With these, I do. They are also incredibly absorbant and I love the designs. Definite recommend.
5.0	I am very happy with my purchase. these go great with the JOjo bed spread set and were very easy to hang.
5.0	Amazing product, I absolutely love Everything about it. So much better than Grobag and similar types of sleepsacks. If it wasn't so pricey, I'd buy it for every baby shower :) but oh well you've gottta pay for the quality.
5.0	The installation was not too difficult (~2 hours), and the crib looks beautiful!  I like the fact that the company adds plastic buffers to the bottom of the legs to avoid damaging floors, and I love the fact that this crib can grow with the child.
5.0	So cute! We love these frames so much!!!!
5.0	Awesome!  I bought this necklace for my granddaughter to help with Teething. I've used the Baltic Amber necklaces to help with migraines and foot pain. Great product and super fast service!
5.0	Get this before the baby, it's a must have. Make sure the size is appropriate for your crib, but it should fit all models.
5.0	Love!!! So comfortable and washes well.
5.0	"I bought this bed for my 2year old grandson for traveling. I thought he was too big to use the pack and plays. He loves his \\""big boy bed\\"" It is so easy to set up and take down, much better than a pack and play and it's low so if he does fall out he won't get hurt. He also likes to stand on it and it is very solid and doesn't tip easily.<br />Update May 2012 This bed is still going strong after use and abuse of 3 kids. All of the kids used it for naps and for traveling when they got too big for the pack and play.Plus I often find the kids playing with it in the playroom for their stuffed animals. I definetly recommend this bed!"
5.0	My 7 month old son loves it!!
5.0	We love this high chair! We are so glad we added this to our baby registry. Luckily a group of wonderful friends bought it for us as a gift. We have been using this product since our son was 5 months old, he is now 20 months and is now using the booster seat. We have no complaints from this products. The only complaint that I have is the way the wheels work. The front wheels doesn't swivel and the back ones do so I feel like I have to turn the seat backwards to be able for me to maneuver the high chair around, which is more of an annoyance to me than a deal breaker. Other than that we are happy to have this high chair. Baby #2 will be arriving next year so I'm pleased at the fact that we don't have to buy a booster for our son since it already came with one. Plus it's easy to clean! You can easy remove everything including the straps and place it in the washer. It also comes with three trays that are stackable. So if one is dirty just take off the top one and use the one below it. Hope you guys will enjoy the product as much as we do! =)
5.0	Ordered for a baby shower gift. Had it monogrammed, she absolutely loved it. It was large enough to hold all her baby items. The color was great also.
5.0	Perfect for potty training. easy to clean and cheap enough that we have several ( one at the in-laws, etc)
1.0	Unfortunately this car seat broke two times for us. The button broke after we returned it for the same problem. The seat belt also adjusts unevenly. I would definitely choose a different brand like Graco.
5.0	It was great and cheap since it was an add on. Prime is great!
5.0	I loved my thirsty all in ones until they started to stink and I couldn't strip them properly due to being an all in 1.  He quickly grew out of the size ones and instead of replacing with the next size I decided to go to the one size pockets.  I'm glad I did.  They are very absorbent and have contained several nasty breast fed blow outs (you know the ones where he hasn't gone in several days and they lets it all out at once).  I can separate the inserts and wash them much better than the all in 1.  The hemp insert is much more absorbent and combined with the microfiber actually makes a good night time diaper.  Plus the sitter really doesn't mind using these diapers as compared to the fitteds with covers.
1.0	We really wanted to love these as we are using them in our child's nursery. Several of the owls were not cut out properly and we had to improvise with scissors and careful cutting to get them off the sheets and onto the wall.  We love the look of the owls, they have a lot of personality but after only a day we noticed ALL of them were starting to peel off despite having followed instructions for application (clean walls, paint dry, firm application pressure). We have gone in every few days and pushed the edges of the decals down again in hopes that they'll adhere but after over a week no such luck.  Unfortunately I wouldn't recommend these.
5.0	Excellent product.  Good price and prompt service.  Highly recommended
5.0	Easy to assemble, comfortable. Essential for any baby nursery. My husband and I have spent many hours in it so far, and I'm sure there are many more in our future!
5.0	Nice looking potty, white insert is removable for easy cleaning. Cute color, yellow lining on bottom of potty. And is BPA free!!!
1.0	Knowing what I know now I would never buy this stroller again, nor would I ever want to deal with their customer service! At first I thought about buying a Bugaboo stroller but since it comes with such a hefty price tag I settled for this one. It seemed like a good deal since it comes with a lot of accessories. However, after few months of use I realized they give you all the accessories to sell a crap product. Besides, some of the accessories (like the diaper bag and the umbrella) are completely useless to begin with. If you decide to buy this stroller just know that you are on for a terribly bumpy ride (in every sense). Your baby will feel even the smallest twigs and/or bumps on the road and the ride is not exactly quiet either!  Also, I would like to point out that  the adjustable handle bar on our stroller started to malfunction just after two months of use and dealing with the customer service is no walk in the park. Perhaps things are done differently in Canada, but in my experience they were very arrogant. They never returned my phone calls and emails in a timely manner. They never apologized for selling me a defective stroller. Instead they said they sell quality strollers and wanted me to ship my stroller off to Canada for repairs. I don't even know if their repair center is in Canada - maybe that's in China too?!? So do yourself a favor and look for another stroller.
5.0	Love this product! Very happy with quality and pattern
5.0	Awesome product. Used it as a soft surface as my daughter started sitting up and crawling. Still planning to use is in her room as a decorative carpet.
1.0	Only had it for 6 months,  for my twin rear facing 17 month olds and chest guard clip is completely busted will not snap! I have heard dorel has had a lot of recalls on different models! I just replacing both with a better maker!
5.0	I am so in love with this stroller!! This stroller can go anywhere. It handles the rough terrain of my neighborhood with no issues whatsoever. I love the no flat tires. I love how well built and great quality this stroller is. It's my first baby jogger stroller and after 3 kids, I'm so sad I didn't have one sooner. I bought this for my third child and sold my large and clunky chicco together double stroller. I hated how hard it was to maneuver and with my second child being 4 I didn't need a double anymore. I purchased the glider board for him when he gets tired of walking and he loves his &#34;skateboard.&#34; It's a little awkward walking with him on there but doable. I did loads of research before I decided on this stroller and I'm extremely pleased with it. It glides so smooth and my little guy is so comfortable in it, he just sits back and enjoys his walks. I love the super large canopy, it provides so much protection from the sun and elements! I love the vents on the side so he can still look out. The recline is so deep and the strap recline is very easy to do. He fell asleep in the stroller the other day and I just laid him back and he slept comfortably the rest of the way home. I absolutely love the adjustable handlebar so it can be at just the right height for me, or my husband, or even my oldest who likes to occasionally push. I love the included parent organizer for keys, cell phone, and water bottles. The underneath basket isn't huge but it fits all I would ever need with 3 kids. I love the elastic sides so it's easy to get things in and out. The fold is ridiculously easy and fast. It's really very compact and lightweight for all the size(you can fit a huge kid in this thing) and performance you get out of this stroller. The Baby Gizmo review on youtube for this stroller really helped me make an informed decision!
1.0	easily get stained by juices!
5.0	There is a British version of this product but from what I can see, the Prince Lionheart version is just as convenient, if not more so as that one.  This one has a built in stand, vs. the separately sold one on the British version.  This one costs about a quarter of the other ones when you also purchase the stand.      When we initially got it, it was a little hard to do because our son was too young to keep his head up (6 weeks).  It was almost a 2 person operation plus him, holding him, washing him, etc.  He loved it from the beginning though.  I would highly recommend this product.
5.0	versatile, safe and easy to clean.  The pads and straps are easy to remove, wash and replace.  The adjusting function of this chair is very cool and is great when the baby is small.  It can be strapped onto basically any chair and voila!  you have a high chair :)  I would recommend this item.  I would buy it again.
5.0	east to turn to use other direction I like how it folds up easy doesn't take a lot of space
5.0	The bassinet: I love it! I used it as soon as we got home from the hospital up until 2 1/2 months as she started to reach the weight limit (15 pounds). The bassinet does sway just a tad when placing the baby in but not enough to wake her up.<br /><br />The changing table: Does what it was made to do plain and simple. Unclips and flips over to move out of way. I would recommend putting a blanket or something down because it does get cold and baby wont be too happy. We are still using it my daughter is now 6 months.<br /><br />The pack n play: I bought a mattress to put in the pack n play to use as a crib. It works great for now. No need to purchase a new bed that would have been WAY more expensive than the pack n play and mattress.
5.0	Buy it and you will not be disappointed.  I was having a very tough time with my curious 3 month old.  She loves to be held more for the mommy-eye-view than for the physical closeness.  Needless to say I was in pain carrying my baby around.  But not until the Bjorn came into our lives.  I was hesitant, very much.  $90 bucks for something that I can get much cheaper from other manufacturers.  Though it came highly recommended, I was afraid of having another disaster as the Evenflo carrier that I had to return.  Im not looking back now.  Its stylish to look at, comfortable to wear and you dont need someone else to help you put the baby on.  I can snap her on it in 30 seconds or less!!<BR>I feel confident that my baby and my BACK is safe. Pricey it is, but its worth every penny.  Plus its great to get chores (vacuuming, ironing) done and have a curious baby smug with all that entertainment she gets to see!
5.0	This is awesome. My 2.5 year old loves it, it's so soft, and it never falls off the bed because the end is fitted. Perfect for preventing frustration!
1.0	Looks nice, but it is not comfortable, not safe, and very much useless. We had to buy another one.
5.0	My granddaughter likes it and I guess that says it all.  She can't quite hold it yet but really likes the music.
5.0	These are cute and nice.
5.0	When you order the 'On the Go Potty' make sure you order this too so you will have extra liners, as my portable potty came with only 3 liners. I really like the pad in the bottom of each liner.
5.0	My daughter loved this so much!  We got it for her when she was 7 months old, she is 2 now and still loves the table.  It is a great investment and I highly recommend it to all parents of babies/toddlers!  I loved it so much, that I bought one for my niece who is now 5 months.  She is still a little small for it, but I am sure she will love it just as much my little girl does.
5.0	My 4 month old Granddaughter loves her Princess Sophie doll! The material crackles and the she seems to like the sound of it too.
1.0	I was very disappointed when my order arrived as I had ordered blue dummies and received pink ones instead!
5.0	We love these and buy them in every new size we need.  They are durable and an essential for a two  year old who still doesn't 'get' what blankets are for.
1.0	I bought this cup for my 19 month old son. IT LEAKS- A LOT.<br />My son got frustrated towards the end of his drink because he tipped it to sip and nothing was coming out. The demonstration given on TV said the weighted straw would solve this problem, it did not. This was a lot of money to spend for a leaky sippy cup that's just taking up shelf space now. My fault for buying into hype I guess.
5.0	So far we really love this high chair.  It's easy to assemble and relatively compact.  It rolls, which is perfect for moving baby to different areas in the room.  Baby is held securely in the chair with a 5-point harness, which was very important to me since I have a very wiggly little guy!  So far we have used it as a high chair and removed the top to bring to a friend's house and attach to a chair, both ways worked great.  It also comes with a booster seat or you can remove the top and use it a chair for when your child outgrows the high chair part.  We removed the infant insert right away and the main seat can be easily wiped down.  Also, the tray is actually 3 trays, so you can remove layers as you go.  My baby seems comfy in this high chair and is always ready to chow down!
5.0	Probably too much features but it is working perfectly. I'm very happy of this purchase and I recommand it! This monitor is rated 3rd / 10 in 2013 with versus 9 other monitors.
5.0	Just as advertised. Very happy with the purchase. Will recommend to others. Does its job like a champ. No regrets.
5.0	My baby wears me out demanding to be entertained! We borrowed this playmat from my sister when our son was six weeks old. As he grows he is more and more interested in it. At first the lights and music kept him entertained and we had to keep that going. Now he can activate the motion sensor on his own. We have added a few extra toys to it and rotate where he lays and where the toys are so he doesn't get bored. The mirror is great for tummy time. Now that he has found himself he likes to raise up and gaze into the mirror from his tummy. He'll play on it long enough for me to start supper, do some laundry or any number of other short chores. We would be lost without this toy!
5.0	It may be by Kids Preferrred, but &#34;Harley&#34; now adorns my husband's bike.  He loves showing off his biker friend, who hangs on with the help of zip ties.  &#34;Harley&#34; is well made and very appealing.
5.0	This is a favorite...  Of course she tries to drink bathwater from them so I have to watch her.  But baby loves it :-)
1.0	"This is the \\""bag of death\\"" - please look for a safer (and more comfortable) carrier than than shown here.  I can't believe this is still being sold anywhere.  Amazon is making me give 1 star to post this review but it doesn't deserve that!"
5.0	We are very happy with this rail. It is very easy to put together and it looks nice.  Highly recommended.
5.0	These are the absolute best baby gates. I did a lot of research before deciding to buy these and I'm so glad we ended up with them. We currently have two and will be buying two more to put on our deck.
5.0	This bouncer is worth every penny. I have all kinds of baby products (swings, another bouncer, FP soothing motions glider, carriers, etc) and this is the best one by far.  The different heights are just perfect for a reflux baby and it is so incredibly easy to bounce.  My fussy 8 wk old daughter almost instantly stops crying when she is bounced in here.  Because it's so easy to bounce,  it's great to use when she is having a bad night and I'm half asleep.  I know others say it works for their newborns as is, but it doesn't have any head support, so we put a boppy noggin nest in and she looks much more comfortable.  Highly recommended!
5.0	This is a beautiful night light.  We have the Camelot nursery and of course this is perfect, but I would use this in other rooms too.  Even a child's bathroom would be nice.  It is just very pleasant to look at and when children see stuff like this, it helps them not to be afraid of the dark.  On or off, this is beautiful.
5.0	Very nice, soft changing pad cover, fits 30&#34; changing pad.
5.0	As my title says, I don't own this item.  I have never seen the inside.  I got one in a different style that I loved.  My friend had a girl and said she thought this is such a cute calendar.  I'm guessing if it is anything like my gender neutral Carter's calendar, it really is neat.  I wish I had gotten this one for my daughter.  The stickers in the back do make milestones easier to chronicle and easier to keep up with.  I recommend a First Year Calendar for any mother.  You won't remember stuff.  This is a great way to ensure that those sweet little moments will always be cherished.
5.0	I bought this sweet blanket for my son on clearance as well. Even though he has a million and a half blankets, I couldn't resist, I had bought the crib set the day before b/c I disliked his current set. I absolutely fell in love with the set and when I saw the blanket I had to have it. It is the softest thing ever, AND it's perfect for a boy or girl!!!
5.0	This was the finishing touch for our child's nursery.  The colors and theme were a perfect match and the hangings are of good quality material and workmanship.
5.0	My grand baby loves his bumbo!
5.0	This hammock really stretches!! Easy to install, I did it by myself at 7 mos pregnant. It holds a lot of animals too.
5.0	Absolutely fantastic. Our daughter started using it at 5 months old and is now sleeping great. Wakes up one time during the night instead of 3 times! We've been using it now for a full month and could not be more pleased.
5.0	We have used this product since my son was 2 weeks old. He would rather play in his bouncy chair than be held most of the time. Sometimes I wonder if I'm holding him enough! He's almost 3 months old and it is still his favorite activity. He kicks and kicks and kicks and laughs when the noises respond to his kicking. He has started kicking the toys that hang down. He LOVES this bouncy chair. It is nice and sturdy and cleans up well if there's spit-up issues. Assembly is simple. The cover comes off easily for washing. It is the best shower gift I received.
5.0	Love the set. Adorable and soft. Amazing for the price!! Can't beat how much you get for how little you pay!!!
5.0	Great price,great size and it was exactlly as described. Love the pattern and colors!<br />I got this as a gift for a baby shower and it was approved by mom to be.
5.0	I love this bath,no more back pain!! Very plush baby and mom are happy with this purchase and I would recommend this to parents who have bad backs, just safely put it in a large kitchen sick but always stay by infant have towels and baby's favorite soap on had makes things a lot more easy
5.0	I really think parents should buy these with the crib! We bought this after some nice teeth marks were put in the crib. This wrap has stopped that from happening. We bought the lontwo short rail wraps too...both are good quality and look nice on the crib. (very soft and easy to wash)
5.0	Just what we wanted, thank you!
5.0	This was a great buy.  They were super cute and my baby seemed much more comfortable in her car seat.  Not sure if the taggies make any kind of difference but nonetheless definitely a nice strap cover.
5.0	Bright and colorful, my granddaughter (1 month) loves this toy and constantly tries to reach for it and talk to it.
5.0	Great transition from the bottle. Our baby loves it! Pricy but I think it was worth it.
5.0	Perfect for breast feeding!  It is thicker than the regular Boppy and has the wonderful strap that adjust around you to keep pillow from slipping.  The Flip Side of pillow is firm but softly covered for a change in infant support surface while feeding.  Now the a amazing feature...it stays in place so that you have an amazing snuggle support as you hold your little one close or want to relax with them on your lap for awhile as you watch them  sleep.  It is also perfect for grandparents who need that added support while holding the baby.
5.0	I bought this for my granddaughter...didn't want.something she would break so thought this was a great idea. I send her money in cards and she likes to hear the pennies drop in piggy!!
1.0	"This chair design is not for potty training toddlers. If you have a boy be prepared for a big mess. While potty training my grandson this chair was a \\""Royal Pain\\"". First of all the child can not sit on the toilet by himself, he needs to be lifted onto the seat, and make sure that stay by the child and hold down his wee wee or there will be pee pee every where as the splash guard is inadequate to say the least."
5.0	This is a pretty nifty toy. The pieces are all connected by a stretchy cord threaded around the outer edge and they can swivel around it. My one year old likes it and my four year old keeps playing with it as well. It's very smooth with no rough edges.
5.0	I had a fancy bathtub for my two older kids but sold it thinking that I was not going to have another baby.  This time around I am just buying the basics...this tub is perfect for our needs.  Baby was only 6.5 pounds at birth and she still sat nice in the tub without slumping over.  The tub is easy to clean and store...I stuck a removable command hook in the laundry room and hung it out of the way.
5.0	I really like this tub!  The sling is great for newborns. I just figured out yesterday that I can use it with my kitchen sink too(easy to rinse her with the sprayer).  She is four months and almost too tall for the infant part. I sit her up in the toddler part to wash her hair and then recline her back on the newborn side for the rest of her bath.
5.0	Works perfect nice and warm
5.0	wish I would bought it when my daughter was first born
5.0	The perfect tool for new parents! Expertly demonstrates all the things not to do while changing baby. 1. Positioning of a Caregiver. This device will ensure that you position yourself directly in the line of fire. Both #1 and #2 will definitely hit your clothes, and if you are lucky, your face! 2. Positioning of Baby. This device holds baby's legs together, to create maximum smear. Holding baby's legs wide apart will only mean that the poop stays in the diaper!!! This device endures spread up at least one, if not both legs!!! 3. Diapering Speed. This device is guaranteed to at least double your changing time. Not only will you have to wiggle baby's feet into this thing while it's attempting to crawl away- you have to take it off before you can take on or off their pants. 4. Breast Pain. All new mums should experience the maximum amount of pain. Not only are your breasts sore from bad latch p, cracking and that bout if thrush, now, with this amazing device, you can get your baby to accurately and repeatedly kick you in the breast. Especially good when baby is crying, and you're already leaking!
5.0	The material is so soft and comfortable for me and my newborn. It took a tiny bit of practice to get the hang of getting it on but now, I use this wrap every day. Yesterday my baby got her first shots and was cranky all day and so she lived in this wrap. I could hold her close so she felt content while I was able to take care of my other 2 kids as well. This wrap is worth every penny!
5.0	Bought this bank for my granddaughter's first birthday.  It's darling, and I'm sure she will treasure it as she grows older.  It has such a sweet expression on it's face--just as my granddaughter has!
5.0	I currently rent a small single family home with a side yard that is also small, but big enough for my toddler to play in.  However, the yard isn't enclosed, and my toddler likes to wander off.  I was delighted to find the KidKusion Play Safe Fence, because it is the perfect solution to my problem.  It is made of material that will hold up outdoors, and has stakes that go into the ground to keep the fence in place.  Also, you aren't limited to making a hexagon like in the company's picture.  If you want a straight fence or a fence that is a combination of different angles, you can do that, too!  I used the fence to make a semicircle that extended from my house to my neighbor's permanent fence.<br /><br />I installed the fence this afternoon.  I'm pretty out of shape, but I installed the fence by myself with a mallet and a block of wood (the tools recommended by the instructions).  I also used a tape measure to map out where I wanted the stakes to go before I put them in the ground.  I took my toddler out to the yard and the fence did exactly what it was supposed to do.  I'm looking forward to a great spring and summer playing out in our yard.
5.0	These worked well keeping my shirt pulled down over my very pregnant belly. Dont leave home without them. I guess a person couold come up with something on their own to do the same thing but why mess with it when these work so well and are not too expensive.
5.0	I bought letters for my son's room and I was so happy with these!  The color is true to the description.  Excellent quality and easy to hang!
5.0	This is an awesome product its going to be great for the baby when he's a little older and makes a great decoration piece for the room!!!
5.0	I purchased 2 of them for our 13 month old bad we love them. We easily installed one in each car. It looks and feel safe and sturdy. Our baby carrier was a Graco so we trust the brand.
1.0	Doesn't fit the handle on the bob Revolution Flex Duallie, the velcro straps aren't long enough.
5.0	This was a gift. It is so adorable
5.0	I think the wiper warmer works great.  The wipes are warm, not hot like you might get on an airplane or restaurant but just a slightly above room temperature.     You just add water to the top of the wipes and they stay moist. I haven't found them to be dried out as some other reviewers may have mentioned.      When your hands are cold, it's nice to have a warm wipe to clean up baby.
5.0	These work great, light weight and easy to use. I live in a small house and the signal stays clear throughout the whole house.
5.0	After doing a fair amount of research on bidet/shattafs and diaper sprayers I settled on this one. It is excellent both as a bidet and a diaper sprayer. The entire thing is sturdy metal construction. The sprayer nozzle in particular is excellent quality. I can't foresee this breaking any time soon. There was a slight manufacturing error as can be expected with a new product, and this is where the sellers, Shiny Happy Shop really set themselves apart. THEY contacted me almost as soon as I had received the sprayer to let me know about the defect and to send me a replacement nozzle, which arrived within a day and a half. I can't think of a better example of customer service. I recommend this diaper sprayer and I definitely recommend Buying from this seller, Shiny Happy Shop.
5.0	Easy to install and a great mirror.  We bought a couple of different ones and this one is working the best. It is great because our middle seat does not have the head rest, but we can put this one on the side head rest and still see our little one really well.
5.0	Love it. Worth every penny
5.0	We have a slate hearth and the Kushion is very effective at covering the edge hazards, has stuck perfectly well so far (installed for about 2 months), and doesn't look bad either.  I'm very happy with it so far!  Also, it shipped quickly from Amazon, so no problems there, either. I recommend it!
5.0	perfect diaper bag!  such a pretty color, quality is excellent.  out of all the baby things i had to decide on, picking a bag actually took me awhile.  i had originally purchased another bag from somewhere else and returned it.  no regrets on this one!
5.0	We appreciated this easy-to-assemble product, which took one person<br /><br />less than half an hour to put together. It is very versatile and can be used for a girl or a boy. We liked the nightlight rdature, which offered a handy way to keep baby's sleeping area gently lit. The soothing lullabies, nature sounds and vibrations helped to lull my little one to sleep. I could rock my son back to sleep not only without getting up,<br /><br />but even without as much as lifting my head from the pillow. And when I wanted to get some more uninterrupted sleep in the morning, my husband was able to take him in the Portable Sleeper to another room.<br /><br />This sleeping system is one of the best available on the market today.<br /><br />It's worth every penny spent!
5.0	extremely cute and useful, never had a problem or any accidents, my two year old still plays with the tray toy lol
5.0	My son was a strict swing-napper, and used this at night for a couple weeks. Then one day, he just decided he was done with the swing and would rather crib nap with his sleepy suit. Totally worth the money- I'd buy this again.
5.0	I loved it! Great for new born baby prof pictures and I also used it for my diaper cake!
1.0	I had a completely difference experience with this sheet compared to the other reviewers. Not sure if I received a bad item, but mine looked like it was amateurly made. The seams were all tattered and unfinished, the threads were coming out, the elastic band was not even enclosed and completely visible, and the edges of the sheet were raw and threads unraveling. I'm returning.
5.0	My son has done great with his Munchkin mighty grip straw cups but recently he has figure out how to punch down the silicone top and get it inside the cup lol (leaving the cup ready for a mighty spill). So my husband and I decided to get a straw cup that has a hard top but just the straw to be silicone. We got a Nuby flip and sip one with handles but it can get expensive to find and order the straws that only come with another hard top. Putting the straw back in after cleaning is very annoying and liquid comes up the straw sometimes. When we saw the Playtex twist and click one we were drawn to it. Replacement straws are easy to find and come in a pack of 3 for under $4.00. Also we liked the design and the top is not easy to take off for  a child :). So far we have not had any leak problems. Our son has no problem getting liquid through the straw and tries to hold it with one hand. Love this product. I also recommend not to clean any sippy cups in the dishwasher, but by hand.
5.0	We loved these so much with out wee one, we bought a pair for my three friends with babies.  They work so much better than your teeth (my sister's suggestion), but they don't cut the baby's skin like the clippers.  Just his nails. :)
5.0	My 2 year old was constantly opening the fridge and then we bought these. The literally saved me a bunch of headaches. I had to use both because somehow my tiny 2 year old has the strength of the Incredible Hulk when he wants in the fridge.
5.0	As a new mom, moving around on my own with baby, baby bag and sometimes umbrella with car keys and cell phone readily accessible proved to be a bit challenging. On my best day I looked a bit clumsy especially when baby was very small and needed to be cradled with two hands due to lack of head control.<br />I wanted  a wrap that would look cute and feminine (i.e. to say not one of those active sporty carrier/backpack types) but will also allow me to move around easily and with elegance.<br />I initially purchased ANOTHER wrap and while I won't call it out by name, I will just say that it was literally a wrap - large piece of cloth that wrapped both me and baby. Learning to use that wrap was a science all in itself! And moments after successfully securing the baby in the wrap I found myself taking it off because LO and I were HOT!<br />That wrap was not ideal for my tropical climate at all despite how cute or secure it was!<br /><br />Then I found the Maya wrap. It had the look - cute and elegant - check!<br />As for ease of use - well I was able to put it on and put baby in it - straight out of the box! So check! (Now of course I read the instructions but really and truly the wrap was intuitive to use to me at least).<br />And now how did it fare in the tropics - well the fabric is very breathable and with the appropriate amount of clothing on me and baby, we were both very comfortable. I can see this working for colder climates too - just garb baby and yourself appropriately, and remember that body heat also factors in.<br />As for security - oh yeah - check! Not only does it feel secure but the instructions give you a little test to do to verify that baby is secure (involves bending over a bed - baby should not move or hang down)<br />LO loves being snuggled close to mommy and now when I walk into the pediatrician's office I stride with confidence. Baby in wrap, bag on opposite shoulder, car keys and cell phone readily accessible in wrap's zippered pocket to the front of me and head held high! No &#34;first time mommy&#34; label stuck on my forehead!
5.0	This bag fits the first years booster seat very well and helped us to keep our baggage more neater.  I think if you are just a casual traveler than this bag will do.  The material is sort of light weight and I think won't hold up to constant use, but luckily we only travel a few times a year and once the kids grow up we won't need it anymore.
5.0	Quality product. Not to mention, they noticed I'm military and wrote themselves &#34;Noticed your APO address. Thank you for serving in our military!&#34; Awesome to see someone stop and actually care from a company!
5.0	These are awesome! Ship time was fast!
5.0	daughter has three biys and uses this gift at their games and for their picnics. They love the mat. It is used often.
1.0	THESE PEEL AND STICK WALL DECALS, THOUGH CUTE, DID NOT STICK TO MY WALL.  MY ORDINARY, FLAT- PAINTED, EVERY- DAY WALL.
5.0	The blue light from this turtle is so pretty!!!  I love it for myself and the baby seems to like it too.  It makes the room look like you are underwater.  The light is nice and low.  When my 5 wk old starts stirring, I can reach over in the dark and press the button to turn on the light so we can both wake up for the feeding.  It has an option for ocean sounds or music.  Both are relaxing.  I normally sleep in silence and hate background noise, such as a tv, but since having a baby...I've had to make a lot of compromises.  lol<br />This is one I don't mind.  I even plan to buy another one, just in case this one ever breaks and they stop making them.  I think it makes such great soothing light.  I really don't like battery operated items because batteries are so bad for the environment if tossed.  I always end up saving them to be recycled and never find time to ship them or drop them off.  I would rather be able to charge up the unit, but other than that, it's perfect.
5.0	Exactly what I was looking for!
5.0	We purchased this monitor when our son was about 6 weeks old when he started sleeping in the crib in his room. My husband called me crazy but I was finally able to sleep peacefully at night knowing that if for some reason our son would stop breathing that I would know almost immediately.  I cannot tell you how much peace of mind this monitor gave me!  Instead of periodically going in to check if our son was still breathing, (what new parent doesn't do this?) I was able to sleep for a few hours at a time until it was time for the next feeding.  The quality of the sound monitor is very high, better than a stand alone sound monitor that we received as a gift and we found the monitor very easy to set up.  We did have to purchase a thin piece of plywood at Lowe's on which to set the sensor board as it cannot rest solely on the crib springs.  We only had two false alarms and both occured when our son was able to roll and scoot over in his bed off of the sensor board. This is money well spent and I highly recommend it for every new parent.
5.0	Fits well, seems like it will work great.
1.0	I put them on and allowed the adhesive 2 full days to set, and the very first time someone touch one of them it came off. I'm very dissapointed.
5.0	Beautiful, and just like the photo. I am going to replace crochet flowers with more elegant flowers to match the high quality of the peacock cloak. Can't wait to photograph baby this weekend! THanks for the great price too and fast delivery!
5.0	Love this product for the recipient of this gift because it is sentimental in memory of a person who has passed away!!
5.0	Easy to put together. Works great.
5.0	My 5 month grandson's favorite teether!  The grip is easy for him to hold, he likes the squishiness of the ends and he likes the sounds the little beads make. It's not a good day when we can't find this teether!
5.0	MY SON HAS TORTICOLLIS (A MINOR HEAD TILT) & THIS PRODUCT WAS RECOMMENED BY HIS PHYSICAL THERAPIST. IT IS GREAT FOR CAR RIDES OR IF HE NAPS IN THE STROLLER SO HIS NECK HAS SUPPORT. I LOVE IT & IT HELPS.
5.0	My son loves his pillow! The fact that it's made in the USA made my decision an easy one!
5.0	Pretty, perfect for car seat or toy. There are pictures on the back of each &#34;feather&#34; as well. (A little mirror, a rubbery chew, pictures of real things in the same colors as the fabrics. VERY STURDY.
5.0	These work really well to secure a toy onto something (a bouncer, high chair, etc.) and are very strong.  I have bunches of them.
5.0	"I love this unique pop-up baby book!  I bought it as a gift for new parents.  It's colorful and gorgeous, and makes a special keepsake for baby and family.  The pop-ups are beautifully done and there's plenty of space for lots of baby photos.  It's appropriate for both boys and girls. I had given one as a gift to new parents a few years ago and they loved it, so I'm back for another one. In fact, it has become my \\""go-to\\"" new baby gift!  Another plus is that it comes in a beautiful, sturdy box that is color coordinated with the book.  Highly recommend!"
5.0	Product arrived on its due date and is quality made. I look forward to using it.
1.0	Our other Summer Monitor was starting to crash (i've bought two replacement parts in the last two years) so I bought this one with high expectations.  To summarize, I'm very disappointed.  The picture quality at night is horrible.  If you like watching your baby in slow motion this monitor's for you.  Also, the receiver completely died after two days of use.  Tried everything to get it to work.  Tried a different outlet.  Checked the battery to make sure it was secure.  Nothing.  Just dead.  I'm taking it back today.
5.0	We had similar car seat for our first child few years back (different neutral colors), and there were no questions what car seat we should buy for our second child.<br />There are many different car seats on the market, and I prefer Graco with GracoPedic foam under the cover. It's softer and if you compare regular Graco car seat with this one you will feel the difference immediately. It's much softer, and you don't have a feeling that your newborn baby is laying on hard plastic itself.<br />The weight limit is not a concern for us. We moved our first one from infant car seat when he was about 20 lbs and 6 months old since it was to heavy for me to carry around (I had blisters on my hands!). I honestly don't know how women can carry their babies in car seats with 35 lb limits... Maybe they leave car seat in the car and just carry baby.<br /><br />For this particular model I hate the material. It shows signs of ware fast. I wish the material was different - not so easy to scratch.<br /><br />I recommend Graco car seats with GracoPedic labels but not the ones without this label. It's the best infant car seat on the market!
5.0	I give it for every baby shower I attend. It's a remarkable little device that works wonders on every kid.  Fits in a diaper bag, car seat or on the changing table. Yes!
5.0	Very soft and exactly as pictured.  This item fit perfectly with the monkey theme for a baby girl.  Couldn't be more pleased.
5.0	For some reason, the &#34;grass&#34; I got is yellowish green. I don't know why. Everyone else I know who has one has really, really green grass.<br /><br />But that really doesn't matter. It still works the same way. It's a good way to hold baby bottles, bottle caps, nipples, sippy cups, pump parts, etc. We usually use ours after items have been washed, but before they get sanitized. The grass and the tray underneath don't get dirty much because we only put clean items on it, but it's also very easy to clean. Just a quick soap and rinse.<br /><br />We can get 12-14 bottles and lids on it. I'm sure it can fit more, but we're not very deliberate about lining up everything to conserve space. After all, we sanitize at least once per day.<br /><br />I'm sure it's just as easy to use a regular dishrack based on how we use this, but the &#34;grass&#34; keeps us from mixing our things with Baby's things.<br /><br />Hope your grass is greener... =)
5.0	I have long hated the traditional pack and play designs and was thrilled to see one that was so stylish. We were in the market for a lightweight easy-to-setup travel crib and were considering this, the gocrib, P&T's yet to be released traveler v3 crib and 4moms. Weight wise, the P&T wins at 7lbs and 4moms loses. Ease-of-setup goes to 4moms but the weight is hefty. I read the instruction manual for P&T's new crib and it looks like the set up is not as easy as it seems. That being said, I was willing to give it a try except it wouldnt be released until April.<br /><br />We received the Lotus three days ago. Set up was incredibly easy. The hardest part was trying to get the safety velcro tabs through the mattress. I would recommend that you sew on some longer strips to feed it through better. I'd expect to get really good at doing this though. The mattress was not completely flat when opened but we left some heavy weight pillows on it overnight and it straightened out! The size looks just fantastic in our living room, not too big and not too small.<br /><br />The best part - our DD took her nap in it with no problems! I LOVE the side open door so I can lie next to her and soothe her if needed. It was also much easier to sit down and put her in so i could take some time settling her instead of reaching over the crib. Love that feature so much! The zipper is a little bit noisy but I don't think there's anyway to get around it.<br /><br />Customer service is FANTASTIC. I thought one of the straps was inverted and I emailed to make a complaint. They replied within an hour in the middle of the night and said they would send me a replacement cover immediately. Turns out I could have easily flipped the flap myself so they didn't have to ship me one. Still, I was super impressed with customer service and truly feel like part of the guava family.<br /><br />Totally worth the $199. We're gonna be taking lots of naps in this.
1.0	My three year old nephew opened his 200 balls and then went to open the play pen and it was covered in blood.  Not sure where this product is made or comes from but something really disgusting must have happened at that location.  Then it was shipped out for children to play with.
5.0	I got this for my baby's 1st bday.  She loves it its soft all over, I like the fabric of the hair. I bought the pink one
5.0	I don't know why the Baby Bjorn soft bib isn't the most popular bib everywhere.  For the learning eater, it's the most practical thing I've seen.  Before this I thought the ideal bib would be a kind of all-body plastic poncho, but this bib does one better.  The simple, amply sized pocket gets most food that gets dropped, so if you've kept it clean as the baby's plate, dropped food doesn't need to be wasted.    We got a yellow one and a red one, and our toddler likes to have the choice of colors.    There are a couple things that could be better.  The bib's nice big size is a little awkward with our high chair arrangement.  On the one hand, the bib is a little too big to fit comfortably between the baby's chest and the edge of the high chair tray, so it digs into the baby's chest a little bit.  On the other hand, if you rest it on the tray, the food is necessarily just a little further away which makes eating awkward.    This may just be an issue with our high chair. It doesn't seem to be a problem but both things led to some early on fussiness.  With a booster seat it should be no problem at all.    The other thing is that with a child with long enough hair, you need to very carefully hold the hair away while you snap the neck strap into place, otherwise you can pinch and pull just a few stray hairs which is painful.    But overall, we're so much happier with this bib than our previous favorite, a generously big cloth bib that needed washing after most meals.  I wouldn't hesitate to recommend getting one or two and giving one of these as a baby shower present.
5.0	"This product is everything it was advertised to be. Was not shipped when we were expecting it to be but arrived shortly after. My daughter and her husband had no problem putting it together. Baby has already taken a stroll in her new \\"" Ferrari\\""...."
5.0	This chair is very comfortable and sturdy. I didn't seem to take my husband long to put it together and there was limited cursing!!! The chair and the ottoman glide smoothly. A very good purchase.
5.0	Fits six bottles and a bunch of miscellaneous pieces.  I also put breast pump parts in here.  Much easier than boiling everything which I couldn't be bothered to do more than once so this really helped.  It's kinda large so it doesn't fit in my (I guess) smaller than average microwave and takes a bit longer to sterilize objects (5 mins but it's all in the instructions).
5.0	As a first time mom, I knew I wanted to breastfeed, but I was unprepared for how hard it would be.  My daughter struggled to latch on to one of my breasts, and after consulting a lactation specialist, I was told that I had a flat nipple.  She recommended the nipple shield but warned me that it should only be used temporarily, and that it may decrease my milk supply.  I really wanted to breastfeed, so I decided to give the nipple shield a try.   It was a miracle!  My daughter latched on with no problems, and she ate fine (2-3 ounces each feeding).  I wanted my daughter to eventually take to the flat nipple, but decided that I would use the nipple shield for as long as I needed.  I pumped after each feeding to protect my milk supply, and after 6 weeks of using the shield and pumping, she finally latched on to my flat nipple.  As for my milk supply - it's fine and I am now researching ways to actually reduce it.  Buy this product - it works!
5.0	These are so great for storing pumped milk!  I pump enough so that hubby can feed baby a couple of bottles each day and these bottle caps help me keep the milk super organized in the fridge.  I haven't had a problem with leaks- they screw on really tight and I've used them to transport milk from one destination to another.  A MUST for mother's that pump!
5.0	"These are for the 2 yr old grand-daughter and they are so cute. She loves all things \\""tu tu\\"" and so they are perfect,it's like having tu-tus at both feet. Great for going to and from ballet class in chilly weather."
5.0	Item came as expected. Item as described. I do not use it. Totally useless thing. Why bumpers even needed. But if totally determined to use bumper this is best one to buy because it was cheap and at least I do not feel too bad that wasted money.
5.0	This hooded towel is super soft and a great size to wrap up little ones in after a bath, shower, beach or even pool day! My daughter loves it!
5.0	I got this for a friend as a gift. It is EXACTLY what she was looking for. She has kids in and out of her sedan car and was constantly cleaning stuff from all of the place. She is so happy she has this to keep her car organized and control the chaos with transportation of kids. THANK YOU!
5.0	fits the theme of the Nursery
5.0	Great customer service. I received the wrong color and they were kind enough to ship the right ones to me without any additional cost and allowed me to keep the other ones. Very much appreciated. And the bibs work great for feeding my son. I'm very pleased. :) thanks.
5.0	I love that it is a one piece,  makes it so much easier to clean, set up, etc. Works perfect with Medela advanced.
5.0	Excellent way of potty training your little one especially if they love thomas
5.0	Well, the boy loves the crinkly ones, could give a care less about the others. So all in all a 50% passing rate, which is considered an A+ in today's education system. So 5 stars.
5.0	Love these!! Came so fast and don't leak at all.
5.0	I am very conscious of heating plastics and avoid it at all costs.  My son's preschool does heat up food but does not allow glass, which has left me in a bind.  I bought these for that reason and to feel safe putting them in the dishwasher.<br /><br />I love them!  So does my 4 year old.  These bigger sized ones are a must for a full meal size like pasta etc.  I bought the smaller ones for side items and the bowls too in preparation for baby #2 so they can go in the dishwasher safely.<br /><br />I wish they made other shapes and sizes etc.<br /><br />The only negative thing is the water spots that show up after washing in the dishwasher.  A wet rag will rub them off if it bothers you, sometimes I do that, it's not remotely bad enough to not buy them.<br /><br />They are not cheap, but they seem to be the only silicone and heat safe items I feel good about using so worth it to me.
5.0	Wonderful quality. Very beautiful piece of furniture.
5.0	I personally didn't find it that difficult to put together, but only because I knew the screws were cheap and that parts didn't always fit.  If a screw is too big, you just have to try another, they are not all exactly the same size.  And don't use a power screwdriver, just go slow and apply pressure and you won't strip the screws.  As for parts not fitting, I left all the screws a little loose until the very end and then tightened them all, that works great.  And I used a sharp ended phillips for the wood screws and a flat ended phillips for the machine screws - that helped a lot.  With all that I was able to put it together in under two hours and it looks good, nothing sticks out, and nothing broke.
5.0	I see that these Dr. Weil bottles have received a number of negative reviews, so I thought that I should mention my experience with them. I love these bottles. We use the glass ones. We've used both the small and the large 9oz size. We don't have a problem with these leaking and they are easy to clean. I love that they are glass. They are durable, very stylish and our baby likes to drink from them! We have used them for 7 months with no problems. I would definitely recommend.
5.0	It's the cutiest room in my house with these decals
5.0	Bit pricey but a good mat for a baby to crawl around
5.0	Amazing crib! We spend 2 months traveling and country hopping with our then 18 month old. This crib is amazing! You can carry it like a backpack and take it as a carry on in a plane (great if you have long layover between flights and need a place to let baby play in the airport). Very easy assemble and light. The matress that comes with it is not very thick, but we would ask the hotels for a thick blanket or 3 pillows and a sheet and make him a soft place to sleep on.
5.0	We bought this for our daughter and son to store all the   books they have collected for the past four yrs. This is   a great value and the wood is quite sturdy. It took   my husband about two hrs to put together but it was well worth it.   We were very impressed with the fast, and I mean fast   delivery less than 5 days. There is plenty of space for   all shapes and sizes of books. I will definitely order online   again. Thanks.
5.0	Good quality diapers, haven't had any problems
1.0	It doesn't work for my babe. I thought it would help him want to nurse and be more like a Breast but it just isn't. I was so hopeful this would be amazing and for so long I tried and believed it would work and be easier to feed him with bottle but it didn't. :-(
5.0	Even right out of the package these blankets are super soft. They are breathable too so they keep my toddler just the right temperature in the summer or winter.
5.0	Works like a charm.  My son loves it!!!!!!!
5.0	These cards are exquisite.  They are much more beautiful than I expected from their picture on Amazon.  I can't wait to use these cards!
5.0	Used it as an Easter &#34;basket&#34; for my one-year-old daughter. It now serves as her family room toy box. Much more functional than an actual basket!
1.0	It's broken when arrived and I could have enough time to claim before use because I leave aboard US.
5.0	Love these. I bought 2 of the smaller lovies for my son when he was a newborn. He never really got into them and he still isn't into them. I purchased him this blanket as his daycare napping blanket. I didn't think he'd ever really love it. He started using it at about 17 months of age. He's now 18 months and he LOVES it. He loves it so much I bought another to keep at home. The daycare teachers also tell us that it calms him down when he's upset. I thought he would only take to a lovey after being with something a long time, but it wasn't the case for us.  I just bought the matching pillow, and my son took to it right away. Sleeps with the pillow every night at home now! He loves rubbing his face on both the blanket and pillow, and both are so soft.  I didn't even read the washing instructions but i just throw it in the cold cycle and dryer on low/med and it stays soft.
5.0	I use these everyday for my son's lunch at daycare. I love the generous size of these and how they seal shut. I've never had staining issues either. This is a great product!
5.0	"Our newest grandson is named \\""George\\"" so of course all things dragon are his theme. We had to return the first one which had a faulty music component  (did not play a tune and the dragon popped out randomly). The return policy was easy and swift. Our new one arrived within a week and works beautifully! Quite the novelty \\""jack-in-the-box\\""!  One note - after the dragon pops out, it is necessary to give the crank an extra turn to move the locking device back into its correct position to close the lid and reset. Very happy with this purchase."
5.0	No metal to damage teeth.<br />Cute, light weight, not sharp or pointy. Easy for a toddler to use. And durable.
5.0	I love love love this diaper bag, it is adorable, functionality is great, magnetic clip on front works perfectly!, it's washable, it fits perfectly on my Jeep stroller, it's easy to carry, and real men love to wear pink!, so proud daddy loves carrying his little baby's bag! It came with a great changing pad, and a clear zipper pouch that I can store things it,
1.0	It is indeed very slippery.  My daughter kept getting her feet stuck under the bar.  I got this as a shower gift.  I do not recommend it at all.
1.0	Bought this for Potty Training prep. for my 2 1/2 year old. It is very difficult (for me, an adult...impossible for a toddler) to get the water  from the bottle into the baby. What little water I was able to coerce into her, filled up her leg cavity or leaked out of the seams of her legs. I am returning. Waste of time and money. Junk!
5.0	These OsoCozy prefolds hold a LOT of moisture and keep baby's skin dry.  As recommended by another reviewer, I use them in conjunction with Thirsties diaper covers and Snappi diaper fasteners.  This is my first time going all the way with cloth diapers-- I used gDiapers with a flushable insert for my first child, but I like this MUCH better.  There are fewer incidents (blowouts, leaks, etc.), for one thing, and I'm not as stingy with changes (the only cost is laundry).  I bought 24 of these prefolds (the small size prefolds work great for my ten-pounder), one pack of Snappi diaper fasteners, and 6 Thirsties diaper covers (size 1), and that's all been quite sufficient for newborn use.  I was even able to use them with ease before the umbilical cord fell off.  I use a newspaper fold, as demonstrated in the YouTube video &#34;How to fold a prefold cloth diaper.&#34;  Cloth diapering was a bit intimidating for me, and I used disposable diapers for a few days until my baby was done passing meconium (I heard it's hard to clean out), but I will not be going back to disposable!<br /><br />Fot cleaning, I recommend a hot cleaning cycle book-ended by two warm rinse cycles.  I also spray the poop off into the toilet before throwing the prefolds into the washer.  Actually, I use the shower massager and spray into the unlined diaper pail for transfer to the toilet (I live in Europe, so the toilet sprayers will not hook up to my plumbing).  So far, there has been no staining!
5.0	Great design, very sturdy
5.0	I was hesitant at first considering the price compared to the leading brands of pocket diapers but decided to go for this package. I am glad I didn't spend the extra money for the other diapers. I do have other higher priced diapers that I also like but what you get with this you can't beat. Looking back the only thing I might change is getting the single insert package because I like to use one of these inserts combined with a hemp or other type insert especially at night. I think this is a great starter kit for anyone looking to get into cloth diapers. I started cloth diapers later with my son when he was 18 months. So I am not sure how they work/fit for newborns but I will use these for the next child and see then. I have had only a few leaks with these and most of them happened at night when I was trying to figure the best night time method.  I would recommend these to friends and will purchase more in the future.
5.0	Perfect in our little girls bathroom.
5.0	As my daughter began to outgrow her Britax Roundabout at 2 1/2 years old, I began debating between the Britax Regent, Marathon, and Boulevard.  Although the Regent is perfect for my tall 5 year old son, I opted for the Boulevard for my much more petite daughter.  I am very pleased with my decision, as it keeps her higher and wraps her in side impact protection.  Despite her small frame, she is thoroughly secured with the head wings and lots of cushioning.  Furthermore, the straps and headrest are always at exactly the right height, as they are adjusted with the twist of a knob--no more rethreading!!  (This is an especially useful feature if the seat will be shared by more than one child.)  My daughter is currently 3 years old and will easily get another two years out of this seat.  That being said, a larger child--specifically one with large thighs, will not fit as comfortably, as the crotch strap is short and the seat is not very deep.  However, for a lean child, this fit is necessary so that the belts stay close to the thighs and provide a secure fit.  The fabric cleans easily with a damp cloth.  However, for deep cleaning it is slightly more tricky to remove the cover due to the headwings--make sure to use caution so that the styrofoam does not get broken in the process.  This is a very minor complaint, as the safety benefits far outweigh the minor inconvenience.  In conclusion, I highly recommend this awesome seat--this may very well be the only seat you will need, as its weight range is 5-65 lbs!  However, if you are purchasing it for an older toddler, try to have your child try one out first to determine comfort and grow room!
5.0	the best gym for babies! The box was not good for a present
5.0	I almost rated this stroller 4/5 stars because of the price and the cost of accessories but the reality is, I love this stroller.  I have owned 3 other strollers and the city mini single and double that I have recently purchased are so much better than the rest I have owned.  The fold and lightweight are amazing and it is so easy to steer and push.  Plus, I love the color.  Our double stroller is the GT model and I like that even better.  The adjustable handle is the best!
5.0	The crib came very fast and in perfect condition. It was easy to put together and looks just like the picture. Now we are just waiting for our bundle of joy to arrive to use it! I would recommend it to others.
5.0	I purchased the more expensive Evenflo ProComfort Symphony DLX Convertible Car Seat my car and purchased this as a secondary car seat for my husbands car because our child rarely rides in it. This thing is not a caddilac of car seats but it does a GREAT job of securing your child and has a fantastic safety rating (trust me I checked about 1000 for safety rating). My son is tall for a one year old but still is able to sit rear facing inside the guidelines as well as comfortably. This model has just enough padding and is a great option if your child is going to sit in a middle seat. I would recommend one with more side impact proctection. Our other evenflo seat has more padding around the head for side impact crashes. This seat is a GREAT value for the money. It's a fantastic seat as a secondary seat. This seat is easy to install however you will still have to have some strong to help you tighten it for some reason I am unable to do this myself to my satisfaction. The harness straps are easy to tighten and loose even when the child is rear facing.
5.0	Since my sons birth all we've used Avent by Phillips products excellent and durable.<br />Never fails.
5.0	Very nice,good quality as described!
1.0	I own many brands of wipes.  (GMD, Kissaluv, Babykicks, Charlie Banana, and some from Etsy.)  I've owned these for around 7 months, and they are the only ones that are wearing out.  It's disappointing since some of my wipes I've been using for nearly 2 years.  The edges are so frayed, it's terrible.  They are also the only wipes I own that will stick to velcro in the wash.  (If you're wondering - I don't usually use my velcro dipes - so that's not the sole reason for them wearing out.)  They aren't nearly as soft as my others and aren't particularly good at cleaning up messes in comparison to the others.  I liked the fact that they don't curl in the wash - but then again, my other wipes didn't curl either. . . with the exception of the Kissaluvs.  I wish I hadn't wasted my money on them.
5.0	Initially saw that the daycare had this kind of kiddie toilet seat and noticed an ease of use when my daughter had to go to the potty.  It's on the pricier side than say the Dora or Sesame Street types you can find at Target, but I found it more secure and comfortable for my daughter than those ones.  It fits snug on the toilet so I'm not worried about it shifting around when my kid tries to sit on top of it (which was an issue with the Dora/Sesame Street type I previously purchased.)  Another plus - the thing is easy to clean!  I'm planning to get a second one for a different bathroom.
5.0	I had difficulties to find a good mattress for my baby,too many mattress,too many bad or good reviews,I spent a lot of time reading the reviews and I have decided to buy this one,wasn't sure but I needed to choose one.it has been 4 months and so far so good.my baby sleeps very well ,it is not soft,not hard.i am  happy about this mattress .
5.0	Still using these 9 months later. Have held up well. Good size towel and I like that it has a hood
5.0	I received this stroller along with the Graco carseat that went with it at my baby shower. At first I thought it was pretty flimsy, but this stroller quickly became my favorite one I've ever had. It was lightweight, which ended up being a life saver, since I had a c-section and it was extremely easy to maneuver, even one handed. The handles were also great when shopping! You cutoff loop bags right in the handles easily!
5.0	After my first pregnancy plagued me with many sleepless nights, and achy hips and backs, I decided I needed to try a body pillow, despite my hesitancy to fork out 50 bucks for a pillow.  But I am SO glad I splurged.  I began using this in my first trimester, and slept like a baby right up through delivery.  I never had a problem with achy hips or back and was always comfortable, despite gaining more weight with this pregnancy too!  The pillow is big though, and might make your sleeping partner uncomfortable if you have a small bed, but for my california king, there was still room for my 1 year old to sleep with us too! :)  If you value comfort and high quality sleep despite all the discomforts of pregnancy, I highly recommend this body pillow.
5.0	Bought a safety 1st first and it was just a waste of money!!<br />This works extremely well. Absolutely no hazard, no danger for babies...Parents MUST buy this!!
5.0	My daughter loves this product and she is very happy with it. She recommends it to all the excepting mothers out there.
5.0	This may just be the cutest lunch box ever. My 3 year old loves unicorns and the color pink... we were picking out a lunch box for her first year of preschool and she pretty much demanded a pink unicorn one - this fit the bill perfectly! A bit pricey, but we had an Amazon gift card from her birthday. Totally worth it - took a bit to ship, since it's from overseas but it's crazy cute and is a nice size. Perfectly fits a large Lunchbots Bento and a small Klean Kanteen water bottle.
5.0	My two month old has reflux and wants to suck all the time but not on binkies...  To save myself the pain of being his binky I have been trying everything and these work the best!
1.0	Too small,  does not fit a toddler 's head.
5.0	My 7-month-old loves this toy. It is a great sensory developmental toy and teaches textures and colors all at once. We hang it up in the car and take it along in the stroller.
1.0	Didnt fit my cabinets. Good thing I only bought one to make sure it worked first. DO NOT BUY THESE!
5.0	The gloves are prefect and stay on his hands. To prevent shrinkage, make sure to hang dry the gloves.would recommend to anyone.
1.0	it's not sturdy, my 19 month old fell 3 times within few minutes of trying to push it around.I took it away. I don't think it's safe.
5.0	I don't have any other milk-storage-bag-experiences to compare these to because I've really been happy with them.  I've been using them for about four months and haven't had any trouble with spills or leaks.  I like that they're biodegradable, although I haven't tested any in the compost pile yet.
5.0	I will keep this short and sweet - this is the best toy I have ever gotten for my child.  She loves this Activity Center and will play in it for over an hour at a time.  She cries when we try and take her out of it!  She is taller than the average child her age (5m) so the lowest setting is perfect for her right now, but she will be able to use this for quiet some time!
1.0	I had such high hopes for these bottles and warmers.  For the price, I would expect these bottles and warmers to be the greatest ever.  Not so.  The bottles leak terribly.  I watched the youtube video many times to try and make sure I put the bottles correctly, which I thought I did, but they leak terribly.  On top of that, the warmer only worked once.  The second time, it simply did not work.  Now, a month and a half later, the bubble on the bottom, which pops out when it is ready to be warmed is still halfway popped out, the color of the indicator is still halfway blue and while there is no clicking when it is shaken, there is a noise that sounds like sand rustling around inside.  I have no idea what happened, but it is broken.  Many bottle warmers that plug in are cheaper than these single bottle warmers and I have since discarded my overly expensive Yoomi bottles for Dr. Browns.
5.0	very very cute. have started to fill it up.
5.0	This was the first toy my little girl could begin to play with as she was learning to grasp.  She loves it.  Well worth the money!
5.0	I bought this to use on a Gen7 pet stroller, which has a shallow molded plastic organizer attached to the stroller.  This stroller organizer fits the pet stroller perfectly and is very functional for daily walks, dog therapy events, and all day outings.  The deep insulated pockets keep water bottles cool and it has great storage for food/treat supplies, and poop bags. Then we tried it on my husband's  mobility scooter  which came with a  wire basket in front of the handle bars. Travel items and drinks alway get jumbled  together in the wire basket. This organizer fits perfectly on his mobility scooter as well and will keep travel supplies neatly organized and easily accessable.  When the scooter has to be left outside restaurants or shops, the zip off bag will be used to take valuables with us.  I am planning to buy another one because I don't want to take it off the pet stroller.
5.0	Love this diaper bag. Nice and roomy. Fits everything I need it too. Easy to clean. Love the diaper wipe holder.
5.0	My freezer was a mess until I came across this product via youtube. I highly recommend. Each try can hold about 20 bags. My bags usualky contain 3 to 5 ounces each. And you can even use the lids as organizers in a pinch. Just lays the bags flat and frerze them first. Then stand them up in the lids.
5.0	My baby loves it. He started looking at it at 1 month, but than at two months began loving it... he talks to the animals and gets really excited. Meanwhile I can get things done. He will stay engaged with it for periods that go from 15min to an hour! At 3 months now, still loving it.
5.0	My wife and I watch our Grandkids on a regular basis and these playpens are a lifesaver. They can be somewhat tricky to break down, however we really appreciate the ability to fold them up and put them in the closet when not in use.  They are well made and we highly recommend them.
5.0	These have been great! No leaking, the cap fits snug and they are easy to clean. I wish we had these with our first child.
5.0	My boy loves it. He starts to sleep on it since he is only 8 months old. My second purchase :)
5.0	Bought these for my Grandbaby and my Daughter told me they work really well.
5.0	"We call this our daughter's \\""kicky\\"" chair because she goes nuts every time we put her in it. She's 4 1/2 months old now, and we've been using it from the very start. The vibration is gentle yet strong enough to soothe her. She's napped several times in it. The music is actually bearable, unlike a lot of children's toys. She loves grabbing onto the rings, or at least attempting! She's getting much more coordinated now. Early on it taught her about cause and effect as well as helped to develop her hand-eye coordination. You could see her focus intently on grabbing the rings. A great spot for her to play. Also easily portable! Sometimes I put it in the bathroom while I shower. We've also taken it over to the grandparents'. Definitely a product I would buy again."
5.0	We used this bag to check our stroller (Keyfit Caddy frame) cross-country. There was a ton of extra room so I'm sure there would be no issue with a regular stroller. We also fit our son's Snugabunny rock-n-play in the bag (collapsed). Both made it to our destination and home again with no issues. The bag held up well and we'll be using it again in the near future!
1.0	The idea of this combine looks nice, but it is not very practical, and for sure quite expensive for the work it does. I owned it and decided to return when I tried steaming the quantity of veggies that I need using a simple steamer. Then I used a wonderful stick blender that I bought for just $30 dollars (Cusinart) and it worked great.  Believe or not, it is less hassle this way.  Less cleaning and drying. I could freeze extra amounts and use it later. Beaba will allow to steam and blend only a small set amount, and if your butter squash will happen to be larger, you have to do 2-3 batches, and so on.  Plus the same time - 15 min, does not work well for all the veggies.  In summary, making baby food using a pot, or steamer and then stick blender does not seem to be any more work than using Beaba; blending fresh fruits with stick blender is much easier than with Beaba (you have less to clean).  Conclusion - Beaba is not worth spending money.
5.0	Perfect size for my 17 month old Granddaughter! Uses it as a sofa with her dolls and for nap time!  Lightweight to transport form room to room. Washable cover a plus as well. Fantastic price!
5.0	worked great great price
5.0	I tried all the breast milk bags out there and decided this brand produces the best bags. They do not stink like plastic byproducts, which is a huge relief. They are a little bit more expensive than the other brands, but I can confidently say that you would be paying the extra for the quality.
5.0	Material is very soft and color is exact in the picture. Also fits perfectly on the summer infant changing table. I would purchase again.
1.0	I have been using Dr. Brown's bottles since day one with my son, so when I wanted to start him on a sippy cup with formula in it I thought this was the perferct solution because it had the mesurments on the side of it.  The problem is that the cup doesn't work!  The cup has to be tipped really far back to get a solid flow of liquid to come out otherwise they are just sipping half air, half liquid.  I played with this cup for a 1/2 hour before I gave up, emptied the water out of it and threw it in the toy box for him to play with instead of actually use.  I read the previous reviews and made sure the bubble was all the way in the lid correctly and that still didn't help. Went to walmart and bought the $3 playtex one and just pre-make the formula for it.  Works much better.
5.0	Much cheaper than the sesame street ones and they work well!
1.0	My baby is really having trouble falling asleep, so we bought this so she could look at it and sooth herself to sleep.  But, the darn thing shuts off before she's asleep!  Even if she did fall asleep before the timer shuts off, she wakes periodically and it would be nice to have the stars there to greet her and lull her back to sleep.  That's why I bought this.  Now it's just another thing I have to babysit, by waking up every 45 minutes to turn it back on.  This is a total disappointment!!!!
5.0	I was pleased with the delivery of the product, and I shipped it to Alaska to my friends' kids who are mostly toddlers.  They sent me pictures and the kids seem to love having their own furniture.  I like how it rolls out to a mat for playing or napping.  It was smaller than I expected, but from their pictures it looks like it is working for them so I guress it is right sized.
1.0	"I have had this chair for three days now...first of all:<br /><br />-Assembly was a pain in the butt. Took husband and I hours to put this together. Should have been simple but the holes were not drilled correctly.<br /><br />-The first time I sat on this chair all I could think was \\""where's the cushion??\\"" I knew it was not going to be super high quality but I expected at least something that felt like a padded chair, and not so much like a rock. The pad is not even 2 inches thick and is made with very low quality foam, instead of being cushy, it is stiff. After sitting in this chair for about ten minutes, I have to get up and stretch because my tailbone is so sore.<br /><br />-The back cushion is the only thing \\""cushy\\"" in this entire chair but it slides down revlealing a couple inches of the wood backing, so don't plan on resting your head back on this thing while your trying to nurse. Its not comfortable.<br /><br />The one positive I can give this chair is that it has a very smooth glide-that is before it starts squeeking.<br /><br />I will be returning this product and buying one that was on display at target. There was no comparison on the quality. Im not a picky person in the least bit but if im going to be up all hours of the night tending to the baby, then I at least want to be comfortable. Amazon is OUTSTANDING. It shipped even faster than what they would, packaging was awesome, and no hassle returns."
5.0	This stroller is gorgeous! Set up was really easy, just adding the wheels. The new tires make this such a smooth push. The bassinet is great, my 2 week old has been sleeping in it alot since it arrived. Good quality, what I expect from Uppababy.
5.0	Fit my 2 month old just fine... Will be great for sporting events and music shows
5.0	This pitcher was GREAT once my daughter started drinking the larger amounts of formula! You have to be careful and only fill it about 3/4ish of the way full because when you mix it, it will come out the top... and don't go Hulk crazy when you are raising and lowering the mixing handle because it will splatter you in formula... This pitcher was beautiful for those 3 AM feedings when I was half awake! Keeping ours for baby #2!
5.0	Inexpensive, Durable and Minimal. I ordered this Kick Protector as other Seat Back Protectors are much more bulky or have a bunch of extra pockets that I don't need. This protector stays out of the way and uses plastic snap/clips to hook around the headrest post as well as an elastic snap/clip band that hooks around the base of the seat back. I'd recommend picking one of these up if your simply looking for an inexpensive way to protect the back of your seat without a bunch of added frills or gimmicks.
5.0	I was pleasantly surprised at how well this pump worked. Great for on the go pumping to get relief from engorgement or to pump off excess after nursing!
5.0	So comfortable and relaxing.
5.0	great product. fast delivery. I love them
5.0	A gorgeous aqua colour. The picture is really neon - and this was my preference. The sheet is still a brilliant blue and I am pleased overall. I have 2 other American Baby fitted crib sheets - so the quality delivered was as expected - exceptional. The fabric is not super soft, but it is strong, long-lasting and the prints are clean. They do soften over time and repeated washing. I intend on purchasing the flannel version for winter.
5.0	Both of my children love their WubbaNubs. The plush animal makes it easy for babies to find the pacifier at night saving mom from running into the nursery all night when they wake up. They last forever...even my toddler's tug-of-war couldn't rip the pacifier from the plush. Just throw it in the washing machine for easy cleaning!
5.0	Very nice, fits most anywhere and has a toy which my daughter loves, def reccomend it. Great price.
5.0	good price and great products
5.0	The Ikea near me is across a toll bridge and 30minutes away from me.  Add a screaming baby in a carseat she clearly despises to that equation and trips to this fun shopping spot become far less fun.  I bought one set of these when my baby started drooling and quickly realized I should have bought at least one more.  Amazon to the rescue!  Bought 2 more sets (totaling 15 bibs in all) and life (and the collars of all her clothes) has become a lot less wet.  We go through 2-3 of these (easily) in a day, so it's nice to have this many so we're not doing laundry every other day.  The price tag makes these even more great, though I believe they were a bit cheaper if purchased in the store (no delivery fees).  They're pretty thin but absorbent, and long enough to cover a good portion of her clothes to catch drool without looking clowny.  The material isn't incredibly soft, but it's soft enough.  There are giant tags on all of them (why?) but they can be easily ripped off.  The colors are also nice and unisex and can be coordinated with many outfits.
1.0	I bought this Trend Lab Flannel sheet along with two other Trend Lab Flannel sheets. This sheet after 1st wash- never used, ripped or rather shredded in the washing machine. I sent it back right away and requested a replacement, as the other two Trend Lab flannel sheets had no issue whatsoever. I received the replacement and inspected it thoroughly before putting it in the wash and found that it too had small little tears in it- so back it goes. This sheet is completely different from the other two, it is thinner and less soft- It also has elastic straps at each corner. Price was cheaper but so was quality. The other two are awesome- one is plain the other is a chevron print, highly recommend those over this one.
5.0	I currently have the rain forest jumperoo for my four month old, but he finds it a little bit too easy to tip over since he is too young to be able to balance effectively in it. So I was absolutely thrilled to test this jumper, which although he can turn around in circles in the seat, emphasizes the back-and-forth motion of walking more. My son loves that he feels secure in this jumper, and he really enjoys the mesh sides which allow me to place multiple toys for him to explore. I didn't use any of the included toys because I don't really like plastic toys which do things for you. We just use the tray and places own toys there and on the sides for him to discover as he sits and bounces.<br /><br />Though it is certainly meant for a larger baby the four-month-old, we just put a thick mat over a large encyclopedia on the floor to raise it up so that he can be at the right level to bounce and feel secure. It's great, because it is easy for him to get in and out of, it's 100% secure and won't tip, and there is lots of room for our own toys. I like this so much better than the rain forest one, because the rain forest one seem to assume that you would want to use their toys, so there wasn't much room for putting your own toys out instead.<br /><br />The one downside is that it takes up more room than the rain forest jumper, but given how much he loves it, and the fact that he can go back and forth along the length of it, is absolutely worth that tiny bit of extra space it takes up.<br /><br />Overall, this is a fantastic toy and I am so excited that my little one will get to grow into this over the coming months.
5.0	My daughter loves these things. I don't even need to attach toys, she just loves seeing them dangle and to grab or chew on them!
5.0	Bigger than most Bibs
5.0	This crib is sturdy, and has a great curved design to the rails.  It was a little nicer that what we saw at Babies 'R Us and other stores.  It took my husband and father in law over an hour to assemble, but once they got it together they then knew how to easily assemble the changing table.
5.0	Love it!! Got here on time and use it to protect my kid from running off. It's not a all heavy and you can adjust it to your kid.
1.0	Started unraveling the first day. Also my son was able to pull the Velcro apart, and the clasps are plastic and easily broken.... I am very disappointed...
5.0	Our daughter uses this every morning as part of early potty training. She has low muscle tone, so we needed a potty chair that would be supportive and comfortable enough for her, and this one does the trick. She seems very comfortable sitting on it, I think because of its high back and the little bump in front that kind of keeps her in the right position. I also like this chair because the little potty bucket is smooth, without many little creases, nooks or crannies where, um, germs might get stuck -- so it's very easy to clean. That's a relief for me!
5.0	My son is too little to use a plate, and so I would bring Clorox wipes with me everywhere, and when we'd go out to eat, I'd frantically Clorox wipe the table and hope that it disinfected enough before I had to wipe it down with water so that my son could eat off it. (It was a horrible process, and I'm sure he ended up eating more germs than I realized, but oh well!) I finally discovered disposable placemats and have never looked back. For some reason, I very rarely ever see these out in public being used by other people so I didn't know about them until my boy was about 15 months old. The Neat Solutions ones are great because they have adhesive on all four sides and don't slide off the table until you pull them off. I highly recommend these and will always have a stash from now on!
5.0	Love these headphones for my son!  He's 3 years old and is sensitive to noise.  I got these in time for the local Christmas parade.  He likes wearing them, and they really work!  At the parade, a fire truck blew its horn right in front of us, and he didn't even flinch!  Comfortable enough that he will wear them and keep them on.
5.0	We rarely sit down to write reviews, but felt this one was worthy of it. Great frame for the price (got it on sale). We've ordered a few Malden frames so far and have been pleased with every one. This one is a great weight for the metal, looks lovely (making a nice gift or addition to any home that is of quality), and although it only fits a smaller picture it is easy to cut down a 4X6. Great frame and great quality! We gave this frame as a gift to my mother with a picture of our two little boys in it and she loved it!
1.0	Buy this product if you want your child to scream constantly while you're on vacation. Our daughter is the easiest traveling child I have ever know. With this vest, she looked like her head would be severed in an accident. No amount of manipulation could stop the cries of &#34;mamma it hurts!&#34;
5.0	We've only just started to use this and we love it. I didn't want one of those massive exersaucers because they take up so much space.  This folds up easily when not in use. Can't wait to take it camping this summer.
1.0	Agree with  the above. All the same color and was supposed to be different colors..  Definitely sending back for a refund
5.0	my baby girl loves this! it doesn't move, unless you move it. very safe, love the bright pink color. easy to use.
5.0	These bags are AWESOME!!!  I got 50 of these bags to try after trying the Lansinoh bags.  The Lansinoh bags were ok but just seemed too thin so I searched Amazon for other bag options.  I read quite a few reviews on these and decided to try them and I am glad I did.  The price is reasonable, there is more room in mu deep freezer, and I like the fact that they are biodegradable.  Great bags!!!
5.0	expectation was met, my son loves it !!!!!!
1.0	This mobile does NOT fit a sleigh or convertible crib.  I have a Baby Appleseed convertible crib and it will not work no matter where I try and place it.  It is a beautiful mobile, but don't be surprised if it won't work.  Very disappointed.
5.0	This is soft and comforting for baby to lie on. She falls asleep on the changing table. It's not hot in the summer the way one might thing wool would be, either, just snuggly soft. We have this in the smaller size as well for the bassinet and she will sleep in that for hours too. Much better than a plastic changing pad!
5.0	My little one is 7 months old and loves to walk. Since she can't do it on her own yet, she relies on me to help balance, all at the expense of my back. At first, I wasn't sure how she would take to the wings because it was a whole new way of walking compared to me bending over and holding her hands. The wings allow her to walk freely. With a little practice (for both her and I) this is our new favorite entertainment device. It saves my back and has improved her ability to balance herself. Needless to say, she will probably be walking sooner now as I see her balance improving day-by-day.
5.0	I've been looking for a toy hammock for my kids room.  We have a lot of stuffed animals so I was excited when I got to try jet creations hammock.  It was easy to install and it fit about 15 stuffed animals.  My girls liked it so they can see all of them.  I received this product for review purposes only .  All thoughts and opinions are my own and not influenced by anyone.
5.0	I have several diaper bags and this one is my favorite! Bought it a year and a half ago and still use it. The pockets are in the right places. Plenty of space. Love it
5.0	"My daughter is about to have our second grandchild.  A doctor friend of mine recently had a baby and said the new Boppy Infant Lounger is a \\""must have\\""!  I bought 2 loungers, one for my daughter and one for my house. I purchased extra covers from Amazon.com.  Can't wait to try them out."
5.0	It works great, even better with a mattress pad.
5.0	Thank-you for the products, All was great! I would recommend to anyone. The panda is so cute, which she gets amused with.
5.0	Works as described and very happy with the purchase
5.0	simple to install. Sturdy so far. Takes seconds to install. Once kids get a little older and try to take them off, a little clear tape over the joints works just fine.
5.0	I bought this after seeing how well it was rated. I totally agree. It's very engaging and my 15 month old still plays with it. It doesn't stay stuck to his high chair forever, but it gives me a minute or two. He loves it!
1.0	Very poor product. Bought for our 18 month old great grandchild & we're very disappointed? The sound was great until we took it out of the box & then it was so quite you could barely hear it. Called the manufacturer & was told they made it soft so as not to hurt the child's ears. It was the correct volume in the box, they shouldn't have changed it. We returned it. Very disappointed.
5.0	I was sent the Caroline's Garden crib set to review with Arabella, and love it.  I have been a fan of HALO products, especially their swaddlers and sleepsacks, since welcoming our first daughter in 2011, and was excited to find out that they were adding a SleepSack® Crib Set to their product line.  And, now with their new line of crib sets, I now have another gift idea to give to expectant family and friends.<br /><br />First off, the design is beautiful -- who knew that Arabella would look so good in flowers? :-)  It was a cinch to add the crib skirt and fitted sheet to her crib.  In minutes, I was able to get rid of the bumper, which I was always afraid of and finally feel relief in knowing that Arabella will not only sleep comfortably on her new sheet set, but that the bumper will not be there.<br /><br />And, with the New England weather, we have been having hot nights for a few days, and then back to wintery feeling nights.  So, I was excited to see the sleepsack and swaddler, included in the HALO SleepSack® Crib Set, to choose from and use at bedtime.  Unfortunately, Arabella has grown so fast that she didn't fit into the swaddler.  But, fear not, I shared this with a family friend who just welcomed her first daughter, and both baby and Mommy love it!  As for the HALO sleepsack, Arabella is able to move her arms freely, as she is being to roll over.  And, with the changing temperatures, I know this breathable material will not only keep her warm, without causing excessive sweating, but will also let her stretch her legs out (thus, preventing hip problems).<br /><br />Since receiving this new crib set from HALO, I have washed all the items over a dozen times, and each piece in the set continues to keep its shape and hasn't faded.  And, the best part -- I love how this crib set can grow with Arabella, and also be used down the road, when I transition her to a toddler bed.<br /><br />Thanks HALO for continuing to delivery exceptional quality and for looking outfor my babies.
5.0	the wonder bib  is hands down the best bib on the market. We were given a pack of them at the baby shower and it was several months before we opened the pack and gave them a try. But now there's no turning back and these are the only bibs we  will use they catch more milk around the neck than any other bib and have better coverage for    chest and the shoulders of your baby. These  bibs are sweet.
5.0	It is roomy and strong and I don't feel a frump while carrying it. Wish I had found this earlier!
5.0	This is a fantastic buy. My son loves it. It is easily portable and the best part about is that you can easily have it washed.
1.0	Bought to use during pregnancy. Had to send back. Was way to big and takes up the space of another person. Ended up using regular pillows on either side of me.
1.0	I, like many others, bought this sling after receiving a promo code. Only $15 for a sling? Sold! First off, it took some time to ship. Then the fabric is so cheap and stiff. The few times I've tried to put my daughter in it she screamed bloody murder. I bought a size 3 after following the sizing guide--and yes, I actually measured myself. It is so freaking small that I can't open the pouch enough to get my baby in. I hate it and wish I could get my damn money back. I should have gotten a K'tan or made my own Moby Wrap.<br />DO NOT BUY THIS SLING!
5.0	This was a great alternative to the bumbo chair.  We decided to purchase this instead of the bumbo and were super happy that we did!
5.0	Perfect!<br />Can be time consuming
1.0	Horrible to install, and I have very thin arms and ended up bruised. The straps to tighten are very hard to use, and the release button is hard to push. I bought two for the twins and as their father and I describe them as the car seats from hell. They say you get what you pay for, and boy do you!
5.0	Exactly what I wanted and arrived quickly! LOVE the color.Keeps my LO's fingers busy while nursing and gives her little gums some relief when not.
5.0	I tried a couple of other toy organizers, neither worked; on a last ditch effort (before resorting to a bucket with holes in it sitting in my tub...), I ordered this product.  It works beautifully - stays in place, not big and bulky yet holds a lot of toys, and the toys dry out well.
5.0	My sister bought this for my daughter who is 14 weeks for chirstmas. My daughter loves the stars shining up on the ceiling and wall. I was not expecting the stars to cover as much of the room as it does. I love the pink butterfly style also. I would recommend this product. As a matter of fact I am buying the turtle for my friend's baby shower!
5.0	My kids go camping a lot.  Needed a high chair for the baby and this is really going to work.  They went to the coast right after they got it and it was really handy.  Even had people asking where they got it.  Great product.
5.0	These sippy cups are really 100% spill proof. We have used 2 other brands, including Tommy-Tippy and the OCOs have been best so far. The valve comes in one big assembly and stays inside the lid. It is easily cleanable with the nipple brush and the the whole bottle is dishwasher top rack safe. Further, you can change the pieces in OXO and place a handle from one of your other sippy cups and that way, it works like  mix n match.<br /><br />Overall, a greta product with good value for moeny.
5.0	We have had the crib for 10 months now since our baby was born and it is amazing. I love it. We got it in Cherry. Not only does it look amazing and expensive in the room, but it is highly functional. Once in a while it gets a tiny scratch, but nothing close to what people said with their crib and our baby chews and chews at the bars. One thing I love about the crib--there are four levels for the mattress height, 1 more than most cribs. This means that you can set the mattress lower than other cribs-- thank goodness for that since I have a climbing baby. I can't say enough good things about this crib. We got the Emily changing table as well and LOVE it as well. The two look like a set. The changing table is sturdy and amazing. We love both. We got the Emily mattress as well. That is the only thing I didn't like. Its okay and the baby sleeps well on it, but I think it is sort of flimsy. But I LOVE LOVE LOVE the crib and highly recommend it. Just today, 10 months later, I was thinking this is the best purchase I have ever made. And for the price, it can't be any better. The company seems fine as well. We had problems with the changing table when it arrived. We could only correspond with Davinci thru the computer, but they sent the part that needed to be replaced in a timely manner.
5.0	Loved them, they work awesome :)
1.0	Thought this was the same as the 55 much different very cheaply made would recommend all other britax products but this one
5.0	I needed a high chair to take with us when we travel to see Family, so I did my research and found this one.  I really love it, because it's not bulky at all, and it's not heavy.  Originally I bought it because I would need it in Spain, but now I keep it in my diaper bag and I can use it when I am visiting friends, at receptions, at family houses, basically anywhere.  What I like the most, is that the baby stays secure and happy.  She enjoys sitting in a regular chair and I can feed her with no problem.
5.0	I give this a 5 star rating because it's perfect for my LO who has reflux for me to prop him on this sometimes when doing a dream feed or when I just want to prop him a bit when he is playing, changing etc. He loves to cuddle in it. Now that he is old enough I do let him sleep with it, though this is not recommended by the company. My only tiny complaint is the velcro that is used on the back to close the seems together since you can take it off and wash it (it washes very well) the velcro is very prickly. So if he was to rub that on his face it could scratch him. It's just important to inspect it and make sure the velcro is closed well.
5.0	These latches work well for those odd openings. We use one on the glass doors of our entertainment center and another on the cabinet door and oven door. They work so well almost husband-proof as well!
1.0	It came broken. I can't get it to work :/
5.0	"I have this, and another wrap from a different company and I have to say that they were the best things I've gotten for my new baby. I wish I would have gotten one when my first child was born. I love that my baby's weight is distributed evenly so that even after walking around a zoo for HOURS I was not hurting, even just 4 weeks after a c-section!    I also have to say that the shipping from this seller specifically was amazingly fast! I had my order in TWO days. I was thrilled!    There are only two \\""cons\\"" that I can see and one is the price, fourty dollars for what is basically a long piece of fabric is pretty steep. If you know how to sew, find out the dimensions, get some fabric and make one yourself for about 75% less money.    The other is that living in a very warm climate, the fabric that the Moby wrap is made from is a little thick for comfort. The other wrap that I have (wrap n wear) is made from crinkle cotton and it's much lighter and more comfortable in the heat."
5.0	Extremely well made, well packaged and the pictures are bright and cherry.  Very satisfied.
5.0	Beautiful rocking horse, looks exactly as pictured!
5.0	Great size for my 2yo. We have used grobags since my son was 6 months and we love them! The material is not slippery so my son can easily shuffle around in these without falling
5.0	So soft! Looks well made.
5.0	This is definitely more of a Cherry color - but looks GREAT! Matching dresser Delta sells goes great with this... Not hard to put together, just need some time set aside!
1.0	When I ordered this it said brand, new never used, original box.  Well it WAS NOT BRAND NEW, NOT IN ORIGINAL BOX. It had scratches on it and was all put together. Very disappointed--took so long to get--it was a gift and my daughter in-law decided to  keep it--she bleached it really good. I wanted to send it back because I don't believe I should have to pay new prices for a used item. I will never order anything from BabyMoov again. If my daughter in-law wouldn't have needed it right away it would have went back.
5.0	I had searched and searched for a second year calendar. When I finally found this one I was super excited. and even more when I found out it had stickers. It has really unique ones that will make hitting the milestones extra special I hope you enjoy
5.0	We received this bouncer about a week ago and my daughter has been loving it.  She's not one that likes to be put down and when we place her in this bouncer she loves the gentle motion and the soothing music.  She is all smiles and giggles when she is in the Ingenuity Bouncer.  Excellent bouncer for any new baby up to 20 lbs and would make an excellent baby shower gift!  The price point is amazing and the quality is fantastic.  Took only about 10 minutes to assemble and my it's now my daughter's favorite item in the home!
1.0	We ordered this after the birth of our son.  It's not an expensive piece of furniture, but we did buy up from the lesser models.  This particular chair has been an overall disappointment.  First off, it looks MUCH better in the picture than it does in your home.  The cushions sag and bunch making the chair look like its 2 years old.  The glider function is not smooth, so each forward back movement has a &#34;hiccup&#34; along the way.....so not so relaxing for the adult.  Lastly, the screws keep falling out of it.  I have put screws back into it at least 3 times.  It makes me a bit nervous if it is safe....but I also dont like the screws on the floor where little ones can get them.  If the manufacturer would only put $20 more into the quality of the materials.....I am sure this would be a great glider.<br /><br />If its not a complete hassle, I would probably return it to Amazon.
5.0	The fitted crib sheet fits &#34;like a glove&#34; and is luxurious in feel.
5.0	It's very useful and comfort ! Most compact fold!
5.0	I didn't buy this to help with flat head syndrome (so I can't speak to that), but rather I bought it as an introduction to using a pillow for my two-year-old son. So far, so good! It is a great smaller size, and cradles his head perfectly. I like that there is an indention in it and that it isn't too lofty, making me feel like it is more safe (as far as his breathing and ensuring he won't suffocate).<br /><br />Also, my son thinks it is adorable! He is always talking about &#34;his lion&#34; and treats it like a stuffed animal! Cute!
5.0	Great little seat cover.  Thin material, but my 17 month old loves his &#34;EMMOE&#34; seat cover.  I would buy again.
5.0	These snack cups are a life saver.  Our little guy can have his snack walking around, riding in the car, or romping around outside and there is a 100% guarantee of no spills!  Yahoo!
5.0	Purchased this for my 3 yr old who is a real Minnie fan and she squealed with delight. The product is exactly as portrayed with the pictures very vivid and the quality excellent.  Great value for money!
5.0	My daughter is rough on everything and this product it holding up very well. Lots of pockets and it's easy to reach her stuff.
5.0	Keeps the little one happy.
5.0	I love the flat sheet is fitted on one end! That way it stays put for the night and the kids won't get tangled in it. Beautiful print and it hasn't faded with the Wash
5.0	Before I ordered this set, I used the Mustela Vitamin Barrier Cream (diaper cream) on DS and I absolutely love it, therefore I want to try more things from Mustela, and this set is a good start. Unlike the picture showed, my gift set came with a free bib, and it looks good on DS! The only product came with trial size was the Demo Cleansing Gel (bath gel), and after I tried a several times on DS, I bought the regular size for him, it was gentle on his skin and washed very clean but left his skin very soft, and smells nice and clean. I used to use California Baby's Calming Shower Gel, and it dries DS's hair and made it so much static, it actually made his hair gets greaser easily and didn't help with his cradle cap. After I used Mustela foam Shampoo for newborn, it made his hair soft and manageable again and smelled so nice, and cured his cradle cap in two days, I love it! I also used the Physi-o-bebe (cleansing water) but didn't like it as much as the other products in the set, because it left the skin sticky. Since I already used diaper cream, I just keep this new one on my diaper bag.
5.0	I purchased this set for my 2 year old.  The quality of the sheets and pillowcase are good, they look like they will hold up pretty well.  The blanket is very soft and thicker than I anticipated.  For $25 on sale, this was a good value.
5.0	Thick and soft. By far the best crib sheets out there!
5.0	This product is the best. I used it until my daugter turned two then she wanted to play with it. She loved the sounds from the time she was born. I used it everytime I layed her down. My husband and I got the most peacefull sleeps once we started using this since she would sleep through the night. I used the beach and the segull sounds together and it was just like we were at the beach, when we actually went to the beach and were sitting on the sand she actually fell asleep and slept for three hours. I think it was because she was sooo used to the sounds of the waves and the birds..hehehehee. I have read other review's complaining about it not being loud enough, personally I thought the sound was perfect, you don't want it to be at it's highest volume since you are trying to put your baby to sleep. It's just supposed to be a background sound. I used to keep the volume just a bit higher than low and I could here it through the monitor's which were all the way across the bedroom. I have since given it to a friend who had a baby and she loves it just as much and says it works great for her baby too. <br />
5.0	I loved it, it holds a lot of my son's animals!!
5.0	Very nice product.  My baby now enjoys sitting in her car seat.
5.0	love this and everyone that uses it like it.  I traveled with it and it is light weight and did not take up much space at all.
5.0	This is such an amazing design!! Honestly though, the bassinet  portion ended up not working out because my daughter is a tummy sleeper. The spot the bassient is placed ended up being the blankets, bibs, toys, etc. storage area, while the bassinet itself sat aside on the stand. Lol If your baby might  likely end up doing the same (based on family history), just get a pack n play that has a changer and a regular section on the side that isn't a bassinet style.
5.0	I look all over for a car seat that would work for our son, Finally I asked my sister who has 10 kids she told me about this one. I totally love it. Our son is really tall  for his age and it wasn't easy finding a car seat that I liked and that would work for his weight.
1.0	My toddler has NO problem ripping these apart and getting into things I'm trying to protect him from. Doesn't matter the surface, it will eventually come off. It may snap closed, but a good hard tug and it's busted open. DON&#34;T WASTE YOUR MONEY.
5.0	I ADORE this backpack. I ordered it for our 2 yr old as we were going on a plane trip and I thought the harness would help me and my piece of mind if I had a hold of her and not have to bring a bulky stroller. I was able to fit in a couple of diapers,3 books and several snacks. It was just the right size for her and she looks downright adorable in it!
5.0	Okay all the reviews here say baby can not get out well that is not true. It has nothing to do with how tight I wrap it or how up or low on his shoulders I put it he did break out. I promise you all I wrapped it tight super tight the tightest I have wrapped it and he still broke out. That being said I would recommend these blankets. They work and while yes he has gotten out he does not get out that often at all versus using a blanket. They help in the process of getting him to sleep and I think every parent should own one especially if the baby is colicky. Do not hesitate in buying these blankets they will save your sanity as other reviewers have stated.
5.0	This is a great toy. My three month old is very interested in him but doesn't know how to play with him yet. I'm sure he will love him more as he gets older.
1.0	Falls off all the time.  The clip on this is too loose and every time we pickup the diaper bag it seems to pop off. Will be getting rid of it asap and try a vera bradley one next.
5.0	a simply one. nothing fancy. easy to put together and install. does the job
5.0	Excellent product my baby is happy !!!
5.0	I LOVE the pattern! I put this on my registry, not knowing the gender and it is super cute for a boy or girl. The cover washes up easily- I just throw it in the wash and hang to dry. By the next morning, it's ready to go! This seat was included in the recall for the buckle sticking. I never really noticed too much of a problem, it would be kinda hard to click open but I never struggled too bad. I emailed Graco and within a few weeks I had the new, easy to install buckle. The stroller is fabulous...I keep it in my truck and whip it out often. It is so easy to open and close. The lower basket compartment is spacious and allows me to load up while out to garage sales :)
5.0	arrived on time & as described
5.0	Excellent product. Made in USA. When daughter refused solid, she ate from this mesh and loved it. Was not too heavy or big for her. Just perfect. Was easy to wash.
5.0	Thus is a favorite challenge toy of my two year old and I'm expecting it go last for a long time.
5.0	A well made, easy to use, stylish and, most importantly, WARM &#34;sleep sack&#34; that is NOT polyester! I've searched everywhere for something just like this and it's everything I wanted and more. The quality is outstanding. The material is unbelievably soft. The color is neutral and pleasing. The zipper is easy and quiet, a nice chunky plastic. I didn't know how much I would love the snaps, I never had one with any. They are brilliant; I lay the bag down in the crib with snaps open and place sleeping babe down, then snap shut over his arms. No more wrestling his arms into armholes and waking him up doing so! I swear the snaps even snap quietly! I can't recommend this product enough. Bravo Baby Deedee!
5.0	If `Flexible Flyer' generates fond memories, you need a  Mountain  Boy  Kicksled.  Hand-built  in  Silverton, Colorado, Mountain Boys are designed to ride on flats or slopes,  on  packed  snowmobile  trails,  snowy  roads  or even  ice.  The  kicker  controls  the  sled,  steering  from behind  while  standing with one foot on a metal runner as the other foot kicks    the    sled    into action.  The lucky  side-kick  sits   in   a   semi-reclined wooden deckchair,  takes  in  the sights  and  enjoys  the ride. For the kicker, it's a great  workout.  For  the rider,  it's  less  bumpy than  other  sleds.  For the  soloist,  there's  the single model. Mountain Boy Sleds are an artful way  to  transport  gear, groceries or kids. (Note: I first published this review in Ski Press Magazine).
5.0	One of the best products I've ever bought! Works perfectly on our spout with a pull up shower knob.
1.0	The sizing on this is absolutely horrible.  My baby isn't even 14 lbs and it is too small for her!
5.0	The set up was very easy and fast. It walks you through a few easy steps and I love that I could just scan the QR code on the back of the camera to set it up. The picture and sound are clear. It was extremely easy to use and I like that I can log in while I'm out of town or away from home and check on my baby. This is a great value for all of the features it offers.
5.0	Great product easy to install, but make sure your dog cannot get head stuck which mine did.
5.0	This is the perfect bib for a toddler.  It is very easy to latch an un-latch and covers most of their front so it significantly minimizes mess!  Love it!
5.0	This is just the cutest rattle. It's such plush and has a soft rattling sound. My w month old can't hold it but likes to look at it and it makes for a great photo prop.
5.0	Great bibs for my 1 year old! These are not only fashionable with the cute pearl design to clip around her neck, but super functional! I can use it to catch her droppings, or put some snacks in it for her to eat. And the best part is that they can be washed in the dishwasher!!
5.0	Love how easy it was to set up! Just the right size for the space I had. I highly recommend this item.
1.0	This is a good idea, but the execution is off.  The mat is bulky and takes up valuable room in my already cramped diaper bag.  The suction cups were a hit or miss.  Sometimes they stuck, sometimes not.  Ultimately, I ended up not using this product and went with disposable placemats instead.  They're super slim and take up no room in my diaper bag, then I just toss them after he eats.  I do not recommend this product.
5.0	I'd been looking for a crib for months for my granddaughter; it had to be just right as far as looks, etc.  Was ready to buy the Graco Charlston crib in white when I saw the Europa Baby Geneva on Amazon.  I'm very glad I ordered the Baby Geneva - very sturdy, looks great and the price I got from Amazon was lower than the Graco!  I am very satisfied with my purchase and would highly recommend this crib.
5.0	Fits perfectly inside a Graco Pack 'n Play Playard® with Reversible Napper & Changer™ purchased at Target.  Our two month old will sleep on this fine. The included pad in the Pack and Play was not comfortable enough for the baby to be happy.  With this the baby sleeps soundly.  Note. this mattress does not fold really well so it will take up some space in your car if you are going to travel with it.  Added a fabric fitted sheet to the top of it and a waterproof pad between the mattress and the fitted sheet and this thing is standing up to everything the baby throws at it.
1.0	Leqks like crazy. My son loves the sippy cup version, which strangely enough don't leak. This two handle version does even when in the lock position. Another cup that we ended up throwing away.
5.0	I bought this and several others of this brand to make a cloth diaper cake for my sister-in-law. They were a great quality and worked out really nicely!
5.0	This is a great car seat! Was exactly what we wanted and expected! Our son fits great in it! Great buy.
5.0	My son loves this teether! Best one yet! 10/10. great for any age. easy to hold and easy to wash!
5.0	In my office I have a lamp that sits on the top of the hutch on my desk.  The switch is near the bulb, which means I can't reach it unless I stand on my chair.  With this switch I can keep the lamp switched on and turn it on and off by the outlet.  It's perfect.
5.0	My husband and I were expecting twins and bought two of these cribs for their nursery. They were easy to put together for two people, one super pregnant person and her hubby and the quality was amazing out of the box! Fast forward 7 months later, the cribs still look fabulous and have been 2 sturdy and reliable pieces in our home. Way to go Storkcraft for making an affordable yet durable product!
5.0	Love the quality! Would totally buy it again. Perfect fir for a Semidor toddler pillow.
5.0	The bra is comfortable and real hand free. I don't need hold the bottles any more. Size is adjustable which I don't need to worry about buying the wrong size. Highly recommend!
5.0	Grandaughter of 1 yrs old loves it and parents are not annoyed by loud bad music. good buy for all!
5.0	We ordered this as a decoration for  our frog & lady bug baby shower and it was perfect. We plan to watch our grandchild play with this toy for years to come. This item was exactly as described in new condition and I would recommend this to any one who loves lady bugs and has a baby around , it was just beautiful
1.0	Despite the item description, the frame only fits pictures up to 3.5x5, NOT 4x6. The frame itself is fine if you intend to use it for smaller-sized pictures, but a major annoyance when 4x6 is more of the standard picture size nowadays.<br /><br />On a side note, I couldn't even return this because Amazon refused to refund my promotional credit of $10 (they do not refund promotion). But my 1 star is solely based on the inaccurate description of the item, not Amazon policies.
5.0	This product is fantastic. I will never use any other.
1.0	Are you kidding me?  These are nothing special just a little plain pouch you could literally sow yourself.  Plus it has velcro so stuff can get inside it is not very sealed and you want diapers to remain a little sanitary at least I do.  Any cosmetic case that size such as Ju Ju Be Be quick for less money has more function such as pockets and wristlet ect. This is nothing.  I seriously can't believe people buy these for that much.  I would not recommend it for this price.
5.0	At first look I was skeptical of this fan, but after a week at the beach in 90+ degree heat I don't know what I would have done without it! It survived being thrown in a beach bag and being clipped on a car seat and being kicked by a four month old!  It provides a lot more air than I expected and helped to keep the baby cool when we got in the car before the air kicked in! Plus the baby loved to watch the fan!  His cousin had the Dynamo caged fan and broke it in about a day- they ordered this fan and rushed it to the house and they are still using it!
5.0	Love these! The ruffle is so chic and matches all my little girl's outfits :)
5.0	This was even better than I expected it to be. It was well made and very cute. l l l
5.0	The blankets arrived so quickly and packaged perfectly. The prints are as vibrant as they appear in the picture. I have seen reviews where customers have not been satisfied that swaddles they order online actually are aden and anais, but these most definitely are. Great quality and I cannot wait for my baby to start using them!
5.0	It's very nice product, came with a complete kit. Safe for kids, soft for the kids skin.<br />I liked it very much.
1.0	THE NIPPLE ON THE BOTTLE CAME CRACKED.
1.0	DO NOT BUY THESE!!!!! I purchased a similar products on the boardwalk in NJ and they were great. When i returned home I wanted to buy more for the neighborhood kids and went on Amazon to find these. Quality terrible. Function terrible. I spent and hour helping the kids trying to fly their  helicopters only to have them fly about 15 feet in the air. I would NOT recommend anyone purchase this product.
5.0	I have three kids who sleep upstairs, and we really needed a good gate, especially to protect the 1 year old from falling down.<br /><br />This does exactly what we need it to, for the top of the stairs, where we had previously tried a gate that used tension to keep it in place. The tension, however, was beginning to warp the bannister, making it easy to push open, so we needed something better quickly.<br /><br />The gate is sturdy and won't move out of place. The instructions included were clear, and it wasn't hard to put up (with a drill).<br /><br />The only problem I had was that the wood screws included were a little too big and wouldn't let the slides go in easily, so I had to use some smaller ones from my own supply.<br /><br />The adjustable side is also perfect, since our bannister was uneven at the top. I'd recommend this product to anyone.
5.0	Too hard to sip from before my girl was 6 months old, but now it is my favorite cup.  Easiest to clean, easy to drink from, good flow.  Nice and light.
5.0	Great product. It does exactly what I thought it would do. I don't really have anything else to say to make the right amount of words.
5.0	Nice bed. I bought it for my daughter about 3 years back. She is still using it.
5.0	Practical necklace with secure beads and clasp.
5.0	Beautiful gift for my newly baptized God children, both parents and children love them.  I shall buy more for stock.
5.0	These are great for toys, sippy cups, food cups anything you don't want on the floor or to be lost. I use them at home at the high chair, out at restaurants, in the car and any time we are in the stroller and my 1 year old wants a snack or a drink. I can't even count the number of times this thing has saved me from having to pick up a sippy cup of the floor.
1.0	Save your money.  This seat has no anchors and slides around on the toilet seat.  It is very hazardous for toddlers.  It looks and feels cheap, as well.
5.0	Really you just cannot go wrong with a Bummis product!!! It's pretty great to be able buy a large wet bag now! We have a diaper kit and it is nice to now have an extra large wet bag for when one is in the wash :)
5.0	I love this gift basket!  It was delivered fast and looks exactly like I expected.  It's good quality and perfect for my friend.
1.0	Hard to use and no case to keep it in, apparently you need to buy a separate case for storing it
1.0	Within a month of using this pail, the lid would keep popping open.  The reason that I purchased this pail was that I liked the idea of not having to buy refills and could use regular kitchen bags.  Now that my son is eating solids the stinch coming from this diaper pail is terrible!  I decided yesterday that I was tossing this pail and going with the 'Diaper Genie', which I have heard mixed reviews on but anything beats this pail.  I realize that all diaper pails are going to smell a little--look what goes in them!  However, this pail should be taken off the market.
5.0	My new granddaughter will be born in July so something like this is perfect. It's incredibly cute and very soft. The theme of her bedroom is Dr. Seuss so this is a perfect addition. Very pleased.
5.0	Amazon is the only store that sells this,  which doesn't make any sense.  This will product is necessary to have with this highchair.  My son is big at 10 months old,  yet he still uses the Booster cushion.  Same fabric as the seat, so easy to wipe clean.
5.0	This is designed to feel like a teether, so the baby grabs it and brushes his teeth, a wonderful trick! My son loves it!
5.0	Big and comfy for baby to wear. The material also helped to keep baby warm as an outer layer during the crisp Halloween outing.
5.0	It's very convenient and fit nicely through the doorway. Looks really good too like it was special made for our doorway which is standard doorway size. No need to drill holes into the walls and it is pretty sturdy. I recommend this for areas that you don't have to move the gate so often as it can be a pain to tighten the wheels so often.  I tried another gate before that has a middle extender and made of plastic but my 15lb dog kept knocking it down.  This one holds up better by far. My cat can jump over it which is fine with me.<br />I don't have kids so I can't give a good review about that. Except that the bars are spaced small enough that a kid can not put his/her head through and I guess they'd have to try to knock it down really hard if they really tried. They'd have to know to lift the door slightly and push it out to get through.
5.0	My 4 month old loves chewing on this and, unlike other items, he can easily get it in his mouth and chew on it and seems very satisfied with that.  The squeak alarms him sometimes, but I imagine he will get used to that.
5.0	I use this to store my cloth wipes.  If I fold the wipes right, they will pop up and make diaper changes easy and quick!  If you use cloth wipes, you NEED this dispenser.  I also like the fact that you can choose the accent color to match your nursery.
5.0	These are the only cups that we have used that actually don't spill all over the place.  There is no fully no leak straw cups, but these are the best.  And we couldn't find this exact type in the store so we had to get them from amazon, but the price isn't bad.
5.0	My son had trouble holding other heavier teethers but he just loved this one... What you see is what you get...
5.0	This seat is great for bike-riding in urban areas.  We do lots of stop and go riding and I can keep my eyes on the traffic and my little girl.  Having her in front makes riding a much more interactive experience for both of us.  She loves her co-rider as much as she loves the car shopping carts at Kroger!
5.0	Love it. Saves so much room
5.0	I add boiling water to this container to warm it up before adding hot foods.  I make my daughter's lunch at around 6:30 a.m., and the food is still warm around 11:30 a.m. when she eats.  If I don't add the hot water ahead of time, the food is cold by lunchtime.
5.0	I purchased this item because of the extra cushion and corners that are included, but there’s much more to this product and company than meets the eye because it’s the little things that make a big difference!  The product arrived in a timely manner, and upon opening the box, I was pleasantly surprised to find easy to follow installation pictures right on the package.  It’s a little thing, but it makes a big difference during installation.  The product itself is exactly as described, but it included a thank you card, which again, is a little touch I appreciated.  On top of those things, I have benefited from the follow up customer service provided by Premium Safety Choice, which included some extra installation tips as well as the delivery of the e-book.  What a great product and experience!

I am very glad that I had the opportunity to review this Baby Food Making System for a discounted price. It is so simple to make baby food now with everything at your finger tips.
5.0	Pleasantly surprised with these swaddle blankets. Aden and Anais muslin swaddles are probably the standard that all muslin swaddle blankets are compared to so I was expecting a bit less in terms of quality. Sure enough they're just as good; same prewashed cotton muslin, same thickness, and great print!.  The only thing is the packaging isn't as gift able as those by Aden and Anais (the $40 set comes in a nice cardboard packaging) but if you're looking to use this yourself it's perfect and at a really good price!
5.0	I am totally obsessed with these blankets. This hawaiian design is super cute. Absolutely love it! I would buy more if the price weren't so steep.
5.0	My youngest's favorite blanket. Super soft, and breathable, which is great when they have a fever and still want to have a blanket. And it's large enough he won't outgrow it any time soon! And very easy to wash and get stains out of also. Absolutely love it.
5.0	Nice and light weight.
1.0	The fabric smelled like it was stored in a garage. It smelled like oil or fuel. I washed it and can't seem to get the smell out.<br />It was too small.
5.0	Great to use for baby book and other baby crafts. Removes easy with baby whipes. Try to use only when bay is sleeping for best results.
5.0	I purchased this for short trips with my Granddaughter.  I love it!  It fits securely in the back seat of my small car and she seems very comfortable in it.  You can't beat the price and it also got great reviews.  I am very happy with this car seat.
5.0	I love this wrap. It is very comfortable and easy to use. My baby is only 2 weeks old and we have used it nearly everyday already. She loves as much as I do. It feels very secure. I also have an ERGO carrier for long walks etc., but this wrap is so much easier to use and so much more comfortable for both my baby and me. My sister has one that she uses with her 8 month old, and they love theirs too. I love the driftwood color too. I highly recommend this wrap.
5.0	No problems! Arrived in great shape. Great style bed and perfect fit for my toddler. Crib mattress fits like a glove. Amazing price.
5.0	"Ok, so I don't normally EVER write reviews but this one definately needs one. My now 6 month old has GERD and it is very difficult making certain that his bottles are always held so he doesn't get any air; with these bottles that isn't a concern. As long as there is milk in the bottom at the straw he doesn't get air. A huge advantage as well is that we don't have to worry about mid-trip stops to give him a bottle. He just grabs it when he's hungry and plugs it in! (It also gives our 6 yr old something to do to help.)<br />They have also taken out night time screams from 5-6 times to once per night, reason enough to switch. As long as he'd holding it, he will sleep.<br />One bit of advice to further lesson their air intake is to hold the bottle higher than the nipple and kind of squeeze the nipple to get the milk flowing. This kind of uses graity to prime it and the milk is already in the nipple for them. The only problem we had was trying to use them at the wrong time. He was at the \\""flinging arm\\"" stage and kept hitting it; now we're good. We're constantly stopped to talk about them. I am about to buy more now that I know how great they are!"
5.0	My son would drink water out of numerous other sippy cups, but not formula. I picked this cup up randomly, and he loved it immediately! He will drink anything out of it, and is no longer using bottles thanks to this cup. The reason this cup has a couple 1 star reviews is because the directions aren't very good, and apparently they didn't reattach the circular piece that screws on to the inside of the lid in order to seal the nipple in place. As long as you put this piece in every time, there are absolutely no spills! My son throws, bangs, and shakes this cup and we have had no accidents.
5.0	Ordered this product to keep puppy out of living room and off new carpeting<br /><br />Will recommend product for sure<br /><br />Excellent service
5.0	This delightful little set of toys is perfect to attach to just about any type of &#34;seat&#34; your little bundle of joy might sit in.<br /><br />Perfect on the car seat for entertainment.<br /><br />My little guy loves to chew on it any time he gets the chance.
5.0	I ordered this pillow after spotting a trial offer for a discounted price. First, I should say when I took it out of the box and plastic, my 8 month old wanted to play with it. She would hug the pillow to her body and giggle. I actually had my pre-schooler use it last night and give me her review since our youngest isn't quite ready for a pillow.  While my five year old is the one who actually slept with it - it was a big hit in our house and I may be in trouble for not buying two!<br /><br />I love that this is a Made in the USA product, hypo allergenic and washable - which is so important with little ones!  The only thing that may prove to be negative over time is that it is really soft so while the kids love that about the pillow (I would prefer something firmer myself but it's not designed for adults!) I do wonder if it will keep the fluff after a few weeks of use. Time will have to tell but at this point, we're in for five stars!
5.0	Timely arrival. Exactly as described. Perfect fit for the medela pump and store bottles.
5.0	The absolute perfect addition to our home! It was even more beautiful than expected.
5.0	I registered for this bathtub after reading the reviews online & I could not be happier with it. My daughter is 3 months old & she is still using the hammock portion of the tub which holds her very well. I also love the caddy section which holds her shampoo & other items.
5.0	This bedding set is extremely nice! I love it! I washed it, and I am currently waiting on my 3 year-olds bed to get the full effect!<br />feels great and its very cute. Money well spent!
5.0	I love how compactly this fits in my kitchen and that I have the option to use the tray or pull the seat up to the table without the tray.  It is lightweight but sturdy and easy to take on the road.  Love this chair!
5.0	Bought this when I was pregnant with my first baby.  It was easy enough to use that our 8 yr old at the time could help.
5.0	"This playard has been WONDERFUL!!  It arrived earlier than expected, which was fab, and was very easy to assemble.  Our baby niece can now play happily in a safe environment when the adults in her life need a few minutes to do other things.  We have it set up on a carpeted area, so I don't know what it would be like on floors or tiles, although there are rubber pads on the \\""posts\\"" to keep it from slipping.  Sturdy but flexible to move around and reshape, I highly recommend this product."
5.0	i loved it, I used it since he was 1 month until he was 7, and I miss it now.  I used it on my back and my belly and he sat looking forward and facing me and he liked it all the ways. It is very safe and very practical.   I took my baby everywhere even for long walks in the beach, and to the shopping mall, he loved to touch everything in the boutiques while I choose the clothes so he lasted much longer than in the troller without getting bored. I highly recommend it.
5.0	Very sturdy. Still going strong and my son is almost 5 months old. He loves to sit up in it, so it serves as a support pillow for him now that he's a bit older. Also resists odors and stains.
5.0	I was happy with this bumper set. Maybe could have been made of higher quality fabric, but for the price, it fit the bill
5.0	My baby loves these pacifiers!! 😊
5.0	soft and perfect light weight blanket.  really a go to I think.
5.0	"I was concerned about this organizer not fitting on our changer.  The manufacturer's photo shows it on the back of the changer.  Our changer has that \\""sleigh\\"" style so I wasn't sure how it would work for us.  I went ahead and ordered thinking that I would use it on the crib or playard if need be.  I'm happy to say that it fits exactly on the side of the changer.  The only con that I found is that I wish that it had a second shelf for a standard package of wipes.  I'm not too worried about that, seeing as how the wipes will be the most frequently used item and will probably just sit on top of the changer anyway."
5.0	These cups are great, though I failed to notice they are not the insulated ones. No worry though, the girls don't mind.
1.0	DO NOT buy this mobile if the railing on your crib is over 2 1/2 inches.  Referring to the the railing that runs horizontal, not vertical.   It will not fit your crib. after 3 weeks of calling the company, I finally get someone on the phone who tells me they do NOT make replacement attachments.   Do not waste your time & money!
5.0	Great size for my kids lunches.  Lids are a little difficult to get on right now, but I know that will get easier with use.  Great color for my girls and because it's Tupperware my other lids are interchangeable for my son.  No leaks with fruit and yogurt.
5.0	This is a must for my 11month old son. He loves this puppy and all three of his taggie blankets. He had them when he was much younger but really didn't start showing interest until 7 months old.
5.0	Loved the colors of these, it's what drew me in first. They are great for a first set of blocks for your baby. Soft rubber, they do squeak a little bit (keep the pets away).
5.0	I don't know what people are talking about. I ordered mine the other day, and two days later it was here.  It is perfect in every way.  In our nursery we have three dressers and didn't want to add just a changing table, so this is just the perfect way to change an ordinary dresser to a changing table that we can still use later on.
1.0	I bought this crib because we were on a budget. I really regret buying this crib. My daughter who is 9 months puts everything in her mouth just like every other baby does. When I took her out of the crib after a nap I found white paint on her toungue and stuck to the roof of her mouth. I went to look at the headboard and rails of the crib and found  more paint that I scraped off with my fingernail. The paint is non-toxic and not harmful to her health which I am releived to know. ... So we are returning the crib and I will never buy from Delta Enterprise again!
5.0	This is a great car set. This is my second peg perego infant car seat and I recommend it. I work as a neonatal ICU nurse and teach discharge planning for newborns. There are several good car seats that basically differ in ease of use and installation along with padding and colors. The reason I like the peg perego is the ease of use. The straps adjust without threading, which for me is a huge plus. I hate adjusting traps on a monthly basis as the child grows. The peg adjust easily without rethreading and taking the seat off the base. It is a heavy seat compared win a few others, but the difference is  2lbs compared to the lightest seats. This car seat is a good deal at $180. The model shown was manufactured in July of 2012. I was afraid that I was going to get an older model for 180$, but was very pleased to see it was actually 2012. I've seen a lot of old model car seats on sale on amazon for high prices, which is a horrible deal considering they expire after 6 years. This one is also the leather seat which is a more expensive seat just for the leather. I also want to mention that the seat is also a very pretty dark chocolate color. It appears much lighter to me in the photos. Anyway it's a great deal for this seat at $180.
5.0	Delivery was prompt, product excellent.
5.0	Perfect if you have a Motorola video baby monitor and want to use it in different rooms at night without having to transfer AC adapter every time or night in our case.
5.0	I saw this suit online and had to buy it for my daughter.<br />She loves to wear it and cleans crawling our hardwood floors. .<br />The fabric is soft the scent does not smell toxic, so i let her wear it without concerns.<br />Family and friends were excited and had a great laugh about the pictures in the instruction manual.<br />I recommend the Babymob to every new parents, it is great entertainment for your child, help in the house and looks just so cute.
5.0	As a new first time Mom, I wanted something easy to use in the front carry position. The Bjorn is just that. Not complicated to adjust and clip in.
5.0	I bought this one and the other ballerina one for my daughters' room.  I was pleasantly surprised with the quality!  So happy with this purchase!!
5.0	Great for changing in public restrooms
5.0	My one year old LOVES this doll and so do I! It much cuter than the picture show and so soft!! It's a pleasure to hold in your hand and just the right size for a toddler. The only drawback is that the label says you can't submerge it in water to wash, but I don't know why, I might anyway. I love this doll!!
5.0	These (I ordered two) were perfect for a recent flight. The padding was thick enough that I felt fine checking them with the baggage rather than gate-checking. They arrived safe and sound.
5.0	So cute for baby shower gifts
5.0	It is pricey but been worth every penny. We've travelled a lot and the functionality has been perfect. Just the right thing to take into public restrooms or airplane loos instead of a whole diaper bag. Really like the clip handle on the outside. Leaves my hands free to carry baby into the loo and then a quick clip off and we're ready. Have had no quality issues - did buy mine in UK but that shouldn't matter....  Don't bother using the plastic wipes case, I usually use half filled resealable wipes packets.
5.0	I love this thing. I love how it compresses the mill so that it freezes flat. The frozen milk not only takes up very little room, it also defrosts really quickly.
5.0	These are highly adjustable and fold up nicely. And they block out noise, especially at higher frequencies. Good for taking your kid to a rock concert or hanging out on a runway or whatever loud activity you might have planned. While they are rated 6 months to adult, they might be a little tight for an adult to wear. They definitely fit thanks to the adjustability, but they are tight.<br /><br />Definitely a very fair price for high quality headphone style ear protection.
1.0	Thought this would be a nice safe, lightweight, 2 step stool.  It is, however problem is it's the same height as a 1 step stool.  My fault for not paying close attention to the dimensions.
5.0	This is one of the best 12 bucks I have ever spent in my life. My baby simply adores this toy. I never thought he will hang on to any toy for so long. It has been 4 months since I got this my baby is 7 months now and this is still his favorite. The designer of the toy has been so thoughtful of the colors, patterns, fabric material etc so well. My baby has got amused with every little thing dangling from the toy even today. He looks at it as if he is looking at it for the very first time. Love it when I see my baby get amused.
5.0	Great toddler sized pillow.
5.0	My son sleeps with his &#34;Brownie&#34; every night and every nap and has for 2+ years. We bought a replacement for one he eventually gnawed through and had a slight issue with some stitching.  I emailed Angel Dear directly and they were super fast and friendly to send me a replacement.
5.0	so cute. well dressed.  but run of color too much
5.0	Ordered the matching bedding. When I got it I didn't realize there was lime green on it however. Still love it tho
5.0	This is the second advocate 70 G-3 I have purchased. The newer model was well thought out by the Britax company. In the older model my son was always able to get his arms out and not have the straps secure around his chest. This newer model has a new safecell strap feature and keeps the straps in place. Another feature I love is the crotch buckle. Before I would always have to reach under my child to find the seatbelt buckle. The new model buckle sticks out towards the front so you don't have to search for it under your child's bottom. I also am very pleased with how secure I can get the carseat in my car. In all the other carseats I have purchased , I was always able to wiggle the carseat from side to side. With the advocate 70 carseat, it does not move at all. It is fastened so secure. This is the only car seat that makes me feel like my child is safe. It's the Cadillac of carseats!!!
5.0	Made of very nice soft cotton.  The shoulder snaps are the best!  You don't wake the up while putting it on.
5.0	I almost never wore disposable pads this size, because the leaking was inevitable.  I'm pleasantly surprised and there's so much to love about these mama cloths!  It's a very well-made pad, and I have seen several different types from ones made on etsy, ebay, and larger companies that are more expensive, and these are just as great.  This fits in a purse or pouch discreetly, doesn't have the annoying wrapper sound of a disposable, and the pul type backing provides extra protection.  Bottom line: it's thin, super absorbent, soft to the touch, washes really well, won't break the bank, and the pattern is adorable.  'nuff said?  In case it's helpful to have a look I posted pictures of one from a few different angles.
5.0	I searched for months for a crib set for our baby boy and finally settled on this one. I also purchased the crib bumper separately that goes with this set. I love the colors, very bright and cheery. The musical mobile is a great added bonus to the collection, our now 2 month old loves to look up and smile at it. The sheet and blanket are a little on the rough side, but I assume that to be the case with all crib bedding in this price range and the baby does not seem to mind :) . My favorite part about this collection is the changing pad cover. I have washed this cover probably close to 10 times now and it shows no sign of wear. The fabric is still super soft and the colors as bright as the day I opened it. I highly recommend this set to anyone who likes this theme. It is a great price for what you get! If I could criticize one thing it would be the wearable blanket. I find it to be rather useless and not necessary, I would much prefer having the bumper included instead of the wearable blanket.
5.0	It was way bigger than I thought it would be, but that validated the price. The kids love it and play with it often. This is one ball they can throw in the house!
5.0	Great tub tor pool toys for my 14 mo old granddaughter!
5.0	We bought a nearly $100 spring mattress at Target when my baby was first born thinking it would hold up for several years - boy, we were wrong! It only lasted about 1 1/2 years before the springs bent out of shape and became unusable. This foam mattress is not only super-lightweight, making sheet changes so much easier, it's covered in plastic all the way around so no more mattress covers! I read other reviews talking about how &#34;loud&#34; the plastic covering was, but those people must have very sensitive hearing. I got on it and rolled my head around (without any sheets on) and it was imperceptible. Once you get a sheet on there and a pillow, there's no &#34;noise&#34; whatsoever. It also fits my crib perfectly - no gaps, nice and tight. Will buy this again when #2 gets here in just a few months!!
5.0	The description says this is the only bouncy seat that truly bounces...and they are absolutely right!!  Instead of vibrating, this bounces! My little boy is 10 weeks old and he LOVES this seat. I never thought I'd find anything that could put him to sleep as well as his swing.  But this does the trick.      The toy bar is really easy to move.  The toys aren't as bright as those on other bouncers...but I just hang a couple extra toys on the bar when my little guy wants to play.    The fabric is also much nicer in person than it looks in the photos.  The colors are subtle, but the pattern on the fabric (with the little bee and snail) is really charming.
5.0	I loved it so I decided to get it for my son & daughter-in-law, after they received it they tried it out (put it their car) then called me to say how they also loved it, would I recommend this to others...sure would !!!
5.0	I love this product! Great value!
5.0	This thing is the greatest!   BEST Baby product out there!!!!!!<br />Those that bash it are not using it correctly.   For instance one lady here bashes it because she needs a second unit on the other side of the house.   Another says the bags split, they do only if you overpack it or don't use it correctly.   Another says she doesn't like it because the little doors get poop on them.   Well if you throw the poopy side of the diaper on the door then yes you do.   Duh.   Another said it smelled.   Well the bags are scented with an odor killing formula, but as with anything if you over fill it or leave it for days to rot then yes it does smell.<br />This invention is excellent.   The best thing that money can buy for your baby.
5.0	I LOVE my bamboobies! You won't regret trying them. They are super soft and protect my clothes from leaks. I am finally healing without ointments and other remedies! Woohoo for bamboobies!
5.0	My sister was having her 2nd baby so I got this as a gift. She loves it! She raves on the quality and says the item works great!<br /><br />Thanks Amazon!
5.0	This product is awesome...it is very inexpensive, yet very effective.  I love to take it with us to restaraunts to mill food for the baby and then we don't have to give our kids yucky jar food.  When using it at home, they get used to eating what I make at home...hopefully no picky eaters as they grow older.  It rocks.
5.0	Bought this for my niece. She gives birth in February so unable to give a fair rating at this time.  She did say some friends had recommended it.
5.0	Great to use and wash, top rack of dishwasher.  And it's okay if they get tossed or lost; cheap and easy to replace.
5.0	I looked a lot to find baby suspenders and to select a pair and these have been perfect! Our baby started wearing these when he was 2 months old and now is 10 months old. He's worn them with jeans, cords, and other outfits. They coordinate perfectly and draw a lot of attention for being downright adorable. He has a lot of room to grow in them too and they're a great deal considering the clips hold up well and the size is very adjustable.
5.0	It's impossible not to have a crib mattress protector on your baby's bed in today's world. I remember when my girls were small and we had these plastic ones that were waterproof but yet looked so uncomfortable to use! And you had to have one because those diapers leak at night. lThis Thema Home Mattress Protector has came a long way. Completely waterproof and does the job. I gave it to my niece because they had nothing on her baby bed. My sister in law loved it! Those leaky diapers are in the past she told me. They have a new baby on the way and plan on passing it down or I may need to buy another! So soft and fits her bed like a glove. I was able to buy this product during a promotion and am happy to share my experience with it.
5.0	Best buy .. It fits good my 3 year old toddler so it's awsome and its very pretty .
5.0	WORKS GREAT FOR MY STROLLER.
5.0	This is a great product! Just wish it was a little bit wider. If your child has a bit of weight on them then this is not the seat for them.
1.0	the bottle part was not pink as in the picture, the rest was. i could've bought the 4 bottle pack, but could tell the bottle was clear with pink letters. otherwise i suppose good as other drbrown bottles.
5.0	The book is great, beautiful print on the front cover (Green and could go well with boy or girl).  The pages are fantastic. Gives you room to write about family tree, the mother and father, the baby shower (wish that page was bigger). Gives you opportunity to put pictures too. I am looking forward to fill out all the pages.
5.0	What an amazing creation!  My granddaughter fell in love with this.  And this actually has some of the constellations that glow upon her ceiling.  Nice job!  Very well done...
5.0	I rarely write reviews, because few products really stand out to me. That being said, this is one of those products. Works excellently with my newborn. I would recommend to any parent or anyone with a baby in the house and you need some quiet!
5.0	These are great. Good size. Cute design.
5.0	Our baby absolutely loves this! We have been using it since she was born and she's 5 months old now!
5.0	I got the stroller for my grandson. Wanted a lighter weight but not too light.  It is perfect.  Britax Blink,in sprout.  Came in speedy time and so easy to get ready for use.  It folds easy (unless it is two men that clearly are challenged with anything)  What can I say. It is great.  Smooth performance, easy to move in all directions, and easy to clean.  Ordered the Black and green and is beautiful.  It is made really well and the material is very high quality.  Must see for yourself an am sure you'll agree it is great!
5.0	Great product fits well in my 2001 Alero and very well in my wife's CRV
5.0	We love the britax advocate car seat. We have owned it for 2 months now. The pattern is lovely without being overly girly.  Fits snug, it is big, but we drive an SUV and there is plenty of room still.  The hugs system can be tricky because you have to make sure the strap covers on te shoulder are pulled down or the straps won't tighten. Geatcarseat, highly recommended.
5.0	My daughter used these and reports that they are better than another, more expensive, brands because these absorb better in that the absorbent material when fully wet does not clump up like another brand did and, so, is more comfortable. She also liked that these had a smaller diameter so they did not appear beyond the edge of her bra. (This would be related to bra size.)<br /><br />The self adhesive strip, which attaches the pad to the bra she found to be a worthless addition as the strips become unstuck when the nursing bra is folded down for nursing. This problem is generic to all Breast Pads in her experience.
5.0	This sheet fit our Graco mattress perfectly.  Very soft and true to size.  We washed it first to get the new smell out.
5.0	It works as advertised.  Great gate for my child's bedroom door.
5.0	fits my vintage wooden high chair perfectly! it's exactly what I was looking for.<br />material is great, fabric pattern is better in person than pictured
5.0	This bag was so much better than I expected.  I wasn't sure of the color.  It is perfect.  Works with any outfit that I wear.  It is just perfect for traveling.  Many pockets when traveling abroad which is what I use it for.  Water proof inside.  Hold IPAD, IPHONE, KLEENEX.  WALLETS....TOILET PAPER (DON'T WANT TO BE CAUGHT WITHOUT WHEN IN A DIFFERENT COUNTRY) UMBRELLA, CAMERA AND STILL THERE IS ROOM....LIGHT....EAR BUDS AND THE STORAGE GOES ON.  NOT TOO HEAVY AND STRAP IN PERFECT FOR ME.  I THOUGHT I MIGHT BE DISAPPOINTED BUT ON THE CONTRARY I COMPLETELY<br />DELIGHTED.  OH! YES CHARGER FOR APPLE PRODUCTS.  THIS IS A WONDERFUL BAG.  IT IS NOT TOO WIDE.
5.0	Love this! My son is 6 weeks old, and a terrible sleeper! This has helped so much! He knows it's time to sleep when he gets wrapped up. I wish I has gotten this sooner! I plan on getting one for my friend who is expecting!
5.0	fitted well when he sat down to it and he feels very comfortable..easy to clean and very light to carry.:-0
5.0	Super soft and cute! I hope my new nephew loves it!
5.0	My daughter loves it!!
5.0	My son is 4 months old and he loves this blanket. He like to hold on to things while hes using his pacifier and it makes him feel comfortable. I love how it has the pacifier holder and teething corners. I would suggest this to anyone. Thanks
1.0	"The product itself is very nice, but it does not fit the size it says it should. I have a 3\\"" crib that usually fits with playard sized sheets, but this one is way too short for the mattress. I also tried it on my actual playard and again, it's way too short. Not even sure what kind of mattress this would fit because it's so small..."
1.0	I purchased this swing with my husband and mother-in-law. We were taken by how cute it was in the store, and cute it is! The elephants are cute. The womb sounds are cute. The swing is blessedly quiet. It has everything going for it, and then you try to put a baby in it. The 'pod' portion of this swing is completely ill-designed! If the swing is tipped downward, the baby looks like he will fall out, except for the harness! If it is tipped upward, so that the baby can look directly up at the elephants, the poor child's head is uncomfortably pushed cockeyed. It is a shame, because everything else about this swing works. My handy husband even thought he would try to fix the seat portion by rigging up something else. Alas, I'm thinking we need to buy an entirely new swing. I just don't want to tell my mother in law because she thinks it so cute.
5.0	I bought this a few weeks ago and I think the design of it is brilliant! The 2 sashes to tie are awesome, no dealing with straps that need to be adjusted and readjusted if my husband needs to use it.  No crazy latches to try and figure out while holding the baby. If you can tie a double knot, then you can use this wrap.  Keeps my baby nice and close to me, right where she wants to be. She is 6 months old and about 20lbs, so this has been a lifesaver since I got it for my arms and back.  I also tried it out on my toddler the other day with the hip carry position and it worked awesome and she said it was very comfy for her. I wish I had this years ago and had used it with all my kids.
5.0	I drive a Toyota corolla and this is the perfect size and I will be buying a few more. It was a little more difficult installing rear. I know my baby is too small for forward but I wanted to get a good look if it would work for the car both ways. Great and cute car seat!!
5.0	Great quality and the graphics are very cute! The price was great and we looked at others before purchasing this one :)
5.0	This high chair is amazing!! My 4 month old is still wobbly but the chair reclines just enough that she eats with ease! It has wheels which are very handy! The chair looks great! It's sturdy and easy to clean! Comfy for the baby as well! I found it complicated to put together! But that was my own fault! I put a peice on backwards!! So if it doesn't work with ease, call your husband!! :) I'd recommend this to every mother!
5.0	Can't beat a rattle. Baby has the pink/purple one as well. She double fists both rattles and smacks them together. Very durable so far and not terribly loud for mom. :)
5.0	Hi, I am a massage therapist and a father. I don't know what other reviewers were talking about!? This product isn't not slow at all! If you want a fast heat, turn the knob UP, possibly expedite by pouring warm water in from the faucet...common sense huh? Takes about 5 min to get yummy warm milk or de-solidify coconut butter in my work bottle!<br /><br />It saved me as a professional so much time and much cheaper that heaters designed for massage therapy...
1.0	This bag is beautiful but not functional. The turn lock make it difficult to open and their is not a lot of space inside. Ooyoo was not willing to exchange the bag for another one. Poor customer service
1.0	I bought this because of good reviews, but my experience is far from good. Cabinet drawers stopped rolling correctly and wouldn't close properly after about 1 month of use. I'm a construction manger and know how to read plans / drawing / instructions. I assembled the item to specs and am disappointed in the outcome. Save your money and buy better quality.
5.0	This is a nice one. Previously I used to have lot of knee pains when I bathe my son. right now its very comfortable and no knee pains at all. Its very soft and the latch in the back makes me hold it in the bathroom. very nice.
5.0	I did tons of research before buying a swing. I looked at countless reviews and finally decided on this one, even though it was a tad pricey. I ordered it from Walmart.com, and it was literally here the next day.  My hubby put it together (about a twenty minute job) another plus, and in baby boy went. The lights were awesome (more ambient than anything), the mobile was cute and caught his attention right away, and the swing motion was gentle and soothing, and the music was comforting. Okay, great!  So you can imagine my dismay, when the next day it stopped working!  It would swing, but barely, and all of the other functions just didn't work.  I Tried to troubleshoot to no avail. I called fisher price and we tried to troubleshoot.  I was using the wall plug, and she asked me if I had D batteries so I could test it.  Duh,I bought it for the plug, so, no I didn't have batteries. Nonetheless, she figured it was the motor housing, and sent out a new one.  It came in a few days, free of charge, and voila! Baby boy loves this swing, and fisher price has kept a loyal customer. Do yourself a favor and buy this swing. It has all the bells and whistles, and you will use them!  The plug is my favorite feature that most swings don't offer.  The lights will trip off in 7 minutes so you have to reset it, but no biggie...baby is usually sleep by then!
5.0	We have been using playtex bottles with our baby from day 1. I must say they were effective since we did not have any problems. I would definitely recommend this product to others due to the design, cost and easy availability.
5.0	Keeps the stains of the leather, so it works as it should. Kids make a mess in the back of the w221, needed this to keep the s class looking like a s class!!!
5.0	We got this seat as an extra for our spare vehicle.  We have a Britax marathon in our main car, but didn't want to spend as much on a second seat.<br /><br />Honestly, this seat is just as good as the Marathon.  I see little difference, and in some ways I like this one even better because I like the silver pattern.  The strap padding isn't as nice on this one, but who really cares?  Our daughter is 11 months old and very tall for her age.  She fits great in this seat, and fell asleep comfortably in it the first time she rode in it!<br /><br />The seat also fits perfectly rear-facing, in our fairly small Volvo S-60.  So I'd recommend it if you have a smaller backseat.<br /><br />If I had known, I would have just bought two of these instead of shelling out more for the Marathon in our primary car.  To me, the upgrades in the Marathon are minimal and the Roundabout is just as good, just as safe, and just as comfortable for your child.
5.0	We have two cameras paired to this monitor and we like everything about it. The image isn't HD, but it's enough for us to see if our boys have their eyes closed or open, and see their tummies go up and down. Never had any issues with using this at all.
5.0	Any product blamed lil Molly brooks must be awesome.
5.0	Great for a toddler and make portion sizes easy. Bought the matching bowl to go with these too.
5.0	By far one of the smartest purchases we ever made. Because we run on a schedule, we know about when the kiddo needs to eat, and we plan accordingly. Now, it plugs into your car, which is 9 volts, as opposed to your house, which is 120 volts, so it doesn't work as fast as a home warmer. Still, it has five-minute increments, up to 30 minutes, which is very, very useful. My wife agrees that we were foolish to wait so long to buy one, so if you have family or friends who are expecting, this makes a perfect gift.
5.0	My son likes freddie the firefly
5.0	Love it! So simple and efficient!!! Love that you can use the water you steamed with so you keep the nutrients!
5.0	First time or parent to many, bathing little ones is stressful. They are slippery little things when all lathered up. The Baby Bathtub Seat Support Sling removes a lot of the stress for parents.<br /><br />There are several features of this sling that I like:<br /><br />The sling holds baby out of the water. I like cupping the water over them and not having them floating in the bath water. This helps to keep water out of their eyes and ears.<br /><br />The four point attachment clips ensure ultimate support for baby especially along their back and neck. The slings is made from a super soft cotton blend that molds to baby holding them in place. Using this sling is like having an extra hand while you wash your little one.<br /><br />Baby Bathtub Seat Support Sling is sized to be a universal fit bath sling. It will fits most infant tubs including Karibu, BabyTrend, Aojia, Safety 1st, Fisher Price, The First Years, Primo and others. The clips attach over the lip on the infant tub at four points, locking the sling into place.<br /><br />This would make a great baby shower or welcome gift for new parents.<br /><br />Promotional or discounted product provided for review.
5.0	My husband was a hard sell to start cloth diapering.  The easy fit diapers are his favorites to use.  The hook & loop is super strong and durable, and it's nice that they agitate themselves out in the wash.  The new minky style is super soft on baby's bum too.
5.0	Brilliant item, just ideal for storing ur bits and pieces together. Perfect size for boot of the car. Ideal to take up at night time with new baby. Love it!
5.0	They work great. But there is always a little bit of formula left in the compartment. It's like it sticks there. Some also sticks to the lid and stays there till being washed out.
5.0	I reviewed this product already, but I will tell you again that I am very satisfied with it.  Administratively I thought the freight charge was high as a percentage of the value of the item.
5.0	I bought this to replace an older Skip Hop bag that I had to dispose of due to a darling toddler leaving a banana in it for far too long causing mold to form. Yuck! Although this bag is smaller than the one I was replacing, I have to say I love everything about this diaper bag! The two outside pockets have a magnetic closure which is helpful to keep items we reach for often. There are two pockets on the inside which are large enough to hold a decent amount of diapers in one and a large pack of wipes in the other. The insulated side pockets hold a typical sippy cup just fine - I just wish they were large enough to hold a small bottle of water for me too! The smaller zipper pocket is great to hold my wallet, cell phone, etc while the large zipper compartment can hold a change of clothes and some other necessities. The pattern of this bag is great as it doesn't scream diaper bag at first glance. I've gotten many compliments on this bag and for good reason, it's great!
5.0	I bought this exersaucer after receiving the Rockin' Jitterbuggy and having my baby love it.  We left that at my parents house, so we needed another similar toy for our own place.  I picked the exercsaucer because it has the same functions but includes many more items for my baby of 4 months to play with.  He has been playing in it since he was able to hold his neck straight, and as his legs have strengthened, he spends more time in it, though no more than 15 minutes at a time as I want him to develop other skills as well.  He loves it, and plays with everything now, turning himself around gradually to reach everything.  A good value if the baby plays with it every single day.
5.0	my daughter has one of these for her 18 month old.  I kid you not when the baby lays on this it is like instant magic quiet so soothing for her.  I watch in amazement how this little girl lays down on it and instant calm.  My daughter watches it in the swing machine when needed and then brushes it out with a metal brush.  Great baby gift I know I will buy one for my friends having babies.
5.0	After an exhaustive search for the right portable/mini crib I decided on the Da Vinci Annabelle for two reasons:<br /><br />1) I have the full-sized Da Vinci Anastasia crib that I am very satisfied with, and<br />2) reasonably priced.<br /><br />None of the collapsible cribs were very sturdy in my opinion (I also looked at these in stores).  I ordered this for a long visit at gma and gpa's house. Baby slept great!<br /><br />I would recommend the breathable baby bumper, and the Da Vinci coil mattress to go along with the crib because it is small and the breathable bumper will fit it PERFECTLY (it comes in two pieces and you only need to use the large piece), and the coil mattress is very comfortable and comparable to a decent full-sized crib mattress.<br /><br />Do note however that baby will probably grow out of the crib fairly fast.  I was using it when my average-sized baby was 5 months, and he fit nicely, but I'm guessing it may only fit him for one more visit and then it will need to be converted into the regular bed.<br /><br />Great purchase, would recommend!!
5.0	This is really too big to use to support a toddler's neck in a car seat during naps.  But it is SO cute and soft, we use it as a lovey.  It is also nice to use when you want to hold your child in a rocking chair and wouldn't mind a little rest yourself!
5.0	Finally found a pad I could use for my Storkcraft changing table which normal changing pads would not fit. I came across this and it works perfect!
5.0	Love the bigger basket that can handle all the parts from my Dr. Brown's bottles for my twins!
5.0	Goes very well with my stroller, lovely looking, good design, and contains everything I need when walking with baby! And I love the detachable purse that goes with it!
5.0	This thing is a tank and really well built. We had purchased a double Bob and it felt cheap and all of the accessories were expensive and felt crappy. We also have a single Baby Jogger, so we opted to return the double Bob and get this instead. Glad we did.
5.0	Complementary to buy for children, has been the evaluation of your others, think this is a good product, so I chose to buy!Purple, green is more beautiful than to buy after the price rise, gaining.
5.0	This is a magical device! Activates automatically when in water and gives you a colored light for temperature. The temperature ranges correlates to color very intuitively : blue for cold, green for normal, red for hot!<br />I spend a good 10 minutes playing with it. This makes a decent bath toy!Cannot want for my baby to check it out too :)
5.0	Ordered as a rocker for soothing grandchild.  This chair works great for that, and even better for rocking and soothing myself.
5.0	"I am very impressed with this unit so far.  I say \\""so far\\"" because I have set everything up and have played around with it.  Our baby hasn't arrived yet, so we haven't used it too much yet.  This is cheaper then other baby monitors on the market, but the quality seems great.  One complaint: I love that it can be used with skype, but the receiver part has to be plugged into a computer.  That is great if you don't need to move the receiver around, but it would be great if it could be connected to a wireless network.  Or even have an optional 2nd receiver that plugs into the computer and is wireless between the main receiver and the 2nd receiver.  Then the unit could be truly \\""wireless\\"".<br /><br />An update to this review.  The only other complaint I have is that this camera doesn't pan.  It doesn't advertise that it pans, so it works as designed.  I didn't know what I was missing until I decided to buy a different Samsung unit that does pan and scan, etc (multi camera unit).  This unit worked for what I needed it for...an infant/toddler in a crib.  Now that I have a toddler in a bed and an infant in a crib in separate rooms, I needed more functions and more cameras.  I gave this unit which was still working to a friend that is having her first, so hopefully she gets good use out of it as well."
5.0	Exactly what I wanted.
5.0	This was perfect and a decent price!
5.0	Great for my premiee when the 3oz was too big!
5.0	I bought this play yard for my grandchildren.  It's easy to put up and take down.  Read the directions carefully on set up and take down.  I read the reviews on the odor coming from the play yard, so I aired mine out for a couple of days and that was enough.  It is sturdy yet light weight enough to make it easy to store away each time after use.  I would highly recommend this product.
5.0	Easy to use and the toddler enjoyed wearing it.  We held him and buckled us and him in through the same loop.  Kept him close and he fell asleep easily wearing it while flying.<br /><br />Of course, now he's 4 and we have to buy his own seat.  :-(
5.0	LOVE these for my toddlers! Only issue is that the valves have started to break open from the middle so I have to find replacement valves. Just for the record, they WILL leak if thrown onto the floor, but I generally can put them right in my purse and they don't leak at all, unlike many sippy cups I have used before.
5.0	It is the best feeling knowing that you are going to be comfortable on any flight with the belt extender, everyone know the belts are way too tight and uncomfortable anyways, thats why I recommend this product to those who travel regularly! 10/10
1.0	This cheaply made product showed me a green color for boy...... I took A BETTER GENDER PREDICTOR (That cost less and is better) test the next week at 17 weeks and 3-4 days and it said Girl! Went to my ultrasound the next day and Dr. called my baby a SHE.......
5.0	This Entertainer from Baby Einstein by far is the best!!!!! <br />My son is 6 1/2 months old..... <br />and goes nuts in this!!! <br /> <br />Tonight, he was in it for 2 1/2 hrs <br />while watching Baby Einstein Videos!!! <br /> <br />Really, we could not be happier! <br /> <br />Baby Einstein products  <br />are the best. <br /> <br />Don't hessitate on this one,  <br />you won't be dissapointed! <br /> <br />Oh, the little red pegs at the base should always be put <br />down if your baby is on the floor....common sense =) <br /> <br />Great product, <br /> <br />Sandra <br /> <br /> <br />
5.0	Very nice product but a little pricey compared with other bumper pads. Almost didn't buy it because of the cost.
5.0	Very happy with this purchase!
5.0	For my grandchildren for Easter! Very sweet and plays Jesus Loves Me. So hard to find Easter gifts that aren't cartoony; bunnies or chicks! Since to me Easter is all about Jesus, a lamb is the perfect representation. Very nice product and arrived promptly.
5.0	The Carter's Monkey Bars Valance is a quality made item which compliments the bedding set very well.  I would recommend purchasing this as a part of the set.
5.0	Love it! The legs aren't as sturdy as I'd hoped, but it's still a great product.
1.0	This tub is the biggest waste of money and it is not safe at all. The non-slip surface becomes more slippery with soap and water. As a newborn, I had to use a big bath sponge to keep my daughter from slipping. As a 6month, she can get into it with minor issues but it is so hard to get her out of the tub. The front tray ended up scraping her legs that I only used it once. The suction cups don't work at all.
1.0	I'm really disappointed. These nipples flow faster than stage 1 should, and I wish I'd gone with a different nipple/bottle system.
5.0	This baby blanket matches the Enchanted Forest Lambs and Ivy set perfectly.  It was quite nice and well stitched.  There are no problems with the applique or stitching.
5.0	This is one of the simplest baby monitors to use: After taking it out of the box, just plug the power cord or charge the battery, and it's ready to use. The buttons on the monitor unit are straight forward, and I did not feel need to read the manual. Functionality wise, the Stella model is very basic, just like any other baby monitor, and it offers two way talking, music playing, night vision. etc. Although this product is only a baby monitor, there are a couple of stand-out features that I love about this product:<br />First, the monitor has a big screen. It's 4.3&#34; screen, and that's huge (and awesome!) for a baby monitor. Often times, with other products, I realized it was not easy to identify what's going on in the tiny monitor screen while observing my child. Even if the monitor has the perfect video feed of baby or child lying down on a bed in the room, I couldn't clearly see if his eyes were closed or opened. However, with this big screen, the same scene looks clearer now. The colors of the LCD screen are also very accurate in a bright room. At night without any light, the night vision works great as well. The night vision mode is always limited in quality and range in baby monitors, yet on this model it worked accurately.<br />Secondly, pan and tilt function is worth mentioning. I didn't realize how nice this feature was until I got to try it. If my son grabs the monitor, i can easily reposition it without having to get up. Considering how many times a toddler may be tempted to touch the monitor and you have to get up and reposition it. For this reason, this feature is one of my favorite. With a one year old baby, I don't have to worry about it, but with an older kid, it happens all the time.<br />There are a few other features I appreciated about this monitor as well. I liked the good range of wireless video feed. I didn't encounter any problems and signal issues with other wireless devices at home. The monitor has a pull out antenna for longer range, but I didn't have to use the antenna. This monitor has the best signal range I've experienced. I also like that the camera is quiet when panning and tilting. My kid is quick to notice noise from panning and tilting in other monitors, but there is no &#34;eeek eeek&#34; noise at all. And the invisible LEDs are wonderful! No distractions whatsoever for my child. However, as I find this monitor to offer excellent features, I do wish this product displayed current time and temperature on the screen as some other baby monitors do; the feature is very essential for me, especially because temperature in my household varies depending on which floor we are in.<br />Overall, this is a user friendly-designed and environment-friendly packaged baby monitor that offers simple, yet easy to use features. With a very good wireless range and long lasting battery, I know this will last in our household for a long time. Although this product's price is slightly high, I find this monitor is worth the purchase.t I didn't have to use the antenna. This monitor has the best signal range I've experienced.

5.0	These containers are great for a toddlers room. My wife keeps socks in one container, lotions and creams in the other, and diapers in the third.
1.0	These lack any sort of spongy absorbing ability (pad), so the &#34;piddle&#34; simply pools and eventually drains through the belt opening.
5.0	Great stroller! Love the sunshade and vented seats. Easy to use and push.
5.0	Love them and so does my son! Easy to clean and does not leak. Only had them one month so not sure on longevity yet, but no issues yet.
5.0	This item is wonderful. It's several gadgets all rolled into one and who doesn't like that? It saves you on space in your baby's nursery which everyone needs. This neat items acts as a clock, feeding reminder, soothing/sound machine, temperature indicator, and a night light. This cute little star design is trendy in any baby's room. Now here is a little more information about this item. Depending on the temperature in the room the star can glow Red (too hot) or blue (too cold). The only problem I have found with the temperature glow is it seems to glow red when the room is fine.  The item can be plugged into the wall to save on batteries or you can use batteries for convenience. It helps you keep track of which side your baby nursed from last which is really cool for those early morning feedings. It acts as a soothing sound machine for your baby and it acts as a nightlight which can be on a timer or kept on all night long.<br /><br />Overall this item is wonderful for an expectant mother or a new mother. The item is a little on the pricey side but considering it acts as so many gadgets it is worth it.
5.0	I like the bright colors that this has to offer. I also like the convenience of it being a fold up play yard. Would definitely recommend to a friend!
1.0	"I bought this item as \\""new\\"" and received it as USED. The plastic is filthy, dirty with scratches, dings, dents, and stains. This was supposed to go in my babies nursery along with all of the other bumblebee products I had bought, but I wouldn't put this near a flea infested dog!!! I am disgusted. I sent the product back for a replacement, and you would never believe that they sent another used product!!!!!!!!!!!! I am dumbfounded to say the least. The only offer Amazon is willing to make me is to keep it and give me $8.00 off the purchase price----are you kidding me???? KEEP IT???? Or just send it back for a refund and have no mobile to match my babies room. No one can seem to give me any answers as to why used products are being sent out, but I want and deserve to know as a customer why this is happening. I AM TICKED to say the least."
5.0	These Munchkin Xtraguard Dual Action MultiUse locks have been amazing! Keeps my very strong 19 month old out of the dishwasher AND the toilet. No problem installing. He's about as strong as a 4 year old and he can't pull them open. My 6 year old daughter has no problem detaching to use the bathroom and re-attaching them.  Easy to install and easy to use.<br /><br />UPDATE- We now have these on our toilet, on the dishwasher, the fridge door, the freezer door and the oven. Super strong and he can't pull them open!
1.0	DOES NOT FIT ALL STROLLERS.  At least not my Graco stroller.  I had to fight to get it attached to the tray.  My son can pull it over onto himself with ease.  I'm constantly moving it back upright.  Just does not work.  Someday someone is going to have to explain to my why I can buy a highchair with toys attached but can't seem to get something that works for my stroller.
5.0	In an act of desperation, I came online and dropped $40 in teethers one evening... of all the ones tried, (cloth washcloth types, fluid filled squishy ones, fluid filled rigid ones, and probably others I'm forgetting) this was her favorite by far!  So easy for a 4 month old to grasp and get into her own mouth.  I will be buying these as shower gifts for my pregnant friends.
5.0	Best pouches ever--love these!!
5.0	Love this product! My kids both have several of the baby Jack blanket loveys! High quality material and they are really well made. I've also had them do some custom work and they are accommodating!
1.0	There is no listing of quantity.  That is why I can't buy this.
5.0	If you have a big baby that has outgrown standard swaddling blankets and still needs a good tight full body swaddle, these are great.  They are also good if your baby runs hot and other blankets are too warm.  They can also multipurpose as a nursing cover, car seat shade, stroller shade, burp cloth, toy, changing pad, etc.  If someone tells you they are too big or flexible to be good swaddling blankets, they aren't doing it right.
1.0	Don't bother buying this matress pad. It leaks right through it, on to the sheet!
5.0	Great for toddler pillow
5.0	This bag is really awesome. It is SO light weight which is what I was looking for. I hated all the other bags that started off too heavy to even want to fill them! So after seeing this in the stores and playing with it there, I decided to look here on Amazon to see if there was a better deal - and there was!<br />I have not had my baby yet but am due in 28 days, so it's all packed and ready to go!
5.0	Finally someone created exactly what we've all needed... A towel created long enough to bundle up babies (even toddlers) where the hood portion is positioned so that child can remain facing parent while also keeping the parent dry. Genius! Why didn't I think of this? ;-)
5.0	We have been using this bottle warmer for about 5 months and it works great.  We have had no issues with it.<br /><br />One note: we found if you use glass bottles, you don't need to use as much water because it gets too hot.
1.0	There is absolutely no night vision on this thing, which is pretty much why you need a baby monitor....for when they're sleeping!
5.0	Gate is awesome.  We have it on our front porch to keep the kids from falling off down the steps.  Only drawback i can see is if you arent familiar with it, its almost impossible to open.  The UPS guy has a time with it everytime he comes to the house.
5.0	This sling is awesome! At first, I was a little discouraged and lacked confidence when using it but then I watched a YouTube tutorial on how to wear it properly and now I am in love with this! I feel badly for those who buy the hundred dollar slings. This one is fabulous, cute, and most importantly safe with a comfy baby!
5.0	These are the real deal, best shave !
5.0	This purchase arrived quickly and in perfect condition. It is easy to assemble and adjusts to fit different tables. Te children enjoy sitting up to the table to enjoy their meal with the family.<br />Excellent investment!
5.0	Perfect!  Grandson loves it.
5.0	My daughter LOVES this item. My only complaint is that I was told it had an apple scent and mine was not scented at all.  But as for as the cube and how it functions it keeps my daughter occupied for 10 min at a time.....amazing for a 3 month old who has NEVER grabbed anything before now....we LOVE it...and also highly recommend the garden bug footfinders if you can get a pair.
5.0	Good quality and beautiful color! Exactly what I was looking for.
5.0	Awesome product for our new daughter.  Easily adjusts for height and is also easy to move around with wheels to assist.  The romovabke tray makes it easy to clean too. So much bang for your buck!
5.0	We use this every time we go out to eat.
5.0	I run a small daycare and decided to purchase these cups. I have used sippy cups before and found nothing is really &#34;spill proof&#34;. There cups are. I love this as they teach the children how to drink out of regular cups yet they can not spill any liquid on them or anywhere else for that matter. I have tried the &#34;stress&#34; test where you lay a cup on it's side for a long time, most times the cup will start to leak because of the pressure yet not these. These cups are the best! If you want a spill proof cup that will teach the child how to drink out of a regular cup, then this cup is for you!!!
5.0	Great toy for babies just learning to walk. They love the popping sound.
5.0	This product really works.. Price is a bit mmuch but worth it....
5.0	"Due to the reviews I have been debating over the purchase of this HK purse.  Thankfully I just went for it and love it!  It is larger than expected (think large LV purse or duffel) but can be easily used as an everyday purse.  As the label suggests, it can be used as a 'girl's' purse, I do not believe this since it is perfect as a large purse or baby bag for an adult.  (Too large for any kid I know.)  The product does come from Japan but in my case, the product had a label on the bag that stated \\""Japan only\\"" but then was in full Chinese which was confusing.  This is a common case in Chinese remakes though so it's hard to tell what is real and what isn't.  In my case, I noticed the accessories are Chinese HK since the eyes and ears are a bit different in this country compared to Japan.  Non-HK addicted would not notice this though.  The quality of the purse was just as expected for the price.  The feel of the outside material is similar to a LV while the inside is lined with a bright gold material.  Everything seems to be well built in my case and I have used it for a few weeks now and I do not notice any wear-and-tear.  The gold on the handles might wear off in due time but I think that would happen with just about any gold painted handle.  Stitching is of good quality and decorative accessories such as the HK key-chain and pull-tab are nice heavy quality and will hold up for years I think.  All-in-all, I'm thrilled I made this purchase and I'm thinking of getting the smaller purse and the wallet to match now since I'm confirmed."
5.0	Love these! stays on the table. Easy to clean. Educational. Perfect.
5.0	I feel my kids are very safe and the seat belt is very well positioned on them in this booster.
5.0	We recently moved to London from California and on the first cold day I knew I had to have the Babyganoosh! My daughter loves it, and enjoys sitting in her stroller when we are out and about in this cold weather. It is definitely water resistant and cleans off very easily. I like the extra flap that fold up, I use that when she is napping to keep the wind off her face. Definitely recommend for anyone in a cold weather location!
5.0	We loved it. Very functional, the night vision works very well. We recommend. You will be able to monitor your baby all the time.
5.0	Bright red color makes my old bugaboo stroller look brand new again. Good quality, so far I have no complaints!
5.0	Great sunscreen.  Pleasant smell and does not leave any white film.  Kids love it.
5.0	My son loves his car seat so much! It is comfortable and very cool looking and looks to be much safe then the two others he has had as a toddler.
5.0	The turtle itself doesn't look like much, but the stars it makes on the ceiling are great.  It only works at night when the room is very dark, but that's when we need it.  Our daughter was always fussy going to bed and we tried mobiles and music and stuffed animals, but this is the one thing that really helped.  The stars cover the whole ceiling and some of the walls.  She loves to look for the moon, which we would move by turning the turtle.      Now she's older (2 years old) and still goes to sleep with it on.  Now she can change the colors by herself and she picks it up and moves it around so the stars move around the room.  We bought some more to give as baby shower gifts.
5.0	We decided on this over the standard highchair. I love that there is no cloth so it is very easy to keep clean. Plus the &#34;rain forest&#34; is a great distraction for our son while we are getting his food.  We will definitely be taking this on our vacation!
5.0	Easy to use as it uses your cars factory seat belt to strap in.  Daughter loves it!
5.0	Did exactly what it was supposed to do :)
5.0	Soooooo soft.<br />Got it for my kids to wash their delicate faces.<br />Great size too!
5.0	I love this diaper bag! After trying several others and obsessing over the adorable Aztec pattern, I finally took the plunge. Several people complained about the hidden bottle storage and not fitting bottles or sippy's in it. I'm confused about that because the bottle storage seems to have plenty of room! I'm due with a baby in May, but I have been storing my 2.5 yr old's 10 oz sippy cups and there is ample room for them.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. Very comfortable to carry especially for a smaller framed person like myself. It doesn't feel bulky or like I'm carrying a weekend bag around.<br />2. I love the mommy pocket. It's very spacious! Enough to fit more than I carry on a daily basis. I fit my iPhone 6, iPad mini, large wallet, headphones, lipgloss, Chapstick and granola bars for me.<br />3. The straps are great. I keep the shoulder strap short and don't wear the bag cross body. The short straps are convenient for a quick grab.<br />4. I feel like this bag has ample room. Because it is taller rather than wide you will end up kind of stacking things inside. I prefer a tall bag to a wide bag for comfort when carrying it.<br />5. The front outside pockets are huge! I can fit all the snacks I carry for my 2.5 yr old easily in one side! I love that they are easy to get to and still concealed. I imagine when the baby comes I'll keep a couple burp cloths and a pacifier in the other one.<br />6. The hidden bottle storage is a pro for me! I love that the bottles or cups are not exposed to the elements and that the bag ends up looking like an adorable purse.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. I wish it had more internal organization. There's only two large pockets inside. They are big enough for a few diapers and wipes, but another pocket on the other side of the inside would have been great.<br />2. If I don't zip the main compartment, the bag is awkward to carry and kind of folds in on itself. This could also be because I'm not stuffing the bag at this point.<br /><br />I will update this review after May and baby #2 is born.
5.0	My 7 month old loves to teethe on it as well as use it as a binky clip. It is very cute
1.0	I bought the 10 oz version of these cups at my local warehouse club as a set of 4 thinking I was getting a great deal.  I was hoping to get my 15 month old daughter adjusted to a different kind of sippy cup but these are the worst sippy cups I have ever used!  From day one they leaked.  Any time my daughter would leave this cup on its side, there would be a big puddle on the floor and almost the entire bottle was empty.  Even if you just shake it around a bit after filling, double checking that all pieces are tight and secure, it will spray liquid around.  Assembly is not at all easy once taken apart for putting in the dishwasher.  I opted to hand wash them every time because I hated the hassle.  Too bad I bought 4 of these because they are all going to the trash.  Terrible product.
5.0	I had bought one of these at an arts and crafts show. Also looked up how to make one from a wash cloth on the internet, but mine never come out as cute as these. They are soft and hold up well.  I also bought the multi dot bunnies from the same supplier. They are just as cute and your aren't trapped into the classic pink or blue.
5.0	The best burp cloths on the market, in my opinion. They cost more than others, but they work better than the others too. They also get softer the more they are washed. Love this brand. 100% would buy these again.
5.0	This is a great infant insert. My daughter was very fussy when she was little but once I put her in this she would fall right to sleep. She loved being bundled up in this. It is easy to use and very soft. I would put her in her ergo with this insert for grocery shopping because she hated her car seat. This worked very well. It was worth the money. The only con was when I was in hot weather she would get sweaty in it. Other than that it is great!
5.0	I had been looking at waterproof bibs for my 2 year old who likes to wash the dishes with me. We have been making quite the watery mess in the kitchen. This is an awesome bib and he can't get it off.
5.0	This is a great diaper bag.  Lots of compartments for all of babies needs.  The shoulder, sling-type strap makes it easy to carry without feeling too heavy!  Men like this look because it's not too feminine for dads!!
5.0	Nice and thick (protects baby's head when he tries to sit up, but then flops his head backward).  I replaced a two-sided pad where my child kept scooting upward and hitting his head on the wood... the extra side creates a built-in head cushion.
5.0	I've been using this since my daughter came home from the hospital.  She is 3 months now and I love it! It reclines and there's like a kick stans type thing to krep her back so or doesn't rock. She enjoys it also!
5.0	These spoons are great!  They are so comfortable to feed our daughter with (6mo) and the size of the spoon is great. We currently are using the silicone end so it's comfortable on her gums. They wash up well and look great as well.  Would definitely recommend these to anyone looking for spoons to begin feeding their little one with.
5.0	My three year old doesn't use this as much as she did before but she still has it in the upstairs bathroom. It was great! She felt more secure and it helped her to use the potty without it! A great product!
5.0	I bought this seat for my granddaughter to be installed in my car when we have her. Installation went pretty smooth and there are many adjustments to get it just right for her. As she grows it's pretty easy to make changes with the harness without having to remove the seat, Bottom line-good quaulity, well thought out,glad we have it.
1.0	This was previously sold as BabyVue and we bought it and it stopped working after a month.  The monitor stopped connecting with the camera.  Bad  product so save your money and buy something more reliable.
5.0	We love the car seat so far! It is super comfy and feels very durable. Love that it comes with strap covers because they were crash tested with the car seat. It's rear facing up to 40 lbs. wasn't very difficult to install. I would still like to have a local official check that we installed of correctly, just to be safe. The only thing I wish is that the cup holder and seat cover could be removed for washing purposes but they seem easy enough to wipe down. We have a Waterproof pad for the seat just in case :) these are definitely not deal breakers for us!! The car seat hits all major requirements on our list. Comfortable, safe, functional, and aesthetically pleasing.
5.0	My daughter is 3 months old and loves this mobile! I also started out with a coordinating mobile for the nursery and read about this one and fell in love with it! The remote control is heaven sent-hang it on the door knob and your little one will never even realize you had to re-start it. My daughter falls asleep to the ocean setting every night! The interchangeable toys are a great for your childs developmental needs! I have recommended this to 3 of my friends when I have helped them register!
1.0	These are so hard to wash and feel confident that you got them completely clean without anything left in the crevices.  Wished they were really reusable.  Maybe they can be redesigned for true reuse.
5.0	I had trouble finding just fitted sheet and pillow case sets in fun designs for my two young boys, I was so excited when I found these! Great price and good quality.
5.0	This is probably the best toilet seat cover to protect my toddler when going out!! It covers the whole toilet and her little hands never touch it! I am so relieved i can have these handy in my purse!!' Yes! I Recommend!!!!! I buy them regularly in bulk quantities for peace of mind!
5.0	This is my second set of these bottles and they are just as good as the first. My kid never had any issues with reflux or gas or any sort of burping at all so no reason to change a good thing after I accidentally ruined the first set. They are incredibly annoying to wash, since there are so many parts, but this would not be an issue if you plan to toss them in the dishwasher.
5.0	Loved the NUK trainer cups.  They made the bottle transition so easy, but our 13 month old daughter's teeth came in early and in abundance so we had to stop using them when she tore open the spout.  We tried ALL of the Nubbys because they have thicker silicone, but the spouts fit poorly into the lids and her milk pours down the front of her (not to mention the horrible suction). Plus, two of them cracked all the way through after being dropped from her high chair.  We then tried switching to the Playtex hard spout cups, but their flow is too slow and the Disney First Years cups have too large a spout.  This cup is PERFECT!  It is easy for her to gently tip this cup and drink.  She doesn't get frustrated and it is not to big or bulky for her to hold.  The pattern is so charming (way cuter in person) and also comes in an adorable turquoise and pink.  We made it through a whole shopping trip without soaking the front of her shirt!  Definitely buying more!!!
5.0	These loveys are amazing! I bought the raccoons for my son before he was even born. It took him a few months, but around 6 months old he started carrying around his &#34;Chewie&#34; (as we call him) all the time. We take Chewie everywhere, and so far (almost 1.5 years in) they have held up great. The three-pack is definitely the way to go (we actually have 6 so far), it's good to have multiples to store in the car/diaper bag. Also, if your kid is like mine they end up turning into a slobbery, disgusting mess and you'll probably go through 1-2 a day. Our Chewies are constantly being rotated through the washer/dryer and have held up well to repeated washing/drying. The only thing I've noticed is a little wear/discoloration on Chewie's paws (my son sucks/chews the paws, so I expected this to happen). They seem to make great teething soothers and they are certainly a good choice for a lovey because they are easy to pack, easy to replace if lost, and easy for little hands to hold. I can't say enough good things about Angel Dear!!
5.0	So darn cute and arrived fast!
5.0	Nice cups, I like that the handle twists independently of the top so that the spout can always be centered very easily.  These are my baby's favorite sippy cups, so we ordered several.
5.0	I bought this for my 7-month old daughter...this is a very good product to help babies sit-up and feed them. can control them and feeding time is reduced.
1.0	the paint is coming off of the pictures and we 've not had this up for 5days!<br />I use it as a playmat for my twin 6month old and I will have to find alternative since it's not a safe option
5.0	After struggling with other portable cribs, I found the BAbybjorn Travel Crib to be the easiest to use in every way. It is very simple to set up and to take down. One person can do it in 2 minutes. It is also very light to carry which means that it actually is used a lot. It is well worth the $$$.
5.0	These are a fantastic tie. They are easy to use and you can rest assured they will not hurt baby as they are applied to the outside of the diaper. I purchased them for our daughter to use for her daughter and she is very pleased as they are easy to use.[[ASIN:B0031AP83K Snappi Cloth Diaper Fasteners - Pack of 3 (Light Blue, Bright Blue, White)]]
5.0	Our 1 year old granddaughter really likes this
5.0	We love out portable &#34;internments centre&#34;))
5.0	"This seat seems very comfortable for my little girl to ride in. Like the Decathlon Odyssey, it reclines very well for rear facing (we haven't used it forward facing yet) and is also very padded for her comfort. The print is so adorable and super soft. I love that Britax has the \\""hugs\\"" system because not once have I had to untwist those darn harness straps like in her infant seat. This seat is also a breeze to install. This is definitely one I recommend!!! 5+ stars!!!!"
5.0	Really happy with the inflatable pillow!<br />As good as the classical version.<br />Baby and mommie are happy and enjoying nice breastfeeding when travelling<br />I recommand this product!
5.0	omg this was an awesome idea. now I can stop using plastic bags to hold wet clothes. I can put everything in the wash and reuse.  the is was a great bargain in price. had lots of styles to choose from.  and came really fast in the mail.
5.0	My daughter can't get enough of these wubbanubs. Great marketing to have different cute animals to choose from. Of course we have almost every one in our collection :)
5.0	My son was getting too big for the blanket our friends in New Zealand sent him when he was born.  So, we decided to get him another not knowing if he would trade his beloved &#34;blanky&#34; for something else.  Well, the softness and the printed dinos did the trick and he loves these sheets and blanket.  Highly recommended!
5.0	It was just what my daughter was looking for, came in a timely manner and looks great. The colors were true colors!
1.0	Can't keep it clean and the buckle only stops him long enough for me to get over to him to stop him from getting out.<br /><br />Looking to replace with a vinyl fabric one.
5.0	These are well made, sturdy and cute.  We actually purchased these for a church function for high school kids to play Fruit Ninja with a plastic sword.  They held up very well!  (and surprisingly the kids had a blast)  Nice size for little hands.  Having a couple of fruits with 2 halves is nice for pretend cutting and the banana peeling is just neat.  Also, having the basket made of corduroy gives a texture difference.  These would be safe for babies to mouth on too, so big sis or brother (i.e. Mom!) wouldn't have to worry about little ones getting into their things.
5.0	we have used a couple different types of outlet covers in the past and these are the best! and best yet once they are installed you will never have to worry about it again you can leave it on forever and it is not inconvenient at all.
5.0	I have given this Kathy Kruse towel doll as a baby gift several times. The quality is very high and it is a perfect size for little hands. Cute!
5.0	I bought this for a baby gift and they loved it.
5.0	A must for parents bending over the tub. Just be sure to hang it to dry as it will mildew underneath.
5.0	I thought this suitcase was absolutely adorable.  My granddaughter is going on two years old and when I have her come for sleepovers it was fun to see what she decided to pack in her own little bag.  It is just the right size for a smaller child to put their little things in.  Mom of course still packs a bag with the other clothes but the main purpose in getting this cute, smaller suitcase is for the child's enjoyment in packing their special items.  I highly recommend it.  To me it was worth every penney.
5.0	We live in a very hilly area in CT and been using this for 3 weeks thus far. Being a hilly area I love the safety strap and break. Really enjoy the ease of the one pull fold and if it matters to you we get a lot of questions about it. Find it very light pushing up and down our steps. We also have a Quinny Moodd for city / shops etc and love both. I bought the adapter for a Chicco Keyfit 30 infant seat and (unless I'm doing it wrong) have to pull the adapter out just before folding where the Quinny Folds within but that's more of an adapter point. It only takes a second even if I am doing it wrong mind... Really happy with it.
5.0	Doesn't work well on carpet, but didn't expect it to.  easy to assemble. good quality.
5.0	It arrived quickly and was exactly as described.
5.0	Great pillow for nursing my underweight twins at first. Nice and super wide, provides extra padding for back support, too, which was a nice surprise.<br /><br />I have a larger chest (36DD before pregnancy) so trying to position my breasts to my babies' mouths was a challenge. But this may work for smaller chested women so I'm not going to knock the pillow for that.<br /><br />In addition, one of my twins had a poor latch causing him to distress after about 10-15 minutes. So I unfortunately had to change my strategy -- now I EBF one twin & nurse the other. Hard decision but now that it's been a few weeks it's the smartest decision I could have made. Therefore, I don't need this huge pillow for just one baby.<br /><br />But I still recommend it & wish other moms of twins luck with breastfeeding.
5.0	My daughter said she thought he was too young at 2 months to have it but he was really chewing on his hands so she helped him hold it and he was dueling every where and did try to keep putting it in his month which I thought will be good for coordination with him trying to get it in his month by him self he seemed really like it. And it is really cute.
5.0	Seems sturdy enough for my toddler
5.0	I got this for my son when he was cutting his first molars. When I got the necklace, I put it on him and my the next day no more medicine!  By the second day, happy baby.
5.0	It may sound weird, but I kind of love these things.  When our son started walking at 10 months he got into everything and caught his fingers in drawers several times.  We installed these all over the kitchen and in the bathrooms and they work great.  The downside to these is that its a pain to find the magnet every time you want to open a cabinet.  We solved this problem by buying a pack of neodymium magnets and fashioning them with a little handle to make them easier to grip (or you could just buy extra magnet keys).  We put one key on the sink (metal) and one on the fridge, which was just about within arms reach of every cabinet in the kitchen.  I liked these so much I build a bookshelf with secret compartments that have no handles and can only be opened with magnets.  If you screw the magnetic piece down to hard it could cause the lever to bind up an not release.  If this happens back off on the screws a little bit until it pops out.  They've been in for 2+ years and haven't had a single issue yet.
5.0	I have been using this bottle brush for about two years. It is very gentle on the bottles while getting them clean. I really like the smaller brush for cleaning pump equipment. I know some people have complained about the soap dispenser - I have not used that piece so I do not have an opinion. This brush is so gentle I bought one for my parents to use on their wine and scotch glasses.
5.0	Love it. Loved it even more watching grown adults try to figure out how to open the toilet. Bahaha
5.0	What can I say - this is THE cutest support there is and it works! A must buy!
5.0	Skip Hop is really a line to use at home or school very different and entertaining, I'm sure my son will love it as I did.
5.0	I purchased this product a month ago, and now can't imagine not having it.  It is still sticks to the wall strongly.  Having said that, it is on a wall of the tub that does not really get wet.  It holds all bath toys and shampoo/soap neatly, keeps the bathroom clutter free, and makes post-bath clean up a snap.  In addition to being convenient, it is clean, and an attractive addition to a child's bathroom.
5.0	So far so good!  The fabric is soft and there's lots of cushion in the seat for comfort.  It's sturdy and I like the extra protection around the head.
5.0	Love this for stripping my cloth diapers and cleaning the dingies from our white clothes. Works well with lots of rinses.
5.0	I was debating between these and the spring loaded ones. Glad i saved the money and went with these...they're hard for little fingers to get out (she tried once, failed, and lost interest -- story of my life, right?) but i haven't had a problem either using plug prongs or my fingernails to remove them.  I use these in every room of the house except her bedroom, where i sprung for the spring-loaded ones (ha - see what i did there?). I figure when she's done with her crib and is wandering around the room when she should be sleeping, she'll have more time to figure out how to remove the little plastic ones.  Point: Worth the money for the more-often-than-not supervised parts of the home.
5.0	This is our second book.  It is so helpful to have at home when you wake up @ 3am and can't remember what happened 2 hours ago... you'll know what I mean when you get there.  It is great to have around because things blend together very quickly.  We also give this to daycare and it is helpful to track when she ate and what is going on while we are away.  The notes part at the bottom is helpful as well, we use it for marking bath days, Dr visits and other events.  I would suggest picking up 2 of these books right away.  We didn't realize we were running out of pages until we only had 2 days left.<br /><br />Pick this up, you won't be sorry.
5.0	We went without a changing table for several months as we were reluctant to buy and store yet another piece of furniture, but our aching backs said changing the baby on the floor was for the very young.  The changing table arrived in great shape - it was packed well and there was no damage that we found.  The wood stain is dark and pretty.  Assembly was very easy.  We opted to not install the wheels as we have wood floors and the locks on the wheels are not enough to keep the table from moving around while you are trying to change the baby.  The table is very sturdy without the wheels.  The padding leaves much to be desired, but the baby only stays up there long enough for a diaper change, so I wasn't expecting a Sealy Posturepedic mattress.  My only misgiving is that the shelves are exposed, and no matter how I arranged the baby's supplies, it still looked messy, so I bought baskets to help disguise the chaos.  For the price of some nice wicker baskets, though, you can come pretty close to the price of a changing table that is enclosed.
1.0	My 3 month old son loved his rainforest bouncy...until...he cut his foot on the vibrating compartment...where you put the batteries into it. I am returning the product and I will not buy another one from Fisher Price. Poorly designed.
5.0	"My one year old is blind and I bought these for his birthday.  GREAT sensory toy.  Love them!  I especially like the biggest ball.  Each ball has different \\""nub\\"" texture too...one is more pointy nubs, one is more rounded soft numbs, etc.  Great toys!  My 5 year old son likes playing with them too!"
5.0	I got this for my new grandbaby who should be here in about 6 1/2 months.  My husband and I became certified scuba divers a couple of years back and we just love the ocean and marine life.  I am hoping to get an early start on instilling that love in my new<br />grandchild very early.  The book is very soft and so colorful.  I just know he/she is going to love it.
5.0	I really do love this car seat.  I just installed it a few days ago and I already know I made the right decision in purchasing it.  My 4 year old son is tall and weighs almost 60 pounds.  He is a big guy.  He fits in the car seat just fine.  I do have a few minor changes Britax should make on this car seat.  The cup holders are not deep enough.  My son's cups fall out of the holder each time we turn a corner.  I would also like to see the armrest positioned higher and with the ability to be lifted up.  Other than these few minor things, the car seat is a great purchase.<br /><br />I read hundreds of reviews on this car seat and I want to address the one complaint that consistently was made.  In regards to the SecureGuard clip, I don't see a problem with this safety feature.  Like I said, my son is really big for his age.  This clip is easy to use.  It doesn't rub him anywhere.  I think if you really care about your child's safety and you understand how dangerous it is to have a lap belt around your child's abdomen, you will appreciate this feature.  I think it takes a little bit of extra time to use this feature, but so what?  It's worth it to have my son's abdomen free of the belt.
1.0	I actually received a monitor for my shower and gave it away, so that I could buy the Pet Sensor for my animals.  Constantly, the beeping in the night that jolted you out of a sleep. Now, the monitor has completely died, it can be plugged into the wall and still shows low battery and shuts off. I still have never even been able to get the compartment open to put a seperate battery in it. The item sucks for the amount of money you spend on it. I emailed the company about the problem and they never responded, considering it died after just having it exactly a year.
5.0	I love my moby wrap, so I thought I would get a swaddle blanket also. I'm glad I did I love it too. It's large enough too swaddle small to medium babies, and when they get bigger it works as a regular blanket for sleeping. Great for stroller rides, nursing cover, sun shade (car seat or stroller), to cover changing tables or what ever you need. Great range of colors, we got the chocolate, it's very pretty.
5.0	Okay- here's the deal. I got this to line my cat carrier. My cat is afraid of patterns so I just turned it over and folded it in half. It works great in the cat carrier- not so crinkly that it scares her (she's a rescue and has some noise issues). I would think you would never, ever just put your child on a filthy diaper changing table- so these are cute and look woven tightly enough to keep  your baby safe.
1.0	The toy is probably a great product.  However when we received it from Babyage, the box was taped shut, and the tie-downs in side were balled up, as if it had already been opened and returned.  My wife opened the box and the toy has scuff marks on it, and we couldn't even get it to work.  We called babyage and they were nice enough to refund the price of the toy (minus shipping of course) and then just told us to keep it (at that time we didn't know that it didn't work).  Shortly thereafter we got an email from them asking to talk to them first before submitting our review on Amazon, so I sent them the same letter that I'm writing here and that was over 2 weeks ago and we have yet to hear from them.  We really wanted the toy but it's a hard to find toy at this point for some reason, so we'll just have to keep looking and steer clear of Babyage.
5.0	My son loves this table to eat at use dough color draw paint and play with his cars toys on
5.0	Keeps the back of my seats protected. LI've them!!
5.0	Absolutely love it! The backpack concept is amazing and good quality for the price
5.0	I like this product, just put in the bag, in case i forgot to bring the bib out for my gal, i just take tissue or hand towel and clip, very convenient.
5.0	I was looking for a gift for my 9 month old grandbaby. Taggies caught my eye because the baby loves a book that crinkles in her hands and she also is always fingering the tags on her stuffed toys. This colorful caterpillar crinkles and has oh so many tags. Perfect! On a practical level it is perfect because it can wrap around her seat carrier handle, her stroller bar or her crib rail. One size fits all.
5.0	There are a lot of pieces to this gate, meaning you can get a fairly large space to enclose.  It is a little large in our house for a square configuration so we have it set up as a rectangle.  Our son is happy to stand up along the wall and travel around while holding himself up.  It is easy enough to put together.  Is it worth the expense? I can't say, as I have nothing to compare with it. I do not regret for a second buying it though.
1.0	It is not the same camera listed as whether proof  this camera is not weather proof you wanted to know what was not right
5.0	so cute, great service. thank you
5.0	Baby has really taken a shining to this Teething Ring.  He loves to shake it then chew on the shapes and the yellow ring.  It's very easy for him to hold and, as other reviewers have mentioned, it makes noise with out being annoying. It is not dishwasher safe but easy to clean none the less.
5.0	Dr browns are the only bottles I will use.
5.0	It's a very cute owl with a variety of sounds and textures for a baby. My son is almost two and this is the toy he sleeps with and drags around the house. I bought this as a replacement for the one he got for his first birthday because the wooden ring on the bottom had broken and that made the other side with the leaf fall out occasionally, which would upset him. It was also getting dirty. I swapped it out with his old one when he was sleeping and luckily he still adores it and hasn't questioned the change. I also like the fact that there's a book with this owl in it (who's hiding, also by skip hop) and we read the book to his owl sometimes. When we lift the flaps to look for baby owl, he holds up his toy owl to see what's in there. So fun.
5.0	After reading up on these little silver cups as much as I could, I caved and bought some. I can't believe how fast they helped. I've worn them as much as I could in the past 24 hours and for the first time in over 1 month, my left nipple doesn't hurt when my son latches! I've had a crack (that turned into mastitis) that just hasn't been able to heal because of the constant nursing. I have easily spent more money on creams and shirts than the cost of these cups, so it was a no-brainer to try one more solution. These are absolutely incredible, I can't believe I didn't know about them sooner!
1.0	I really wanted to like these bottles but they leak and when my baby sucks on them the nipple sucks in. I don't supplement so it really upsets me when bottles leak my hard pumped milk-- ain't nobody got time for that! Also I'm not the only one my friend has the bottles and she also has to stop pull out the nipple and continue feeding.
5.0	Amazing build and quality craftsmen ship. Easy to install and adjust. Worth every penny. Love that the harness come with built on pads that prevent the strap from digging into the child and acts like a built in neck pillow.
5.0	Needed a new one, old one was getting ripped up. Was very happy with the covering though and kids loved it!!!
5.0	We are very happy with this bassinet. It is very neat looking and is a perfect size for our small apartment. I love that it fits through doorways so I can easily wheel the baby into another room without waking her. The changing table is a nice addition. There is plenty of storage space below for diapers, wipes, blankets, etc.
1.0	This is a big, giant, piece of crap!!!!  The box it came in works better than the product itself.  First, some of the pieces are cracked, then the frame is bent so the locking mechanism does not work.  The directions are just plain stupid.  They make no sense and the pictures only make it worse. Don't but this piece of crap.  Any good review of this product is someone trying to hide that this is a piece of crap.  Kidco, you guys need to stop making this terrible piece of crap.
5.0	I love this clock. It helps my son stay in bed until he sees that it is &#34;wake up&#34; time.  It was a big pain to get it set up the way that I wanted because the instructions are written in such small print it was difficult to figure ou the next step.  Once it was set up though it was a breeze to change on a nightly basis if need be to change the bedtime or wake up time. A bit expensive but in my mind, worth it!
5.0	We used these bottles during the birth of our first child.  We tried several other bottles, and these were the only ones that didnt give her gas or cause her to chock/throw up.  Dispite other reviews saying they are hard to put together and leak, we found the opposite -- especially compared to other bottles such as advent or the ones w/drop in liners.  I would suggest a practice run in putting the bottle together so you are not fumbling when your infant is needing to be feed immediately.  Cleaning is not difficult - just make sure to have a few extra bottles on hand that are already cleaned and assembled, incase you need an emergency feeding.  We are currently expecting twins and will definately use these bottles with them.
5.0	Purchased this as a gift for my nephew. Shipping was speedy and it came undamaged.<br /><br />He absolutely loves it, and it is fun watching him wheel it around. Lots of pockets. The backpack strap on the back is great for adults.
5.0	My 14 month old loves this!  It's not too loud, but makes noise when he pushes it.  The big roller can go over almost any surface, so he doesn't get frustated by it getting caught on uneven surfaces.  The ball can detach and be played with alone.  It's very lightweight, so it's easy for him to carry and manuver.
5.0	Item is nicely made and is as shown<br />Transaction was seamless and shipping was right onX
5.0	I bought two of these for my twin 2 year old boys. We don't use them often, but they're super handy when we need them! They are excellent for the price! They old up, the leash piece is the perfect length and they're not super hot like those that have the stuffed animal backpack on them. Both of my boys get really hot really quickly, so these were perfect! They didn't like putting them on, but it didn't bother them in the least once they were on them.
5.0	My first impression was that this is much smaller than I was expecting.  Actually a pretty good size for a young child to pick up and manipulate.  A simple toy that appears to be well made. Shipping was super fast.
5.0	Easy in and out - with or without the latches.  My grandson thinks the &#34;hidden compartment&#34; is great for his little treasures.<br />Attaching the latches and tightening them is great; much easier than regular car seats.<br />As a grandparent, I feel the seat and child are much more secure with the latches.  However, even without them, the seat fits very well, especially with the belt tensioner.  Plus, changing the seat from one vehicle to another is no longer a chore.
5.0	Wish I had bought this for my first child! Makes it so easy to quickly pack lunch!!
5.0	So easy to set up and put away. Super lightweight to carry and not bulky like a pack n play.  My son sleeps in it all night with no problem.  Small enough to fit inside large suitcase if flying, or can just check the carrying case.  Buy it, you won't be sorry!
5.0	We were handled down the pack and play and the previous baby was on it for two years and left a divot where he slept. This fits perfectly and my baby sleeps like a champ now.
5.0	We purchased this after our daughter (now 2) was put in her crib and routinely got an arm or leg caught between slats and couldn't free herself. It seemed like a good solution and IS! We've now moved it onto the month of our 5 month old because he's started having the same issues. The velcro and mesh fabric has help up very well through two babies and after your baby can pull up or climb the bumper collapses down so that they can't use it for leverage to get out of the crib (the way a normal bumper can be used.) It seems that bumpers these days are ONLY to prevent the limb issues and that the cuter (but stuffed) ones are not only a safety hazard for SIDS but can also pose a safety hazard for a child using the height of the bumper to get out of the crib. I'd recommend this bumper as an easy safe solution. It's not the most gorgeous thing but the safety is worth it.
5.0	Awesome cup! Now my 16 month old does not spill his snacks everywhere. Cleans easily and he learned to use it very quickly
5.0	This little ball is one of the best bath toys I've seen. If you're little one likes to play with balls - this will for sure keep them entertained in the bathtub!
5.0	Bought two-gave one to my sister because her son is potty training and she can keep a change of clothes in a stylish bag in her bag and then it's waterproof for putting the dirty clothes. Mine I use for traveling and in the car. Have washed several times and it washes well!
5.0	i bought this themometer about 5 years ago. just this year the battery died on me. this is the 1st time i've had to replace it. the battery is hard to find in stores but amazon carries it! it's easy to read fast and accurate. best thermometer ever!
5.0	the amount of diapers used and discarded, this is a must have product if you don't want your home smelling. Refillable baking soda and easy to use and discard bags are really handy.
5.0	I'm a owner of the ergo baby, boba, and a sling. They are all good in their own way, but the Mei Tai is just perfect. The fabric is comfortable and can be flexible according to the baby, and there's enough air for the baby. It's not too snug, too stiff, too loose, too hot. I would recommend watching the video they've created, before putting it on. I was putting the carrier on wrong for a month, but since the baby was comfortable, baby hardly fuss. For the price, and the result, I would give it a 10 star if I can.
5.0	this swing is a special helper. my baby loves it and i do too.  it's easy to take any place. i think every mom needs one.  I do recommend this product
5.0	I  just received our new mamaroo today, and I absolutely love it. It is very stylish...it looks even nicer than the pictures show. I am amazed at how it works and my daughter, who has been very fussy due to teething, absolutely loves it! It is definately the best soothing technique I have found! I was a little skeptical at first and was concerned that with all of the motions that it would be very loud, however the mamaroo is so quiet, you almost can't hear it! If you are looking for a product to make your and your baby's life a little easier for a very reasonable price, please try the MamaRoo!! Cindy Reichel
5.0	Wonderful product and the customer service was excellent. Very friendly--I highly recommend Touch of Europe products to everyone!
5.0	It works and makes my life more efficient.
5.0	My 3 week old fits perfectly in the tub.  I love that it has little leg supports and the non slip pad for her back keeps her in place.
5.0	GREAT BACKPACK...  WE NEEDED A SMALLER ON AND ONE THAT DAD WOULDN'T MIND CARRYING...THIS WORKS OUT...NOT A LOT OF ROOM BUT I DON'T USE IT FOR LONG TRIPS
5.0	We love this Swing. It is so cute.<br />It came in excellent conditon and was easy to assemble.<br />Thank you
5.0	Awesome cover for baby feed pillow
5.0	"This mattress makes such a difference in the continued usability of the Pac N Play.  At 23 pounds, my granddaughter no longer seemed comfortable sleeping on the original thin \\""mattress\\"" that comes with the playard even though I had put a quilted pad on it.  This mattress fits perfectly, tightly enough to not invite little fingers but easy enough to take in and out to change the sheet or if you want to use the Pac N Play as a playpen.  A good price for a really good product."
1.0	This gate is horrible. I cannot find a way of making it tight because it requires that you loosen the pressure mounts so the door has 1/8th of an inch room so you can slide the handle to unlock it. In order for our gate to reach the 1/8th of an inch we had to loosen the pressure mounts so much that there is no way it would stay in place with my 12m old pulling on it!!   Not only did we have issues with that but it is REALLY difficult to open! There is no way my 8yo can unlock the gate and even I'm having a lot of trouble.  Save your money and purchase something different. We'll be returning this gate.
5.0	It works as advertised... and when the little part that goes against baby's nose got into the garbage disposal for a day or two, when we pulled it out, there was no damage. Amazing.<br /><br />We call ours the snot hookah. It causes the least trauma of any nasal suction device I've yet used.<br /><br />ETA:<br /><br />We've now had this two years. I don't use it often but it is still very effective. Word to the wise, however... little babies just turn their heads and it's not too hard to use this. Using it on an active and seriously pissed-off toddler is like trying to play the bagpipes while washing a cat. Wear protective gear.
5.0	A short trip from Vegas to Denver and back and it only had a few scuff marks on it.  Better on the bag than our stroller.  When we left it near the entrance of the plane, I could tell the baggage carrier preferred that over others who simply left their strollers there, which meant maybe they'd be nicer to it. ;)  Looks like it has several uses left so we'll hold onto it until out next trip.<br /><br />It comes folded up in its own zipped pouch and I initially thought it would be impossible to get back to that small size, but it was surprisingly easy.  Just a few folds and you can literally stuff it into its built in bag.  This way, it takes up less space while you're not using it during your travels, as well as when you're storing it between travels.<br /><br />I'd recommend this to anyone traveling with a stroller.
1.0	This product was a huge disappointment. The seller only shipped one ball, not four, as the title states. If I wanted to buy just one, I would have ordered that. This left me with three fewer toys, and scrambling to find replacement gifts. And, it's overpriced for a single ball. Fail.
5.0	Cute! Looks like real.
5.0	We've used this nightly for 6+ months, and it works great. We play the white noise, but there are other options that would work well for children and adults as well. I like that it can be plugged in when at home, but it also can just run on batteries if we are traveling. The ability to set a timer (pre-selected times) is also a nice feature.
5.0	my grandson fits in this just right
5.0	We travel a LOT and try not to check bags. This carrier is the perfect solution! It folds down SO tiny. I carry it in my diaper bag at all times, which is handy for those shopping trips when baby gets fussy. I have an Ergo that I use for daily use, and my son is just as comfortable in this carrier as he is in his Ergo. Love it!
5.0	I purchased 2 sets and only had 1 winner per package as advertised (some people said there was more than 1 winner per pack). This was a hit at the shower.
5.0	I love this baby food processor and would highly recommend to every one.  easy to use and quick. good size.
5.0	Lucky for this buy, I got 2 sets of different design although both are for boys. My kids love them and finish thier milk faster than usual.<br />The bottle are great and sturdy, no leaks and easy to suck. Sometimes its feel difficult to suck maybe bcos the valve is not fitted nicely. And the liquid cannot be fully finished due to sides of the spout will trap some liquid so have to open to finish it. But other sippy cups also have this issue.
5.0	I originally thought this was WAY to expensive and appalled at the price. However, I purchased another for around $40 and it was a piece of junk, ended up returning it. I then purchased this and wow, opened it up and it literally took one minute to put together, refreshing. Also, this is of such great quality and heavy duty, I feel very safe with my child using this unit. Impressed, to say the least!
5.0	Cute little knee pads, exactly as shown!
5.0	This tub was given to me as a gift at my baby shower and I have been very pleased with it. With a newborn, it works great with a netted sling that hooks over the top of tub so that baby can be bathed but not yet submerged. Once baby gets older, you have a slanted side and then a sitting side, both with anti-slippery material so baby doesn't slide all over. I also like having a spot to put the shampoo and soap that the baby can't get to. There's plenty of room for baby to move and splash and for you to manipulate the baby for washing. It's very durable and easy to clean as well.
5.0	This mixing picture isn't huge, carries just what you need for the day, and is super each to clean and assemble.  As a new mom, I appreciate efficiency when I can make it happen, and this pitcher really helps with the bottle prep time.  Thank you, Dr. Brown's, for another great product.
5.0	This stroller is awesome for taller people. I am 5'9 and its nice to not have to hunch over to reach the handle to push it. The handles are at  nice height and it feel like it navigates really well. It doesn't get stuck on uneven concrete, it handles with ease. I don't have to worry about the front wheels getting stuck when Im trying to push it after stopping. I chose this stroller for my 3.5 year old daughter whom complains of frequent leg pains (doctor says it's growing pains) She is about 40 inches and 33lbs and she fits nicely in this stroller. Her feet don't dangle to the ground so, don't I have to make sure I'm not dragging them because she forgot to pick them up. She's doesn't look crumpled up in the stroller, she's able to sit up straight and comfortably. It also has a 5 pt harness. I initially disagreed with this idea when I bought it. I took my daughter shopping and remember how my daughter lies to reach out and mess with clothes or whatever she can reach now and again. Guess who was happy for the 5 point harness after that :D The one down side but I'm okay with dealing with is, it's a bit heavier than the other smaller strollers.  I really think its a little heavier because this stroller is very supportive of heavier weight. I also like that there is a basket at the bottom, an umbrella, and an organizer by the handles. Oh, the grip on the stroller is really nice as well. Over all I don't regret purchasing this product and it was worth the extra $20, I was gonna just get a cheap $19.99 one. I think my child can use this one for at least another year or year and a half.
5.0	"There are very few things I have bought for my baby that I would consider to be \\""must-have items\\"" but this is definitely a MUST have. I am considering pre-emptively buying a back-up (or 2) because I'm sure I'd have a breakdown if I lost mine or if something happened to it. I had heard about the Nose Frieda before my baby was born, but our child education class instructor recommended a Red Cross one, so I purchased that instead (waste of money). I got my baby home from the hospital and had a little breakdown because we had spent time in the NICU for a lung issue, so I was extra paranoid about every tiny change in breathing sounds anyway, which culminated in me not being able to get a booger out of my baby's nose. I was crying, she was crying. I tried everything including the bulb syringe they sent me home with and nothing was getting that thing out, so I immediately ordered the Nose Frieda and kicked myself for not having it here before she was born. She finally sneezed that booger out and we calmed down and the next time she needed anything suctioned, I had my Nose Freida ready. This device is a life-saver, and SO MUCH EASIER to use and to clean than the hospital one and the Red Cross one. The only thing I would say is that the tube that goes in her nose falls right off the part with the filter if I don't hold it together with one hand.  This is very inconvenient since I already feel like I need two hands to hold her still. I might have just gotten a defective one though, because it seems like it should snap on, but mine doesn't. It still works like magic though, it just is hard to wrangle it and my baby at the same time. I still rate this 5 stars though because it is a million times better than any other snot-remover I have tried."
5.0	I bought these for my two month old and I can tell they will fit her for a few months longer, which makes these a great bargain. They are wonderful for a light layer with a onesie or under a dress for extra warmth. I keep some in the diaper bag in the summer because restaurants and stores are so chilly. I just slide them on her really quick and take them off when we go back outside to the 95 degree heat. She looks cute in them, they are really useful and easy to use. The cute patterns always get compliments!
5.0	Works great! My son loves them.
5.0	This hammock was bigger than I thought it would be.  I also really like the fact that the sides are elastic, so it can expand when toys are placed in it.  I have had other similar products that don't have the elastic, so it was a bonus.  It came with the hook screws and studs.  Haven't put much in it yet, but it seems pretty sturdy, so I have every confidence that it will hold what I need it to.  I am very happy with this product.
1.0	This laminated bib looked so cute i had to get it.  The description says it easily wipes clean but it does not.  All food stains it - especially at the neck.  we've only used it a few times and yet i can't get the stains out.  They say not to put it in the washing machine, but what's the point of having a cute stained bib???
5.0	This car seat is extremely easy to install, as well as move from one vehicle to another.  My son seems to love it!  I feel confident that he is safe and secure and didn't mind spending a bit more to be sure of his safety.
5.0	I tried the madela bags and they always leaked. I have never had a single issue with these bags. They freeze and thaw wonderfully and have never leaked a drop. Definitely the best option in storage bags.
5.0	These bags are fantastic.  The baby powder smell masks the odor of any diaper we've tossed in them.  They are great for travel, home, etc.  We have them in our diaper bag, the car, near the diaper pail and in our suitcases.  We use them at home most often when our son decides that it smells way too nice in his room.  We toss the dirty diaper into the bag, tie it as tightly as we can, and toss it into the diaper pail.  5 days later and you still can't smell that nasty diaper.  So worth it.  And for 200 bags, the price is just outstanding.
5.0	This a great chair for newborn to toddler. My 2.5 year old really likes this chair. I will definitely buy another one for my next child.
5.0	Fits well, soft, we will see how it holds up with baby!
5.0	This carseat is easy to setup and safe &secure for our little grandson. It was the perfect choice! Would strongly recommend.
5.0	Adorable.  Baby loves it.
5.0	They are awesomely cute. Love them. They look really good on my daughter. Didn't think she could cuter but she did.
5.0	Perfect for my 3 year old. Easy to clean. Easy for her to climb in and out on her own.
5.0	We have been using cloth for almost a year now. We stared with prefolds and reseving blankets then switched to alva pockets. We where still using disposables for night time and disposable wipes. A few months ago my friend let me try her cloth wipes and I feel in love with them. However I didn't want to buy 15 for $10 off of Kelly'swhen I could make my own so that is what I did I made over 100 for about $14. Now the same friend has asked me to make her some. I was sick of buying disposable as well for night time so she recommended I try home aio's so I ordered 3 from alva. (I am the type of person that doesn't like change if I know cometh ij .ng works that's what I stick with so it was hard for me to switch to aio's for night) well after placing the order with alva (I ordered a few more things than just aio) when I actually got my order one thing was missing and they have still yet to fix the problem when I spent more that $100 with them. Well out of the problem3 aio one was not what the sight cleaned it to be and I DID NOT like that diaper and one of the elastics on the pocket broke. (They have still not gotten back to me on eather problem and it's been 3 weeks) my son did good in them for night Time with an insert in the pocket of the aio so I thought I would order some more but did not want to go threw alva and dint want to pay Kelly's prices so I got on amazon. And that is where god sent me y'all I ordered calls Ogga booga and Elaphents. I was so excited when I got them cause they where so cute and ran to prep them. I was instantly in love with them after the 2nd round in my prep. Run they where already fluffyer than my alvas that had about 8-10rounds even y'all insert was insert was twice as fluffy as all of my alva inserts. So I was so excited my friend came over and I HAD to show off ny diapers!! Needless to say we where both just amazed. So I put my son in one for night and was hoping they didn't sleek threw with him peeing so much got up and changes him thenext morning and expecting the whole insert to be sopping wet  and it wasn't it was only half wet!!! And that's when I feel in love with the diaper all over again!!!!!!!! Told my friend and she ordered 2 off of amazon as well for her lil girl!!! And I will be orderi.ng more of your diapers when some of the sold out ones come back in stock on the web page.   I was wondering if y'all where thinking of seeking wipe solutions? My friend and I have both been looking for a whip solution we are in love with it's rubby moon wipe bits Kelly's use .tk have them for $7 for a 4 or 5 oZ. Bag and they don't have them any more:(<br /><br />So I just wanted to lets you know how in love with your diapers I am for not liking new things and I will keep spreading how awesome they are around to all my cloth groups on Facebook. Y'all are great!!!!
5.0	Keeps my toddler and very mobile 10 month old from climbing the stairs and unlike the old gate, my 2 yr old can't take it down! Peace of mind and safety which is important for this busy momma!
5.0	We recently purchased this food feeder and I was debating on the mesh bags or the silicone ones. After reading multiple reviews, I decided to purchase this product. Lets just say it took my 6 month old son a few tries to get the hang of it and now he loves it, loves it! I've been putting Maine wild blueberries in it and he just goes crazy when I get it out and hand it to him!
5.0	These are very well made sturdy bowls. The perfect size for my toddlers.
5.0	The pump is great, My baby is 1 yo and I still breastfeed thanks to this pump. The fact that you can regulate the power makes it gentle, yet effective. At first, I was upset because I lost one of the membranes, and I cound't find a replacement to buy. The only websites I found were from Malasya and Australia. But then I found Maymom, that sells parts for the medela pumps. I sent an e-mail and they said that if I bought both the valve and the membrane, it would work for spectra dew. I bought them, and they really work! Same as the original parts! After that, I can honestly say I have no complaints about this pump.
5.0	I was intrigued when my daughter started using these in sinks so her son could reach the water stream.  I got one for myself since it is hard for me to lean forwards to reach my bathroom sink flow, and find it especially useful for getting under a wide, centered stream of water when washing my hair in the sink
5.0	I like these sacks.  They have nice smell and last long after.  It'd be nice if they could contain 50 bags in these 200 counts box, so when you open to get fist one, the smell will stay and last for the rest after box opened.
5.0	We rent an apartment, so we have been hesitant about painting the walls of my son's room.  These decals are just the ticket!  My son loves pointing at the animals and giggling at the animal sounds we make in response.  We put a couple over the crib and a couple by the changing table to keep him busy while we change him.  If we want to change it up, just peel off and place them somewhere else!
5.0	This is an absolutely beautiful crib set. My son loves to look at all the animals on the bumper pads and he loves to feel the blanket. I recommend this set for anyone! It's awesome!
5.0	This monitor is GREAT, espicially for the price.  My husband and I have not experienced any problems with static or any type of interference.  We can hear every little sound that is made from our baby even when we are in another room, which makes me feel secure and able to get other things done.  I would recommend these monitors to all parents.
5.0	It's a small pillow. It didn't smell funny. It was soft and my toddler left my pillow alone. It did the job.
5.0	This is such a cool idea, there are a few others like it but this one  seems to have it all.  Not only is it the most secure of the travel high  chairs I've seen but it's also great to look at.  Would definitely  recommend it as something every mom should have handy as you'll use it  all the time.
5.0	My son loves to play with this net and the fish while in the tub.  He uses the net to catch any bath toys that will fit in it.  The three fish that come with the net are brightly colored and have bumps and texture.  My son likes to chew on them like teethers in the bath.  The fish are numbered and have the same number of holes in the bottom of the belly to strain water, but the number two and three fish only have one stream of water coming out despite having more holes.  Overall, it's a fun little toy.  My son often carries the net out of the bath with him and holds onto it until he goes to bed.
5.0	I bought this for my daughter that loves purple.  The timer is great and she can turn it on when she goes to bed and I don't have to worry about turning it off.  The lights are bright until you need to change the batteries.  This one lasts about a month (on every night) and then we have to put new batteries in it.
5.0	I was skeptical when I saw this item for only 9.95. I assumed it would be smaller or cheaply made but when I got it, it was so soft, the turtle's shell is made better than my son's $30 dream lite. This item is fantastic and the price is unbeatable. I saw something very similar at toys r us for $35 except that item didn't play music as well. I'm really happy with this purchase. This will make a great gift.
5.0	I received my GalsShopper in a two days and today I used it for the first time. I absolutely LOVE LOVE my GalsShopper! There was a color brochure with a few easy steps to submit for my free grocery shopping list and I received it in one day! I actually look forward to shopping now. I am so organized now and I will never leave home without my GalsShopper when I shop! Thanks GalsShopper!
5.0	These are really great. The velcro is really strong but only sticks to itself so you can actually wash it with other stuff without ruining it (usually baby velcro stuff is unreasonably sticky and seeks out your clothes in the washer just to destroy them, especially lacy underwear!) Also the top is super soft against baby's skin, doesn't leave those harsh elastic marks. The outside is soft and not plastic and the inside is a nice netted material that keeps them dry. Great product.
5.0	These are some serious tubs. I bought them to put in a wooden storage bin (9 bins) so I bought pink and brown. They fit PERFECTLY and they are VERY STURDY. I've had them for years and they are sturdy. Also, when you have company, they are an easy clutter clean up!
5.0	I'm a BG fan. I like the freetimes. 4.0's  and also use Flips. These are expensive, but I wanted to try. The organic cotton inside is really thin compared to the usual microfiber inserts which makes for a trimmer fit. There are two thin layers of cotton attached to the diaper at the ends but loose in the middle which makes for a faster dry time. I double the fabric up in the front since I have a boy. I really thought he'd leak through because the cotton didn't look like it would hold much. However, it was good through his 2.5 hour nap. I'd like to slowly work these into my stash if possible. If you can afford them, I highly recommend them!
5.0	This necklace has two different kinds of oral stimulation. A bumpy side on back and a lattice pattern style side on the front. If you have a serious chewer, the break away clasp wont last long. Looks like modern fashion jewelry, does not draw unwanted peer attention.  This product is large enough not to go down a normal tp tube!
5.0	We have had these bumpers for the past 9 months….<br /><br />I was very resistant to purchasing these crib bumpers. Mainly for the cost and also because of the reviews that I have read surrounding the cleaning issues.<br />We finally ordered these crib bumpers after a few failed “cheaper” solutions and one episode of a 10 month old climbing out of the crib.<br />**** The other reviewers are right – you have to order 4 extra ones for the corner posts if you have thicker ones… just connect the two bumpers together.****  We have the Pottery Barn Larkin crib.<br />They arrived in huge boxes and I threw them in the laundry.  First let me address the issue with the washing hassle:  If you wash them on delicate wash and put tennis balls in the dryer – you’ll be fine, they won’t bunch up.<br /><br />Second, let me address the issues with putting them on the actual crib- Yes at first it’s a pain, but once you get the hang of it you just wrap and zip up/or down…. Depending on how curious your child is in unzipping. My suggestion is have the zipper face sideways or out of the crib, the latter one will not look as neat but it beats your child “being quiet in the crib” while unzipping the bumpers one by one.<br />  Once the bumpers are on- they are so fabulously functional! They are the best thing since sliced bread. They provide the face/head/butt against the rails sleepers by providing cushion while allowing air circulation.  They also work wonders for temper tantrums and crib thrashers.  They also take care of the space between the crib rails for the occasional arm/foot slip-through.  My only regret is that I was being cheap before and wasted so much money trying to find alternative bumpers. Next baby we will be putting these on from the beginning.
5.0	These are great! They are much larger than I expected which was a nice surprise. I use them to store everything I would normally have in a diaper bag and then just throw into my big tote purse. No more carrying to bags or having a tacky diaper bag :) Love this print too. Super cute!
5.0	I give this to new baby boys along with a copy of William's Doll by Charlotte Zolotow  also available from Amazon.
5.0	I got this in the mail today and am VERY happy with it!  My 22 lb son can now be comfortable on my back, he loves it!  It is easy to put on and is a bargain price!  I'm very glad I didn't buy the much more expensive Ergo carrier!
5.0	very nice product. fits as expected.
1.0	We loved the lightness of this fabric, but our son - who is an active sleeper - kicked this sleeper open at the seams the third night sleeping in it. For such little legs, I was surprised at how easy it was for him to rip the sleeper that cost so much!!
5.0	I have been combining this four layer hemp insert with the five layer bamboo inserts for overnight and have found that they hold all night without any leaking.  But it wasn't until I tested another method of using them, that I became extremely pleased with this product.  Usually during the day I use the five layer bamboo insert with the pocket diapers. They hold great.  My babysitter mentioned that my daughter was stiff as a board because of the diapers.  I knew there was so much to know about the diapers and so many various ways to alter them to make them work, since they are one size.  I contacted this seller and asked her if she had any suggestions.  She gave me a few ideas, but the one thing she mentioned that really clicked was that maybe the inserts were too bulky on her.  They aren't too bulky where they'd leak, but they are too bulky where they stiffen her up.  She isn't even three months old yet, and I was worried that when she begins to crawl, she'd need more movement than what she can currently do. I didn't want these diapers to hold her back.  This seller suggested using just one insert instead of two. Little did she know, I already was using just one insert. My daughter doesn't pee a lot (yet).  I decided to tell my babysitter that I wanted to test something.  I informed her that I had been combining the hemp inserts with the bamboo inserts at night and it holds all night.  Therefore, I wondered how well the hemp inserts would hold without the bamboo inserts there.  My babysitter told me that she didn't have any problems with leaking with the hemp inserts, and she changed her every few hours like she normally did with the bamboo inserts.  The hemp inserts are much thinner, and therefore gave her more room to move around.  I understand as she gets older and pees heavier, this won't work, but then the 5 layer won't be as bulky on her anymore, either, as she grows bigger.  This is an amazing product with an amazing seller.  I highly recommend this seller,as you can ask her anything and she'll guide you to the answers you are seeking from personal knowledge and experience.  She has definitely helped me better understand cloth diapering with my daughter!
5.0	I bought this when my son was just about 3 months old and he loved it. He loves biting down on her legs, although he doesn't have any teeth as yet. She is also very easy for him to hold. I definitely recommend this to all new mothers.
5.0	I bought the entire set for my baby boy room and its beautifull.<BR>If you are still wondering about this set well dont, its perfect.
5.0	We've used this on an almost daily basis for several months now as my 11 month old absolutely loves sitting in here and watching what we're doing in the kitchen or going on walks. It's held together without issues. He's a big boy too at 25 lbs and he has room to grow with it.
1.0	This gate is so terrible that it deserves its own reality show. Only the bottom bumpers actually make contact with my base boards, leaving the top bumpers a good inch or two out in the middle of nowhere with no support like they work customer service for Comcast or something. If you have a normal house built after 1952 then this gate will be terrible for you too.
5.0	I can't tell you how it is myself, but I bought it for a baby shower and it was a BIG hit. Very cute.
5.0	Best music maker and has a projector as well, love this item
5.0	This is the best purchase I have made thus far for my new grandchild.  She has loved it from the very beginning and her interaction with it as she grows is ever changing and stimulating. She has gone from just looking and listening to it, to pressing the buttons herself and chewing on the ends as a teether and has begun to select the music and instruments on her own. It is an incredibly well designed item and very sturdy as well.<br /><br />This is an excellent choice for a baby gift.
5.0	I keep the booster seat in my car and use it when at friends or family's houses.  I also just used it at a wedding this past weekend.  I love how it all folds down and it is so easy to just grab and go!!!
5.0	This set is so cute.  Worked great in the baby's room.
5.0	Oh, I love this scissors, they are so convenient for baby's tinny nails and you won't have to be worry about cutting your little one. Highly recommended.
5.0	We bought two, one for each carseat in our two cars.  They fit well and we haven't had a problem with it sliding down.  It has protected our car's leather fine. I haven't checked to see if the seats leave indentations in our leather seats, but it wouldn't matter anyway.  I rather our car seats be firmly secured and leave indentations, then not.
5.0	grandmother,was looking for gifts for fathers we seem to forget how pride they are when children are born .I became a Glam mother in Oct Kaleb and April Toni 2014 and i wanted to have a prize for the men. Give KR his gift he loved it matches his work bag he looks great carrying both. Know Toni will love his he very stylish.
5.0	Good price for a good product. It does what it needs to do for more than half the price of other placemats.
5.0	This crib liner is just as described.  I love that it blocks some light but is still breathable.  I would purchase this again if needed.
5.0	Ordered for baby gift.
5.0	Great to protect baby while outdoors especially summer days. I used it with Britax infant car seat. Easy to put on
5.0	I purchased this blanket for my 7 month old daughter's crib in place of a traditional crib set. I have bought many other a+a products in the past but this by far is the best! The bamboo muslin is soooo soft and luxurious. The size is great so she and I can cuddle up together under it easily. It is a little spendy but completely worth every penny! I would recommend this blanket to anyone who is looking for a larger, super soft blanket for an infant or toddler.
1.0	The shades won't sit flat and are damaged. The bottoms are curved and can't be fixed. Disappointed in the product.
1.0	This is my first review on Amazon ever!  When I opened the box, these baby toys smelled strongly of toxic fumes, like paint or permanent markers.  There is no way I can give these to my child.  Despite being PVC-free, it is clear from the smell that something they are made from is no good.  I am guessing it is the paint.  I immediately boxed them back up for return to Amazon.  Luckily, Amazon is a wonderful company for accommodating returns.  Also, unlike the advertisement, water can easily get in the bottom since the ducks are not solid.  And of course, if you need another reason, they are made in China.  If you are thinking about getting these ducks, please read all the negative reviews under the individual duck products such as Bob Odd Duck [[ASIN:B002KCNMGK Boon Odd Duck - Bob]] or the other ducks before buying.  I wish I had thought to do that because the 5-star reviews for the Odd Duck 4 Pack are misleading.  In the individual duck reviews, you can see these same issues that I point out and also that others say that the paint can chip off into kids' mouths when they chew on the duck.  Given the unknown toxic nature of the paint, that is no good indeed!
5.0	I love this wet bag. We use it with our Diaper Dekor pail and never have smells get out, no slipping and washes well! We hang dry however, we found it started to break apart after using the dryer.
1.0	Cute pattern but material is horrible and cheap and doesn't breathe. My daughter woke up drenched while under just the sheet. The comforter is fine and we will use that.
5.0	Looks great and was simple to install.  After using it for the last month, I have no complaints.  I would buy again.
5.0	I recently purchased this monitor and an extra camera.  I had been using a Safety 1st model from about 4 years ago and it was discontinued and I was not able to get new recut batteries for the monitor. The monitor also finally stopped showing video and was only good for sound.  This new Samsung monitor is great.  The picture is clear and the sound is great.  I love that you can speak to the child as well, although I only do this with my 3 year when she is playing in the room.  The monitor is easy to use, has volume controls right on the side instead of having to go into the menu to change it, and using multiple cameras is a snap.  The moving camera is nice and also easy to maneuver with the monitor controls.  I wish I had gotten this monitor when my second child was a baby instead of fighting with my old one.  This will be great for our next baby and I can still monitor the playroom when I am around the house.  Highly recommend.<br />I just realized this review should have been attached to the monitor system and not the extra camera that I also purchased.  I will say that the extra camera is fine but is not one that you can move via the monitor like the camera that comes with monitor.  Other than that the review is the same.
5.0	I was actually sad to give this away.  I bought this in off-white eyelet and it was gorgeous.  It worked perfectly too.
5.0	I prop bottles with my twins all the time and I keep an eye on them. this will  make it easier to feed them. I don't know why these other comments are so negative, probably mother's without twins. Duh your baby could choke if your are not watching them. These bibs are just an aid. I am tired of constantly readjusting blankets and stuff to feed my boys and I have a toddler her so I can't always hold each baby to feed. Different strokes for diffident folks. I am sure a mother of multiples invented this. So get off your high horse moms who think this is a silly product.<br />And for anybody to assume mother's do not watch their babies are just plain ignorant.<br />Since receiving my holders I think they are great! They do not have any sort of velcro or snaps that would keep them attached around babies neck, which is great. When my babies are done feeding they just kick the things off of themselves. They are light and easy to use. They are just bib shaped pillows with elastic holders and baby is not forced to feed off his bottle like some people here are assuming.
5.0	I had heard this works best with the Ubbi diaper pail and they are right. Hate the pattern but it was cheapest and wouldn't be seen anyway. (Literally HATE the pattern.)
5.0	Nice to be able to buy just the caps. I kept losing them and they are great for keeping your bottle nipple clean.
5.0	We like RAIN at our house.<br />Clothes come out smelling fresh and soft...<br />and established spots in clothes have been removed!<br />The purity of the product is impressive.<br />We are a believer in the product!
5.0	This is a great product. The seller shipped immediately.
5.0	The best judge of the quality of this seat is the LO who sleeps like a baby (there is a pun there somewhere) when in the seat. Fits seamlessly with the [[ASIN:B00416QYJU Britax B-Scene Stroller, Red]]. The seat feels sturdy and baby gets good support. The only drawback I have is that I wanted a green one and this only comes in red and black.
5.0	This is so cute and my baby keeps it on.. it catches her food and cleans easily.<br />Good purchase. 1 is good. I almost bought 4 ... lol
5.0	This was purchased for my daughter.  She is finding it very helpful as her pregnancy moves along.  She is looking forward to using it once the baby is born for nursing.  A couple of items were purchased on the same day...this, yoga pants & Bella Band...she could not say one was better than another as each has different used, but man she is so glad to have them all!
5.0	"These are more expensive but calming our little one makes it so worth it. These are the only ones she doesn't spit back out. I also like that it doesn't \\""imprint\\"" on her face like the plastic ones did."
1.0	Junk. My grandson chewed through this like it was candy
5.0	Perfect product. This is exactly what I needed. I used to do it the old way by boiling a jug and putting the bottle into a cup of boiled water so it warms the milk.... what a time consuming process that was. Now I just put the bottle in and press go and it is ready in seconds. I love it.<br />The only problem with it is that I was not able to purchase this warmer anywhere in Australia so I have to also purchase a power plug converter to make it work.
5.0	I bought the Bugaboo Cameleon about 2 years ago when I found out I was pregnant and have loved it since day 1. There are sooooo many reasons why but I'll list a few:  - I hear of parents who often have to get 2 or 3 strollers for thier kids because kids out grow them or they have broken, etc. You don't have to worry about that with the bugaboo. My daughter used it when she was an infant, baby and now as a toddler. It grows along with her.  - We're tall parents and the handle bars adjust a lot!! Other strollers are so uncomfortable for the parents to push, especially on long walks.  - When our daughter was an infant, she was way too small for her crib so we put the bassinet part of the bugaboo in our room and she slept in that for the first few months.  - I love that the Metropolitan car seat fits onto the stroller. A super convenience for those quick in and out visits to the store. Trust me, as a new mom I didn't realize how important this was until I had to make 4 stops in one day with a new born.   - I love that it's adjustable for the baby when sitting...meaning that she can sit straight up, tilt back slightly or completely lay down. My daughter is so comfortable in her stroller that she can nap inside her stroller when we are on long walks or out shopping.   - I also love that you can switch the seating so the child can face you or the opposite direction; same with the handle bars. It's great!  - Also, I love the attention we get when we are out around town. I have had soooo many people stop and ask us about our stroller. We had ours personalized with our last name embroidered on the top of the stroller.   If you are debating on whether or not getting the Bugaboo Cameleon, I woudl say GET IT! It is pricey but it's totally worth it in the long run and your child will love it too.
5.0	*I received a discount code for this item*<br /><br />This is my third baby car mirror (all different brands). What I like about this one is that you do not need a headrest to use it so I have the option of placing it in the middle seat. It is a great size (very large), but the padding makes it very safe if we were in an accident. I would definitely recommend this mirror!
5.0	Soft, neat, and fits my pack n play mattress perfectly.
5.0	I bought two of these for our house, they are very cute, and seem to be comfy no rough edges and go on quickly to the toilet with not a lot of trouble.
5.0	Love that these are tiny and thin. I realize some people might see that as a bad thing, but they're perfect for washing your face without getting a big thick towel all wet.
5.0	"I used to work as a nanny and all the families I babysat for owned this BABYBJORN travel crib.<br />When I got pregnant I sure registered for one and my mom bought it for us!<br />I love this travel crib! It's super easy to set up and take down, it's light and it fits in a suitcase!! When we went to Brazil we brought it for my daughter (16 months at the time) and it fit in our 30\\"" suitcase! We also added all her clothes, Summer blankets and soft toys in with the crib.<br />The mattress is really soft! We used the travel crib as her crib for about 2 months after the co-sleeper in our room because we didn't have enough space for a regular one. She slept great and through the night!<br />I've cared for children who had a pack n play and that thing was hard, uncomfortable and a pain in the... to setup! One time it took me almost 10 mins to do it (whereas the BABYBJORN one only takes a few seconds!)<br />If you're trying to decide between this or a pack n play go with the travel crib!"
1.0	We got headaches from trying this monitor -- the low-droning, incessant static was annoying, and it barely picked up any child-related noises. One night, my daughter just came downstairs and into my room to wake me because the monitor didn't -- with both units at full volume, I heard nothing! We bought this to replace an Evenflo from 9 years ago; we liked the feature of that one to talk to the baby (almost like a walkie-talkie). This one has that feature, too, but it's useless because the sound quality is so disappointingly poor. <br />
5.0	Love it! Doesn't smell, use your own garbage bags, don't have to buy refills, easy to drop diapers in (no unscrewing top). Great product.
5.0	My daughter and I love this set!  I wish the box weren't quite as tall (it could easily be less high and still fit the silverware), as it is a bit big to fit in her lunch box.
5.0	Happy Mom and Dad!! LOVE this item, I will buy it for every baby shower I go to. Fits great on the mattress. It is all natural so it is extremely soft. My son has asthma so being that it is allergy free is a huge selling point for our family. Love it will definitely be buying more!
5.0	We purchased the Caddy and the Cicco Keyfit 30 for our daughter before she was born. We have used it almost every day since and she is 8mos old. It drives so smoothly, I steer it with one hand all the time when we're shopping and it turns on a dime. The storage underneath is huge and fits our full size diaper bag no problem.  The foam handles and cup holders are a great feature, I can't tell you how much I LOVE our caddy!! It's the only stroller you'll need for a long time until you convert to a convertible car seat.
5.0	My older daughter recommended this car seat for my youngest grandson, as she's had such a good experience with it and the Mama of the youngest really likes this car seat, too. The one I bought is the 3rd purchase of this car seat in our family!
5.0	Love it! absolutely awesome sponge to clean little one with. So what that it will come apart and become smaller with time! its a natural product - that means it has a life limit! And its not exactly so expensive that you cant' replace it :)
5.0	I read so many other great reviews so I ordered 3 of these for the grandchildren.  They look great and I can't wait to try them!
1.0	"Nowhere on the Chicco website or on Amazon's page for this product does it say that this product is only considered safe for children 6 months and older, but that's exactly what I discovered in the safety information - AFTER I bought it, when I opened it up. I bought this for a trip this weekend and had to return it and get another stroller on short notice, which was a giant hassle (thank god for prime & free returns, but still.) The \\""recline\\"" was also a joke - an inch at best - and the harness was very flimsy, so even if they hadn't specifically excluded younger children, I would have been totally unwilling to even consider risking it with my 5 month old.  So don't buy it if you need a product suitable for a younger baby, and for goodness' sakes, Amazon, update your product page and make it less of a PITA for the next person in my boat."
5.0	The sunshade has adhered to my window for several weeks and provided an adequate amount of shading for my little one in the back seat. It was easy enough to install and trim where it was needed to fit the window. I would recommend this product instead of the shades that have suction cups. This does not interfere with my seeing out the window while driving and will not become a projectile like the suction cup shades will.
1.0	I am not one to write a review, but the Evenflo high chair is so dangerous and the company so negligent, that I had to let others know.  The Evenflo Majestic Highchair has recently, finally, been recalled.  We had issues with the screws popping out of the recliner section of the chair when we used it with our then 6 month old, I called Evenflo last March, they sent me a repair kit with longer screws, still didn't work. Customer service had told me then this was not a common problem and that even with a screw missing, highchair was safe to use, not dangerous. I'm so furious they lied about my son's safety!!!!! Our longer screws did pop out a few times, we put them back in, I called back and since the highchair still held up fine and they told me it was okay to use, we wrongly trusted Evenflo and continued to use the highchair (my husband had checked it and felt is was okay). I just called in response to last weeks recall and they said they do have a record of me calling, sorry that happened and would I like a new set of screws? They won't give a refund and the new screws (which they will ship out in approx. 2 weeks, and recommend we don't use the highchair in the meantime) supposedly work better than the original replacements. I am returning this to the store, and if they won't accept the return, I'll have to eat the cost and throw out the chair.  We've had so many of our kids' things recalled, it's infuriating that these companies only have to send screws that may or may not work and before their belated recalls, our kids are at risk and to boot this time they assured me there was no danger. Please do not buy Evenflo and know that you can't trust the info you receive from customer service.     I'm am so thankful my son wasn't injured. We've had other issues with most of our Evenflo products not working correctly, but all involving bells and whistles not structual. I just can't understand how these companies put more money into their impossible to open packaging thaninto their product safety.
5.0	Exactly what i want it.
5.0	Got this for my son and this seat is a great value and its comfortable too - love that it reclines because my kids love to sleep when we go on trips in the car.  They are comfortable - my only issue with it is they can't really reach the cup holder easily because it reclines so we took them off the seats.  Otherwise its great - got one for my daughter too!  Its a bit of a pain to take the cover off to hook in the seatbelt but it has snaps so its doable  - we have a tether system so that's not nearly as hard.  When its rear facing it can also be tough to adjust the straps to be tighter.  But it can be done.  I also like that the cover comes off easily to wash it.  We have an SUV so it fits nicely although I'm not sure you could do 3 across since its kind of wide.<br /><br />In the end I think its a great deal and would definitely recommend it.  The few issues I had with it are minor.
5.0	I was devestated when I couldn't produce enough breast milk and making bottles at midnight wasn't very much fun. We decided to splurge with a gift card and get this. It is a luxury, not a necessity, but it saves a lot of time and it really is as easy as pushing a button and bam, bottle done in 5 seconds. We haven't had any problems with it after a month.
5.0	Love these as baby shower gifts. Most practical, protective lasting bibs.  Can't by in stores.
5.0	Perfect fit for my 1 year old. Exactly what I was looking for. They washed up well. True to color.
5.0	Love, love, love this pillow!  It conforms to my daughter's head and neck which is exactly what I wanted so as not to disturb any continuing development.  She is just about two, and I noticed she was &#34;bunching&#34; her blankets underneath her head and neck for some elevation, so I ordered this pillow for her.  She falls asleep on it EVERY night and even asks to take it with her when she gets out of bed.  Great purchase for a toddler newly using a pillow.
5.0	These bibs are excellent!  Definitely the most absorbent bibs I have found.  They have been very helpful in reducing bib changes for my 7 month old.
5.0	I just had my fourth and had to purchase all new bottles. I received this free as a promotion with an Avent bottle kit. My four month old drinks water and pear juice out of it at times and it's a great cup. It does not leak and it does not over flow the mouth when drinking either.
5.0	I am so happy with this bottle! My daughter is a breastfed baby, and used to use a bottle. We previously used the playtex drop in system and she loved that bottle... until I stopped using it for a month. I was at home for the summer and we hand no need to use a bottle since we were nursing.. unfortunately that month off lead to her refusing the bottle. She is 7 months old today, and we just tried the  breastflow bottle for the first time tonight. This is the first bottle she has taken willingly since going on strike! It feels soft everywhere except for the tip, and is very much breast like. The inner piece releases milk like normal let down of breast milk. It is AMAZING! The only draw back is that the outside nipple compresses and stays compressed at times which messes up the overall latch. But I am still impressed because the latch that she maintains with this bottle is identical to the latch she uses on my breast so I know we will have no problem switching back and forth. I Think THE Reason She Liked THE Playtex Natural Latch Initially Was Because THE Nipple Is Like THE Avent Pacifier nipple. Now that we don't use a pacifier I think she prefers something that is more like my breast. This bottle is a perfect match. (Please excuse random capitalization, my phone auto corrected it that way and I didn't feel like going back and retyping)
5.0	My son loves it.this items keeps him calm in his teething time.
5.0	My niece loves the stickers, she had a lot of fun putting them up.
5.0	This really helps the seat to sit more upright. We have had one for about a year now that was starting to get a little smashed down, so I replaced it with a new one (will still keep the old one as a backup). I'm glad they made this product, it definitely gives more room front to back.
5.0	These bedrails are simple to put together and simple to install.  The price is awesome too!  I recommend this product!
5.0	Fantastic product. I looked at a lot of sterilizers before settling in on this one. Very easy to fill 4 8oz bottles. Easy to clean, maintain and travel with. This has been a true life saver while traveling. I was not a big fan of the brush that it came with as it does not have sponge at the top like the regular munchkin brush. Without the brush it's harder to clean bottles properly plus they scratch the bottles.
5.0	Have been using these for years with all of my grandkids. A cold apple slice is great for helping them through teething without worry of choking. Bananas are also a favorite. No need for preservative-filled baby food with this. Everything can go in it and the kids can suck the good nutrition right out of it without having to puree or do any work. With soft foods like banana's the kids can get kind of messy so make sure they are wearing a bib. A good rinse with hot water gets the food out when they're finished. I don't know if they're dishwasher safe cause thankfully, I don't have to wash them. Their mom's do. :) I wouldn't hesitate to put it in the dishwasher at my house though. It's great for teething and also great as an alternative to pureed baby food.
5.0	I was looking for a handle stroller and bob has met my needs. Also comfortable for jogging and off road uses.
5.0	I live in an OLD studio in San Francisco, and my bathtub doesn't have a drain stopper! This does the trick every time - perfect seal.
5.0	Materials are good, very easy to set. My dauther loves it!<br /><br />If we are going spend a long time in one place, such as parties or barbecues, camping etc... I take it with me. If she falls sleep, i don´t have to be seated with her in my arms, she goes to her bed and naps.<br /><br />My dauther uses it also to play with her dolls. I highly recommend it.
5.0	Is helping child learn in more than one way<br />and is soft compared to alot of the toys that are hard
5.0	Came on time, Exactly what i have expected from the product, and a realy good price, with short supply time. Thanks!
5.0	It is really nice and works for my 3yr old. She loves it to! it came with  water bottle which i don't use yet.
5.0	My daughter gave me my first Be Quick for my crochet. Now my DIL uses one for her counted cross stitch!
5.0	My son loved these. Even when he wasn't sucking on it he was still holding onto it.  I bought 3 different ones and over a dozen single binkies and a year later I still have all three wubbanubs  and not one binky.
5.0	My son loves the bright color. I love the spill proof lids (that do not leak). And we all love helping the environment!
5.0	We bought two of these car seats for our twins when they had grown out of their infant carriers. We love them! They fit better in our car than the infant carriers--giving us more leg room up front (even with the seats rear facing). They were easy to secure into our car using the LATCH system. The straps are so easy to adjust that we are sure we're getting the proper fit every time. Since the car seats are rated up to 50 lbs, we'll be using them for a long time.
5.0	This works perfectly and the price was right.  The only thing is that it is sorta bulky and doesn't fit into my diaper bag but that is probably to be expected in this type of cover. Overall I love it.
5.0	"My 6 month old babies love these keys!! They are easy to hold onto and make an excellent clacky sound when they shake them. Some other reviewers thought the keys seemed \\""flimsy\\"" but I like that they are light weight...then I don't have to worry so much about the twins banging themselves or each other with heavy chunky, plastic."
5.0	Received my mirror less than 24 hours ago and can already tell it is better than any other ive tried! Can clearly see my daughter and she can see me!!! Kept her calm on our 30 min car ride this afternoon!
5.0	These bibs are my new favorite bibs for my 7 month old. They are big but not too big for her right now and they will still work for a long time (and the elastic is adjustable).<br /><br />I've had problems before with velcro on some bibs chafing her but these do not. The velcro is secure but not irritating. The pouch in the front is a nice touch but the best part is how easy these are to clean.<br /><br />The Mickey designs are adorable. Definitely would recommend these; you will get a lot of use out of them.
5.0	Very nice seat. Soft and comes with a carrying case which is very convenient.
5.0	7 month old grandson loves to chew on this, just cut his first tooth. He has another tooth coming so he'll definitely get a lot of use out of it.
5.0	I've used both Medela and Munchkin sanitizing bags. You pay more with Medela, and you're paying more for the name. The quality is the same as Munchkin. Save yourself some money and go with Munchkin.
5.0	very cute my almost one year old grand child loves them
5.0	What a surprise.  I test ran the potty at home with my two toddlers.  It didn't wobble as much as I thought based on the other reviews.  My normally skittish toddler didn't mind.  Both used it as a seat and one used it on the toilet.  And it fits easily in my diaper bag.  Very impressed.  The bags are easy to attach and remove.
5.0	This is a great quality cotton percale sheet and was a lot thicker than I was expecting, given the inexpensive price. It comes in a variety of patterns which are very versatile and can be matched to most nursery d&eacute;cor.<br /><br />I have a Stokke Sleepi crib, which is an oval shape so I was unsure how this would fit, but it worked great. The sheet was easily able to be tucked under the mattress at the sides for a snug fit and is a lot less expensive than a regular Stokke sheet, as well as coming in a wider range of colour and pattern options.<br /><br />The crib sheet is washing and wearing well and the elastic ensures a secure fit. The fabric has a tight weave and I am confident it will last the distance with my baby. Very happy with it!
5.0	product looked better when they arrived then in the picture..which was great..no broken pieces and a good size for the game we are playing at a baby shower. Perfectly priced!
1.0	My 9 month old was able to pull this cover open in less then ten seconds. He just used one hand and it was open in seconds
5.0	looks beautiful in my grand daughter's bedroom. very colorful. love it.
5.0	I got two sets of these bc I wanted more for the play mat and to use in the stroller. They aren't thick like the ones that come with the our mat but I still like them.
5.0	My sons absolute favorite toy!! He's carried this around with him since he was 6 months, he's now 1 and still loves it!
5.0	Light and easy to install, great for a backseat with multiple kids.
5.0	TOPS:  solid construction, easy to clean, great fabric, removable comfortably padded liner, adorable print, and very stable.  Got it as a gift for my expectant daughter - why didn't they have great things like this when I was doing the &quot;mommy thing&quot;?  Worth every penny!
1.0	I have a 14 mo who has decided that drinking out of a water bottle is much better than a sippy cup. The problem i she ends up pouring water everywhere. I saw these no spill bottle caps and thought it was a perfect idea. I ordered them and they came just in time for our family trip out of town.  I was very excited. I haven't found a bottle that these caps fit on. I have tried all possible combinations. If the cap does go on the bottle a slight tug and the cap comes right off. I would not recommend this to anyone.
5.0	This little onesie is too cute on my little prince. Great fabric, beautiful design, tagless,  and not to mention, great price..love it!
1.0	Fine to wear with shoes, but purchased for the so-called non-skid feature.  The &#34;non-skid&#34; rubberized letters are only in the middle of the foot - not at the heal or the ball of the foot, so my poor little girl slipped and fell.
5.0	We bought two sets of these and I wish had purchased more (since they were on sale and are now back to full price).  These are great bibs and function just as you want a bib to.  They are the perfect size, large, but not so large that they are too long (which I have seen before), with a good closure that my girls cannot undo (a must!) and the material is great, easy to wipe off if the mess isn't too bad or can be thrown in washing machine and dryer if needed.
5.0	I love this diffuser! Super cute, sleek design. Super quiet. You can barely hear a little bubbly sound. The color changing is awesome but not overwhelming that it'll keep you awake at night. You can stop on any color you wish if you don't want to have it rotating through the colors. Packaged nicely and secure. Simple directions. Lid comes off easily, but is still secure. I'm not afraid to have it in my four year old's room. I would buy again.
5.0	these liners are great. Easy to use and fit into all of our four oz playtex drop in bottles. The price is right too! Esp if you have amazon prime and get free two day shipping!
5.0	AMAZING! Totally worth it!
5.0	This is a great sound machine for the money.  Lots of sound options and good quality of sounds.  Pretty loud.  Not as good as the marpac but good for the price.
5.0	This necklace is AMAZING!!! My son wasn't a very bad teether but my daughter is so bad, drooling, cranky, can't sleep, acidic diarreah, etc. Her shirt used to be soaked from drool but after 24 hrs of wearing her teething necklace her shirt was completely dry. Now after a few months, she does still drool some and the top of her shirt will be wet by the end of the day when she is teething extra hard but not anywhere near what it is without the necklace.<br /><br />Last week I took it off for her bath and forgot to pitot back on. That night was terrible. She was having a hard time sleeping, was restless and very fussy. The next morning I realized her necklace was off and pitot back on. The next night she slept great again waking only to nurse twice. The third night I forgot to put it on again after her bath and again she was very fussy and had a very restless night. I promise I will never forget to put it on her again. This thing works! I have read to make sure you buy the RAW one and that the lighter the color the better. That what we did and I am seriously in love! I tell everyone that this necklace is a must for every baby!
1.0	This blanket/teddy bear only  measures 20 inches wide by 22 inches long. Seriously.  I purchased two of these for two different gifts - and they are SMALLER than you advertised. You describe the item as a  size of 24 inches!  This is misleading; and the price is not cheap for this blanket made in China.
5.0	Worth every dollar!  This diaper is the best cloth diaper I have used!  It is so soft and comes in so many colors and prints!  It is so trim and looks great on, no super poofy booty!
5.0	Super cute diaper! fits great
5.0	I love these for for when my breast have leaked and I need a quick clean up!  I also love for cooling the breast when they are sore!<br />I truly think Bella B has some of the greatest BF products on the market & love their customer service!!
5.0	I have loved this baby monitor. The camera denifition is good, and it is very practicle and easy to use.
5.0	Best natural soothing cream for a soft baby bum.<br />I'd recommend this product to anyone. Give it a try now.
1.0	Read the product details.  Cal prop 65 details.  Don't get fooled by the organic labeling of the title--you don't want to wrap your baby in this.
5.0	Like others, I was skeptical about buying this mattress since it is so much cheaper than others.  But, I decided to take a chance because of all of the good reviews, and I am glad I didn't spend twice as much on a Sealy/Serta.  The mattress is good and firm, has a removable waterproof liner, and it fits snugly in the crib. Amazon had it to me the next day.  Great purchase, would recommend to anyone.
5.0	Easy to assemble. Pretty sturdy& it's the perfect length, even for my tall child.
1.0	Beware, the &#34;extra plush padding&#34; is... not plush, it is not even padding.  If a five year old can feel the hard plastic shell in highway smooth ride, it is nothing more than just a pink cover on injection moulded hard plastic shell.
5.0	"This warmer works great and is VERY convenient. I usually only need to warm one bottle while I am out and this does the trick.  Just boil the liner before your outing and then the special substance inside it is ready to warm up when you are ready. Just \\""click\\"" the little metal disk inside and watch the magical reaction warm the gel and your baby's bottle. It stays VERY warm for a long time so you might even be able to warm another bottle a little later if you needed to, but I haven't tried this.  <br /> <br />I recently took a 3 hour flight with my baby and this was a lifesaver.  It was easy to heat up his Avent bottles for takeoff and landing.  If the flight was longer, you might want two of these since you have to boil it to \\""reset\\"" the gel.  Plus, I had a head cold and the gel pack was still VERY warm after I used it to warm the bottle so I used it as a warm pack over my forehead. Once you no longer need a bottle warmer you are sure to find lots of uses for the gel pack. <br /> <br />This is a great buy. I would reccomend getting 2 for the convenience of it if you are out and about alot."
5.0	"I really like this pacifier holder. It is a tight squeez to get two in there but it is doable. It is very nice to just attach this to my purse and go about my day. I never have to worry about finding my daughters pacifier at the bottom of my purse or dig through her diaper bag when she is upset to find it. Very handy and gives pacifiers a clean \\""home\\""."
5.0	Favorite toy!  Recommend everyone buy one!
5.0	I use this for my car. This style is good for cars because you can press the lip down somewhat and put half the lip under your passenger seat - so it stays in place and doesn't move or tip over; and also it keeps the trash can partly out of view. Also, it keeps it close enough to the driver's seat so you can easily place stuff in it.
5.0	Pumping was horrific! I got pump burn every time ! But then I switched from Lansinoh to Medela and OMG what a difference! The lipids are key to healing !
5.0	This is the best diaper bag I've ever had-- lots of pockets-- roomy without being too large! Has great outside pocket to hold sippy cups or my camelbak
5.0	Exactly what I was looking for
5.0	This was a gift. The recepients loved it.
5.0	This was easy enough for my brother in law to assemble. Looks exactly as pictured. Durable bed, too. My toddlers have jumped and wrestled on this bed many, many times and it is still standing strong. Good purchase.
5.0	It's exactly what we expected.  Clean and quite simple.  Nothing complicated for my first grandbaby~    The mobility is a must moms!!!    Thanks Amazon!
5.0	We hummed and hawed about a changing table for the 9 months of pregnancy until a month after birth. We wanted something that was more than just a table, that would be useful past infancy, and that didn't cost an arm and a leg. We were hesitant to buy something this large online but we are so thankful that we did. It is manufactured wood. so the paint does scratch easily, there are a lot of pieces, and it is heavy, but we love it! It feels so solid once put together and is so easy to keep stuff at hand and organized. Diaper changes are a breeze and it is babies FAVORITE place to be. She smiles and talks anytime she's on the table! The drawers provide enough space for all of our cloth diapers and all of babies clothes. Once she's older it will be a perfect small dresser for her bedroom. If you want a solid, real wood piece of furniture you are going to pay a lot more than this. If you want a functional, easy to use, convenient piece at a reasonable price this is it! I also want to mention the customer service of this company is the best we've ever experienced! there was a small nick in one of the panels and we called them and they sent us a completely new piece free of charge and it was delivered within the week. The representative was super nice as well. And just an FYI sometimes they use scrap wood as packaging to prevent damage so if you have extra wood don't think that you missed a step, its just extras :-)
5.0	Easy to install, granddaughter loves the look and the comfort.  Its also portable. When my son picked up his children, he only had one car seat with him, so it was easy to let him use this one.  Will definitely buy another one when the two year old gets big enough.
5.0	These diapers are amazing. I originally bought a pack of a different brand because they were a little bit cheaper and they leaked every time. Based on the recommendations of friends, I decided to try the bumgenius elementals and I have not been disappointed. They are easily adjustable and fit my 4 month old perfectly. They also snap down to fit newborns; I wish I'd had these all along. They don't leak at night either, and my boy sleeps through for about 10 hours straight. I use the bummies reusable liners with them to keep him feeling dry.<br /><br />They do take a long time to dry, and the instructions recommend line drying. Having a really sunny spot for this is helpful. I've dried them in the dryer though and they came out fine.
5.0	I HATE hand cleaning bottles as I am lazy and those anti-gas dr. browns bottles were a pain to wash several times a day. There's plenty of room. It fits pacifiers, straws, anti-gas tube thingys from dr. browns  bottles, nipples, and sippy cup parts. The straw holders flip down if you do not need them. They also break kinda easy, but I didn't use them much anyway. I wasn't fond of the color (pink), but that doesn't affect the performance and function. I highly recommend this. Great price as well.
5.0	LOVE this seat!  More than my two Britax convertible seats.  I was up in the air between this and the Britax booster but am so glad I got this seat!
5.0	Had no problem getting our granddaughter off her bottle with this cup!  She loves it.  Now, if only we could get her off these and on to the cups for toddlers.  She refuses any kind, but the Nuk learner cups!!
1.0	The essential air harnessed booster seat head rest DOES NOT stay in place on. As a consumer I have found the demo in the store and my current car seat to both have faulty head rest. I feel as though this should be further evaluated to see if a recall should be issued for safety reasons on this particular model.Their response was wow I havent heard of that happening before. That's odd considering so many other reviews say the same thing. They offered to replace it with a different model because they are phasing that one out and dont have anymore in stock at the factory. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT
5.0	I don't go any where without it.  Every time I pull it out I get asked where I bought it.
5.0	My sister got these for her stroller and I could not wait to get mine. When you have kids (I have a home daycare) you always have lots of stuff. This holds a small cooler, purse, diaper bag and they hooks can be put on tight to stay put! Would make a great shower gift for new parents
5.0	The best car seat- it actually has padding and my one week old not only fits but sleeps so sound in it! So much better than others we looked at at a similar cost and the extra bar is great for grip.
5.0	My daughter loves it for her grand baby.  Helps her a lot when babysitting with this sweet little girl. Thanks
5.0	great gift<br /><br />excellent quality, still being used like new 2 years later, i would recommened this product for new moms<br /><br />thanks
5.0	Great item with fast shipping!
5.0	6weeks old and i both love it.<br />easy to use, no hassle<br />newbornhangs in perfect so i finally can do some work while having her close
5.0	Looks awesome and comes off easily.
5.0	My 8 month old son loves this teether. The hole in the middle makes it easy to hold. He loves feeling the different textures on each 'petal.' He kept trying to chew on flat plastic things like my keychain and he likes putting tags in his mouth, so I figured he would like this teether. He loves it! He wouldn't put it down for more than a few seconds the first time I gave it to him. He often tries to carry it around with him as he crawls! I also love the fact that it is BPA and phthalate free. My one complaint is that it's hard for me to find because it is clear. However, HE always seems to find it!
5.0	IN LOVE! Perfect to give that finished/completed look to nursery!
5.0	Love it and that we didn't have to get a full size stroller for twins and that their car seats just fit right on here.
5.0	Very unique. Quite handy for two children.
5.0	I got this for my Niece for her baby and they love it so much. It has worked out very well. Thanks
5.0	We purchased and have been using the monitor for almost a year now, and we liked it so much we just ordered another one for our daughter's play room. The old monitor had a couple issues though: the port for charging broke off inside the monitor with no way to fix it, and the beeping sound was annoying every time you hit the top button to put the monitor to sleep/wake up, but they addressed both issues with the new model. We called the company that makes them and they were nothing but helpful and super nice! They told us just to send back the faulty monitor, send them a picture of the receipt showing we shipped it, and they sent a new one out immediately. I mailed it on a Saturday afternoon, and the new one arrived no later than that Tuesday (may have even been Monday, but I don't remember for sure).  They followed up with us to make sure we received it OK and if we had any other issues. They definitely honored their one year warranty, and it was easily one of the best customer service experiences I've ever had.<br /><br />On to the actual monitor & camera: the picture is great, as is the range and sound. The camera is lightweight and easily mounts to the wall with one screw. Set-up is instant, as you just need to charge the monitor and plug in the camera. It's already paired. Adding a 2nd camera to each monitor is a breeze too. There's one button you hold on the camera after you select the camera button on the monitor's menu (so simple to find), and you can pair up to 4 separate cameras to one monitor. It has excellent night vision as well. I do wish you could set a warning for when the temperature gets outside of a comfortable range, but it's not a big enough issue to knock any stars off the rating, nor prevent us from ordering another one.  The new version also no longer makes the beeping sound when you want to change between the &#34;sleep&#34;/black screen and the &#34; awake&#34;/viewing screen, which is a huge improvement. Believe me, that very loud beep got really old whenever she woke up in the middle of the night and I wanted to check on her - it would wake my husband up each time. But now, it's silent and I can check on her anytime I want.  Overall, I'm very happy with our purchases.
5.0	My little teenie tiny cute little baby girl loves this thing. NUK for president, NUK for mayor!
5.0	Loved it! I lost my daughter's favorite blanket similar to this one I'm happy she liked it!
5.0	This product was just as it was listed on the website and even arrived before it was scheduled
5.0	great product, on time shipping....everyone is happy! thank you
5.0	I love this diffuser. I have two. One for upstairs and one for downstairs. It throws a great deal of scent and is quiet. I like the nice colors it cycles through as well. Perfect.
1.0	I have these same blankets but in a different pattern. I got them as a gift and wanted a few more. After getting them in the mail I realized they are not if the same quality as the store bought blankets. I am returning! They are rough muslin, not the soft material I expected.
5.0	item came quickly and is exactly as described
5.0	I have used this diaper pail for about a month. Before getting this pail, I have used the Diaper Genie and the Diaper Champ. I like the Arm &  Hammer diaper pail because it keeps the room smelling fresh. After a few days, the others start to make the room smell. I do like the convenient bags that come with this product. All you have to do is fold the top, snap it closed and take it to the trash! I love not having to knot and tie the other bags closed. This pail is wonderful!
5.0	Before finding this, I was using rubber bands on the knobs to &#34;lock&#34; my pantry doors, but my son (only 2....) figured out how to remove them, and raid the pantry.<br /><br />Since these slide on the top of the door, he can't reach them, they are easy to use, and they keep the doors completely closed.  Perfect.<br /><br />They come with spacers for smaller doors as well, so I would assume that they work with just about everything out there.<br /><br />Great product.
5.0	Love this, totally worth the money!!
5.0	This gate has 3 main pieces and some smaller hardware but best of all it is a sturdy and well made product.  We have had ours since 2010 and still use it.  We bought two Golden Retrievers and needed to block off an area of the house for them.  They have since learned not to jump up on the gate or people but it is there when we need some alone time.  It is made of tubular steel with a good coating and painting on it.  When you buy yours do not be alarmed when you see the latch part of the gate sticking out at an angle.  This helps keep the tension against the wall and door beams.  It is a little tricky at first but once you set it up you will be glad you bought this gate.  The gate swings both ways and can be adjusted for small and large doorways.  It is also tall and strong enough to keep back two 90 pound pooches.  Just be sure to keep the gate straight up and down as there is a latch at the top and a pin at the bottom.  It cleans up nicely even though the bars are round.  Enjoy.
5.0	I purchased the PINCH NOT Door Safety Shield for installation in my home. We have four children under the age of 6 and I have been very pleased.<br /><br />- Effective: Great design on this thing with its accordion type plastic construction.  Fingers are SAFE.<br />- Quick Delivery<br />- One Size Fits All - To trim the shields to size, you just snap off a pre-perforated section on the top of the shields.<br />- EASY INSTALLATION - Huge positive for this product is how easy it was to install. Through a really impressive use of adhesives, they really make it easy to install.  Just READ the six (only six!) instructions and this will be up in no time.<br />- No Screws - You will not be drilling holds in walls or doors<br />- Durable - The adhesive on the shields is serious - this thing is not coming off anytime soon. My youngest is 6 weeks and my eldest is 5 and 1/2 so that is a good thing for me.<br /><br />Why is this product a REALLY GOOD IDEA for anyone with kids?<br /><br />Listen to this...I was planning to install this in the door to my 3 and a 1/2 year old daughter's room. It is in a high traffic spot and I had seen one of my childrens hand / fingers in the door jamb there previously. However, when I was in the midst of installation, my 5 and a 1/2 year old told me that he had got his fingers stuck in the door to the garage once.  Really? Yes, he said, he was screaming and then mom came to help him out.  So that is where we installed it.  I had no idea that we had a door / finger injury at our house UNTIL I bought this and my boy chimed in.  Ask your kids if they have ever had their finger smashed in a door.
5.0	My baby used Dr Brown since birth. Easy to swallow and does help burping.
5.0	Easy to install and does the job well. Keeps my daughters finger safe.
5.0	Item is as described and shown in the pictures, exactly same colors.  Lovely piece, trendy and handy. I love the quality
5.0	Fits nicely on the toilet without slipping. Nice cushion. Great spray protector. Easy to clean. My son loves the design.
5.0	I love this towel!  It's really soft and absorbent.  My child stays nice and warm after her baths.  I would recommend this set to any parent.
5.0	Baby was drowning herself with the normal Dr. Brown's natural flow nipples, so I did some research and came across these so decided to try.  Great decision!!  Baby is wasting much less milk now and actually has to suck at them a bit to get the milk out which I like so that she won't start to prefer bottle to breast.  I've been able to switch back and forth between bottle and breast with no issues.  Due to feeding issues we had to introduce bottles at 2 weeks old.
5.0	Absolutely love this crib liner!
5.0	We are very happy with our purchase. We bought them primarily to protect the car seats from muddy shoes.  The pouches are an added advantage. Excellent price as well!
5.0	"I used this to nurse my baby to sleep for all naps.  Had purchased the bjorn for newborns (white/grey with red trimming), but it only lasted for 8 weeks, wasn't cheap, and was rather uncomfortable for me - the bjorn had no support!  Conversely with the Ergo, my daughter was able to fit into this comfortably (for both of us) from 3 months to 14 months, and I even used it once for a 6 hour flight where she had to stay on my lap and I created a \\""sleep zone\\"" for her. She was 23 months at that time, and though snug - it still worked!"
1.0	my baby is big enough to roll over but his arms  are compressed and his face is then pressed to the mattress.
5.0	my baby hated tummy time but at 4 month visit doctor said she needed more tummy time. This works great!!
5.0	I use this gate to keep my boxer out of the dining room. The doorway is 4ft wide and the gate fits it perfectly. It was very easy to assemble (I didn't even need the instructions). I love how it doesn't put holes in the door frame with any screws - the suction cups lock it in place just great! It's sturdy and the door swings either way. However, I rarely walk into the dining room and my dog doesn't mess with the gate at all, so it serves it's purpose for me, but I can't vouch for it if it's going to be used in a heavy traffic area.
5.0	Your baby will love this.  Our baby sits and plays with the tags.
5.0	My grand daughter loves sunglasses and these will be so special for her because of Minnie Mouse. She really hams it up in her sunglass collection.
1.0	It broke after one use you think the red cross would put its name on something of quality. One use then showed previous weigh and nothing else. Removed the batterie ps to reset but same thing. Waste of money
5.0	Best thing ever made, easy to take with you and store! My daughter absolutely loves it!
5.0	Provides a decent amount of cool white light for avoiding obsticals.<br />Sensor works as expected. Light is directed upward and reflects off the wall. This creates a light pattern of arches about 3 foot long on the wall. This light pattern is neither good nor bad, but it will provide the most light into a room from white or light colored walls.
5.0	you cant ask for something better than this. really spacious, a lot of pockets, looks manly(lol). the price is fair.
5.0	Granddaughter absolutely loved it!!
5.0	This really is something all parents should get - you will definitely use them.  We have them to secure toys while our son is in his swing and his car seat.  We also use them when we are out and about so that he can have a toy and we don't have to worry about him dropping it and then finding a way to clean the toy.
5.0	This is perfect for our boys room. It arrived quickly...it looks perfect and its a fun little clock.  Would recommend!
5.0	Super easy to use and very cost effective
5.0	My wife thought it good
5.0	After our first child, we placed the baby monitor unit in storage.  Once baby #2 arrived, we pulled out the monitors from storage to setup in the nursery and realized the batteries wouldn't hold a charge any more.  After looking online at several sites, we found these @ Amazon.  The replacement batteries were recieved earlier than promised and are a direct replacement for the ones provided by Graco iMonitor Vibe unit (Model #2795).
5.0	I am very happy with this product.  It offered exactly what I needed and my son loves it.  It was VERY easy to install, easily taken out to clean when needed, and very easy to change the strap locations when needed.  I especially like the way the cup holders are done because they will fit multiple size cups due to the stretchy band.  My son and I are both VERY happy with this seat!
5.0	I purchased this for my granddaughter and it has become a great gift for my daughter and myself. Good baby, but very hard to put down when she is awake. She LOVES this swing. She plays, sleeps and watches her baby videos in this swing. When she gets tired of swinging one direction, we simply change the direction and she is content a while longer.    The fact that you can plug it in is fantastic. I highly recommend this swing.
5.0	I'm on my 6th year of breastfeeding.  I have used many different types of pumps.  I give breastfeeding support to women as part of my living.  I love this pump more than any other I've used.  I loved the Isis hand pump, and this pump has all the benefits of that pump and the added benefit of pumping two sides at once (shown to increase supply and output) and if one has a hands-free pumping bra (or converts a standard nursing bra), two sides at once and hands-free.  It's great - I pump to get let down a couple of times, push a button, and the pump takes over for me.  Once let-down starts, I pump a couple of long expression pumps, push a button, and the pump does what I just did.  It's great.  I get an average of 3 let-downs each time I pump when I'm away from my baby.  This pump works exceptionally well.
5.0	Fit our bassinet perfect is soft  couldn't find any other bassinet sheets that fit as well as these did and you can't beat the price very affordable!!
5.0	This is a great product. My 9 month old just loves it. There's plenty of room to play and she climbs on the side without it falling or becoming unstable. Also it was delivered quite quickly and assembly is very simple.
5.0	This is consistent with recommended guidelines for safe sleep for infants. The micro fleece is very soft.
5.0	Gift also. but not much you can say about a wash  cloth, they look fine thru the package. Wash cloths are well wash cloths
5.0	This slide lock fit perfectly on my solid, two panel closet door.I was worried at first about the slide-lok being made of plastic, but it is pretty amazing how simple it is and how well it works. I cannot open the closet when it is in place. A simple slide to the right or left, and the closet opens normally. I wish all the other child safe products worked as simply as this. I highly recommend.
5.0	Can't live without them to keep my growing baby boy warm and safe!
5.0	I purchased two of these during the Holiday season for young family members.  One was 4 months, the other 8 months.  Both of them are still enjoying the item nearly 5 month later!  A great toy for babies who are first learning to sit or who are exploring things during tummy time.  It is the perfect shape for many months of play and exploration.
5.0	The briliance of the light made it so easy to see.  My friend ordered 4 for her business.
5.0	Heard about this through a friend.  Once it arrived it was the go to seat for my newborn son.  Have the orignal boppy also but the lounger gets much more use.
1.0	Don't waste your money on this item. It was all folded up when received, so it's bent around the rim. The part that goes around the head is to thick and so the water doesn't run freely down the hat. It did not fit our grand daughters head very well even with the adjustable snaps. It also smell like chemicals. We tossed it in the garbage. Not worth the money it would cost to return it.
5.0	Highly recommend this product. It is awesome. The little one is a lot less fussy at changing time. So that means I am less cranky at the 3AM changing.
5.0	Perfect item for us. It is utilized every single day. We have ours on the couch and she naps in this every day. She hates her bassinet so, without this, we would not know what to do. We even pack it up and take it to friends and families houses when we visit. She sleeps in it there just as well as at home. I cannot say enough about this item... it is probably the best thing we have for her besides her swing.
5.0	We purchased another type of Popsicle maker but the summer heat would get to the popsicle before the kids could finish them and there would always be some chunks of popsicle on the floor.  The Popsicle maker made the perfect size for little hands and the kids would have enough time to finish them before they would melt.  They are easy to remove after being frozen.
5.0	Even though we have not put our baby in it yet, this crib exceeded my expectations! We purchased the Oak wood one and it is gorgeous! The crib was easy to put together, compared to most crib and it is sturdy but not too heavy! This crib does come with the parts to convert it to the other stages. I would purchase from them again!
5.0	Our favorite infant spoon.  Very safe and soft
5.0	This is the second sippy cup I've tried for my 6 month old (the first one is a Nuby and she had a hard time with the spout). It is lightweight and easy to hold. The spout is longer than most that I've seen so it is a good transition from a bottle. It's also soft for little gums. I love that the handles spin around from the bottom of the cup so they are always in line with the spout.  I've used this cup for several weeks now and have never had a leak. I've carried it around in my diaper bag and it's been dropped repeatedly from the high chair (yeah.. we've started that game) with no problems.  She does usually end up with water all over her front when she bites on the spout, but that's going to happen with any cup when they are just learning.
5.0	My little girl loves this cup. And the bright colors makes it easy to spot -- when she sees it she gets to excited. Loves drinking water from this.
5.0	Beautiful! And my baby loves chomping on them!
5.0	Bought this and the matching crib--LOVE THEM BOTH!  Very easy to put together--easiest if you have 2 people though.  We accidentally used the wrong screws in the beginning which resulted in drilling thru the outside, but unless you're looking for it, it's hardly noticable.  Love the quality--some say it scratches easily, but have not found this to be the case with us.  Highly recommended!!
1.0	Not very safe. The layers of extension comes apart. My child has never been in it while it collapsed but it does collapse.
5.0	We have had this sheet for almost two years now and it has been the most durable crib sheet we have owned. It has also been one of the easiest to put on the mattress.  It has held up to numerous washings, is still soft, and the elastic has remained intact.
5.0	Love.  Doesn't dry wipes. Needs to be refilled often but love the travel feature.
5.0	We bought this for our baby when she was 4 months old, and she fell in love with it instantly. She would spend hours bouncing and playing in it, if we let her.  She is now almost 7 months and still loves this toy. She touches and plays with all of the toys on this jumperoo. It has held up very well, considering she's an extreme bouncer and loves rocking back and forth in it.    It was fairly easy to put together, and very easy to adjust the height.  I had to take the seat pad off to clean and it was very easy off and very easy on. I threw it right in the washing machine and it came out like new.     Baby and I love this product and would recommend it to everyone for every baby.
5.0	This was great for the money, still have it after all this time, still works great. would recommend this product.
5.0	This swing is fabulous!  My daughter is 5 weeks old and we have been using the swing for the past few weeks.  She is mesmerized by the fish on the mobile and is content to swing in it for as long as we'll let her.  I'm happy that she has a fun and safe place to be while I get stuff done around the house.  She giggles her head off in this swing -- it's a great investment!
5.0	Easy to put up together, easy to fold and carry away. My baby girl loves the hanging toys, and she seems to sleep just fine when i put her in it; the only problem i find is that the padding it's not comfortable enough, but I'm still glad with this purchase, even when i usually don't really like Graco products because they seem tyo be  huge and rough sometimes.
5.0	This product is a perfect play mat for babies. It cushions and insulates the wood floor, cleans easily, and has no small parts that would be choking hazards.  It can be used to create 3 dimensional shapes - intriguing for toddlers.  It is also very useful when camping!
1.0	The First Years crisp and clear was the worst monitor. Crisp and clear is what they call it, what a joke. Should have been called static with more static. You can tell if your baby screams or cries due to the loud noise you hear, but other then that, nothing. Super static baby monitor.<br /><br />Graco digital connect baby monitor is an awesome monitor. It is crystal clear. You can hear every single little sound your baby makes with absolutely no static. This monitor has some cool extras to it too. It shows you what the temperature in your babies room is on the main base. Something super cool that for me that gets used a lot is that the monitor has a talk back option. So, for example, if you are with baby in the nursery and you ask your hubby what the temperature reads for babies room, your hubby can push a button and talk back to you. Very convenient.<br /><br />Vtech was an ok monitor. I could hear when my baby was crying or screaming, but all the little cute sounds that babies make, like cooing, I couldn't really hear to well. Any sound I heard come over the monitor came in with a little bit of static also.
5.0	he started losing intrest before he was finished his bottles, we switched to these and he sucks down the bottle in half the time.
1.0	Projector stopped working after only using it two nights. Im very upset because it put my son right to sleep.
5.0	Quality product.  My daughter refused to use a blanket or a sheet so this worked out well.
5.0	I don't have much new to add, besides another 5 star review. It has been my son's favorite since he first got it at 4 months and now still at 9 months. It's easy to grab, it's soft (which got us through the period when he would inadvertently hit himself in the face with everything he grabbed), it makes a nice gentle rattling noise, and it bounces (convenient for when he is in an enclosed space and it can bounce back to him). He enjoys tossing the ball to us.
5.0	This potty is wonderful!
5.0	its the best looking playpen on the market. very sturdy with a large play area. the fabric colors are beautiful. no more plastic in kitchy-koo patterns!
5.0	I highly recommend this product for baby meal time. It's very soft and cute. You maybe love it. Esay to use and clean.
5.0	My daughter love it, my husband likes to take a nap on it too!
5.0	My one year old really likes these balls.  She can easily grasp them, throw them, kick them, and bang them together.  She is fascinated by the texture.  My older children really enjoy them as well.  I recommend them to people all the time.
5.0	Thought it was so cute for a baby due in mid October, Daddy is a huge Giant's fan
5.0	My kids love these!  I am going to need another set now that I am expecting again.  They know their patterns and I doubt will share... these are not the botique ones therefore are slightly thinner but my kids don't seem to mind.  Better for summer babies anyway.  Now they just use them as pillows and I can't complain becuase they are safer than a pillow and much easier to wash!
5.0	I bought this necklace for my daughter (3 months), who has started drooling and biting already. I also bought one for my cousin's new baby, as a gift. Even though she lives in Florida (and I in VA), they each arrived at the same time. I really find that Amber works well for teething. It seems to reduce the discomfort and the drooling, although it isn't a miracle cure. Once, I took the necklace off my son (I had one for him when he was little) to give him a bath, and forgot to put it back on. The next day, I was commenting to a friend how he had been so fussy for the last day, when I realized that I'd left the necklace off. I really think they work.<br /><br />This one seems of good quality. It is as pictured. The string seems to be maybe slightly lighter in color (like a golden yellow) than the picture suggests, but it could also be lighting or my monitor's setting. It is pretty, and the beads are small enough that even if my daughter did somehow manage to get one in her mouth (not sure how that would happen), it would likely not choke her. It has the same screw-in clasp as other amber teething necklaces I've owned. It is nice & secure. It is also a really good length. It would be long enough to comfortably fit a fat baby, but isn't so long as to be a problem for a skinny baby. My baby is on the skinny side, and is 3 months old in the pictures below. She wears the necklace under her clothes, next to her skin, to get the benefits of the amber, but I pulled it out to show the length in the one picture. In the other picture, the necklace is partially down her back, as it usually sits, and you can see it because she's about to outgrow that onesie (they grow so FAST!). If this one breaks, I'll likely buy another from the same company.
5.0	Comfortable for one child, also.  I rearranged the straps and my daughter rides in the middle by herself. My two-year-old daughter is 30 pounds and 37 inches tall.  Folds fairly flat, tires come off easily.  It is lightweight and I barely notice I'm pulling it. From folded flat to hooked onto my bike ready to go takes about 3 minutes to get the 6 hitch pin-like pieces into place.  Has a rain cover, do wish there was a side vent, but the front ventilation with the rain cover up is good.  Lots of storage in the back for extra supplies.  Has a fairly good sized pocket on either side that she puts her water bottle or a snack in one side and our smaller bluetooth speaker on the other.  The only adjustment I wish could be made is maybe a little more head room.  She wears her bike helmet and with it on, the top of the helmet touches the top of the cover on the trailer.  Doesn't seem to bother her yet and if she leans back a little it's better, just not sure how that will be a year or so from now.  For what it's worth, I bought this at my local bike specialty shop and they assembled it and put the piece on my bike that attaches it for $220.
5.0	this was a great item for my developmentally delayed baby. His therapists raved about it when they saw it!
5.0	This is one of my favorite baby items! It really does make any bag a diaper bag. I don't always want to lug my full diaper bag around, (like when visiting someone in their house or using my umbrella stroller) and I can just grab this and know I have a diaper change just in case. I also keep a disposable diaper pad in one of the pockets for those nasty public changing stations. Very useful on an airplane too!!
5.0	These pacifiers are the same kind that I got from the NICU for my daughter and she would not use any other brand or shape. This is the only place that I was able to find these pacifiers and not have to by a whole box. I ordered these and contacted them to fix something on my order and they were very nice and helped me out without any problems, PLUS they still got shipped to me very quickly.   My daughter loves these and the colors are so much cuter than Soothie.
5.0	Excelent... Delivery right on time
5.0	I wish we had more floor space for her to cruise around on it. She is so happy playing independently in it and scooting around. She is 6 months old and I am afraid she is going to grow out of it too soon. I love the clean line of it and she gets to play with whatever toys we have around. She loves throwing toys from her standing/walking position.
5.0	I really like the medium flow nipples, they are my niece's favorite.  If she is in a patient mood, the slow ones also work well, but when she is hungry, she needs more flow.  With the quick flow, she can suck down a bottle in record time, so the medium flow are the perfect speed for most occasions.  I love the whole kiinde breast feeding system.
5.0	After researching the latest news on crib bumper safety I couldn't get the traditional crib bumper I had purchanced for my daughter out of her cib fast enough. As a new mom you always worry about the safety of your child. I heard rave reviews about the Wonder Bumpers. I decided to try them out. I could not be happier. Not only are they safe, soft, and adorable but they give me the peace of mind that my daughter is safe throughout the night! Thanks Wonder Bumpers. [...]
5.0	Love, love, love The Art of Cure products. My little guy has been so much better with teething and drooling because of them. Thank you Art of Cure!
5.0	Holds the cars eat in place allows you to recline so when kids fall asleep their heads do not slump forward. Super comfy. My boy is 3.5 41&#34; and loves it. It also omens with 2 cup holders.
5.0	These seem to work just as well as the more expensive brand name pocket diapers. We've been cloth diapering for four babies. We can't afford the higher prices so we started buying these. They work really well. I've had more leaks in paper diapers than cloth. Make sure you look up what detergents are safe for cloth diapers and don't use softener or they will become waterproof and not absorb the moisture! Also watch out for Diaper rash creams, some are OK and others can mess up your diapers.
5.0	My toddler loves the set! He wont eat from any other plate or bowl. Nice and easily fits in the diaper bag.
5.0	Soft and look great after multiple washes.
5.0	This was a shower present,  The mother was quite pleased with it.
5.0	very nice the kids seemed to like it very much it was was on their wish list
5.0	I was nervous buying non-medela bottles because I wanted to have a seamless fit between the bottle and the pump.  These seem like they'll be fantastic for breast milk storage AND they fit the threads on the pump replacement parts.  Super price!  No chemicals.  Easy to boil and disinfect without worrying about melting.  I'm one happy momma.  (would be nice if evenflo created rubber grips and sold them SEPERATELY intead of only in pre packaged form)
5.0	This is a nice product.  It's much larger than I expected, difficult to put together and take apart.  This would not be an easy to pack up and take for a weekend item.  I also purchased the travel lite crib and that is muche easier to handle.
5.0	Grandson turned 2 a few months ago and has been climbing out of crib for some time.  This bed railing is perfect.  No problems whatsoever.  The little guy loves his transformed new big-boy bed, and the railing is holding up perfectly (because he insists on climbing over the railing rather than going through the open sides.  Such a boy.  Love this product.
5.0	I really like this chair, it rocks very smoothly and wasn't too difficult to put together.  I really enjoy sitting and rocking in this, the padding is very comfortable for me.  The seat for the rocker isn't too big, though I can sit in it easily (I wear a size 12/14 pants) I can see how if you were large it might be a tight fit.<br /><br />One thing to be aware of with this type of rocker (or really any rocker) is little fingers.  There are a couple of places on the base where little fingers could be squished/trapped.  The chair is fairly light, so as long as no one was in the rocker there probably wouldn't be any damage.  However, I would be careful if little ones were around while someone is rocking in the chair.
5.0	My 18 month old niece loved this gift.  She enjoyed using it as expected, and just playing with the balls.
1.0	The moment I opened the package, I knew that this tub would not work. The inside portion of the tub is smaller than our plastic tub. We wanted a transition tub, not a tiny baby tub. This product is going back.
5.0	Beautiful wood letters decorate my son's nursery. The guides that are included are perfect for hanging with a couple simple nails. I'm a perfectionist and it was super easy to hang these letters. They are a really great quality. Definitely worth the extra couple bucks compared to the other options.
5.0	I bought this when they had on sale for $[...]. I was very hesitant because I have had such bad luck w/ strollers. This one is awesome and would have paid more if i had to. steers easily. large basket underneath. very easy to fold. great cup holders. its a little smaller. my 2 1/2 yr old wont be fitting much longer but my 8 month old should be able to use it for the next couple of yrs. dont hesitate to buy this one. It is worth every penny.
5.0	I love the formula dispensers perfect thing for a diaper bag.
5.0	I really like this sippy cut, I will compare it to the skip hop sippy cup my dautgher has, is really similar and I would say it is somehow better because of the handles, it make it easy for her to carry and drink from it
5.0	I bought this stool to help with potty training. My 2-year uses it to wash his hands, brush his teeth, and turn off lights. I have tried other stools but my son never figured out how to stand on them correctly, that is why the feet placement design is great!
5.0	I love this carseat so much!  I live in Japan where the cars are small.  I have three boys that sometimes ride in the back seat all together.  They can all fit while using this carseat.  We had no problems installing it rear facing or front facing.  I originally bought this in the lime green color, and now I have the red.  They're both excellent!
5.0	A great piece for baby to grab on to. Can easily be shortened to whatever length you like. I recommend it to any nursing/babywearing mother.
5.0	We got two of these gates for our family room.  Wow, they are great....look nice, easy to open and close or lock with one hand, no toeholds for little ones or dogs to climb over, quietly swing shut if you want or stay open.  I have nothing negative to say.  They are exactly what we need.
5.0	Yes indeed this set does take a chunk out of your wallet , but lets face it, youre probably interested in this item because it is BPA free, and anything BPA free comes with a premium price tag. its a wonderfully made set of feeding dishes for your little one - the finish is great and we are using ours daily. The stainless steel linings can be slipped out of their plastic bottoms for ease of cleaning. Wonderfuly great product - very pleased !
5.0	This is a very nice neutral color sheet that works well with varied nursery décor.<br />Washes well and looks nice after several washes
5.0	My son just loves this toy. It stays on his diaper changing station so that he can happily kick it and listen to music. Rather than nursery rhymes, it plays a brief clip of classical music, not too loud. You can suction it to a surface for hand play, or you can hold it at your child's feet for kicking. I highly recommend.
5.0	I ordered this after reading review after review, and I am so very happy I did.  I've tried all the shakers I could buy at my local box stores and none of them worked well.  I had trouble with getting all the formula out when making a bottle as well as issues with formula falling out (ugh, expensive!) when lids were not tight enough.  This caddy is shaped differently than others, takes up a bit more room in the diaper bag but is totally worth it.  I've bought a second one for my mother in law to use while she is spending quality time with her grandson!
5.0	It makes every little girls princess fantasy real and fun. It brightens up every little girls princess bedroom with fun dreams.
5.0	My daughter enjoys this so much!
1.0	Received in horrible condition!!!! Very disappointed satisfied :(
5.0	We were looking for a video monitor to replace our old summer infant video monitor that doesn't support multi camera viewing. We have 3 kids now and we really want to keep an eye on all of them, primarily our 1 year old little boy. We use this mostly at night when we sleep having our monitor screen downstairs and the camera upstairs where they sleep. We really like how good the night vision is on this unit. We got everything around $260 and I don't think we can get anything better at this price range.<br /><br />The volume falls a bit on the short side but we found that you can help boost the volume by placing this on a metal tray (we found one from our kitchen) and force the sound to be amplified by this home-made apparatus... it works and you can give it a try!
5.0	These are awesome, just as good as the diaper genie brand, but more for less. They fit perfectly in my diaper genie pail!
5.0	EXCELLENT PRODUCT !!!
5.0	I love these bottles. I purchased  two packs for my twin babies. They are the perfect flow and no leaks. Would recommend these and can't beat the price!
5.0	This is a Great, cheap and convenient stroller. My son loves it and I have no major issues with it. The shade could have been a little bigger and the back abut more vertical but it does exactly what it says. Best for the price.
5.0	We ordered this for our daughter who will be here in September.  Its intended use is as a bassinet in our bedroom for the first few months. The assembly was really easy, and everything is sturdy.  We washed the pad, and it held up perfectly.. soft, but not too deep or squishy. It really seems like the perfect blend of cozy but not overly so for safety reasons - and I am a super paranoid first-time mom. The arm does make a clicking sound when you swing it out of the way- its not a defect or anything, just don't move it when the baby is asleep. I wish it was a little bit taller, but the plus side is that I will be able to look off the side of the bed and see her face and breathing without getting out of bed.
5.0	This lunch bag is much bigger than I thought.  It's very roomy and I like how tall it is.  I have only used it once so far, but so far so good.  It seems to be a decent quality as well.  If anything changes I will revise my review, but for now I really like this lunch bag!
5.0	I absolutely loved the Diaper Genie! It works wonderfully. You just put in the diaper and give it a twist or two and you diaper is gone until you empty the unit.  It was a little tricky learning how the refill it, but once you get the hang of it, it's pretty simple.  After my daughter started on stage 3 foods and table food, there was a limitation to how long I could leave diapers in the diaper pail. It will start to smell. Plastic does become porous. Any pail will. So I recommend that you change the Genie every few days, don't just wait until it gets full. If your child has a stinky diaper everyday you can pretty much figure when they go and should probably start potty training. My daughter was fully trained before she turned two. We had fun learning how to go potty and wearing favorite underwear. You cannot rely on any diaper pail to indefinitely hold in odors. Just read the directions and keep the thing clean and fresh. You shouldn't have any problems.
5.0	I am so impressed with this necklace.  My little man is 10 months old and is getting three teeth at the same time.  Unfortunately, we can tell that these are more uncomfortable than previous teeth he has gotten in as he is fussy, warm, drooly, and tugs at his ears.  After receiving the necklace, I noticed that he wasn't drooling as much.  And even though he would get a bit warm still, he wasn't fussy or tugging at his ears.  I really liked that the necklace helped my little one, but I was really impressed by the fact that it is so sturdy.  My son tugged on it when I put it on him as a bracelet or anklet and it didn't break apart.  I love that the length allows for it to be worn as a necklace that is not too tight, but it's short enough that it can't be pulled and put into the mouth.  I'm glad I found a product that works, is versatile, and it is adorable on my baby boy.
5.0	I thought this was a bit frivolous, but it is very functional. We have the twig and the flower, and the flower is perfect for bottle nipples, and the twig holds the rings. It brings a bit of fun to an otherwise mundane task, and also makes the job easier by filling its role really well. Once we are done with bottles, we will definitely keep using it for regular dishes!
5.0	After extensive research (and I seriously mean it when I say extensive) I finally decided on this carrier, and I'm very happy with my decision! This carrier is excellent and excellent quality. We purchased this to use for our 6 week old daughter. We also have a two year old so I was in great need of having both hands, and arms, free to wrangle him. This carrier is extremely user friendly, easy to get on and off, and everything adjust very smoothly, even while you have it on with baby in it. I read a few reviews saying that there baby sat way to low in the carrier, even in the newborn setting. I'm not sure why they had that problem because I certainly did not and I can't see how you possibly could have that problem with this carrier. My daughter sits perfectly in it (I am able to kiss her head, which is recommended) and she is very secure and comfortable. and there is no head wobbling or getting crunched up. My favorite part is definitely the fact that the front completely comes undone allowing you to take out a sleeping baby with extreme ease! No tugging on a stuck baby or getting one leg stuck in there. A carrier we had in the past my son would get stuck every time we tried to get him out, my husband would have to hold the bottom of the carrier while I pulled my son on out, so annoying. This carrier definitely doesn't have that problem. Everything about this carrier is functional! I really like the way it's designed to go on as well. it's So simple, you don't have to worry about trying to buckle anything behind your back, which to me is just crazy! The material is a very soft canvas material which I really like, and I haven't had a problem with me or my daughter overheating while she is in it and we live in a very warm climate & I am one that is usually always hot. My husband also really loves this carrier. He absolutely did not think it would be worth spending that much $ but once he used it (just once) he told me he was wrong and that it was definitely money well spent! And my hubby does not like spending money. Not sure if this info helps but I am 5'6&#34; and 165lbs and I have no problems with getting this carrier adjusted, it fits beautifully, it is just so perfect. And my husband is 5'10&#34; and 185 lbs and he says the same about how it fits. So hopefully this review helps those of you like me that read review after review trying to find the perfect product. I highly recommend!spent! And my hubby does not like spending money.

5.0	I love this crib. I don't understand the huge crib little baby thing so we got this crib and its perfect. My son has plenty of room to move around with out taking up a lot of space.
5.0	we love it but gave it away as a gift. would recommend to a friend. was a decent price too.
1.0	Only lasted 5 months!
5.0	So glad I tried this pillow.  I found immediate relief from my lower back pain.  One of the best pillows I have tried!
5.0	I ordered my first package of these a week or so ago and have already bought more! They are perfect REUSABLE cloth diaper liners. They are NOT doublers and do NOT add any more absorption, rather they allow urine to pass through them and wick away moisture from your baby's bum.  They also make cleaning up poo much easier and cut down on staining the actual insert or shell of the diaper.  I use these with my Best Bottom hemp inserts.  Hemp takes a little longer to absorb than micro terry and my baby's bum was suffering.  These liners give the hemp time to do their job while keeping the moisture away from my little one's sensitive skin.  I like that they are thin and do not add any bulk.  So far, they have stayed in place perfectly for us. Thank you Bummis for a perfect and inexpensive solution.
5.0	I bought the fitted waterproof crib mattress cover as a gift for a friend's daughter.  She thanked me and told me that this cover was great.  She said that the longer skirt was a definite plus and that it was easy to take off and put back on for laundering.  It made an excellent gift, thanks.
5.0	Easy for her to keep in mouth,  probably because they're so lightweight.  Tried almost all brands and these are her favorite!
5.0	easy to use! no smell works for both cloth and disposable.
1.0	my 18mo old thinks its a toy and drops it after 5 mins. Lint cat hair and other stuff gets stuck to it constantly. not worth the $ and unless your kid is interested, it's a lose lose item.
5.0	I like this high chair because it has wheels.  Also is dish washer safe.  Very durable material and easy to clean up!
5.0	I love this bouncer!  My six week old loves it too.  She enjoys the soft music, bubbles,vibration, and fish. She loves to nap and play with her bouncer.  I can get a lot of things done around the house, and actually watch a little TV.  It also helps with her colic, because of the vibration.
5.0	I bought this for my daughter as a replacement for a beach souvenier she lost.  I read a lot of reviews on mood rings before making this purchase - since I saw A LOT of bad review.  This ring was perfect.  First of all, it actually works.  It is small enough to be a ring for an adult (maybe pinky finger) or a ring for a child on a larger finger.  Shipped quickly and came in an adroable little box with a bow that made it erfect for a gift.  Would recommend.
5.0	fantastic..a bit too big for ny 2mo old but great none the less
5.0	These are way too much fun, my son loves them.
5.0	Perfect, highly recommend!
5.0	Great monitor! Very happy with my purchase!
5.0	We love this gate so much we ordered one for my inlaws. Nice quality. I love that you can walk through the door in the middle or fold the entire gate against the wall on either side. I highly recommend it. Note: it is not adjustable. If it is too wide then you have it bent out into the room. It's not a problem for us.
5.0	My son loves thoa,  good price.
5.0	As a dental hygienist I can highly recommend this brush. Great and fun product for little ones. Got it for my grandaughter!
5.0	I'm very pleaaed with my purchase. Perfect for my kids laundry. It doesn't loose its shape when not filled.
5.0	Perfect gender neutral bedding.
5.0	I could have thought of a better gift for my lil baby girl. This is a great product, and hard to lose. My daughter is only 2 months old but she manages to hold onto the horse. I would definetly recommendthis product to all who belive in giving their child a pacifier.
5.0	Works great with my carseat. Is very easy to get in and out of the car.
5.0	Bought this for my 2 year old daughter.  Fits her and her bed perfectly!
5.0	"I really like this car seat. My husband wanted us to get more \\""gender neutral\\"" prints for some of the more expensive items that we might save to use if we decide to have another baby. I really like this print. The car seat has the 'wings' that cover the seat belt up by their neck & newborn head positioner included which is a nice feature. I also really like the piece of belt that hangs down and allows you to easily adjust the tightness of the harness quickly. The material could be softer but the upside is that it is really easy to clean and it isn't scratchy or anything. I recently had to take everything apart to remove the cover to wash it (it is machine washable) and I will say it was a challenge getting everything back together but with the help of the manual we got it, just took me a while to get everything just right and next time it won't take as long now that I've done it before. I also like the convienience of having the base already in the car so you can just snap it in and go(we bought a 2nd one for my husband's car which we found on clearance at toys-r-us for $25). I also really like that it locks into place in her Graco LiteRider stroller and onto most shopping carts so I don't have to worry about it coming loose in the store. It's fairly light and will hold her until 32lbs so I expect it to last a while. Overall I higly reccomend this car seat in whatever pattern you choose.  Pros: Light weight, easy to spot clean and mahchine washable, convienient stap to quickly adjust harness tightness, snaps into base & shopping carts with ease  Cons: A little cumbersome to take apart & put back together, material could be a little softer"
1.0	The main hinged component was welded at an angle, so there is a gap between it and the adjoining component.  This means that the door does not latch at all, or close.  There is a one-inch gap at the latch!!!  I regret that I didn't check this gate as soon as I received it.  My mistake!!!  I would give this unit a negative star if I could!
5.0	These are so great! I have a few and my babe just loved them. They are the same binky used in the hospital.
1.0	do not order this scrapbook, i placed and order for this and never received it. instead i was sent some charm for a necklace that looked like it came out of a cracker jack box. i would recommend not buying from this company.
5.0	I really like them! Good material and has water resistant material on the back! It does it's job and to 9 month old is no longer chewing his crib up.
1.0	these break real easy.  they have a single point of stress on the plastic.  I'd never buy another.   Instead I recommend the mommyhook.  it's so much better for 2 reasons:  1. it's metal & doesn't break.  2.  it closes so it's not an open hook that things can fall off of  and (here's a third - just thought of it) - it's much bigger than these plastic things & bags don't fall off.
5.0	I got this as a baptismal gift. It is really pretty, quite soft and very well made. The parents really loved it
1.0	There is nothing positive about this baby bath tub.<br />- Its to slippery so my baby keeps sliding down under the water<br />- The &#34;hump&#34; that is suppose to help support babies in a seated position is too small ans slippery so again my baby slip's down under the water.<br />- The drain is located in such an award location that the tub does not drain all the way<br />- the top hook is to narrow to slid over a rail or shower curtain rod to dry<br /><br />This tub is such a hazard to babies it should be removed the market!
5.0	My son refused to take milk in sip cups. I tried tons of different type of transition bottles and finally this one works! I am so happy that my son starts to drink milk, NOT in the bottle!
5.0	We were searching for a nightlight that did not have to plug directly into an outlet.  The KinderGlo nightlight was the only one we could find.  The charging base has a long enough cord to reach behind furniture.  We got the owl nightlight.  It is adorable and my daughter loves it!  She likes that she can choose a different color light and it is helping her to SLEEP IN HER OWN ROOM! We recently took it camping with us. It stayed lit all night long without the charger and gave the tent a comforting glow. Also, I had a question about the timer function. I emailed the company email address on the instructions sheet and received a prompt, courteous reply.  I like this product so much, that I now have a second nightlight to give as a gift.
5.0	My wife and I had been searching for a few months for an item like this.  We found others that where much more expensive ($15+ for 5 pads!) but this one was right on the mark.  If you are looking for a way to keep your baby safe on those nasty changing tables when you are out and about, look no further!  These pads hold up when being used, and are small enough to fit easily into our diaper bag.
1.0	Bought the graco myride because i wanted to do extended rearfacing for my son.  We had the carseat for almost a year and the buckle broke.  My son had to be cut out of the carseat afte the buckle wouldnt release the straps.  I will not be purchasing another myride 65 anytime soon.  next time I'll go with Britax.
5.0	let her to write review would be better. I have no idea on this. but I used to be asked by her to take some ice out. not easy
5.0	Very cute and soft blanket. It has some padding to it so seems like it will be very snuggly for my infant daughter to use when she is a little older. The back of the giraffe is on the reverse of the blanket. Very pleased with this purchase.
5.0	"My boy loves this toy. I had no idea how much fun is for babies to have toys with rings or other hanging things on them. This pyramid is the ultimate \\""ring\\"" toy since the triangles are thick, have rubber spots on them and also make popping sound when rotated. At the bottom of the pyramid there is a mirror.    The toy is nicely made as all Lamaze toys... Highly recommended for the price...."
5.0	Still using and my daughter is 5!
5.0	Wow! We're very impressed with the clarity, sound and distance for this monitor. We also appreciate the adjustable sensitivity and audio. The microphone is an awesome added feature. Very portable~ The only bummer was that the &#34;kickstand&#34; broke when our preschooler played with it.
5.0	I bought from these 2 pack for the nights,seems working perfectly!
5.0	Very pleased with the fit.  No leaks yet.  Washes well. Fits with all inserts.  I really like the Buttons inserts.
5.0	These blankets are amazing!  They wash well, are amazingly soft and are a go-to for my son during naptime.  We still prefer the a+a Muslin Sleeping Bags for overnight, but he'll transition to these blankets for nighttime soon.  So cozy that Mommy sometimes cuddles up with one!
5.0	"We got these cards as a baby shower gift, and they are wonderful! They come in a nice box and are very high quality. My baby started paying attention to them very early - pretty much at the age when you think babies don't really look at things. He just loved looking at them, and later on would coo excitedly at his favourite ones. I also own a \\""Hello, Animals\\"" book, and it is nowhere near Wee Gallery by design sophistication and quality. For the hours of entertainment these cards provide, they are definitely worth the price. I got these as part of the baby shower gift for my friend as well, and will be keeping them in mind for future gift giving."
5.0	"To start, I must say that I was a little weary of buying this crib at first, because I could only find a total of TWO reviews on every website this crib was offered on (which was just babyage.com and amazon.com). However those 2 reviews rated it 5 stars, and now I know why! By the way... at the time I bought this, the price of this crib ($250) was the same on both babyage.com and amazon.com, both offering free shipping. I ultimately ordered it from babyage.com because they had a $10 discount I was able to use for signing up my email address with them. 10 bucks is 10 bucks! And they don't overload me w/ junk mail either :)<br /><br />We recently just put this crib together, and the directions were very easy to use. It even comes with an envelope to hold the directions and stays attached to the mattress springs. (You can easily take it off if you'd like.) All of the parts arrived undamaged and nicely packaged to keep from getting scratched. It ended up being very sturdy, with all pieces fitting together exactly right...holes with bolts matching up and all! The crib does take a standard sized crib mattress, making that easy enough to find.<br /><br />I am 5'2\\"" to 5'3\\"", and the height of this crib is perfect for me. I do not think you would have lean over too much either if you happen to be taller.<br /><br />A big plus with this crib is that, not only is it a convertible crib...it also includes all of the necessary parts & pieces to convert it later. Most \\""convertible cribs\\"" only convert if you make additional purchases for the rest of the parts (the conversion kit)...which tends to run about $100 extra I've heard. The price on this includes it all. There's only 2 pieces extra that aren't used for the crib, and we'll just store them until we're ready to convert it to a toddler bed.<br /><br />So if you're considering a convertible crib (which is probably made of pinewood, a softer wood - you'll have to check), and it doesn't come with the conversion kit (because most don't), add about $100 to that specific crib price if you plan on converting it later...AND you'd have to buy that conversion kit ASAP so that you know your model doesn't become outdated.<br /><br />Sooo...with the total price of this crib being $250, and deducting $100 (since it comes with the conversion kit), a net price of approx $150 for a HARDWOOD convertible crib is a hard deal to beat! Cuz you know those babies and toddlers don't take it easy on these cribs!... You want something durable! When I researched the poplar wood, it sounded as if it doesn't get dinged up as easily...especially in comparison to pinewood.<br /><br />We ordered black, and it is a true black color. The paint finish appears even with no complaints there. The drawer on the bottom slides in and out smoothly.<br /><br />I have yet to try it out with the baby, as I am still pregnant, so I will need to update this later."
1.0	I did purchase this item used gently which was why is was priced accordingly. Imagine my surprise when I opened it and had to super glue most of it together. Gently USED does not mean BROKEN.  Thank you.
5.0	I got this blanket as a gift for my second baby, and only wish I had had it for the first!  It is so hard to find the right size swaddle blanket, and this one is not only the perfect size, it feels like a silk cotton, and is an amazing tecture!.   Be sure to check this out....you won't be disapointed.   :)
5.0	These are so cool! They really dressed up our wall and ceiling!
5.0	These angle adjusters are simple foam mats that you shove under one end of the seat so it sits at a different angle. Think of them as boosters for your car's built in seating. In the many cars too short for the Radian's default rear-facing angle these are a lifesaver- using these pads, you can shoehorn 3 radians into a Toyota Corolla and still comfortably fit two adults in front. In some seat configurations,t hey can be put in place without removing the seat, which is very convenient.<br /><br />I can't help but suspect, however, that selling these adjusters is the reason the Radian has no innate angle adjustment. Call me paranoid I guess. No bad mark though, they do what they should.
5.0	Keeps our rambunctious 100+ lb Great Dane pup out of the kitchen (even though he could totally soldier right through it if he tried). It's perfect height for adults to use, yet my preschooler can still get in to fix his own snack or start his breakfast. It stays secure, even in our not-so-square doorway.
5.0	My grandson is 14 months old and I watch him a couple mornings a week. I wanted something that didn't take up floor space and was easy to clean. This fits the bill perfectly. I strap it to a dining room chair for him (after covering the chair with a towel!) and when he is done I take the booster seat off the chair, and put the whole thing it in the kitchen sink to wash it off. I like that there are very few nooks and crannies, and I can easily rinse it clean with just the sink sprayer. On days he's not here it folds up and can be tucked away on a shelf.<br /><br />He's a squirmy little guy and this holds him securely. It's not heavy duty, I'm not sure how long it would last if it were used multiple times a day, day in and day out, but as a portable light duty booster it's great.
5.0	I bought this for my son who is chewing on everything. I like the design, color combo was great because it goes with what I wear. It also went with the kind of jewelry I usually wear which is different artistic design jewelry.  My brother gave the biggest complement. &#34; that's a great necklace&#34; I responded &#34;it's a teething necklace&#34; . He said &#34;no way! It looks like your regular jewelry&#34; Thats why I'm ordering another...I can still wear it after my son finishes teething! That's great design. Beautiful and functional! Great job would love to see more!
5.0	My daughter loves this bib.  It is of adequate size to prevent food from getting onto her shoulders when she turns her head from side to side during a feeding.  She also really likes the teether.  I've had two of these for several months now, they are constantly in the washer and so far, have held up really well.  Only thing is, the packaging says nothing about BPA free plastic on the teether part.  However, when I purchased mine, the sight claimed they were BPA free.  I haven't let it bother me too much because she chews on most of her toys and only a few of them claim to be made of BPA free plastic.  Give these a try if your child has trouble hanging on to her teether.  This one is guaranteed never to hit the floor because its fastened to the bib itself.
5.0	My granddaughter loves her piggy..
5.0	We used this to replace a Graco Snugride that my 10 month old had outgrown.  It fits a lot better in the car and he fits much better (and much more happily,now that he's up at a better angle for him to look out of the window and see the world going by.
5.0	Great product. It fits my son's crib really well and keeps him from biting into the wood.  I would recommend this to others with babies that like to bite on their crib.
5.0	Like other people have said, the pink is nowhere near as bright as the pictures make it look.  Regardless, its still beautiful.  I actually got it off overstock for much cheaper.  Facebook friend overstock and you can get an additional  10% off.  The bumper goes on easy, the sheet fits perfect and the skirt is simple to put on.  The comforter is really thin and that would be my only complaint.
1.0	This item arrived quickly and was perfect for my teething 10 month old son - it seemed to work wonders!  Unfortunately, on the 7th day of wearing it, my son reached up, pulled lightly on it and it broke in his hand - and a bead fell off!  Not safe at all for a baby.
1.0	base tilts the more you tighten it using a three point seat belt!
5.0	Love these and gave a good rating, but wanted to comment that the 9 Oz are too big for my kids hands (2.5 and 4 years). They have a hard time squeezing everything out. I will be ordering the smaller ones and save these until they are older.
5.0	Great way to keep from losing the pacifier.
5.0	It is easy set up and useful
5.0	I love it and the shipping was right on time thanks alot for my product
5.0	Useful for newborn but not an ultimate save. I see no problem and reuse it many times after proper wash of course.
5.0	Fits perfectly and my little one loved the color
5.0	A teacher friend sent this to my son when he was born. We've kept it close to him since he came home from the hospital. Now that he's five months old, he can't keep his hands off of it. I don't know if his love for music has sprung from this toy, or if the toy just feeds it. It has been the perfect toy for &quot;tummy time&quot; and keeps him occupied for long stretches of time. I strongly recommend this toy to parents everywhere!
5.0	My son loves this little Gruffalo doll! It is well made and so accurate to the book with its features. It is small enough to carry around but not too tiny. Glad we got it for him!
1.0	I purchased the Baby Tenda table from attending a seminar sponsored by one of the distributor in the Bay Area.  The sale guy got his entire family to help him selling the products.  He claimed that his children grew up using the Baby Tenda products (they were there to testify as well).  We were convinced that the table would be very safe despite looking very ugly (our friends thought we hand made it).  Our friends and family thought we overpaid for the product, but we felt it would be worth it due to its strong safety claim.    As our baby girl used the table, we soon found out the claims were all myths:    * Claim/Myth #1 - With the wide table, baby will not throw toys or anything onto the ground since she cannot notice the ground.       Reality is that my daughter threw every single toy she can off the table and enjoyed doing so.  She loved hearing the sound of her toy falling off our floor (tile).  She even climbed out of her seat (with the seat belt fastened) to see where the object landed.    * Claim/Myth #2 - The wide table is sturdy and safe, especially with 4 legs.       Reality is that one of the leg broke when my daughter turned 1 (she used the table only since she was 3 month).  The height of the table can be adjusted with each leg.  One of the metal adjuster for the leg simply fell off on my table, causing that leg to shrink (we used the highest position).  Luckily, my daughter was not on the table when it broke off.  I don't want to imagine otherwise.    * Claim/Myth #3 - The seat belt and design of the table keeps the baby in one place.       Reality is that my daughter was able to climb out of the seat belt and stood up on the chair.  We tried tightening the belt as much as we could (without hurting her), but she was still able to wiggle out of the seat belt.  From my observation, babies don't have wide hip.  Thus, the belt simply cannot effectively held her down.  The baby can use the foot stand to stand up and wiggle herself out of the belt.    My daughter is very active and does not like sitting still.  We often only use the table to feed her or have her sit next to us at our dining table.  This was effective until the leg broke off.  I will contact Baby Tenda to see what they can do for me.  I'll update that later for everyone.  In the mean time, I'm using a booster seat (with belt) to have sit on our regular chair, and this works just fine.  I don't know how much this booster seat costs, but it's definitely under $100.    I don't know how this product can last for a long time for others.  For me it's certainly did not last long, and thus, I would not recommend anyone to spend so much money on this product.  I am sure you can find something else that is similarly effective at a more reasonable price.  I definitely would not purchase any more from Baby Tenda for our next child.
5.0	Fit well. Washed well. Worked well.
5.0	New & improved version! Best ever!
5.0	I love Ju Ju Be! Their products are fantastic! I purchased this bag because I am the mom of a 16 month old and a soon-to-be newborn. I currently use an Oioi diaper bag, which is also amazing but not quite big enough for my growing needs. After reading a ton of reviews I decided on this bag. However, when I received the bag I didn't realize just how big it actually is. It's HUGE. I still love the bag but I don't think I will be using it as an every day bag. It will be a great hospital and overnight bag. It has so many pockets and I absolutely love the big mommy pocket in front. Overall, definitely a 5 star diaper bag! The only thing I don't particularly like (and maybe it's just me) is the I think the changing pad is too big. I think the memory foam is completey unnecessary. I would rather have a changing pad that I can move to smaller diaper bag depending on what my needs for that day are. However, this pad is just so thick and it takes up too much room for a smaller bag.
5.0	Loved this chair. My daughter just turned 1 and sits in it all the time :)  She can easily get in and out of it. It has a soft coating that she likes to snuggle. Great for in the living room so she has her own chair like mommy and daddy. It's a little big for her right now. but can see her using it for years to come. Lot's of room to grow.
5.0	These are the only pacifiers my son will take. I love them. The nipple is shaped the same on both sides, so there really isn’t a “right side up” and “upside down” which is extremely convenient when a child is learning to put his own pacifier in. The prints are cute and the colors are bright.
5.0	This is a awesome safe desk, I recommend it for anyone with kids ages 3/5
1.0	My advocate melted... YES THAT'S RIGHT YOU HEARD ME... IT MELTED..... Customer service for britax has been unresponsive,,, RUNRUN RUN FAR AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT
5.0	these were a great price, however they sent me the wrong colors than what I ordered.
5.0	Great little brush for my mOmma bottles! Love it! Great price too! Wish it has a nipple brush with it, but still great!
5.0	Beautiful color, excellent quality! We love it!
5.0	I think this mobile is great.  We have not had any problems with it as mentioned by previous reviewers.  I don't think it eats through batteries and we use just normal ones.  The FP Aquarium uses more batteries than this.  And I never thought the motor noise was too loud.  When my son was little, we would use it to keep him entertained while I showered.  When he got too big for the mobile part, we took that off and left the music box.<br />Now, at 17 months, we use the music part to lull him to sleep at night.  He will even get up when it turns off (after about 20 minutes or so) to turn it back on.  Then he lays back down.  I think he really likes to control the music, which he wouldn't be able to do if we just had a CD player on for him.  He also likes to play the music when he wakes up in the morning before we come in to get him.<br />I'm not sure what I'm going to do when I have to take it away to give it to the new baby coming soon!  Maybe it uses less batteries now because the mobile part has been taken off, I'm not sure.  But, you will get years of use out of this mobile as opposed to just a few months with the more &quot;decorative&quot; mobiles.  Another model has a remote control.  I have never wished I had a remote for it.  Seems like a waste of money to me.
5.0	Purchased for my grandaughter, her mother loves the crib as it is lower to the floor, great for shorter moms and dads.  color beautiful. Arrived broken, but was promptly resent within a week.
1.0	I want to start by saying I absolutely love all the features that both TW501 and TW502 offer and they are great baby monitors with one MAJOR flaw... the CAMERA.  I am currently on my THIRD monitor (they have been replaced under warranty) because if you unplug the camera (to move to another room or take on a trip), it will not turn back on when it is plugged back in.    The customer service representative I talked to acknowledged they have had problems and offered me a downgrade to the TW301 which apparently has a different camera.  Then they offered me an upgrade to the TW502 which I took, but it has the same camera and has already failed after TWO WEEKS.  Each time the camera goes out I have had to send it back to the manufacturer at my own expense, then wait 1-3 weeks for a new one.  If you want to get it in 1 week you have to pay for a new one to ship right away and then get a credit when they receive your old one and test it.  They have had my old one for two weeks and still no credit.    I wish they would fix this camera problem because it would be a great product otherwise.  Unfortunately, this has not happened yet.  This is the only review I have written on any product I purchased for my 8 month old daughter, but I feel strongly that it is important to warn other consumers about this product and company. BUYER BEWARE!
5.0	mom and dad can enjoy this item<br />it moves without batteries...great!<br />lots of fun.  the kids really enjoy it the most
5.0	Evrything was good thanks
5.0	I've been looking around for cups with lids and these were good quality and cheap. I would buy these again.
5.0	We bought this mat to put in our playroom, and we love it! It's thick compared to other mats I've seen, very nice colors (we got the pink and brown one), baby doesn't slide trying to walk on it, and likes the texture! We've had it for a month now, and cleaning it seems to be easy so far.<br />My only suggested improvement: have corner sides, and let the thin edge pieces cover 2 squares (same length, just go from half a square to half of the other and cover the square edges). Baby's finding a new hobby in lifting the edge, and that separates the pieces...<br />We give it 5 stars!
5.0	he will only take this kindf. Thank you for carrying them
1.0	I am really unhappy with this product.the quality of this bottle cap is really cheap.not worth picking up for infants.really sad quality.i have done a mistake by ordering this product.this is the only product I regret ordering from amazon so far..
5.0	This is a very high quality costume. My son loved it and it has held up to many wearings. He has played fairly rough with it and it still looks brand new.
5.0	Works great! So after I bought it I found it at Walmart for $30 which of course after tax is more expensive but in case you want it right away you can get it there. Really the best thing I have found for New England dry winters for this price! I live in a dorm room  and had trouble sleeping because the air was so dry... after I got this the problem was solved. I only have it about half way up and it more than does it job so I would imagine it would work for a fairly large room.
5.0	Best bottle brush EVER!  Say goodbye to bottle brushes with sponges attached.  This brush features bristles and NO foam to collect bad bacteria. (Gross)  The handy little nipple brush is tucked away conveniently in the handle so this brush also travels well (we often travel with baby and need to take this with us to clean bottles on the road).  RUN to buy this brush!  Love it.
5.0	use this at bedtime and in the car seat.  my 6 month old son can take it out and is working on how to put it back in himself.
5.0	Great product that does what it says. My wife enjoys loves using it while going to bed. I highly recommend it to soon to be parents.
5.0	Really great purchase...my baby and I love this glider.  My mother even has one for her home now. It's perfect for breastfeeding or reading to your little one.
5.0	These are the only bottles that my 3.5 month old can use without making a mess with milk dripping all over her chin and clothing.  She seems to latch onto them perfectly, creating a great suction for her formula and pumped milk.  I have noticed a significant decrease in gas as a result.  My only qualm is that I ordered the white set, and it can be hard to make out the writing on the bottle in the middle of the night with just dim light.  I hate to turn on the lights and wake up beyond return.  I gave away all my doctor browns and avent bottles after trying these.
5.0	This is a wonderful product! I now use this bra each morning and evening when I'm pumping so that I can multi-task. (I'm actually using it as I write this review, which gives me two hands to type instead of one!) It makes things so much easier and saves time, which can be a lifesaver for any mom! Highly recommended to all you breastfeeding mothers who want to be able to use your pumping time most effectively. Comfortable & easily adjustable to fit a wide range of sizes.
5.0	Beautiful crib very classy
5.0	The product description is spot on.  The curve to the handle and metal parts an both utensils help our 21mo enjoy foods just like us!
5.0	I love these lights.  Work great, nice soft light and work perfectly.  Highly recommend
1.0	I bought this tub b/c of the price and the excellent reviews. I dont understand how everyone is giving it 5 stars. The newborn insert my baby outgrew before she was able to sit up unassisted so it has been difficult to hold her from going forward or from sliding down into the tub. I have to use an inch or less of water, i just leave the plug open that way if she slides down or goes too far forward then she won't go under water. It is frustrating and my back is sore every time from leaning over the bathtub, with her tub inside. Even when she fit in the insert there is no way to clean her private area because she is sitting down on them. I would have to hold her over one arm and pour water over the other. Now that the insert is taken out, i have to lean her back and put her legs all the way up to her chest to be able to clean her properly. That leaves her back uncomfortable. This tub will be better once she is bigger and cannot slide down into the tub or fall forward while sitting. For now I am going to look for a sling, like what i used when she was newborn.. only that sling broke and i'm waiting to get it replaced.
5.0	Ease of use: Check<br />Comfortable: Check<br />Not Scary: Check<br />Noisy? Nope<br /><br />This is truly the no nonsense potty for training, no distractions, comfortable for the child and get's the job done. Highly recommend this to anyone who is starting to potty train their child. Don't think it gets any better than that for a short review.
5.0	This was my sons first toy.  He loved the songs and the the lights.  We passed it down to his little brother who loved this as well.
5.0	I purchased this mattress sheet for my LA baby 3&#34; mattress and it fits perfectly. I love the soft feel and my baby is comfortable sleeping on this sheet. I am ready to purchase more sheets in various colors.
5.0	I've been using dr browns wide neck for about 2 months.  They work great! My baby is rarely gassy or spitty.  I had used the 4oz bottles prior to these and I will always recommend dr browns bottles.
5.0	I love these bottles! No leaks! Our daughter took this bottle right away and didn't have any issues. I had to get medical treatment done several months after giving birth and needed to pump and dump for 24 hour periods over the course of two months. I was nervous the she would have a difficult transition from breast to bottle and back to breast but these bottles are fantastic. Just make sure to remember to put the clean flow vent ring on the bottle for every feeding or the bottle will leak. The clean flow vent ring prevents the leaking and also makes sure that the baby does not suck in additional air. We love the breast pump adapter also! Great great bottle!
1.0	I must say, I thought this bathtub was great..........it looks good, but after my babies hit 3 months, they would slip down and their feet got cut up from kicking the blue edge.  Now my husband and I are shopping for a new tub, they realy should take this thing off the market.
5.0	Nice to have just plain chamomile tea- no added flavoring! Very calming; I enjoy a double strength cup of chamomile tea before bed. Very good quality and good value when purchased at subscribe and save price :-)
5.0	Say it ain't so! A classic cola that's made with real cane sugar and sold in a real glass bottle? Who could ever come up with such an insane idea?<br /><br />Double Cola is my preferred soft drink, particularly because of its bolder cola taste. The cola flavor is center stage while the sweetness takes a backseat. And, in my view, all beverages taste better from a real glass bottle. Thank you, Amazon, for making this product available.
5.0	if you like pickled things these are what your looking for i will be trying other brands to see how they stand up so far these are the best on amazon. 9 2 12
5.0	This is a great, truly scent-free natural hand soap,not too greasy, just a really clean feeling. Seventh Generation products are excellent!
5.0	Making sausage is fun for the whole family.<br /><br />Ok, so it is work and takes some practice but definately worth while if you figure it out.  These are hog casings packed in salt. Quality was fine (*no suprises in the casings*). I would order them again.
5.0	Good candy just what I wanted
5.0	Bigelow Teas - why don't you put this out on the grocery shelves anymore??  It is great tea and thank goodness for Amazon, or I couldn't have found it!!  So five stars to Amazon too!  There is a market for this tea year around, not just as a Christmas promotion.  Please consider re-introducing it in your everyday Bigelow fare,
5.0	Love this mocha, will buy this again.
5.0	quick service,love the taste of the popcorn feel like Im at the movies will be ordering some more real soon
5.0	These are delish.  I used to get these when I was a kid.  They are lite and airy not very dense or heavy.  They have a very subtle hazelnut flavor.
1.0	I was initially puzzled by the caustic responses to 2 negative reviews of this product (16 oz size) from Dr. Roller and J. Robinson, both of whom are obviously knowledgeable about their biochemistry/nutritional science, until I realized that the responses were Nestle plants.  As a practicing physician with a subspecialty in diet and nutrition, I would like to state that there is no safe level of trans-fats in any food. I think it's a shame when people attempt to post informative reviews and get flamed for their trouble. I, too went to some effort to ferret out the facts, before commenting--I called Nestle in an attempt to be fair and informed and asked them what the total amount of trans-fat is in either the 50 or 56-oz containers.  I was told by both a rep and a supervisor that the amount in a teaspoon was 0; they implied that the FDA required (not allowed) them to say that, and refused to answer my actual question...repeatedly.  I found them contemptuous--and contemptible.  Stated simply, this product is bad for you, unless you are one who conflates a cardiac event with a rock concert; I would suggest that a healthier alternative would be rice or almond milk, and I will avoid all Nestle products in the future.  I would suggest that you do the same so as not to reward their apparent lack of concern about selling a harmful product. Big Food, Big Pharma, Big Tobacco--an ethical race to the bottom.
5.0	Addicting!  I'm a repeat buyer.
5.0	We eat a lot of rice and I decided to try Nishiki Premium Rice, Medium Grain, 15-Pound Bag.  We also are preppers and we vacuumed sealed the rice in quart bags for emergency cooking situations.  This brand of rice taste wonderful, we followed the directions and it came out great.  I normally use minute rice and OMG never again, once you try this brand you will be a true believer in real rice!  I HAVE!
5.0	I have bought this twice and will continue to purchase!
5.0	Super good! I love these. They also shipped in super fast
5.0	"100% real deal - not Memphis or KC real though.  This is North Carolina real.<br /><br />Here's the deal, in NC we don't use a BBQ sauce like y'all do over in Memphis, KC, or Texas except on chicken, sometimes.  This is a finishing sauce - not a cooking sauce. We use it on pig, after the pig has been cooked. In fact, we're known to cook the shoulder with nothing but the meat and fat and then season it after it's pulled.  It's mighty fine right off the heat plain but some folks like a little tang and a little bite - that's what this is for.<br /><br />Another thing about this one - it's not that thick and gooey ketchup looking stuff you'd pour over some ribs or brisket - this is a thin vinegar base.  There's no sugar and fat in here to caramelize on your oven baked \\""BBQ Chicken\\"" - that's not what this is for at all.<br /><br />A huge hint might be the picture of a pig on the bottle.  Use it on pork!  Pulled pork.  Another hint is the color, it's not exactly \\""sweet and mild\\"" - it's sharp and hot.  Not hot sauce hot - you can add that too if you want.<br /><br />If you'd like something close to a Central/Piedmont/Lexington NC style pulled pork sauce you remember from that trip down I85/I95/I40 -- this be the goods.  If you'd like a basting sauce like the use over in Kansas, this ain't it.<br /><br />Did I mention, \\""finishing sauce\\"" -- not a cooking sauce.  And very-very authentic to restaurant fare in much of North Carolina.  Because that's what's on the table in much of North Carolina."
5.0	I absolutely love this tea. I'm trying to cut out caffeine (coffee mostly) but I still like to have something to drink besides water during my work day. This tea tasted delicious and seems to make me less hungry too. I drink 3 bags per day, and sometimes use 2 bags for a stronger brew.<br /><br />I recommend this to many of my friends and they have even gone on to try other Yogi detox teas!!
5.0	the  seeds  came as promised  but  I loved it  they were  cryovaced so they were also, sealed for freshness perfectly,  thus  giving them a longer life  span for freshness.  they also came in a timely manner , will order again
1.0	I love tea. All kinds of tea. Cheap tea. Bagged tea. Loose tea. Fancy tea to supermarket tea. I have a fancy pants tea maker (Breville automatic tea maker) but I honestly enjoy ALL KINDS of tea. This tea? Awful. And so disappointing. It starts off quite nice - a little fruity, nice green tea taste - but ends with such an awful bitterness that I can't get past it. I've tried steeping it cooler, less time, etc. Nope. It goes from bitter to disgustingly bitter but it's all just bitter.<br /><br />Green tea is not typically this bitter which makes me wonder if there is something off with the orange/lime/fruit pieces in it? I don't know. This is, hands down, the worst tea I've had in yearsssssss though.
5.0	Great tasting, especially toasted. Expiration date stamped on the package is about 10 months from the time I received it. Made in Germany, the country where pumpernickel bread originated.   No chemicals are listed on the ingredients label unlike the abomination pumpernickel bread sold in US bakeries which has half of the periodic table of elements on the ingredients list and is colored with caramel/molasses/cocoa, etc.   US-made imitation is total garbage compared with this real pumpernickel bread and cost more.  This bread is a rare example of the real thing which is better quality and costs less than the imitation.   I will gladly buy it again when my supply runs out.
5.0	When I last bought these, the Amazon price was $28.87.  The current price is $41.04.  Suggested retail on the actual Barbara's web site is $3.29 for one, $32.48 for a box of 12.  These are delicious but I can't see paying 25% more than retail to buy them here!<br /><br />Price was adjusted to be close to retail, so review was updated.<br /><br />These things really are good - sharp and tangy white cheddar!
1.0	I'll take Hershey chocolate bars over Milka.  It didn't have much of a chocolate flavor.  Reminds me of the off brands you find in the stores during holiday time.
5.0	My latest favorite thing...I do not like the soft bake cookies. These are rather elegant and placate a need for<br />a good chocolate fix. Thin crisp and crunchy.
5.0	Island Mango & Peach!  Yummy!  Love these little tea pyramids.  Perfect for those days when you are craving something fruity and refreshing.
5.0	Lots of product for the price. I really like all the flavors, but the sesame is my favorite.
5.0	Well, sometimes you just don't have time to make a whole new batch of rice in the rice maker. Other times, your rice got eaten by a hungry teen. This is great for those times.
5.0	Very, very good quality buckwheat! More than satisfied...
5.0	I love this Cornmeal masa. We bought a tortilla press and make weekly dinners with fresh corn tortillas and beans - a new family tradition that my whole family enjoys. This masa is so fresh and easy to use. We just add water and a little salt just the like the directions on the back say - the fresh tortillas are so delicious with a little cheese or avocado! The price here on Amazon is unbeatable.
5.0	This is the coffee my cuban parents used when making cuban espresso here in the US.  Its great to relive the taste of home.<br />I've always thought that the 'llave' (key) in the name is a reference to Cuba being the Key of the Caribbean (as seen on their coat of arms).  Just a little historical tidbit :)
5.0	I bought the Ostrim while looking for a lower fat alternative to a Slim Jim. This is one of the best beef sticks that I have tasted. It is not oily or greasy like a Slim Jim.  It is low calorie (80 per stick), low fat (1.5g and only 15 fat calories) and high protein (14g).  If you like beef sticks try this and you'll probably like it.  I've tried the Pepper and the Natural flavors. Both were good, but I liked the pepper just a little better. The pepper flavor is not overwhelming, just a little spice to it.
5.0	The best honey I have ever tried !
5.0	Ordered this and it came wrapped/packaged wonderfully to protect the bottle. Works great! I used it in a fruit dip recipe and it tasted great! I ordered this on amazon because I was unsure if I could find it in the local grocers baking aisle.
5.0	This smoke flavoring is my go-to for beef/salmon jerky. It tastes great and if you let it marinate for any length of time, you won't need much.
5.0	These are really yummy. If you are looking for a pick me up and something that is GF - these have a great PB/Chocolate flavor.
5.0	My mistake was using this tea like regular instant tea.  I put a teaspoonful in about 10 ounces of water and it was awful:  dark and bitter!  After I poured it out I looked at the label on the can.  I needed a magnifying glass to read it.  It says to use 1/4 tsp per 8 oz.  For me that's just the right amount.  If you like stronger tea increase the amount a little at a time.  This stuff is really concentrated.  I usually sweeten my tea with Splenda and this tea is sweetened already so I need to use less.  I think four jars will last a long time so I'm happy with this purchase.
5.0	I used to buy these as a kid when the convenience store near me had a big tub of them and they sold them individually and put them in a small paper sack.  I loved them then, and they are still just as good now!  So glad I found them on Amazon!  We have already gone through three of these boxes, because everyone in my family loves them and whenever someone visits they eat them too.  They are definately my favorite candy!
5.0	This is my favorite tea.  I love the spice flavor and the natural sweetness from the cloves.  Great winter drink.
5.0	I live in Hawaii where everything is expensive. Could not believe the price on these cashews, almost half of what I pay on Kauai. I was really happy when they arrived and found them to be whole, not pieces of really good quality cashews.
5.0	I sent this to my sister who lives in another state for her birthday so I did not see it.  She was extremely pleased with it.  She said the contents were delicious.
5.0	I got a bag of this as part of a gift and AM HOOKED! Delicious.. The flavor is pretty strong; I like to use 'regular' coffee and add a couple of scoops of this - more subtle flavor and a way to stretch your dollar.
5.0	Bought this for my Marines son, whose stationed in the Philippines.  He loves the Dill Pickle flavor!  He doesn't want to chew tobacco, so he does the seed instead.
5.0	Good quality and arrived on time
5.0	I went with a plant based protein due to the desire to use something other than whey. I mix this with my shake in the morning for a tasty breakfast and then again after my afternoon workout. I have not tried to mix it on its own so I cannot comment on that. This protein is a bit expensive, but considering the benefits its packs, it is an easy choice.
5.0	Need to watch for stale Chick-o-sticks.  These were fresh.  160 sounds like a lot but the taste so good they go fast.
5.0	This tea is sooooo flavorful!! I love it and everyone who I have ever served it to.... about 12 people all LOVED IT. I add 1 tsp of honey and it is good to go.. I definitely don't drink any tea other than this... thus why I bought a 6 pack hahaha
5.0	The bar is comparable to Medifast bars. If you want a variation or lower cost alternative, it is a good substitute.
5.0	Good stuff, though a bit expensive for the quantity you get.  Bitter, but I don't mind the taste.
5.0	i've tried most of the major pods out there (illy, lavazza, segafredo, lucaffe, danesi, etc.) and this one stood out as having the best flavor. after using locally available (at the grocery store) illy, which is well-packaged and lavazza most recently, espressione is much more densely packed. while producing good flavor and crema, i found lavazza pods to be inconsistently and often loosely packed. illy pods are packed very consistently and just right for my gaggia machine. so, the only (minor) complaint, if you can call it that, with the espressione pods are that they are packed too tight. very snug in the portafilter and, if you're not careful, can result in over-extraction. once you figure out how to get the right extraction out of your particular machine, you should be getting very good, strong coffee out of these pods. i was using two pods for each large iced latter with illy medium roast pods but i may be able to get a full-flavored latte with just one of these espressione pods.
5.0	Just what I expected!
5.0	I love Kemach cookies and feel they are better than their 'wheat' counterparts by far. I have really never been a fan of oatmeal cookies until I tried these all I can say is they are better than any I have ever made or eaten
5.0	After reading the 'yuk' reviews, I was concerned it would not be palatable.  I made a shake with the same ingredients I use with vanilla flavored whey protein: start with 1/2 C unsweetened original Living Harvest Hempmilk, 4 TBS Nutiva Organic Hemp Protein, 1 C frozen strawberries (or more as they will thicken the shake), 1/4 small avacado (for healthy fat MUFAs!) It blended up thick and creamy just like the whey protein, and tasted absolutely delicious (a healthy taste, anyway). Some complained about it being gritty, but I didn't notice it as being a negative factor.  It is not that gritty. I was very pleased and this is definately going to replace the whey protein with it, as I am trying to lose weight and thought maybe the dairy is not helping me in that direction.  I'll have to wait and see if it is more effective in weight loss than the whey.  As far as storage, I used three 1 qt mason jars, vacuum sealing two that I won't be using right away and refrigerating all three.  I do make a shake everyday for breakfast after my workouts and it keeps me satisfied for 3-4 hrs.  I will definately be buying this product again! Also, some reviewers complained about the packaging, mine arrived in perfect vacuumed sealed condition.
5.0	Arrived on time - love those chiles.  Wish I could get whole green chiles - and hot
5.0	great price and product!
1.0	Okay this is not about the product... more the return policy. I ordered the pack of 6 because I was making my own baby formula but my doctor wanted her switched back yada yada. Anyhow by the time it arrived baby was back on her Similac and now I am stuck with all this lactose powder, which, mind you, is sealed and still in the box. Not happy.
5.0	"My wife was almost repulsed at the initial thought of these was \\""YUK\\"".<br /><br />Now I can't buy enough to keep them in stock for her.<br /><br />Excellent creamy texture and mild, distinctive flavor - they even have most of the natural oils still in them (Not denatured).<br /><br />AND they are excellent MOOD FOOD:<br />High on nuts Treating all foods as cocktails of mind-altering drugs may take some getting used to, but the upside is that eating the right things may dispense with the need for drugs such as sleeping pills or anti-depressants. \\""A couple of handfuls of cashew nuts delivers the same dose of serotonin naturally as Prozac does artificially,\\"" says Andrew Saul, a New York-based natural medicine consultant and author of Doctor Yourself. [...] \\""It's simple chemistry.\\""<br />[...]"
5.0	The best pancake and waffle mix I have ever had.  Very easy to use and delicious.
5.0	I've had other cacao powders (more expensive) and I think this one is just as good and at a decent  price.
5.0	What can I say.  Love goldfish snacks, so this large size works well with me.  Tastes the same as the goldfish that come in the smaller size packages.  Got the whole grain version, hoping that maybe its a little bit healthier for me.  Who knows, as long as it taste great, it can't hurt.
5.0	Our package was received on time and the packaging was wonderful! The price was great too!! Will definitely be ordering again.  :)
5.0	Very satisfied with my order of Guatemala beans. Good range of fruity flavor that came out very well with a light roast. They were shipped quickly. Great quality at a low price!
5.0	I'm usually skeptical about these things, but I must say this stuff is amazing. I suffer from acid reflux and I've gone through all sorts of medication to try and fix it. I found this in a Wawa convenience store one day and was curious to try it after hearing various things about alkaline water. I noticed, within only 30 minutes of drinking it, that my symptoms diminished. Since then, I've made sure to always have a bottle with me. It has never failed me in getting rid of the upper pains in my stomach or the horrible burning sensation I would feel under my tongue and on the roof of my mouth. If you have various stomach issues, give it a shot. You won't be sorry, I haven't had to take any acid reflux medication since drinking this stuff.
5.0	This wholesome sweetener taste very good.  I love just about anything made with coconut and this is no exception.  It has a slight caramel consistentcy and subtle taste but not rich. I add it to my smoothie and pour over French toast. Yum.
5.0	came in a good timely manner for very costly, yes I know its the weight but a lot of money for 2 12 of pop
1.0	If could have given this no stars, I would have.  Don't get me wrong--the pie would probably have been awesome.  Who could tell?<br /><br />1. The box says &#34;Keep Frozen&#34;; it arrived warm and melted.<br />2. The description / order was for a &#34;chocolate truffle pie&#34;; what arrived was (apparently) a sampler box of 4 different varieties.<br />3. The order took 2-1/2 weeks to be processed, not the 3-5 days indicated in the confirmation.<br />4. Attempts to contact the seller were fruitless; neither of the phone numbers worked and the email was undeliverable, per Amazon.<br /><br />If anyone else offers this item, I would be interested, but never from this seller again!
5.0	good fruit exchange ..Where I live groceries are very expensive,..mostly fruit and vegetables (fresh).  Pineapple is about the only caned fruit I like.
1.0	This was the absolute worse pack of single -cup coffee I have tried.  If I could give less than 1 star, I would.  No matter how little water was used (the lowest on my coffee maker is 6 oz), the cup of coffee was weak & flavorless.  The darkest roast in the variety pack was barely palatable. I truly wish I could get my money back.<br /><br />The flavored k-cups were even worse.  I still have the maple sleigh, hazelnut, vanilla & some caramel mess.  They were watery, weak in flavor & had an after taste.
5.0	I drink one of these each time I exercise to rehydrate me.  I really enjoy it and it works great!
5.0	This is an excellent product - makes wonderful sandwiches and I also use it for a tuna casserole dish that my family really enjoys.  This is one of the very few Bumble Bee tuna products that wasn't in the recent recall problem.
5.0	Great flavor and the salt has a fine consistency.
5.0	Everyone in my family loves these, from my 1 year old to my 4 year old nephew to my I-can-spot-something-healthy-from-a-mile (and refuse to eat it) husband. Made a cold pasta salad for a birthday party and the noodles help up well with all the stirring and digging into them. I will definitely order more when I get down to the last bag. If only I had a bigger pantry... :)
5.0	Bye bye Keurig - Hello fresh roasted beans.  They say it is better for our health to grind them as we go.  This is tasty coffee and I like mine strong - 6 heaping tablespoons for 6 cups of clean bottled water.  The K-cups were bland and weak and waay too expensive.  Amazon has the beans for the best price and they came quick and sealed.  No complaints here.  You may find more people going back to beans and regular coffee.  I cannot imagine drinking instant coffee or another Keurig.  Plus I make my coffee at home in the morning.  What is going on at Starbucks that has their parking lots always filled?  Do people enjoy spending five buck for a Latte plus tip?
5.0	I usually buy whole flax seed and use a pestal and bowl to grind it myself as I need it.  I like this product because it helps with time and energy.  I use it in baking and in hot cereals and so far I am pretty happy with it.  It doesn't really have a taste to worry about and it does wonders for keeping you regular as well as other health benefits.
5.0	Great tasting.  Well packaged for reuse.  One of my favorites.
5.0	very good product... interesting flavor and so much better than those found in jars in the grocery store
1.0	Sorry but this is not Italian and its not spaghetti seasoning either. At best it can be added as a flavor enhancer before you add your herbs and spices. The price is fair and it wont hurt to have some on hand to  add a bit of flavor to a few dishes but dont buy it thinking it will do anything by itself
5.0	This candy was really delicious! If you love sour candy, you have to try this! ^_^ 5 stars for the taste and time
5.0	Hot this hot that.. inferno this inferno that...Never hot enough??? This will do the trick, I guarantee it.  I did Blazin challenge at Buffalo wild wings and that was like pepper to this stuff.
5.0	These noodles are delicious and if you're trying to lose weight or avoid the extra carbs in pasta, a great option!  It's hard to give up pasta completely.  I actually prefer these noodles knowing that they are such a good choice.
5.0	These are by far the best protein/nutrition bars on the market. I loved getting to try so many flavors and I will definitely buy these again. You will get addicted!
5.0	Loved this. I was a contractor in Afghanistan when I ordered this. All the goods came and were delicious. Wasnt enough though
5.0	I got my husband a box of bars, thinking he could control himself better. Not. This white chocolate is so supreme, it is impossible to resist.
5.0	Can't go wrong with Dunkin....number one coffee!
5.0	My wife uses this in all kinds of sauces where cream or half/half is normally required.  This works great, is dairy-free and organic.  Nothing against dairy, but it doesn't sit as well with me as this.<br /><br />I make ice cream with this using our Cuisinart ice cream maker.  2 cans of this, 2/3rds cup honey and flavoring (vanilla or mint), works great!
5.0	I was very impressed with the selection this sampler offered. 30 different K-Cups as opposed to others which give you multiples of the same ones. There were a few that I was already familiar with, but the majority were unknown including a couple of Green Mountain flavors I hadn't seen before. Highly recommend.
5.0	Very finely ground and delicious.  I enjoy this more than the almond flours that are less finely ground.  I would highly recommend this brand!
5.0	Excellent Seller.…Super Fast Fast Fast Shipping….Exactly As Advertised! 5 STARS!
5.0	DELICIOUS. My wife uses it in her peppermint frappachino things that she makes at home. And in Hot Cocoa (homemade as well). And she sometimes blends it into chocolate chip cookie dough.<br />Just delicious!
5.0	Great price and love this cereal.
5.0	Love this product! will buy it again. I bought it and it busted during shipment, so I let them know and they gave me a refund and apologized.
5.0	Can't go wrong with this syrup! And the price was good too
5.0	Sometimes Slap Your Mama is difficult to find. I had searched their website and looked in the local stores but did not find it. I ordered 3 canisters. I love to use it in chili and soup.
5.0	I LOVE THIS STUFF, JUST  PUT IT IN A BOTTLE & GO..IT HAS A GOOD FLAVOR..A BIG THANK YOU VERY MUCH!!~~
1.0	Even cut 50 percent with club soda still overly sweet and artificial tasting.  This seems to be a trend with stevia soda.  If they made it allot less sweet they would be much better off.
5.0	Best coffee ever! It keeps my hunger and weight in check-does not upset my IBS. Been using it for over 5 years.
5.0	"The written description of this tea was good enough to get me to put it on my wish list this xmas. My wife prefers the sweeter fruitier teas, such as Republic of Tea's Kiwi Pear, and I generally go for traditional blacks, Prince of Wales, Oolongs, etc. But this tea is perfect for both of us! I always liked good vanilla teas, and some coconut teas always blew me away as well. Our pals at Steep Tea still make some of the best teas in around, so we were pretty game to try this Lana's tea - it always feels good to try out teas by the 'small guys'.    Anyway, there was this unbelievably great aroma to this tea that we couldn't pin down until one of our pals pointed out \\""This smells like Bailey's!\\"" Bingo. Need I go on?"
5.0	I am so surprised how great this tasted coming from a box (and a pouch). This was in my food pantry for a few months and it became time to use it or lose it.  We love the flavor and the chicken came out very tender simmering in the sauce. We thought the sauce was a little scant for the portions, but I have a few ideas now on how to add a few simple things to increase the volume. I will be buying this again.
5.0	LOVE this stuff I alway reorder before I ooen my last container! Love that I can enjoy my favorite snacks with pb2 and not wreck my diet!
5.0	Just what I was looking for to complete my Simply Organic collection of spices.  You can count on the Quality and Freshness of all of their products.
5.0	Very small morsel but great explosion of taste. Tin container is cute but not convenient. A small prescription bottle is  more handy.
5.0	These cookies are delicious.  They're dark, not terribly sweet, and go down far too easily.  They taste just like an Oreo, but better.
5.0	According to my 12 year old son, these are delicious.  He has also tried the chocolate chip ones but likes these far more better.
5.0	I make natural herbal skin care products and this was my main use for purchasing, however, it is enough that I will also add it to my cooking.<br /><br />www.TeaHerbMilkSoaps.com
5.0	I'm not a fan of the &#34;make your mouth numb so you can't taste your food&#34; hot. My hubby loves spicy so I figured if Awesome Sauce was too hot, he would still love it. Turns out our whole family loves it! When they say &#34;real heat&#34; they don't necessarily mean &#34;real hot&#34;. They mean &#34;real spicy flavor&#34;. Sure you get the hot sensation, but what's really great is that the heat doesn't overpower the flavor of the rest of the sauce or your meal. You get something that really compliments your food, not something that masks the food with eye-watering, mouth searing heat that prevents you from enjoying the flavors in your dish. Awesome Sauce is Awesome!
5.0	There are Other comparable brands of 'dried' soups on the market,,,,but Nile brand is the BEST tasting and best value for the money...............
5.0	Great product!!!  Julia's ships immediately and provides a wonderful snack that is easy to prepare!!  Love them and would recommend them for everyone.  They are far lower in calories than the deep fried rinds and are carb-free too!!
1.0	I found this tea quite undesireable; the taste was not pleasant to the pallet.  It did not leave me with a satisfied taste.  It was not a pleasure to sit and have a cup of tea using this herbal tea.  It should come off the market.
5.0	I always watch for a great deal when buying my favorite brand of<br /><br />tea. Amazon did not disappoint. I will always get my tea thru them because it's more trustworthy than buying thru eBay.
5.0	Very addicting chips - this order is only for one bag though not 3 as originally advertised.
5.0	It is the only milk i've given my LO and i think it is amazing.
5.0	I tried the v8 vfusion orange pineapple drink for free thanks to V8 V-Fusion® +Energy. I was very excited to try this because it contains a whole serving of fruit and veggies without added sugar. Plus who doesn't need a pick me up! I was pretty happy with the flavor and texture of the drink, it wasn't overly sweet or too veggie tasting. I felt a little bit less sluggish after drinking it and would recommend it to anyone looking for a health energy boost option.
5.0	These are great to have as a K-cup brewer accessory. Just make sure they work with your model coffee maker before ordering.
5.0	Very yummy! These are especially good on a bagel with cream cheese. You won't be disappointed. Gotta try them. Oh yeah
5.0	I like the concentrated brown sugar flavor of Sweet 'n Low, much more flavor than the Sugar Twin Brown Sugar Substitute. For some reason this is almost impossible to find in stores, so getting it on-line is a great option.
5.0	Use it to make home made gummy bears amongst other things for my kids to help keep them healthy and their digestive systems working properly :-)
5.0	Hot as hell. Do NOT come in direct contact with it. Even a small spec on your tongue will numb your tongue for a week or two.
5.0	I love it,drink daily
5.0	Great product....speedy delivery...pleasant communication.  The container is nice enough to be used again.  My husband and my daughter both love this tea.
5.0	These are the best Peeps ever. I only wish you could get them year round.
5.0	This is the best size for the price. I can go through two of the small cans in a week. Decided to go for the large size. Def. worth the time and money. Delivered fast.
1.0	I used to really like the puffed millet from this company, but over the past several months the amount of hulls included in the bag has become intolerable.  I threw away several bags and will not be buying this brand again.  Millet hulls are no joke - they don't pass well and they wreak utter havoc on your teeth, getting wedged in your gums causing bleeding and swelling and take hours to get out.  I think I would rather chew on broken glass than millet hulls!  I suspect someone in their marketing department came up with the brilliant idea of increasing the fiber content while simultaneously reducing the processing time.  Brilliant!  Now for every bowl of cereal I get at least 2 or 3 tablespoons of hulls.  It's disgusting, and they've lost this customer for life!
1.0	I cannot comment on the taste of this product, as when I opened the bag, I smelled a very strong odor, similar to formaldehyde. It was terrible. Thought it was just the plastic and opened the husks, which smelled equally bad. Not sure if others have had this problem, but I couldn't imagine what was in this kit and didn't want to feed this to my  family after how horrible it smelled. Threw it all out. I bought this from my grocery store, not amazon, but it was well within the expiration date.
5.0	Yes they do take a long time to be delivered sometimes but who cares! Once they arrive you can eat as much as you want for about 40 calories and they completely replace pasta. BUY them if you count calories at all!
5.0	Who'd have thought a powder mix would deliver such a tasty whiskey sour. Soooo much better that bottled mixers. Just the right amount of sweet and sour, tart enough yet a wonderful complement to a good bourbon whiskey. I use a little less water that instructed per package (I prefer my flavor to be a bit more potent) and once the cocktail is mixed I add a few dashes of Angostura Bitters along with a fruity garnish. Yummy!  [[ASIN:B000HQMLX6 Bar-Tender's Instant Whiskey Sour Mix, 8-Count 4.7-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)]]
5.0	I love that this product is pure, no fillers, and not from China!  I have been using Stevia for about a year now, since I gave up refined sugar.  My husband thinks he prefers regular sugar in his coffee and tea, but I recently used this Stevia Powder in our batch of iced tea, and he could not tell the difference, and loved the tea! So now he is a Stevia convert.  I prefer this concentrated powder product, because a little goes a long way, and you get the sweetness you desire without the calories, without an after taste, and without a spike in your glycemic index!  Love it!
5.0	I ate the whole bag in 2 weeks.  I did share about 1/2 lb with my dad though.  So good!
5.0	This is one of the best seasonings I have ever used. Soups, Mexican meals, beans. It is a must have!
5.0	I competed my first Ironman 140.6 wearing this adorable tri top.  I was comfortable every step of the way! Would order again!
5.0	"I enjoy healthy snacks; Larabars, Kind products, and such, I consume them all. While browsing, I stumbled upon this and I ordered it thinking, \\""well, I will give it a try.\\"" I was thoroughly pleased. Now, before I go too overboard with praise, after trying the product, I do wish that it was a little bit more clustered together, but other than that, it's great. I highly recommend this product; it is very filling, similar to eating trail mix, but with a different texture. Order some!"
5.0	good taste and easy to use
5.0	Not much to say about beef jerky. The product was not expired or anything, arrived on time, and tastes great.
5.0	Good service - Good coffee
5.0	OMG I love this thyme! It made a turkey breast so delicious. Normally my family does not all like to eat the same meal for dinner. And nothing is too special about plain old turkey for dinner. But we spiced it with the thyme leaves and I can't believe how delicious it made the turkey. This is a great spice to have in your pantry for everyday cooking!
5.0	I'm giving this a 5-star rating, but have only had the product for 1 week's use so far. But knowing the benefits of non-GMO gelatin and collagen, and having read about your product before buying it (can't recall the site I saw it on...sorry), I would have to say it's likely a 5-star product.  I'm enjoying taking both products in organic pink grapefruit juice twice a day.
5.0	I ordered this coffee after falling in love with another coffee called &#34;Fog Chaser&#34; from San Francisco Bay.  This bean doesn't disappoint.  It is a VERY dark roast; there was even oil drops on the inside of the bag when I received it.  The coffee has an earthy flavor that is balanced without too much bitterness.  If you love bold, dark-roast coffee then you should definitely try this one.
5.0	best chocolate, ever!  Not too sweet, and no hard chocolate outer shell  - love it
5.0	Not your everyday candy. Dark chocolate, creamy liquid filling, assorted flavors, makes a great special treat.
5.0	It was a gift but I was told it was wonderful and totally appreciated... Obviously if I'm looking for a good candy, I will send again!
5.0	These trees kinda taste like peanut butter and chocolate, they also taste like the Reese peanut butter cups. Really good.
5.0	I'd say I'll buy this again for sure, but I don't know that I'll ever manage to get through the entire box. Wow!
1.0	I purchased this &#34;new and improved now with no saturated fat&#34; smartpop (butter) popcorn at the local supermarket. I am not one to write bad reviews but feel it is important to warn people of how horrible this stuff is. My wife and I both had the same negative experience.<br /><br />This popcorn leaves some sort of residue on your teeth that feels slick and tastes acrid/chemical like. The residue doesn't come off easily.<br /><br />We have had many a bag of microwave popcorn in our days and have to say this is the worst.<br /><br />Avoid this new and improved product at all costs.<br /><br />We bought a 6 bag box and are trashing the remaining 5 bags. I doubt the store will take an open box back. I do hope they stop stocking this product.
5.0	Excellent substitute for other salt filled bouillon. great for a vegetarian diet or someone that wants great taste without the other stuff.
5.0	I am hooked on PB2!  It has great flavor and I love that it is all natural.  I mix it with my Shakeology protein shakes, have used it in my homemade protein bar recipe, and really enjoy it plain on toast as well.  Great healthy substitute for peanut butter lovers!
5.0	"I first bought this cake at a grocery store.  It was on clearance, so I figured \\""what the heck\\"".  I baked it a few days later, and oh my gosh, it was delicious!  I raced to the store to see if the product was still available but they were gone, and not stocked on the shelf.      I was sooooo glad when I found out Amazon stocked this cake mix.  Not only is the carrot cake to die for, but the apple cake is wonderful (and my personal favorite), as well.  I now stock this cake in my pantry, and am giving the cake mix as gifts for hostesses, and friends for Christmas.      Love it and thanks Amazon for stocking it at such a great price!"
5.0	I must admit yes this taste like gas station or convenience store sugary cappuccino but I love it. For around 80 calories and $0.40 a cup this can't be beat. I love it. It's hard to throw one in my keurig and drink just one or two a day. When the winter comes I will rejoice and LOVE having a hot cup of this stuff... that is if they last until then ;)... lol
5.0	I love bubble gum (oh, I'm over 40 and I still like my candy).  These black cherry blow-pops are DE-LISH - wow.  Try them today =)
5.0	Pete's 2014 Holiday Blend is so good it is now my benchmark for other k-cups! Smooth and rich.  I have a Bunn My Cafe, which pulses the brew and makes a stronger cup than a Keurig, I think, but not sure how much of a difference. I take milk in my coffee, so need a coffee that can handle milk w/o weakening. This coffee holds its own.  Comparable to Green Mountain Dark Magic, but a bit richer with superior taste imo.<br /><br />I also really like Pete's Cafe Domingo when I want to mix things up. A medium roast, but definitely full-flavored and satisfying (and good with milk).  Have used Major Dickenson's Blend in ground coffee, but not the K-cups.<br /><br />Hope next yrs holiday blend is as good!  Bought mine at Costco online
5.0	I wanted a decaf coffee and a very bold flavored coffee. This Dark Magic had both. I will continue to order this.
5.0	I live in honey country (northern california).  I guess lots of us do and I try lots of local honey.  They are great but nothing quite matches really raw honey.  It's got stuff in it that's kind of cool and it's flavor is just superb.  I feel bad importing my honey when so many people have bees producing fantastic stuff  but it just doesn't measure up to Really Raw!
1.0	I had bought this chocolate before and loved it.  High quality chocolate with just the right amount of salt.  I ordered it again as a treat--it is expensive but I have had a rough couple of months.  This time the chocolate is waxy and has white blotches that make me think it is old, or has been exposed to fluctuations in temperature.  I was really disappointed.  I don't know if you can return food to Amazon. If not I will probably just bake with it.
5.0	Tastes great and great price for tons of coffee.
5.0	Love this coffee so much
5.0	As a Hypoglycemic I love to have this rice on hand.  My family can eat the white rice with the Chinese food and I have my yummy multigrain rice.  In fact I have had some problems with family members wanting to eat my rice instead.  For convience it cannot be beat.
5.0	I applaud your ingenuity and love your coffee. I am a regular customer from here on out.
5.0	I have tried so many coffee. I love coffee.and this coffee is the best yet is. Very linght in texture and all the flavor are very good too.I will not buy anyother coffee.
5.0	I remember these from childhood. They taste just the same, and who can argue with heat and serve? I need to come up with a spanish rice recipe to serve with.
5.0	"If you're looking for a really strong coffee flavor... not so much. The coffee flavor is recognizable, but considerably less than a cup of coffee. The sweetness is perfect. It takes the 'can-be-kinda-like-chewing-palm-tree-bark-flavor' edge off the Coconut Water without making me feel like I need to run for my toothbrush immediately after drinking. This one is already on auto-ship so that I have at least one-per-day. I bought some of these for my Nephew as well because he is a very active 20-something who really needs to maintain his electrolyte balance (been hospitalized twice ... serious business) and Coconut Water does the trick naturally ... not like those chemical-laden 'sports' drinks. And he's a coffee drinker so he didn't crinkle his nose up at something 'healthy'<br /><br />Notes for ultra-health-nuts:<br />1. This is not NOT an organic product<br />2. It is sweetened with evaporated cane juice (OK not so bad, but it's not organic)<br />3. This product has milk in it (not organic and not labeled as non-rBGH)<br />4. The final ingredient on the list is \\""natural flavors\\"" hmmm ... that can actually (legally) mean MSG! I'm not really sure exactly what they're hiding in the \\""natural flavors\\"" label and this would be the only reason I'd cancel my auto-ship ... the minute I get wind of MSG, I'm out.<br /><br />UPDATE Nov 4, 2012 - For anyone who's wondering about the mystery \\""Natural Flavors\\"" ingredient ... I wrote an email to the \\""Contact\\"" address that I found on the website for CocoCafe. I got a reply from Brian McCaslin (email signature block says he's the Director of Sales at CocoCafe). I asked \\""Can you please tell me if your product has MSG in it?\\"" His response was \\""No msg natural flavor is a mocha\\""<br /><br />Mystery Solved."
5.0	Add some carrots, onions and diced chicken and you will have homemade flavor.<br />I have been using this soup for years in my cafe.  Inexpensive, but really good.
5.0	GOOD PRODUCT WORKS GREAT
5.0	This tea is exactly what I was looking for in a tea mix: it's tasty, authentic masala-style Indian chai with real sugar and no artificial aftertaste. It's not as good as real, creamy masala chai, but on-the-go and on a budget, it's perfect. I skip the Starbucks at my university and instead drink this in a thermos with hot water. It's easy to make.<br />The only con here is the exorbitant price this seller is charging; it's available for $5.75 in my local Indian grocery store. Of course, that's all the way back home, so I generally bring a few boxes whenever I return to university from home. Definitely worth $6.00, but this price is ridiculous.
5.0	Compare these to the best you have ever had, and at a very reasonable cost. These are smoked, reasonably tender (as far as octopus goes), and taste delicious. I was reluctant to try these, especially when first offered on Amazon, because there was a 10-Can minimum. Well... I can tell you, we ate them up so fast that 10 cans wasn't that many after all. These are great!
5.0	My blood sugars don't react like regular pasta. Taste just the same and the rotini worksa for every recipe. yummmmmmm
5.0	I am lactose intolerant and purchased this to go in a chai tea recipe.  The taste is good and I am able to enjoy the tea without having to worry.
5.0	This is the real deal.I am so sick of so called truffle oils with &#34;truffle essence&#34;.What the heck is that?
5.0	They are not loaded with salt and have a very good flavor.  Probably will be buying another case soon.
5.0	Tasty if not a little too pricey
5.0	love it - not quite like heated cider -but close enough - I was getting tired of tea-has some calories - but very satisfying
5.0	My son is allergic to wheat and oats, but can eat potatoes.  We found these online and they are fantastic!!!  They are delicious, and they deliver in no time at all!  These have quickly become a staple in our house!
5.0	The problem with snacks this delicious is that I will try to eat the whole bag!  It is very crunchy, and the flavors of the ingredients go together nicely.  It's not too sweet, but it tastes like dessert to me.  We took this camping, and it was a big hit.
5.0	Excellent coffee! Better than what we get in Greece...
5.0	This bar is not only nutritious but also delicious.  The added bonus is that it's gluten-free, for those that require that.  The only drawback for me is that it's too sweet and affects my low blood sugar problem, but if you can tolerate sweetness, it's better than most bars.
5.0	Smooth!!  Better than green mtn pumpkin...very surprised!
1.0	I carefully followed the instructions on this kit, and it produced absolutely no mushrooms.  Not one.  I never even seen one attempt to sprout.  I tried both sides, and neither side had any activity or mushrooms.  Very disappointing.
5.0	We love this stuff.... Pancakes, crepes, cobblers... bake most anything with it... but mostly we use it for pancakes. In fact, we say... &#34;Wanna have bacon, eggs and Pamela's?&#34;  We don't even say pancakes any more.... the reason it's so good is the almond flour. It's designed for gluten free people, but anyone who has it a few times... especially with buttermilk instead of water... will not want any other pancake mix. It's sooooooo good! I think we'll have some in the morning. How about you? Pamela's anyone? Yes. That's my recommendation. Bon Appetit!
5.0	.•:*PERFECT*:•.10 STARS*.•:*DREAM SELLER*:•.100%RECOMMENDED!:•.THANK YOU*:•.<br />FAST SHIPPING! EXCELLENT SELLER!
5.0	I love a cup of bold black tea to start off my day.  Twinings English Breakfast K-cups fit that bill perfectly.  They are stronger than traditional tea bags and have a nice bold flavor.
5.0	On a whim, I bought a box for my husband.  Now, these are the only seeds he'll eat.  Wish they were sold locally, so my pantry doesn't look like a bird feeder!
5.0	Awesome way to kick start any morning
5.0	We have ordered these grains twice.  They arrive as described, alive and thriving, and make excellent kefir.
5.0	Awesome taste, we are a fog chasing loving family. The flavor is perfect for k-cups, strong enough and delicious. Many other k-cups brew too weak. The price is also awesome compared to other brands.
5.0	I really like this powder, & so do my kids! To clarify, we've had the berry flavor (figured it was sweeter than chocolate). I've made milkshake with milk, banana, any berries (optional), almonds, cinnamon, nutmeg and 1 scoop of the berry powder for my girls. They like it a lot but you have to drink it right away.<br /><br />Another huge hit in my house is a smoothie: coconut water, pineapple, banana, a bunch spinach, any sweet frozen fruits (mango, strawberries), almonds, Amazing Gras berry powder, a little spirulina. My 6 & 3 yr old LOVE it along with us.
5.0	This tea reminds me of Wagner's Spiced Apple Tea, which I LOVED and used to drink a lot of, but I haven't been able to find it for years now.  Carrington's is just as good and at a much better price!
5.0	I know, I know, it's processed food. But if you must eat (or in my case, give a practical finger food to a toddler) dry cereal, this is one of the best.  This has THE lowest amount of sugar at 1g per 1/2 cup.  My son loves it until he was introduced to other crackers; he still eats it but would ask for the other stuff now.  The only down side is that it's not fortified so the iron is low, again, matters more if you're feeding a child.
5.0	I buys this as a gift all the time and everyone always loves it. Great price, great treat! I would definitely recommend this.
5.0	Matouk's is on another level - deep heat that sets in rather quickly, but does not overpower the taste of the peppers.  So good.
5.0	Low-calorie and delicious! It's not for people who do not like pepper. My sister tried it and did not like it at all. But it hits the spot with me.
5.0	I am amazed at the great customer service I have received.  I  will continue and recommend to all! The tea covers the health benefits I am looking for.
1.0	This is a great concept however only about 15 cups worked in the Keurig 2.0, and the ones that work tasted stale.
5.0	It came about half an hour ago and when<br />I saw it I started screaming! I was<br />So exited! I ran inside and imediately cut it open, the packaging was nice and i felt so mature seeing my very on name on something that I ordered with my own money and it was officially mine, I wanted to share with my brother but he didn't want to take any of my candy:)<br />I was most exited about the blue raspberry but I took the cherry out first because it was just so pretty. I tried a little bit and it was like love at first lick! It was so good! It was slightly warm but nothin melted together!!!! Also it's like 90 degrees out but I put one of each flavor in the freezer and I put the box with the rest in the fridge! I'm so exited to eat them!!! It's my first order on amazon and I'm sooo happy!! This product is a must buy!!
5.0	This is an amazing product and the company handled it very well as it came on time. The  price is quite reasonable for the U.S and my friends and I thoroughly enjoyed it.
5.0	I am so thrilled I found these on Amazon. I grew up in Vermont, and Grandma Brown's were the base we used to make Boston Baked Beans...so delicious When I moved to GA 15 years ago, I couldn't find them anywhere in the South which was disappointing. Now with Amazon, I have a piece of home. I bake them with minced onion, mustard powder, bacon, brown sugar, molasses and pure VT Mapke syrup until thick and gooey. Yummy!
5.0	I have had many flavors of the Kureg coffee but this one I have not gotten tired of yet. It's great. I can have french toast without the calories.
1.0	this is a rip off.  One package of rice for 14.95.
5.0	This is delicious.  Before trying this product, I would never have imagined using the words delicious and green tea in the same sentence.  Formerly, I bought this by the glass at a local coffee shop. They discontinued smoothies. An employee took pity on me and told me what they bought to make the drink.  This is it. Yummy!
5.0	This is the best honey I have ever tasted! And it's about the same price as the honey at the grocery store but it's much better quality! It's made in the U.S. And it's organic, I highly recommend this :)
5.0	All reports were favorable. I was thanked many times for the gift.
5.0	I was first turned onto this tea on a caribbean cruise. I tried it and haven't looked back! It is delicious. I enjoy it hot and for iced tea. Both are very nice.
5.0	I used to be a fan of original brewed Starbucks, then got used to Pikes.  I developed a preference for Casi Cielo / French Pressed at home.  When Via came on the market, I was excited because I love Starbucks, but it's such a hassle to fit in the time to find an outlet/get there/ stand in line, etc when traveling.  And then came Via Columbia.  I have been transported to a heavenly world of flavor, instant availability even when traveling and a reasonable price besides!  Thank you, Starbucks, for this amazing and delightful coffee....far and away the most incredibly delicious thing I put in my mouth each day!
5.0	I could eat my weight in freeze dried ice cream! Seriously.
1.0	I thought I was buying a tenderizer/marinade with papain in it but this product contains NO papain - big disappointment!!!
5.0	I LOVED this cherry cola syrup.  Cherry Coke is my favorite and I was tickled to death to find it.  I think it tastes like a soda fountain cherry coke.  This was sure a winner with me!  Amazon is out of stock but I am willing to drive way out of my way to Bed, Bath and Beyond to go get another one because I liked it so much!
5.0	I enjoy sprinkling them over other things and they keep me regular.  Love them in milk shakes and over soup
5.0	In California, I can buy bottled Nanami in many Asian supermarket. However, because I use them on fish, meat, ramen, soups, and many other things, the half oz bottles can get really expensive and inconvenient when needed in bulk. I see Nanami sold in bulk in the markets in Japan. However in California, there's no place that sell this in bulk. But guess what, I found it on Amazon.<br /><br />This is the same popular brand I find in local supermarket, but much better priced. I refill the small half oz bottle with the bag, and also use them from the bag when I need to use a lot.<br /><br />Reading some other views online, I just want to add a little more information about Nanami here. Many translate Nanami as &#34;7 pepper spice mix&#34;. While the actual Nanami or Togarashi sometimes only consists of one or two dried peppers. Some flavor uses chilli pepper and asian hot pepper. Some others use chilli pepper and chinese peppercorns (which is not a Capsicum). But all the Nanami are more spicy flavorful, then hot. This is not a very hot pepper spice like one expects from Indian, Thai, or Spanish cuisines. The ingredients listed on S&B Nanami are:<br /><br />chili pepper, orange peel, sesame seeds, Japanese pepper, ginger and seaweed<br /><br />I like Nanami on many Japanes cuisines. It's very flavorful, and not too spicy.
5.0	I really like this coffee. It doesn't taste molasses-y which I hate. I've had trouble with the packaging on almost every Black Tiger I have received, but no problem thus far on this one.
5.0	I love these cookies. They are the best. I eat one bag right after another. I wish you could get just one big bag instead of little ones.
5.0	This is our favorite fajita marinade, and we've tried a bunch. Good on beef, chicken, and pork. Smokey with a bit of heat and good flavor. Marinate for as little as 30 minutes or as long as several hours. We've used this not just for fajitas, but just as a nice grilling marinade as well. Glad to find it on Amazon when I couldn't find it at the grocery store anymore!
5.0	I love the taste.  It arrived quickly.  I will probably be reordering again soon so that I have it on hand.
5.0	...this is hands down the most delicious hot sauce I've ever tasted.  Spicy yet very flavorful.  The lime gives it an extra kick you don't find in most hot sauces.
5.0	Taste soooo good my hubby and I really love this candy. will buy it again:)
5.0	I soak them in milk and I toss them in the blender to make smoothies. :) Yum.
5.0	have always trusted  campbell  products  and was very  happy  with this order  have used  two cans  so far  one as a bowl of soup  i did ad some cooked small pasta  to it  i  like it that way  will buy again
5.0	Delicious!!! Great value!!!
1.0	"Timothy's Rainforest Espresso is great-tasting coffee; I only wish I could get a full cup.  When I press the start button the flow of water/coffee starts out great, but after a few seconds it drops off to a mere trickle and never (I mean never) fills the cup.  We don't have that type of problem with other K-Cups so I know it's not the coffee-maker.  Thus, I won't be purchasing this brand of coffee anymore.     Despite what others have said about buying in bulk, trying to \\""trick\\"" the coffee-maker, etc.; I didn't buy a coffee product to play games with."
5.0	Fantastic service, super quality,great price. I looked all over town for sugar bees and they all looked too much like a cartoon. The bees I received are beautiful. I used them on a beehive cake and everyone was very impressed.
5.0	Although I wouldn't rate this candy as a gourmet treat, it's better than the bulk candy available at my local market and the price (~$15 per 5LB) is phenomenal.  Most of the items are labelled Brach's and the candy must've been stored well, because the wrappers are not sticky at all.  This will fill an awful lot of candy dishes, and I'm happy w/ my purchase.
5.0	Back in Europe it was the only coffee I was drinking. Here in US I prefer to get green coffee beans and roast them by myself. But, I ordered couple of this and tried them. Same taste, same great quality as it was in Europe. It is a little bit pricier here, because it is imported, I believe.  But, if you want to enjoy a really good product, you definitely have to try this one.<br /><br />Here is a secret of how to get all taste and aroma from this coffee. Do not use any coffee machine, try french press instead. Also, try to use Turkish pot, but, best of all - simply put couple teaspoon of this coffee into your cup and pour near boiling water. Let it  stand for five minutes and enjoy :) Also, don't put any sweeteners or milk, try to use condensed milk.<br /><br />Good luck!
1.0	I received sweet potato starch instead.  I guess I'll just use this for something else I guess. It's to inexpensive to return and not worth the trouble either.  I don't know if this was a honest mistake or I was just sent this sweet potato starch because the tapioca starch was out of stock.  Regardless, the item was delivered on time and in good condition.  It just sucks that I didn't receive what I ordered.
1.0	The taste was not ggod - it was a different somewhat salty taste with an aftertaste as bad- I only drank 1 bottle and donated the rest.Not for me!
5.0	Great product at a great price.
5.0	REALLY TASTY ON SALADS AND OATMEAL.
5.0	The item arrived on time as promised. And my husband loved, loved the candy!  Thank you!
5.0	if you like candy, and have 12 bucks, buy this.
5.0	I love, love , love this coffee!!  I but it every year at Christmas for presents and everyone loves it!
5.0	My favorite oatmeal. I used to buy oatmeal in the canister from the grocery store but now I don't enjoy going back. Nice substantial oats for making my morning hot or cold oatmeal.
5.0	OUTSTANDING MEDIUM BLEND COFFEE. I BOUGHT THIS FOR MY WIFE WHO NEEDS A DECAF COFFEE. I NEVER WAS A FAN OF DECAF BUT THIS IS SO GOOD AND I COULDN'T TELL IT WAS DECAF. I FIND MYSELF DRINKING THIS IN THE EVENING USING THE DECAF AS A REASON BUT THE TRUTH IS I LOVE THE TASTE!!!!
5.0	I've been drinking this tea for a week now and I just love it. I'm drinking this tea to help strengthen my uterine muscles in hopes I bounce back easier this time around from a c-section. I wouldn't listen to the bad review...after some research rasberry leaf tea is known to be helpful very beneficial throughout pregnancy. I would recommend this product!
1.0	The Eight O'clock Columbian Supremo I received was stale and tasted horrible.  No telling how long it had been sitting in a warehouse waiting for someone to want a 5-pound bag.  Amazon did give me credit for it and it was tossed.  I'd buy the bulk quantities with caution.
5.0	"Whether using almond milk, cow's milk, cream, even a dash of keifer, this tea is amazing on a cold night (or any time of the day when the weather is chilled).  By itself of with the addition of a \\""milk\\"" product, this tea really feels like you are enjoying pumpkin pie.  Its incredible. I plan on stocking up on this item as it is a limited edition."
5.0	Absolutely the very best teriyaki sauce I have ever had the pleasure of tasting and using. It has performed great as a marinade for beef jerky. Chinese stir-fry dishes are awsome. Thanks for an outstanding product.
5.0	nice and fresh makes thick yogurt I have used it for 10 years.  tastes very good don' have to buy greek yogurt or strain this
5.0	This is what i was looking for. A tasty healthy snack at affordable price
5.0	Ordered these for my honey after searching high and low for them for two months! He loves them and said they were delish, so I'm happy :)
5.0	Great for snake or instead of potato chips, every one loved them and wanted more. I highly recommend these snacks.
5.0	Very good. I will keep buying it!!!
5.0	This coffee has a great taste and aroma, and it works nicely in my Keurig. I was worried the plastic-free filters wouldn't work properly, but I was pleasantly surprised! Great coffee at a great price! I can't foresee myself buying any other breakfast coffee as long as I have my Keurig.
5.0	The honey has a rich flavor; however, the sugar content is a bit higher than ones that I have used previously.<br />I do not have to use as much to get the results that I seek.
5.0	Luau Leaves are a must in making Squid Luau... so what isn't there to like if you like some awesome Hawaiian food????!!!
5.0	Everyone in my family loves Chocolate Twizzlers and Amazom is the only place I can find them, and at a terrific price!
1.0	Not very good coffee. Besure to roasted it dark, very dark, as its really poor tasting. then you can experiment with your grinding & brewing methods. If you're lucky, you might be able to salvage this poor coffee, or you'll have to throw it away... Needless to say, coffee bean direct no more for me!!!
5.0	Texas Pete is amazing. I've been using it for years. Unfortunately, it's a little hard to come by in SoCal so I have to get it online. The only downside of the gallon size is you need a sauce dispenser of some kind.
5.0	Received quickly. Great for ice tea.
5.0	Powerful ORAC greens, tastes decent, and perfect large size container to last awhile.  Will buy again for quality and taste for my morning smoothies mixed with protein and veggies; stays with me.
5.0	My husband loves these!  Make great lunch snacks for brown baggers.  The taste is really good and doesn't have a funny aftertaste as so many non/fat/diet foods do.
5.0	good stuff, gets like raelly strong so you dont know whats happening cause the world around you is moving so slow, feel like superman yo.
5.0	Arrived just as expected and just in time.  Household down with nasty head cold.  Not only soothing and delicious, actually seemed to make breathing passages clearer.  Teenage son previously against all 'tea like products' requests this tea especially before bed.
5.0	If you have ever purchased coconut water in the store you know how expensive they can be, $2.50-$3,00.  This was an excellent value and great quality of product.
5.0	What a deal this is the healthiest salt you can use.  This box should last our family the year no problem.  Iodized sea salt will not raise your blood pressure as regular salt will.
5.0	We used to buy pepitas in the smaller bags before we found these in the large (5 lb) size.  They are not over roasted or over salted so we roast and salt again.  We pour around 10-12 oz in an aluminum foil lined roasting pan.  Spray with nonstick oil, pour in the nuts and spray lightly.  Lightly salt.  Roast on 350 for 13 min.<br /><br />This comes in a re-sealable plastic bag, so just take out what you want to use and reseal for the next time.
5.0	I buy this by the case. My family likes it so much, we make two packs at a time. I do add an extra half cup of water & let it simmer an extra 15 minutes, we like it a little softer. Sometimes we add a can of garbanzo or kidney beans & some chicken or meatballs for an entree soup.
5.0	don't use sugar anymore - this is low glycemic and the best price I have found anywhere with the auto-shipping
1.0	I found these just a bit bigger than regular peanuts I've had, hard and lacking<br />in flavor.  Could be old?  Disappointing?
5.0	i love Powerade as much as Gatorade.  i like this flavor a lot.  the good thing about them is that they are inexpensive.  and they are great at keeping you hydrated.  if never tried powerade try it at least this one time.
5.0	It's remarkably difficult to find these Altoids in our shopping area so when I saw them available online, I grabbed them. It's great having so many available in my cupboard (in my car, at work...).
5.0	A friend had reccommended this tea and it is wonderful! I especially like the large leaves since I had been warned that some Jasmine teas have tiny leaves, almost like dust. Not this one! I didn't realize it was a pound as I usually get the 4 oz. tins with other teas. But it was a happy accident since I do like it. I will buy this again!
5.0	I LOVE these and plan reordering very soon. I only wish there was somewhere close I could buy them. Now I have several friends and family HOOKED on them.<br />AMY
5.0	A great combination of flavors.  I really like the Warm Oatmeal Cookie.
5.0	Started drinking Talking Rain when I lived in Seattle, Wa. Had it delivered by Amazon as part of my grocery order. Then when I moved out to Virginia, Talking Rain was not available in the grocery stores. Luckily it is still available from Amazon and they even pay shipping. So if you haven't tried it yet, order a case. There is Talking Rain Sparkling Essence which comes in four flavors. This is the one to try as you get to sample the four flavors without having to buy an entire case of just one flavor. No sugar, no artificial anything, and so bubbly, this is the best on the market.
1.0	This was gross. Totally described wrong. Definitely not worth the money
5.0	This is a little taste of down home. This coffee whether strong or medium, makes the perfect tasteful cup of coffee for me. If it is not community coffee, I don't drink it.
5.0	I rated this chili, &#34;I love it&#34;, because this a quick meal tasty and flatulence free. :)  No beans!!  If you have some, put sour cream and scallions on top. yum yum.
5.0	Great, I have ordered before and will order again.  These candies are Sees best.
5.0	I really like this tea.  Their fruit sangria is my very favorite tea.  This one is great, too.  Very fruity and flavorful.
5.0	Love the product!  These guys have a very consistent high quality light honey that works well in all of my cooking applications.<br /><br />I've been very pleased with this product, and have repeat ordered a few times.
5.0	Awesome rub sweet and spicy but not to spicy
1.0	I have searched for weeks in every store I could find for those ginger snaps that would put a little burn in your mouth.  Remember those?  They were so good and all of a sudden I started craving them.  I saw these on Amazon and ordered them.  When they arrived, they did not look like the ones on the web site.  The ones that arrived had strips on the bag.  They were not ginger tasting at all.  I might have to go to Nibisco themselves and find these snaps.  For now, I'm stuck with 16 bags of these things.
5.0	Great tasting condiments and new way to spice up anything from eggs to meat, to soups and stir-fries.
5.0	I ordered this to give it a try and I was very satisfied with this cappuccino.  The taste was surprisingly very pleasant and the strength was excellent.  Definitely worth a buy!
5.0	None of these were broken and they seemed fresh!
5.0	wonderful purchase. great gift!
5.0	These cookies taste so good by themselves and are even great for baking.They make terrific pie crusts...
5.0	After reading over the reviews for several different coffee brands and flavors, I decided to go with Gloria Jeans Hazelnut and I am so pleased that I did. The price is far less then what I was paying at the stores. The flavor is excellent, the boxing and individual k-cups arrived in perfect condition,(I had read that some did not). I am going to set up for the automatic renewal. What more can I say, it works great for me. Thanks again amazon!!
5.0	No complaints haven't tried a pizza with it yet but the bagels are great glad I brought it good flour
5.0	It's a very nice product! The flavor is fresh and full. The taste is just great. Will definitely buy again
5.0	This is the only hot cocoa I will have in my home. We love it with milk or water.
5.0	Love these butter biscuits, both with a cup of tea and separately as a not-so-sweet treat. These are only &#34;cookies&#34; in the broad sense, and have a neutral taste similar to a plain animal cracker. Thin, crisp, flaky, buttery, with just a hint of sweetness. When my children were babies, I used to give them these mild biscuits and they also loved them. Each cookie is about the size of the palm of my hand, so just 1 or 2 satisfy without heaviness.<br /><br />I can find these in only certain stores in my area and rely on Amazon as a back-up source, so definitely do some shopping around locally.
5.0	Finally a rice cooker with a stainless bowl! I will tell you, my secret is that I use no more than 3 cups of dry basmati rice with 3 1/2 cups of water. I also unplug the unit and let it set for at least 20 minutes before fluffing and it does not stick to the bottom the way it does if you do not have patience.
5.0	These are amazing. Not only do they have a very pleasant taste, they are so nice for soothing your tummy.
5.0	We eat this every third morning on Ezekiel 4:9 toast with blueberries &bananas... a real treat & good for you as well.
5.0	Campbell's has a winner here! Delightful subtle flavors and textures. I especially appreciated the occasional chunch of water chestnuts. I will definitely get this again.
5.0	The price is awesome for the quantity. The product is awesome. And the extra packets of drink mixes helps keep the product from becoming dull.
5.0	Very tasty indeed. I have purchased this a couple times and I am pleased with the quality. I use a lot of pepper and the 14 oz package is plenty for the winter.
5.0	Given as a gift to a true tea connoisseur, and she loved it!  I believe that this was a new flavor released by White Lion, so I hadn't tried it personally and took a chance on it as a gift.  It was deliciously balanced and delicate, as reported by the recipient.
5.0	I was somewhat surprised to discover that not all yacon syrup products on the market are not actually gluten free. The syrup itself of course comes from the yacon roots - which by themselves are gluten free. But some companies unfortunately mix in cheaper syrups or preservatives that contain gluten.<br /><br />This brand in particular (made by Hathaway Health) is indeed completely gluten free. An added bonus is that it has a very pleasant and sweet taste, and I just feel good every time I have had some. This really is the real deal, thank you.
5.0	Sunbutter tastes great and is way better for you than peanut butter. Sunflower seeds contain more minerals and also has high levels of plant sterols. Plant sterols help remove cholesterol. Since consuming my breakfast oatmeal with yogurt, peaches, and a tablespoon of Sunbutter, my cholesterol is way down. Plus this combo tastes great, texture, sweet, sour, nutty... I ate oatmeal for years but my cholesterol didn't go down that much till I ate it with Sunbutter. This works for me, results may vary for others. Not to be construed as a health claim. Dang lawyers. Anyway, some people my be allergic at a low level I was told by my allergist, (I ate peanut butter for years but a allergy test said I was allergic to peanuts), so I stopped eating peanut butter and I felt better. Please reread disclaimer.  [[ASIN:B002OK6E6I SunButter Creamy Sunflower Seed Spread, 16-Ounce Plastic Jars (Pack of 6)]]
5.0	This is a great deal for this amount of vanilla beans, which are perfect to use to make your own vanilla extract. I have made several batches now, and still have many, many more beans left to use. This is about a lifetime supply...Make sure that you seal them up in a airtight container to maintain freshness. The beans were very fresh, fragrant and flavorful. I am please with the quality.
5.0	Cant just eat one, they are habit forming!
5.0	LOVE every single one of these.  They were big hits with the kids as well! Highly recommend.
5.0	It really tastes way better than regular or sea salt, great on my salad.
5.0	These are the best brownies I have ever had! Everyone who tries them says the same thing. It's definitely worth subscribing!
5.0	I enjoy a nice cup of tea! I prefer the twinings brand and several flavors. English Breakfast and Irish Breakfast are my favorite
5.0	Zatarains  brand is a no-brainer.  You have everything you need in one box, add meat and you have a great meal.  Love It!
5.0	Great product!  Wish I had known about it years ago.  Allows me to make restaurant-quality Thai food from the comfort of my home.
5.0	Awesome real deal! I love real wildrice and this is premium quality, excellent tasting product. It is very healthy, tasty, and I have a standing order now. I heartily endorse this and the Red Lake Nation efforts to protect the resource!
5.0	We love the Mrs. Meyer's lemon verbena hand washing soap.  This is a great value and will give us many refills of the pump bottle that sits on the counter by the sink.
1.0	"No dice!<br /> I don't know where they get off calling these \\""Molten\\"" they are not even hot!  As far as the \\""Hot wings\\"" what you are referring to is Buffalo wings (AKA Franks Red Hot & Butter) and I am sorry to say these chips have none of those flavors.<br />If you have ever eaten these chips, run, don't walk to the store and get yourself some Snyder's of Hanover, Hot Buffalo Wing Pretzel Pieces. These are the real deal! They will change your entire perspective on anything with the title of \\""Hot Wings\\"" and put this sad imposter in its place.<br />It is obvious to me that the good people at Ruffles did not even try on this one. Ten minutes of research would have done wonders."
5.0	"Hibiscus tea is so very good for your blood pressure. I brew up a batch to chill as iced tea to drink throughout the day. The flavor is similar to cranberry juice, only a little lighter. It's been called  \\""Sour Tea\\"".  Recent studies have shown it has diuretic properties, it opens up arteries and is a natural ACE inhibitor, which means it slows the release of hormones that constrict blood vessels. My source for this info is from an article in Mother Earth News by Michael Castleman Oct/Nov 2011. However I've come across a number of encouraging articles on the benefits of Hibiscus Tea. Another source is The Health Ranger, Mike Adams on naturalnews.com.<br /><br />This tea is an everyday staple for me. I have it delivered on Amazon's auto ship program.<br />Another bonus: The left over tea bags are fun to use in fabric and paper dyeing crafts too! Great color!<br /><br />Enjoy, and be well.<br />Elaine Beckwith"
5.0	I have been eating oats for years. This is the first time that I switched to organic oats. I can taste the difference right away. Great stuff.
5.0	This is my now my all time favorite. TRY IT!!!
5.0	This pasta requires a bit more cooking time than other brands of gluten free pasta.It is superior to other gluten-free pasta out there.  I love it because it never gets soggy. It is a difficult to find product in the US since it is made in Canada. I live gluten-free by choice and needs - I am glad that I have easy access to it through Amazon.com.
5.0	Very filling and has tons of fiber. This product has helped me keep my weight in check. I use it as a snack and find myself satisfied, not wanting anything else; each cracker has 12 calories with 5 grams of fiber.
5.0	We like this very of Pace.  While the salsa is chunky and juicy, the picante sauce is less chunky, jus as flavorful and goes well in burritos and enchiladas.  Comes down to personal preference.
5.0	This is so good, it tastes awesome. Its my favorite shisha I have. Very good has a flavor and wonderful smoke.
5.0	Great Product! Deceptive advertising. I thought I was buying 2 bags of chips for the listed price because of the photo.
5.0	I really like these spices.  They definitely have more taste and fragrance than the ones I used to buy in grocery store.
5.0	I love spicy food and these certainly deliver.  You know how sometimes you only feel the heat after eating something advertised as spicy for a while?  Not these...I was on fire after the first pistachio I ate.  And it's good flavor as well if you like the chili-lime combo.
5.0	my wife only can use this due to peanut allergy...she swears by it!
5.0	It's about time there is something better for us to drink.. Something cool and mainstream (that actually tastes good and is refreshing!!), but a drink I can actually look at the ingredients and feel like I am doing good and only good for my body. I stopped drinking whats out there because frankly, there is just sooo much sugar in it.
5.0	I use to buy these in the the store and then for some reason they stopped carrying them. I found them on Amazon and was like THANK YOU!!!<br />They cook up great and not like the nasty taste of canned refried beans. i have tried sooo many brands and this hands-down has been the tops!
5.0	The serving size per bag is small but aside from that - these are very yummy and addictive!  My hubby even enjoys them!
5.0	This stock is the best I've tried.  I use it for soups, casseroles, anything that needs chicken flavor and moisture.  I order this using subscribe and save, and find it to be comparable in price, or less, than store  brand chicken broth, which is less flavorful and requires I use more product. The only drawback of this stock is that I cannot figure out how to open the seal without using a knife.  If anyone has figured out this mystery, please post the key!
5.0	"For starters - I do not like most forms of energy and protein drinks.  I find the tastes are too sugary or the aftertaste is bitter or it just doesn't do what it's supposed to.  Anything that states it can be a meal replacement should not make me feel starved or deprived 1 hour later - as is the case normally.  The Svelte Chocolate is good.  Yes some aftertaste exists, but to me it taste like the same aftertaste as anything made from soy.  I've only had the chocolate because my local store carries chocolate and cappuccino and I don't like coffee related flavors.  This drink will leave you feeling full and sated for several hours.  I had one for breakfast one time and was perfectly fine all morning.  I didn't sit at my desk craving food.  It also works really well for afternoons if there is a long time between lunch and dinner.  The flavor is also rich.  It's not super sugar sweet but more of a rich sweet, which satisfies any cravings for sugar or chocolate.  One of my favorite things is the size - 1 bottle is an entire serving!  It's not one of those, \\""Here's a single-serving size container that has 4 servings in it\\"" products.  Which probably helps with the satisfaction afterwords because you can have more than 4 oz.  If chocolate isn't your style - try one of the other 3 flavors.  I hope to try the french vanilla and chai soon."
1.0	I purchased this Balsamic Vinegar hoping that it would be similar in taste to D.O.C. qualty, 12 year old vinegars. I knew by the price that it wasn't actually aged, otherwise it would have cost four times more. Unfortunately, there was no similarity between a good quality Balsamic Vinegar and this product. I even had a blind taste test to prove it.     There is a chain of stores called Oliviers & Co. that sells a $35 bottle of Balsamic Vinegar that is ten times better than this product. I would also recommend Colavita's vinegar over this brand for 1/3 the price.    Finally, it is customary for fine vinegars to have the number of years aged on the label or in the name. For these guys to call the Balsamic #12 is rude and misleading. For that reason alone I would add caution to your purchase..
5.0	This is absolutely the best granola in the world. I have tried many different kinds, and this is by far the BEST. Good for you too!
5.0	I absolutely love this tea, hot or cold. Good quality, good flavor, my new favorite! Do not forget to pre-heat your tea pot. And use filtered water for better flavor, this will make the difference. Enjoy! Just an update to this review. I now have my whole family (including the grandchildren) drinking this tea and they all love it.
5.0	Made this and chapati one Saturday night for guest.  The loved it!  The finished the curry sauce with a bosten butt I made for BBQ.  I almost think pulled pork cooked in this instant curry mix is better then chicken.<br /><br />Wife had me make a second batch on Sunday.
5.0	great flavor, very potent. One drop in a bowl of soup gives it lots of heat!
5.0	I like to keep these on hand for when I'm making soup.  They are good & I don't have to keep green onions on hand, which I don't use often enough & tend to spoil.  So these are perfect!  Good shelf life, good taste.
5.0	I have 4 kids who eat a lot of goldfish! I prefer the 1oz bags for portion control and freshness.
5.0	I first tried the barbeque-flavored GemWraps, and then these.  I was a skeptical, bread-loving person when I bought these.  I really wanted something to cut the carbs while still being tasty.  I really like these and the barbeque ones.  They may not be for everyone...the texture seems to throw some people off.  However, I have used them for both hot and cold wraps and have enjoyed them.
5.0	I use this flavoring so I will drink more water. We have to buy bottled here as the water locally is not good for drinking. And bottled water, some has a after taste. So I use this and it works well, no added calories
5.0	I gave them out in my baby shower and my friends love it. They said it tastes very good.
5.0	Smooth and flavorful!
5.0	best coffee for the kurig. followed by Donut Shop Dark roast.
5.0	Love this, it is so wonderful in the mornings. Can hardly find it anywhere and we do not have a Starbucks in our area.
5.0	Decided to try ordering sesame sticks as I live in a rural are where they are impossible to buy.  Read all the reviews for different brands and picked the Sincerely Nuts brand based on previous reviews.  Order arrived 4 days earlier than estimated by Amazon.  These sticks are great.  Love the flavor.  Will definitely be buying again.
5.0	OK, 100% Jamaican Blue Mountain Coffee is expensive. It is also really, really good. With apologies to Hawaii, I think it is the best coffee I have found, with rich flavor and less bitterness. The flavor is complex and nuanced. You won't get coffee this good at your local coffee shop, and, even though it isn't inexpensive, it is still cheaper than going to Starbucks. I use a coffee maker which grinds the beans and then brews the coffee. It doesn't get fresher than that. If you really appreciate good coffee, you will love this stuff.
5.0	Very very yummy! I'm impressed with technology---how could they make a soup so good come out of a dry bag? Amazing!<br /><br />We added chicken, of course. We also had it with a sprinkle of cheese on top and dollup of sour cream, along with our own tortilla chips mixed in. Absolutely delicious!<br /><br />It is especially delicious while camping. We tried the potato soup by Bear Creek as well, but I wasn't impressed. This was a great hot dinner with a camp stove (didn't add anything then, but it was still great because we were camping!).
5.0	This salami is delicious to me. It is firm and just spicy enough to be good to me. It is slightly greasy but no more than any other salami or pepperoni that I have ever had. That means that it is normal. I eat it at room temperature and it has a firm texture but is not excessively chewy. I like the convenience of the four pack as I do not have to buy it quite so often.
5.0	"When you love Indian food, but don't have the time to cook it, Kitchens of India is a really great alternative. I have yet to be disappointed in one of their dishes and this one is no exception. The great thing about Indian food is that they are mostly sauce (or \\""gravy\\"" as they say), so I will cook up some meat or steam up some veggies and add one of these packets to make a fabulous meal. Their really aren't much in the way of veggies in these packets, but that is typical in Indian food, no matter where it comes from. American's tend to use gravy or sauce as the secondary component while Indian's use it as the primary component and sop it up with lots of bread or rice. By steaming or sauteing some additional vittles, you can really stretch one of these packets."
5.0	The price I paid was just what was expected; great.  I mean what can you say about Macadamias; they are pricy but here with these guys it was a great price for the two pounds.  Here where I live a 8 oz can costs close to 9 dollars so I knew I was getting a lot more bang for my buck.  I will defiantly buy from you guys again.
5.0	Wrappers worked perfectly.  I didn't experience any caramels sticking to the wrapper at all.  Very thin, clear wrappers as described.
5.0	Ener-g tapioca flour is wonderful and reasonably priced compared to the other ones. I use it to thicken foods as well as in gluten flour mixes. The Brazilian's use it to make amazing cheese bread. I highly recommend this product!
5.0	This item is extremely good, helps with Colds, Sore Throats and Headaches caused by Colds.  I highly recommend this product!!!
5.0	great coffee but the price has gone up  since i last purchased it. can't afford to buy it anymore. i will switch to something else.
5.0	Great smooth and dark taste. I would definitely recommend this coffee to my friends and family. Great for cappuccinos and lattes.
5.0	Work great with or without having a cold.
5.0	I tried these when I was home in PA visiting my sister and she had some in the cabinet. We literally sat there and ate half of the bag. These are so much better than other cookies and do not contain gluten or wheat. The coconut macaroons are better though I will have to say but they do not sell the single bags on amazon. I have yet to find them in a store down here in Jacksonville NC.
5.0	I ordered the decaf version. It arrived as promised. It smells and tastes just like fresh brewed coffee to me. I love that I can make either hot coffee or iced coffee so easily. I don't know why grocery stores don't sell this product.
5.0	THis gum is delicious and also has very long staying power.  I chew gum all the time because of a dry mouth and the flavor lasts and lasts.
5.0	Love this coffee and the convenience of subscribe & save delivered monthly to my door!!
5.0	All four of the spice combinations are popular at our house.  i often serve French or Italian bread with olive oil and this spice jar as an alternative to  hot buttered bread  or garlic bread.  I have also used the spices in cooking Italian food.  Since I have no longer been able to find this product locally, I was relieved to see it on Amazon.  We did try a similar product by another brand name and, though it was good, we prefer Dean Jacob's.
5.0	Simply Strawberry is probably my favorite flavor right now! It is so perfect for the up coming summer months. Enjoy this sweet delectable dessert anytime. It is perfectly sweetened and reminds me of summer!
5.0	This is my favorite, and my orders are processed and shipped very quickly.  po'WKEFM poewfijm nein jc;j.  weincf EJIq fdbnIKJUFDCNB  EJEEJ FCDJEI  kiejcf nbIO; FC ;jef nWEIwe.
5.0	My first purchase was @ Trader Joe's. I loved the flavor so I purchased it in bulk. I recommend this flavor.
5.0	This smells divine.  I order this coffee all the time and it never disappoints. I drink it black with a smile on my face.
5.0	Buying in bulk through the auto delivery option is such a great value! Sign up now you won't be sorry!
5.0	Mother in law loved them
5.0	Recently found out that I am gluten-sensitivity.  Made idlis [...] with these and wow, they are soooo delish and extremely healthy!
5.0	Nice easy way to add a quick flavor boost.
5.0	A lot of folks have mentioned the big con with this Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz: no instruction manual.  But come on now - let's be fair to Tuscan.  Putting together a manual for this product would be an unapproachable chore, as there are a million and one uses for this stuff.    Not only is this milk delicious and usually fresh, but it's an amazing substance to have around the house.  Got dandruff?  No problem - liberally apply Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz during shower time, and repeat if desired.  Kiss those flakes goodbye.  Need to strip grease from your dishes?  You guessed it - this milk cuts the mustard.  And the grease.  On your dishes.  Just soak for 15 minutes and it'll remove even the most caked-on food.  Same goes for stains on your clothes.    Amazingly, I've found that Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz is great for disciplining pets.  Did your dog just eat your shoes?  Maybe your cat pooped on the floor.  All you have to do is get your pet hooked on Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz, and then when they misbehave - take the Milk away.  Your pet will be a whimpering, obedient slave within minutes.    Finally - and I know this sounds crazy - Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz acts as an amazing signal booster for cable television.  If you live in an old house like I do, you know that sometimes the strength of your cable signal can waver.  During those vital newscasts or gameshows, nothing can be more obnoxious than a weak signal.  To fix this, simply dump Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz onto your cable box.  It's amazing - a clear beautiful picture within minutes!    So in short, the lack of operator's manual is a bit unfortunate, but supplying one would undoubtedly raise the per-unit cost of the milk.  Think about the insane bargain you're getting for this amazing liquid!
5.0	The best spice I've tried to date.
5.0	My rice cooker never turned out rice the way I liked it until I tried this rice. Comes out perfect, is healthy, and tastes great.
5.0	These teas are delicious. I ordered the sampler pack so I could try different flavors, and I am impressed. They tea was delivered in a timely manner.
5.0	I've bought this for a couple of years now.  Excellent dark roast decaf.
5.0	This is great for beef or chicken! Any recipe where celery would be used. I love to cook cockpit meals. Chicken, water, a pack of Lipton onion soup mix and this!! Delicious and simple.
1.0	I bought this seaweed to try upon recommendation in a book I'm reading. I couldn't even eat one little piece! Right when I opened the first package I was shocked at the overwhelming rotten fish smell. But I took a bite anyway and it was horrendous. I haven't tried any other seaweed so I have nothing to compare it to but there's no way I could eat these. The consistency was unexpected, like a thin sheet of bumpy styrofoam. &#34;Seasoned and Roasted&#34;? Hardly. There was no flavor other than bad fish. Some have commented that it's crispy but these are not crispy by a long shot. Another commented that it varied between packages but I can't bring myself to open another one. Remember in grade school when you'd &#34;make paper&#34; by chopping scraps in a blender with water, squeezing it out and pressing flat over a screen to dry....yeah, these are the fish version. They taste like someone threw fish in a blender, squeezed it out and pressed it. Horrible, horrible, horrible. There are so many good ratings. Am I missing something or did I get a bad batch?
5.0	A bit overpriced, but my local Indian store is now closed.
5.0	Apple Strudel Poptarts are absolutely the best flavor Kelloggs has yet to make. They have just the right amount of frosting and are not completely covered in frosting like all the other flavors are.
5.0	Great deal.  Everyone in the office loves them.
5.0	My kid love these crazy eggs!!! I have no idea why!!! Lol
5.0	The most deliciously crisp salty snack that has ever had the honor to pass through my lips.
1.0	Did not like the texture of this flour.. Everything was very gritty.
5.0	You can socialize with this no calorie, no alcohol drink and enjoy it too! This is a great way to participator in summer gatherings.
1.0	"I love a great Bloody Mary, even a mediocre one... this is the worst I've ever tasted. The only good thing about this product is the honesty of the product description, \\"" spicy pickle brine, tomato paste, fresh pressed cucumber juice\\"". If you want to try this mix before buying, do this first... take the pickles out of a pickle jar and stir in some cheap tomato paste and muddle a chunk cucumber. Seems that McClure's has found a way to sell its used brine to to the masses. This awful concoction should not be labeled as a Bloody Mary mix. Disgusting, waste of good vodka."
1.0	I sent these to my sister as a surprise. That didn't go well. She opened the box and immediately sent me pictures of what was inside. It was infested with bugs! YUCK! Never again. Now she doesn't understand why I sent her a box full of rotten and bug infested chips.
1.0	I bought the Dolce Gusto machine along with the Latte Machiato capsules. I thought the drink tasted horrible. The milk was too sweet. I can't quite pinpoint the exact taste, but is wasn't like anything I had tasted before. I really believe it came from the milk capsule & not the coffee capsule.
5.0	great value. i have never tried hibiscus tea until i bought this bag. i like it. very different taste. a nice tartness to it. im sure people with more refined tea palates can tell a difference. but this is great tea to me.
5.0	None of the local stores carried this when we needed it for a birthday.  It came in time and was just what we wanted.  It made a great tart cherry pie, just they way they should be.
5.0	Taste wise, its very refreshing in the morning.<br /><br />The worst thing in the morning is when you reach for your coffee and it just taste plain awful. I drink my coffee black 95% of the case so this was one that was smooth, bold and didn't upset my taste buds. Some beans usually have a very roasted or burnt taste to it. This one is very smooth despite being a dark roast. When I look for dark roast coffee, I look for that bold smooth dark flavor, not burnt coffee. This is the one
5.0	Very delicious, no garbage in it and no cross contamination with other tree nuts. This one is without sugar and it is just as good as the one they have with sugar. Best of all NO GMO! Love their products!!
5.0	I'd been looking for some quality (I hesitate to say 'gourmet') simple popcorn, as I watch a ton of movies and am constantly eating the stuff.  Snappy White pops up nicely, tastes great with I Can't Believe It's Not Butter, comes in a huge package that assures that I will not run out anytime soon.  I concur with the hundreds of people who rated this highly - this is really good stuff, and is actually not very expensive when you consider how huge the package is and how long it will last.
5.0	I just made 2 gallons of the best pasta sauce that I have ever made. I love your company.<br /><br />I just made 2 gallons of pasta sauce. This is the best pasta sauce to date. If you are ever looking for an Arizona sales rep. hire me!! I love the selection, price, and product standard of these fantastic herbs.<br /><br />i
5.0	very good tea wish you could still buy in the stores I use to buy Lipton English breakfast at Vons years ago.
5.0	After browsing around a few grocery stores, I could not find any Irish Cream flavored coffee that is sold in K cups (for Keurig makers).<br /><br />I decided to purchase a bottle of this creamer and I really enjoy it! This of course surprised me because I never had the Original Bailey's Irish Cream Liqueur prior to purchasing this.<br /><br />The creamer has a special flavor that cannot be easily described. In my opinion, it has a cherry-like flavor with a sharp twist that I like.<br /><br />I would recommend this creamer to anyone who needs a break from traditional creamer flavors such as vanilla and hazelnut.  That being said, Irish Cream does have a taste of its own and it may not be for all coffee drinkers.
5.0	This is my favorite brand of Earl Grey Tea.
5.0	Justin's Almond Butter is a wonderful product and absolutely delicious. This particular flavor is my favorite of all the others I have tried. Highly recommend this product. So much better than peanut butter!!
5.0	This is the only formula that has worked for my baby! She is 3 months old now and has been on this since she was 6weeks old! I called the company and they emailed me the nutrition charts and etc to give to my pediatrician. It says toddler formula because they believe breastfeeding is the best for babies under 1 year.<br /><br />This formula was a miracle for my sweet girl! She was on enfamil ready feed, enfamil gas relief ready feed and then they tried putting her on nutramigen powder! The nutramigen made her so gassy and her poo smelled like chemicals! It was horrid!  So I prayed and my friend recommended baby's only and I feel so much better giving her this stuff! She was literally a completely differnt baby after 3 feedings!!!! It's not full of junk that will hurt her system! I just wish more places carried this formula! The closest place for me that sells it is N hour away. Thankfully Amazon can ship it to my house!<br /><br />You will not be disappointed with this product!!
5.0	Rich dark color with full flavor & a smooth low acid taste. Easy to drink without the nasty bitter aftertaste- a clear winner for many knowleable coffee lovers
5.0	Warm pork rinds are so wonderful straight out of the microwave. Yummy!
5.0	My wife really likes these so it is in my best interest to purchase them, and I like them too.
1.0	It sounds so good but it isn't. I wasn't expecting it to look as good as it does on the package but when I opened it was disappointed to see brown mush of various shades, with no hint of color of any vegetable. Heated it per direction. I tasted and it tasted like brown mush. Should have known like any ready to eat food it looks and tastes like plastic.
5.0	Many reviewers say they don't like the taste but I like it alot.  I like it much better than the original flavor bars.  Has a slight berry'ish flavor; earthy goodness to it.  I enjoy it probably too much.  Perhaps because I'm just desperate for good bars to eat that stay clear of all the major food allergens.  Although, I'm not suppose to have spinach and it is an ingredient in this bar.
5.0	I've been on WW diet and these crackers are great! I have them with soup and can eat 24 for only 3 points. I ususally just need 11 which are 1 point. Hubby loves these too.
5.0	You will receive a box in a fraction of the time allotted for international shipping.  These are so very good with a 6month shelf life.  I remember them from my days as a kid and visits home to the UK, they don't make anything quite like these here in the states.  They are close to a Haribo gummy bear, yet shaped in a lozenge shape sprinkled lightly with confectioners crystal sugar.  The flavors are more true to the fruit taste than a gummy beaI wouldn't hesitate using Medideals, I have twice now, it's a heavy box and considering their cost and capturing shipping they sell for a more than fair price.  If you don't want to order this large box and want to experiment to see that this will be a future favorite of yours too; try ordering a smaller quantity and them come back because you'll want more. You'll experience a blackcurrant flavor used the world over that we don't see here, it's a nice add, in most countries you can buy tubes of just the blackcurrant.  Try them I think they'll be a new favorite candy for you too.  It's difficult to stop eating them is the problem.  Chewey, sweet but not overly and that light crystal sugar coating starts it out so well.  Thanks Medideals.
5.0	I love these and they really work without making me jittery or nervous. After using one sheet, I feel sharp and clear headed. However, I buy them direct from Sheets@Brand.com for $5.95 per 8 pack.
5.0	Celtic sea salt is full of important trace minerals which the usual refining process strips out of commercial salt. It is available both in coarse and fine grinds.
5.0	Love this product! I have used several bags and will continue to reorder.I use it in baking and in shakes !
5.0	This tea is the best in the world.  I love the taste & it actually has health benefits too.  It can help prevent diabetes, lower blood pressure, lower your weight & many, many other things.  This tea is for the serious tea drinker.  You can look up the health benefits yourself, here online.  I've told all my friends & family.  Most have switched.  My husband & children even love it.  they are so picky.  Hope you & yours enjoy it like mine.
5.0	Just what I expected. A nice flashback to when I was a kid. It was hard finding them anywhere else.
5.0	I LOVE this drink!!! Great taste with ZERO SUGAR, ZERO CAFFEINE, ZERO SODIUM, ZERO ASPARTAME & only 5 Calories, did I say GREAT TASTE! I've been on the 6 Week Body Make-Over Diet which calls for food & drink with 0 salt, it's very hard to find. Great for those with diabetes or high blood pressure. Go to this company website and check it out, [...] My kids love these drinks too! No, I don't work for the company, but I believe in what they are doing, and want them to survive!
5.0	Arrived promptly. It is amazing what a difference vanilla beans make!
5.0	Great buys.happy and impressed.thanks
1.0	there is nothing remotely hot about it
5.0	These things are the best.  I get them at my local grocery store, but if they ever stop carrying them I'd probably order from somewhere else like Amazon.  Where else can you get nearly 100% of your day's fiber by slapping two tortillas together and making a cheese quesadilla in the microwave?  One minute later and ka-bam!  I've now had a high fiber diet for that day!  Want even more fiber?  Toss some beans into that quesedilla!  Do they taste like a normal corn tortilla? NO...but they taste just fine (it's mostly a texture difference...these are smoother and not as granular/cake/flour like as a normal corn or flour tortilla) and will turn nearly any variety of unhealthy compliment (i.e. cheddar cheese, etc.) into something that's not too bad for you!  Looking at the ingredients, it looks like they're getting most of the fiber content from oat fiber, so that explains why these don't taste overly wheat-like.
5.0	Used the weight watcher recipe,  nothing but egg, cheese and hatch chilli.  Quick and easy to assemble bakes in 30 minutes..Absolute heaven!
5.0	This isn't the best rice you'll ever eat but it's pretty damn good for rice that's done in 60 seconds.
5.0	I love this Chai. I usually make a large coffee cup with four teaspoons of Trader Joe's Spicy Chai Latte and a 1/2 teaspoon of Trader Joe's sipping chocolate. It is delicious! I'm definitely addicted. I drink at least two of these a day!
5.0	This coffee is pretty darn good. I like strong coffee and the Fog Chaser meets my expectations. Very nice job on the K-Cup holder also!
5.0	The drink definitely has a kick to it and gives you energy but I'm not a big fan of the spicy ginger like taste of it
5.0	Yum! My new favorite coffee. Excellent flavor and convenient packaging.
1.0	I bought a case of these for around $60.00, thinking I am getting some delicious Italian Coffee,<br />the cup is not the right size for the keurig coffee maker and I have wasted my money. I am not<br />sure if this will work in the tassimo machine or not.? I am sure the coffee is probably good,<br />but not when it doesn't work in your machine. They should list what coffee makers support this<br />product. I hope you can learn from my mistake. In the picutre, the cup looks longer than it<br />really is. It is a small narrow cup in actuality.
5.0	Good Li Hing Mui.  What every Hawaiian away from home craves.  It's the real deal.
5.0	pure barley-malt powder/<br /> tastes like<br /> the inside of a malted-milk ball.
5.0	NOM NOM NOM NOM NOM... Open the bag for a couple days to let them dry out a little! They had the consistency of hot dogs when i first opened the bag. The office loves them!
5.0	Using it to balance the Ph in my hydroponic system, does very well.
5.0	I bought these for a friend and then he gave me a box and they were so good I bought more just for me.
1.0	Although i am very satisfied with other Rishi teas, this one smells like dead fish. It simply stinks. I could not even dare to take a sip to taste it. Maybe it is packed in a fish packing facility at China but this thing is undrinkable.
5.0	great coffee great shipping good overall experience
5.0	My favorite coffee...and I'm glad to see that it's available in more outlets. Used to be that you'd need to go to a physical DD store to get these, which was always kind of a pain for me. Now they are available pretty much all over.<br /><br />It's a very unique blend, one that doesn't come across as over roasted or bitter, as some coffees tend to do (I'm looking at you, Starbucks!). It perfectly straddles the line between rich and mild...there's definite flavor there, but it's not overpowering. I drink it with no sugar, no cream, and it's marvelous. Really, it's one of my favorite cups.<br /><br />The K cup format doesn't seem to detract from the product. By that I mean I have brewed various size cups and they all taste stellar. A very good brew.
5.0	Not too salty.  This is lite and you will need to use a lot more to get the taste.  I like it and it is healthy.
5.0	"I love Wasa crisp bread and this is my favorite kind. It's thick and crunchy with a good rye flavor. Tastes wonderful with cheese and deli sandwich meat. I use this for homemade \\""lunchable\\"" type meals in one of my two-tier bento boxes, 2 slices of this, with fruit in silicone cups on top, top layer, cheese and meat and some vegetables. It's tasty, quick, and easy and low fat depending on the kind of cheese you use."
5.0	We bought this product to use for making gingerbread houses for the holidays.  we had over 40 people over to build gingerbread houses and our guests loved the candy provided for decorations
5.0	The best value for the price!  It averages out to about 2 cents a packet and I've seen them for around 4 cents each!
5.0	"These have a great taste and a great price.  The sea salt provides a much cleaner taste that \\""ordinary salt\\"".  These are not too salty, but I also use them in breakfast cereal, so I need to remove most of the salt.  While some might rinse and dry the almonds, I find that putting them in a wire strainer and shaking the salt out in the sink works great.  Other times I leave the salt in.  Another good option for these it adding them to [[ASIN:B000M69QRU Ocean Spray Craisins Sweetened Dried Cranberries - 48 oz (3 Pounds)]] in a salad.  A very nice combination.  I have also done the same with chicken salad!    Great, versatile product."
5.0	20 Below makes wonderful shakes.  Ice cubes, milk, powder...presto!  Very chocolatey with a thick texture more like ice cream but without quite so much fat.  Add a banana or strawberries for a yummy twist.  It's good as hot chocolate, but even better as shakes.
5.0	Good producto. Muy buen producto . Me encanta para usarlo en la preparaci&oacute;n de la paella.
1.0	No walnuts! Only 1 Pecan! Almost all almonds will not buy again!
5.0	Yummy Japanese seasonings in eight variations.  They come in glass jars with sturdy yet soft plastic covers.  Delish!  I am working my way through the lot, starting with the salmon flavored Furikake.  The jars are larger than I thought they would be (Yay!).  I don't think it will take me long to work my way through all of them and then place a second order!  You must try these :)
5.0	Just the right amount of sweet and spice. Take it from a tried and true Texas BBQ family...this was such a pleasant surprise that I have put it on auto delivery and even given several bottles as gifts.
5.0	Donut Shop coffee is the best we have found in a long time.
5.0	Beware if you drink to much of this tea you will start speaking Chinese.
5.0	Love best money you could spend for your health do you know The Lord Jesus  Christ then you are healthy wealthy and wise .
5.0	I have 6 plants currently in my yard just north of Boston. They were covered under five feet of snow since Christmas, but the snow is melting and they are springing up good as new. They grow fast, tolerate a little or a lot of sunlight and they shoot like crazy. In the end, they should be 5-7 feet in diameter and 10 feet tall, perfect for a nice hedge or single specimin.    I'll be buying several more of these plants and growing them indoors in larger pots (6-8 inch)for about a year and then putting them in the ground next spring!
5.0	Love this gum! It tastes great and lasts longer than any gum I've ever tried!!
1.0	Worst flowers I have ever seen.  Very late.  Wilted, brown and one even broken off the stem.  Looked like they cam from a funeral.<br />I would be embarrassed if I were the seller!
5.0	awesome<br />its the closest I've had to the home made
5.0	"I've been eating nori since the seventies (which is when I started managing natural food stores and thus also selling seaweed), and One Organic Nori is as delicious as any I've had. The sheets measure about 7 1/2\\"" x 8 1/8\\"" (by my own measurements), and so fit perfectly on the smaller of two bamboo sushi rollers I own. I used a sheet to make sushi with rice, tofu and vegetables, and it was so tasty and delicious that I couldn't resist making a second batch for immediate consumption.<br /><br />The only ingredient is organic roasted seaweed. It comes in an easy-to-reseal package that contains a dessicant (moisture absorbing) packet that is meant to be discarded after opening. The seaweed should then be stored in the refrigerator.<br /><br />After eating the sushi I made with One Organic Nori, I enjoyed a cup of tea made with [[ASIN:B00O41OKEI One Organic Matcha Green Tea Powder]], and it was a perfect complement to the nori.<br /><br />I received a sample of this nori to review."
5.0	This is a great rub for ribs and chicken on the grill!  It gives it a bbq flavor that is sweet, but tangy.  We put the rub on and let it sit for a while - grill it up then put on the Bone Suckin sauce a few minutes before taking it off the grill - delicious!
5.0	Earl Grey Tea  Love it.  Thank You
5.0	Truly our favorite Almond Butter of all that is out there!! This is our newest obsession!!...goes quickly so order multiple jars..:))
5.0	Use it often as marinade. Meat is tasty and delicious, ( and TENDER) especially when cooked on the grill. Never actually made a spiedie though...
5.0	Delicious and arrived on the date posted for arrival.  Good coffee, good service, thanks.
5.0	I'm a new roaster and really enjoy this particular bean. Most consistent roasting of the 4 types I've tried and the the round shape makes rotating them onto all sides very easy.
5.0	Loved the coffee, love Starbucks coffee.  This one was very price for the number of K-Cups.  Pricy but  good!  Thanks Starbucks!!
1.0	Not good.  Bought this from the local supermarket to avoid going across town to buy my normal brand from a specialty market.  I added the entire jar and it never tasted like curry.  This is awful.
1.0	Box did not contain advertised assortment. Different brands and flavors and not an equal mix of coffee vs tea vs cider, etc... Will not be ordering from this vendor again.
5.0	I was curious to try this mix, many no gluten mixes can be somewhat grainy in texture after preparation. This mix was primarily used for pancakes ( pumpkin pancakes as well. ) I enjoyed the flavor and texture very much !
5.0	Ok, well I add more tomato than they call for and 4 tablespoons of cocoa to smoooooooth it out, but we love this seasoning mix!
5.0	This is nice barley, cooks up firm and plump and has a nice texture and flavor, and the price was very reasonable.  It'll take us a while to get through all of it but having lots of it on hand is encouraging me to use more of it, as a substitute for rice or as an addition to dishes that I haven't added whole grains to before.
5.0	Tastes great.  I mix it in with my morning coffee.  I'm looking forward to using it on cookies or some other baked goods.
5.0	I deal with people alot and these mints really help me feel that my breath is fresh and clean. Love these mints.
5.0	Very good quality and reasonably priced. I will be buying again.
5.0	Its 1 AM and I'm munching one down as I type. Its not the conventional creamy textured ice<br />Cream that we all love and adore its slightly more crystallized and breaks off Into little lumps, but once its in your mouth .....its so delicious. The flavor lingers just long enough and its actually good for you made out of milk whey which has tons of protein. Its a guilt free midnight munchie. Enjoy!
5.0	Works great, and a good price. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone. I will definitely use this product again
5.0	I thought that maybe they would taste good. And then I tried it and decided they didn't taste good. They tasted AMAZING. This is possibly the best snack one could have. I deeply recommend this product, and I hope others will learn to enjoy this tasty treat as well.
5.0	This tasty, chili pepper-based sauce has a distinctive flavor not unlike Tabasco Sauce, but with a very intense kickback bite. Spicy and bold are accurate descriptions. It can be splashed on anything you'd normally consider putting hot sauce on...it steps up the flavor and character of any food...chili, pizza, burgers, etc. Excellent sauce that is not to be ignored!
5.0	My daughter and I both love these treats.  Became a little tired of all the fruit snacks in the stores so I bought these and love them.
1.0	First AMAZON's Packing Box Came Opened ??? ~N~ Second Complaint This Orville Redenbacher's Smart Pop Kettle Corn Popcorn, 3-Count Boxes (Pack of 12)Product is TOTALLY:    1. smeared or covered with oil; greasy: any oily road surface they could find.    2. of the nature of, consisting of, or resembling oil.   3. of or pertaining to oil.   4. full of or containing oil.   5. smooth or unctuous, as in manner or speech: an oily hypocrite.  6. in an oily manner    GET The Meaning: ~ OILY ~ OLIY ~ OLIY ~ OILY ~ OLIY ~ OILY ~ OLIY ~ OLIY    We Have Had This Product Before ~N~ It Was NEVER This OILY ~ NOT EVEN CLOSE ~ There Was Enough Oil in These Bags ~ That U Could Run A Aircraft Engine For Hours ~ Well ~ U GET What We Mean    We Will NEVER Purchase Any Orville Redenbacher's Popcorn Ever Again
5.0	Nice bold roast! One of my favorite brews from the Tassimo family. If you're not the fence definitely take this one for a spin.
5.0	Red Gold ketchup is a step above the everyday ketchup. It has a tangier taste and is full of great flavors. Flows  out the bottle better than the standard brands.
5.0	this is great coffee!
1.0	The cake was on the dry, crumbly side and there wasn't enough creme filling, like in the past.  Wouldn't buy it again.  It was definitely overpriced!
5.0	I really loved this candy. It is so addictive. My whole family enjoyed each piece and the whole variety is very flavorful.
5.0	Absolutely elated with this product. I was concerned it may be flavorless, but the complete opposite is the case. Do much flavor and easy to make.
5.0	I believe that I submitted a review at the request of amazon a couple of weeks ago... So that in itself is a bit irritating... But as I said before: got the product I ordered and was delivered as estimated... no prob with product.
5.0	hey, try this new flavor. just bought all flavors and i liked them all. I mixed it with vodka (mix 2/3 zico and 1/3 vodka), got drunk, then i drank the rest the next day :) Feel like i saved a bunch of money by buying a cocktail ingredient and a cure at the same time! LOL
5.0	Do some serious reading about Coconut Oil and your health, physical AND mental and you will want some of this item. NUTIVA is possibly the best available & Amazon has a great price & delivery. I like the 2 pack so I don't run out as well as the price.
5.0	Ordered my plant and received my confirmation e-mail as usual. Checked my e-mail again later that night and received an e-mail saying my item had already been shipped. The instructions my Venus flytrap came with were very clear and easy to follow. The plant it self was smaller than I had thought but still in great condition and is very happy on my window seal in full light. Defiantly planning of getting other carnivorous plants!
5.0	Great quick breakfast snack.  Taste pretty good, haven't tried the chocolate.  I don't feel super guilty after eating it since the whole grains make it sound somewhat healthy.
1.0	I bought these from Costco when they no longer carried my favorite gummy snacks and even my kids won't eat them.  They have an awful texture and the taste, well they just taste horribly artifical.  Hated them.
5.0	My husband loves these cookies (biscuits to him he's English) and they are very hard to find here in Fl.  Finding them on Amazon( AND IN THE TINS!) Has been such a treat.  I will be ordering and re-ordering as long as possible.  He is one happy camper.  Me too.  Thanks Amazon.  Once again.
5.0	Use in shakes, pan cakes muffins.
5.0	there's no arguing with the taste of the product as this company has perfected the trifecta of cookout condiments. I like that it's squeezable and in a good size.
5.0	I love your Chai Tea Latte.  It is the only tea I drink.  It has become my special afternoon treat.  Don't ever change it, please.
5.0	Yummy!  And just the perfect amount of sea salt, great alternative to peanut butter
5.0	The product arrived exactly on time, as advertised. It was well packed in ice and in excellent condition. No discoloration, very little blood, easy to prepare. Fantastic flavor and texture! We had some right away and froze the rest and it kept very well for several months. The last dish my wife made was foie with egg and cream. Served with toasted challah and an arugula and mushroom salad it was rich and delicious.
5.0	It's great if you have never had it. It's the hungarian version of Sambal Oolek. the asian chile paste. Salty not over the top spicy but a fantastic compliment to hearty stews, roasts and gravys. Love the stuff.
1.0	I ordered this because Amazon recommended it to go along with the Redenbacker popcorn popper I got from them. Hey, only a few of these actually pop! Most of these small, unpopped kernels get thrown out of the popper. What an absolute waste of money!
5.0	This extract really works well. I used two tablespoons to make a half gallon of excellent eggnog flavored yoghurt. Most extracts (e.g., vanilla) do not work well for this application.
5.0	This delicious fudge is great druing the spring and summer when you crave fruit.  I like to cut this fudge into squares and display it on a candy dish or party tray for house guests to enjoy... Order yours today!
5.0	Wow. Received 7 peppers, all intact, ahead of schedule. I decided Id try my luck and eat one of the smaller peppers whole... Dear god it was excruciating for a half an hour...A whole half gallon of milk is the only thing that helped me survive it. Wouldn't do that again, but as far as cooking with the Carolina Reaper, it imparts a wonderful flavor and a nice kind of heat. added one small pepper to a pot of Cincinatti style chili and it was delicious. also a little bit minced up VERY finely in eggs or rice or anything really. Very happy with the product.
5.0	I love Sun Harvest - they have the best oranges and terrific customer service! Great job on the delivery!
1.0	My daughter really didn't care for the flavor. However, the product definitely was what it advertised. I like the other plum lines.
5.0	Works great as a leave in conditioner for hair, moisturizer for skin (especially in the winter when my hands are dry and cracked)... even tastes great as a substitute for butter in the frying pan!  Much healthier option.  Great product.
5.0	good berry to put on a Beagle it  taste good and is good for you  so Dr. Oz says. this is better than jam or jelly.
5.0	I've used this product for many years, making my mom an Angel Food Cake for her birthday, and again for Mother's Day, topped with this Fluffy White Frosting Mix and shredded coconut flakes.  It's so easy to make, holds up well for over a week, is easy to spread, and according to my mom, is quite delicious.  This frosting has been getting harder and harder to find in recent years, and lately I haven't been able to find it at all in my area, so thank goodness for Amazon sellers.  I have found that even past the expiration date on the box, when kept in the refrigerator, this frosting mix lasts for a very long time and still fluffs up to the volume needed for a large angel food cake.
5.0	This flavor is currently my favorite and apparently a great many other customers' favorite - Local groceries kept selling out of this flavor - ordering from Amazon eliminates being disappointed at store
5.0	Just what I needed; looking for this tea with the berries and not leaves this is a great tea. Thanks
5.0	These are very fresh when they arrive and taste just like they should.  The price was one of the best I have found so far and there were no shipping problems.
5.0	I love this stuff. Its great on most meat/seafood and cooked or raw vegetables. I use Aromat instead of salt for about 75% of the things where I would normally have used salt. Beware that the second ingredient after salt is MSG for those that are MSG sensitive.
5.0	I haven't seen these myself, but I sent them for mother's day, and I'm told they're gorgeous. They were delivered as promised, and my sister (who did get to see them) thought they were much more expensive than they actually were.
5.0	Bought this as a gift to introduce my daughter to it.  Very flavorful and excellent swap for the high calorie/fat peanut butter.,
5.0	Kettle Chips flavors can be hit or miss.  Some of their flavors are terrible.  But this is very simple and delicious.  Probably one of their best flavors.<br /><br />Pros: Thick, crunchy potato chips with light salt that doesn't compromise on taste, eco-friendly business that isn't just giving us lip service<br /><br />Cons: The occasional burnt chip and the bag is a pain to open.  They have a tab that you can pull down but most of the time I end up tearing down the entire side of the bag.  Use scissors instead.
5.0	I am so sad that they are going out of business. I just love Senseo coffee pods and it will be sad when they are all gone.
5.0	I bought this to use in coconut water per Body Ecology recommendation that juices contain too much sugar and adding probiotic culture converts the sugars. I added it and didn't add enough or didn't wait long enough with the juice at room temperature for the fizz to occur, which indicates the probiotic cultured.  I left one coconut water with probiotic out a few days by accident. It developed beautifully and I used it to culture other coconut waters. Once you have a good batch, the culture process is faster than sprinkling the powder into juice. Just add a tablespoon or more of the cultured juice, which fizzes, to other juices or coconut water.
5.0	I love this product works great as a hair mask, skin moisturizer and smell so good
5.0	I purchased this to send to my father for a Christmas gift.  It was beautiful.  The fruit and nuts looked so nice and fresh.  Now I am waiting for his report on how good it all tasted.  I can't rate the taste only the appearance.  I had wished I had ordered two so I could keep one for myself !!
5.0	The contents of the bottle are fine -- tasty, but pleasantly neutral -- and after a second order of this, we got it in the pictured glass bottle.<br /><br />When we first ordered it, the bottle wasn't as nice as the one pictured.  That time, instead of getting one of the bottles that we thought we could clean and use for other things, we instead got one of the typical half-translucent square frosted plastic bottles from the store.  It was the same label, and the same contents, but the bottle itself was a disappointment.<br /><br />But this time, we got both the oil and the lovely bottle too.  I don't know if they bottle both ways, or if the other bottle was just in old packaging, but it's nice to have it either way.
5.0	Excellent Transaction! Fast Delivery! Great Dipping Sauce! We not only use it for dipping but we use it to spice up and top off grilled chicken and pork. Tastes great! Thanks!
5.0	highly recommend as a very clean non-GMO food to eat and store up!! - add some Peak dry milk and coconut sugar and organic raisins and rest assured one will survive cravings for food through the day and in case of a disaster
5.0	These are wonderful tasting drinks, i like to have them on hand for company for a refreshing but not sugary sweet beverage.
5.0	I enjoyed this pasta with a creamy sauce with broccoli. It went well with the sauce, and on it’s own had a good, subtle taste. It was firm but not too chewy.
5.0	Great rich flavor.  Does not taste like decaf.  Good as Tully's French Roast decaf, which does not seem to be available anymore.
5.0	I have always enjoyed Brisling sardines more than other kinds of sardines, but have always purchased them in extra virgin olive oil.  I had previously purchased sardines in water, and was not as satisfied with the taste.  I took a chance on Seasons Brisling Sardines in water, as they were less expensive, have about 100 fewer calories, and more 3-omega Fatty Acids than other brisling sardines packed in olive oil.  I was pleasantly surprised with the superior taste, with just the right amount of salt added, and better nutritional value.  I am switching from my usual King Oscar and Crown Prince brands, packed in olive oil, to Seasons as a result.
5.0	My kids loved each and every one.  The only downside a couple of them are not in English but we still had fun.
5.0	I received a bottle of McCormick Gourmet Thyme compliments of Influenster for reviewing purposes. Right away I added it to a dish that I was making: bacon-wrapped egg white bites with tomatoes (pictured). The thyme, coupled with paprika, gave it a nice and aromatic flavor. I like the packaging and more of these herbs and spices are beautiful when displayed on a rack or a carousel in the kitchen counter. The bottle also dispenses/releases the right amount of thyme, not too little and not too much. This is also GREAT for chicken dishes, especially when combined with other seasonings like rosemary or lemon pepper. In fact, my hands are itching to make a chicken dish with my bottle of thyme right now. I took the FlavorPrint quiz on McCormick's website and thyme is a 96% match for me. It is indeed something that I'll use to flavor many things, from soups, to stews to roast.
5.0	I bought this five pound block or marzipan. I finished it in a week. Being from germany, I am a marzipan fanatic, and I already miss marzipan again. will definitely buy more soon!
5.0	I have trouble finding Bob's wheat bran in my area. Stores seem tohave every other out-there grain product from Bob's, but no wheat bran. So I gave up shopping locally and ordered a four pack from Amazon. The product arrived quickly, the quality was typical of Bob's (excellent), and I was completely satisfied with the transaction. Highly recommended.
5.0	This was a great product for a great price. Very satisfied with the purchase. Good flavor variety in the case.
5.0	It's great , drink a cap full every day. Good for your health
5.0	Rice is one of those things you don't want to buy off the discount rack. The cheap stuff never cooks consistently, and will often be old and impossible to cook to a tasty consistency (not to mention the stray husks). This rice, on the other hand, comes out exactly the same every time - absolutely perfect.<br /><br />It's so flavorful - nutty, sweet, almost toasty. And the texture... it's like no other. Keeps it's shape perfectly, comes out tender and chewy, slightly sticky but also maintains the integrity of each grain. I could eat this rice plain all day. It almost seems like a shame to mix it with anything.<br /><br />I don't use any butter or oil when cooking (the package suggests you do), but I do like to add a pinch of salt to the water. I also like to bring the water to a boil before adding the rice (the package say to add rice and then bring to a boil). I think this is the best way to avoid sticking. The rest I do exactly as recommended: Reduce to simmer for 45 minutes, then remove from heat and let sit for 10 minutes before fluffing.<br /><br />Also note that this rice has a PERFECT texture cold, too. Wonderful for sushi (yes, it's sticky enough) or rice salad! Such a versatile, delicious, high-quality rice. At the grocery store by me, this is $2.30 a per pound. So to have it delivered to my door for even less... just can't go wrong.
5.0	I loved these cookies and so did my kids. You can read my full review here [...] My favorite part was definitely the taste, and I'm not even an oatmeal cookie fan.
5.0	We keep trying different BREW OVER ICE tea products, but we ALWAYS try to keep this one onhand as it is becoming our FAVORITE!
5.0	I make a bowl of McCann's every morning in the little crockpot for my breakfast; add a banana, and it's perfect!!  Try it and you'll never eat 'the other stuff' again!!
5.0	Bought this for my grandmother for her birthday. She was completely obsessed with it. Ha, she loved it! Great, nostalgic and creative present.
5.0	Product arrived as described. Will purchase from this seller again.
5.0	This Variety Pack is perfect to keep around for that morning you need a quick coffee but don't have time to make it.  The variety of flavors is perfect and while it has a slight taste issue (instant, strange creamer taste), it is very nice and smooth and I do enjoy.  Product of Denmark for those that are interested, despite the page saying Made in the USA.
5.0	I love this candy bar. An Australian co-worker brought them in one day and I got hooked. I live in the U.S. so these are hard to find. I was really stoked to find a well priced 24 pack.
5.0	My Pop cannot eat sugar but he deserves great taste. Russel Stover has provided a simple portable treat that can be shared without worry!  I have bought multiple flavors and he likes them all.  He eats two as soon as the package arrives.
5.0	My family loves the taste of Braggs.  I like that it is lower in sodium than even the light soy sauce I was using.  I like that Amazon has improved upon the shipping of this item.  It used to arrive leaking, but this last shipment was wrapped in plastic and made it to my door in one piece.  I highly recommend Braggs...it tastes great!
5.0	Great taste for after workout RTD
5.0	I Have been looking for the perfect popcorn pre-made pouches for a long time. This is by far the best and Discount Tommy is the fastest in shipping the popcorn to me. I can always count on them for freshness, prompt shipping and perfect taste every time.<br />Thank You!
5.0	My grandkids love them
5.0	These are the best Baked  Beans, no brown sugar, or pork, or bacon, or any other add-ons, Beans in  a tomato sauce plain and simple but full of flavour!   Great fibre very healthy, the English style Beans.
1.0	I am big on Dark Roast coffee. My favorites are Folgers Dark Silk and Gevalia Dark Roas Arabica coffee. I wanted to try different dark roasts as well, bad idea! They were mostly disgusting, either too light & watery or tasteless. Stick with what you like!
5.0	This is the best so far. The other &#34;top seller&#34; brand worked, but I find that this one seems to energize me much better.
5.0	Visited a relative in Canada who was using this product and imported it from South Carolina.  Loved it from the start.  Especially good on salads and vegetables. Bought a case since friends and family all seem to like it.  Great flavor and a little goes a long way.
5.0	I love seaweed snacks. Ever since I've started eating them, I can't not have them in the house. I usually have one a day as an afternoon snack with my baby boy (a little over a year old). He loves their crunchy texture and honestly, the kid loves them. They get soft really fast, so he can eat them up easily and he loves how they break apart, too. We split a package, which has roughly 20 sheets of seaweed? Maybe a little less. Either way, I subscribe and save to these and 15% off and then I don't have to scour the one organic foods shelf that my grocery store has only to be disappointed....
1.0	"OK we have this in our office and HATE it. Convient yes...coffee taste good...yes. Volume too little...6oz. I measured it. The main idea is to sell coffee. Must buy coffee from them...no reusable \\""bag\\"" to use with your own coffee. So to get full cup need 2 bags! Twice the cost of any other supplier. Avoid the trap. Too little selection as well. $$$$"
5.0	Warning!  This chocolate is addicting.  It has a taste of caramel and is very good.  As a diabetic, I have only barely nibbled with chocolate since 2009.  I ate an entire bar.  I have to hide these because they are not good for me.  But, they are oh so good!!<br /><br />My plans to have a small bite each day failed miserably.  I never have had much control with chocolate consumption which is why I don't keep any of it in the house unless it is the splenda variety.  If you can control yourself, go for it.  Otherwise, I recommend that you exercise extreme caution.
5.0	Doesn't seem like much to look at dry, but watching that little packet &#34;bloom&#34; in hot water is a delight ... better yet, the taste is excellent.  Low-cal and nourishing, excellent aroma and taste ... what more could you ask for?  Oh yeah ... more locations to buy this wonderful product!!
5.0	Great flavor, boosts the energy and hydration.  This is helping me cut down on the amount of diet Coke that I drink.
5.0	I buy a box of these every month. They have always been good quality and well packaged.
5.0	Makes perfect scones.
5.0	Love this stuff!  Bought it to help fix my digestive issues and use it daily in my onr cup of morning coffee.  If you haven't tried it in coffee yet give it a try.
5.0	I have been using Tiger sauce for about 15 years.  I am fairly certain that I am the number one consumer of the product in the entire world.  I use it mainly for making delicious sandwiches and rice.  I love rice, with some flavor of course.  Tiger Sauce is my secret ingredient for my world famous sandwiches.  Basically the sauce is like hot sauce mixed with worcestershire sauce (another philyodaddy fave) mixed with steak sauce.  It is kind of hot and kind of sweet.  It is delicious and I was thrilled to finally find a bulk deal on amazon as many super markets do not carry it.  STRONG Recommendation.<br /><br />The one question mark is that it is produced by the &quot;Try Me&quot; Brand.  That always weirded me out, I am not sure why.  Try a little harder, &quot;Try me&quot;
5.0	Excellent coffee products from OG if you travel take it with you, that way you always have a superior cup of coffee
1.0	BEWARE  I recieved my box of 25 assorted Nonnie's Biscotti from Amazon . Every single biscotti was broken in 1-3 pieces. I am disgusted completely as these were to be favors of a wedding . I will never buy from this company again.  BEWARE
5.0	Not what I expected but amazing!! Great for making salad dressings. Fantastic flavor and had me fooled. The flavor is full and not watered down. I am very surprised that it is not made of Soy.
1.0	Although the candies are good- to have put the splenda label on the package is fraudulent.  My wife can not tolerate malitol etc but does alright with Splenda. Unfortunately, the candies contain NO splenda but are sweetened with malitol making my wife sick. Beware
1.0	Melita coffee pods are as good and less expensive. Walmart Sells Senseo much cheaper also. They also sell Melita. Thing is when you buy their coffee maker they think you're locked in. Stay in Europe and rip those people off.
5.0	Great breakfast treat.
5.0	love , no sugar options
5.0	He absolutely loved them. He asked where I bought them but I told him that I would not give away my secret.
5.0	No more driving around looking for these in the local grocery stores!  It's the star ingredient in the Hen Sauce that was served on the Cornish Game hens by the Pottery Restaurants in Hawaii back in the 70's.
5.0	I can't seem to get enough of this drink.  I really enjoy drinking it warm and it's great for sore throats
5.0	Fast shipping and good price and the only change from buying them in the tiny boxes is that they are doubly wrapped with paper and some pieces are really hard to get the paper off but other then this, I would buy them again in this bulk way.
5.0	The best coffee I have tasted.
5.0	I am a peanut butter lover. So when I found this product, I was really thrilled. It does have a different taste then real peanut butter, but the taste is really good, and you cannot beat the calories or the fat content i like to add it to my protein shakes. Great taste, with no guilt!
5.0	I have been using Liquid Aminos as a soy sauce and salt replacement since I took on the healthier path about 2 years ago and I love that it tastes so good even though it's on the healthier side.
1.0	Unfortunately this mix gave me the worst intestinal problems I have  experienced in a very long time and I did not overeat the mix.  Tasted good but a couple of hours later I was just ill.
5.0	This is a gum to rave about, it delivers 100% of what it claims, a full, hot, long lasting burst of cinnamon that endures. This is a fine gum, and there is no half measure on the intense flavor. This is now my favorite way to get my cinnamon fix..
5.0	Now I always have food and they don't have much sodium. Not the yummiest thing in the world, but everyone's taste is different, I like to mix this with a bunch of ingredients.
5.0	eat them all the time
5.0	BIG on flavor but the quantity didn't knock me out.  I've had all the vegan jerkies. this one stands out as a gourmet, not slimmy like others.  Packaging is very cute.  I ate it while playing &#34;Ticket to ride&#34; lasted less than 10 minutes.  I ate it all.
5.0	These packets are amazing! I'm currently a college student living in a dorm, so I'm not able to make myself food very often, which makes any food a gift. These are relatively inexpensive and super tasty! :)
5.0	i love this tea, first found it at disneys epcot, an when i found out u had this product, i ordered it an am very pleased it came in a couple day, this is my 2nd order of this tea. an will probably continue to do so as needed. i was always pleased at all past orders the way it was handled .
1.0	I was disappointed with the lack of bergamot in the tea once it's brewed.<br />However, more disappointed when i found out that Target sells these for $5.99 :(
5.0	All chips are tasty...but when vinegar is added chips have an outstanding flavor and are a treat to ones taste buds.
5.0	This is my family's favorite dressing.  The delivery was fast and a lot cheaper than other sites.
5.0	My husband's favourites!
5.0	"This really is the perfect gift that bacon lover that's hard to buy for :)From the box that it came in to all the bacon flavored gifts inside, it's such a nice little package.  We bought it for a \\""dirty Santa\\"" gift exchange, and I'm sure it'll be a hit!"
5.0	We have purchases many different brands of espresso beans for our machine.  This espresso, by far, has them all beat.  It has a great flavor, smooth finish and makes a beautiful crema.  I won't buy anything else.
5.0	I'm a tuna lover from way back.  This is the tops!  If I could afford it I'd buy this exclusively
5.0	The shipping is a little bit steep, but the rice is really good and good for you.  Deep purple color, interesting nutty flavor.
5.0	This coffee has great flavor and true to description<br />You will not be dissatisfied excellent quality! I will continue my subscription for a long time.
5.0	Made lasagna for my father in law over the weekend who has celiac, and this made it perfectly.<br />Would defiantly buy again in the future.
1.0	I bought 3 of these about 8-9 months ago for my Kuerig mini.  They worked perfectly and I was thrilled for 8-9 months (and I was filling my cups to the brim with grounds, I like strong coffee).  All of a sudden I started getting half a cup of coffee with all 3 ekobrew cups I had.  So I would have to add about 1/4 cup more water to the brewer and start the brew cycle again using the same used ekobrew cup in it.  When I did this, it would make my cup of coffee flow over and I would have to have another cup handy to catch the overflow.  After some reading on the internet I came to the conclusion that my machine pump was not strong enough for my ekobrews anymore. So I purchased 3 brand new ones and received a new Kureig mini and Keurig Elite for Christmas. All 3 cups did the same thing with the new brewers.  I also tried filling the cups to the fill line as instructed by the company and my coffee tasted terrible. I don't understand why they worked so well at first and now not at all even with new brewers and new Ekobrews.
5.0	Excellent, great taste.!!!!
5.0	Please never stop selling this item. As a native gaucho this is the only erva to use for chimarrão and it's super hard to find in U.S.
5.0	With English ansestry, I consider myself a tea lover. I always watched my Gran add milk and lemon to her cup of tea. She would ask me to join her in this ritual. The milk and lemon didn't seem to me to be a combination that would work, but they did. At the holidays, Gran would place some spice into a small wire ball and add it to the contents of the tea pot. These cups of tea were my favorites of the year.<br />Enter Holiday Spice Tea, from Harry and David. WOW, the best, most fragrant, most mellow cup ever. Gran, I just know you would enjoy this brand. It evokes warm memories and is the perfect cup to snuggle up with by the fireside. Republic Of Tea/ Harry and David, please keep this in your lineup,and many thanks to Amazon, as well. I looked everywhere to find this brand and you had it in stock.
5.0	Great product at a great price! Would definitely recommend buying this product! In fact I am getting ready to reorder!!
5.0	Great product.  Tastes much better than other coconut oils I have used.
5.0	first had this stuff 15 yrs ago in Costa Rica bumming around. Loved it<br />my family hates it which is totally fine with me
1.0	I've ordered the dark chocolate covered cashews twice and both times I've received chocolate almonds. Both times the package said chocolate cashews but was filled with chocolate almonds.
5.0	smooth as silk. easily blends into any recipe. great on beef or chicken on a grilled stick. great in japanese salad dressing.  yumm
5.0	I was pretty bummed when I had to go on a soy and gluten free diet.  I like eating sushi and making many stir fry type meals.  I got really excited when I found this product.  So far it has delivered what I was looking for.  Like others have said this is a great alternative with a hint of sweetness.  In some ways its better than soy because it is lower in sodium.
5.0	"The two bottles I bought lasted nearly a year, and I have dropped almost 70lbs using this Stevia in addition to moving to a more paleo/primal way of eating. At first it had a very bitter taste, but that was because I was convinced that 1-2 drops in a drink weren't enough - I was using about half a dropper. I only need 1 dropperful for a gallon of \\""sweet\\"" tea. If you use the right amount (very little) you get all the sweetness of sugar and no bitterness. Once you get the measurements right, the only difference is that Stevia sweetened drinks are lighter on the tongue than sugar sweetened (not so syrupy or thick). For those who are experiencing bitterness, I recommend cutting your current measure back until you get rid of the bitterness."
5.0	One of my favorite candies growing up
5.0	Love the full gusto flavor and taste. Order it many times, won't be without in the house.<br />My guest like it as well
5.0	If only! We had these in usa
5.0	We ordered this coffee a few weeks ago and it is delicious. We like it much better than the Supercrema.
5.0	Amazing. Absolutely amazing. I made some black bean burgers and added a few drops, they were just perfect. This is a great product and would definitely buy again.
5.0	On the back of the bag they make the claim that this product is &#34;deliciously addictive&#34;.  They are correct.  You have been warned.
5.0	Love this for the protein value but it does tend to add a green hue to baked goods.
1.0	What a croc!  The picture indicated what i wanted, 8 half gallon sized coconut milks in the red containers.  That is NOT what i received.  I got 8 SMALL 6.5 ounce containers.  This is outrageous.  Don't order.  This price is way too high for what is received!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5.0	Great taste and texture and super healthy. My kids even like it.
5.0	This is just what I was wanting.  The candy is fresh and has the slight mint flavor I was wanting.  Arrived on time and well packaged.  I would highly recommend this seller.
5.0	Simple and tasty--this is my new favorite for ramen!  It's the first time I've seen a vegetarian ramen under the Maruchan label and it's a perfect substitute for the Top Ramen's oriental flavor (which I can no longer find at my local stores).  The mushroom flavor is mild and goes perfectly with random veggies.  I also like to think it has mysteriously medicinal qualities, as it's been my go-to food when I'm sick and nothing else seems appetizing.
5.0	Has zero sugar and I like coconut water with zero sugar. Most of the coconut water out there are loaded with sugar. They may taste good but benefit of coconut water is ruined with sugar. I wish it would cost less.
5.0	I know can eat pasta as often as I want with Dreamfields pasta!!  Amazon has a great price and this qualifies for free shipping so I stocked up!  Pasta doesn't spoil.  Five stars!!
5.0	No-stir is the best Sunbutter they make.  While I prefer crunchier versions, they separate a lot and you can never quite get that consistency back to normal.
5.0	Great product and flavor - Used for a school event Grades Nursery through 8th - Informed that Triscuits are Peanut safe and the children loved them - COuldn't get enough!
5.0	Got a single packet of this chai latte mix...one cup and I was hooked!!  It is fantastic.  I love having the larger package and may look into getting a larger one once the fall weather hits.
5.0	I tried the chocolate chip cookies and they are great! The pancake mix is, as well! I will reorder, definitely.
5.0	Johnnycake is the best
5.0	the eight o'clock original whole bean coffee is my favorite coffee. i use it to drink by itself and to blend with other coffees.
5.0	This is the best of Lindt's dark chocolates. I always keep a store of these for sweet occasions.
5.0	I love Freshen Up cinnamon gum and it was worth buying in bulk! Now I know where I can buy my supply.
5.0	these are so yummy and they taste a little bit like a coolata or iced latte at dunkin, only less sugary and more flavorful
5.0	I have tried other gluten free pancake mix and this for me is by far the best tasting. I think you used to only be able to get it in a six pack which is a lot, but I think you can now by them individually.<br /><br />I add a mix of milk and water, an egg and some vanilla extract. Add slivered almonds and./or fruit such as blueberries, bananas etc- very delicious!!
1.0	Don't know how the coffee is but the packaging was the pits. I canceled immediately when the coffee beans were strewn all over the box. Canned goods, which didn't need it, were CAREFULLY packed......while the cello bag was loose in the box with other items. Split and got all over.<br /><br />Haven't even tried the coffee yet so can't comment on it's quality but in any case, won't be buying it again.
5.0	this stuff is the best tasting dressing {fat free]  really u wont be disappointed
5.0	I drink this brand because I have a problem tolerating acid, and this is the only low acid coffee I can find.  It's usually much more expensive in grocery stores than regular coffee.  I got it cheaper here on Amazon and also got free shipping!  From now on, I'll buy my Folgers Simply Smooth from Amazon.com.
5.0	It's Stevia, there's not much else I can say. It sweetens things. It does a good job sweetening things.
5.0	very good product.. the real thing.
5.0	I really like the light better. It is good in everything. I add it to my protien drink in the morning. The pack of 12 is great and I saved not only money, but free shipping.
5.0	These chips were available for a limited time in stores around Christmas. I bought them and made the chewy chocolate cookie recipe on the back and they came out just like a chewy version of thin mints. If you like mint and you like dark chocolate and you want to make your own chewier, healthier version of Thin Mints then buy these chips.
1.0	I am not impressed by this product at all, it is just powdered sugar and will not make anything taste like kettle corn
1.0	Horrible texture. Disliked to the point of almost gagging. Tofurky used to make a Kent l jerky that was awesome. Been looking for a replacement since they stopped production, this is NOT it.
5.0	Fast shipping, nice flavor, and oat milk is the one milk okayed by Dr Esselstyn in his book How to Prevent and Reverse Heart Disease.
5.0	The taste of this tea is great.  As a hot tea, it has an unusual taste for me, which I will call slightly medicinal, yet still comforting and delicious.  But in iced form I think it's even better - so refreshing.
5.0	Great product and price!
5.0	Simply fabulous!!  Wish they were less costly as I would be buying a lot more......perhaps it is best that they are pricey ;)
5.0	Our go to espresso whole bean for our automatic machine. Beans are dry. Flavor is great. Smooth taste with only a hint of bitterness. Good price point.
5.0	Great rye bread. Very easy to make. I even forgot to add the apple cider vinegar and it was still excellent. Both my husband and I really liked it. We ate some warm. It didn't even taste gluten free.  I will definitely be buying this on a regular basis.<br /><br />I purchased a bread maker at the same time. The bread maker was defective so I made it with the other method. I didn't even use a mixer. I just blended the ingredients by hand - first slowly to blend the ingredients, and then more vigorous for 15 seconds. It was so easy I decided I will just return the bread maker instead of replacing it.
5.0	I disliked all teas, hot or iced, for all of my life. While on vacation in England, my son asked me to take him to High Tea. I decided when in Rome...so I tried a fruity tea, Twinings Cranberry Rasberry specifically. I loved it! I drank it a few times per day for the rest of my trip. I didn't buy any when I returned to the States as I recall seeing several Twinings teas at my local grocery stores. As hard as I looked, the fruity teas are not available in this country. I ordered several cases from the UK via Amazon. I paid hefty shipping and had to be patient waiting for it to get here. I found a great tea store, via Amazon, that routinely imports all Twinings teas. She orders it for me and I only pay US shopping rates. And no long wait. I tried several other of the fruity teas  but to me there is nothing more satisfying than Twinings Cranberry Rasberry. The tartness of the cranberry balances the fruitiness of the Rasberry. It's the best! My friends, colleagues, and patients are hooked as well!
5.0	I am now on my second bag of this Carrington Farms Flax Chia Blend. I have been using either flax, chia, or both in my morning green smoothies for about a year now, and I've tried a couple different products, but this is by far my favorite so far. It saves me the time of mixing both flax and chia together myself from different containers. I just open this bag and pour in as a last step, and it blends right up into nothingness. The price is fair for the amount they give you. I am not sure what the percentage blend is between the two ingredients, but I like the resulting taste so I am happy with it regardless of what it is. Best of all, no need to transfer this to another container for storage. The plastic on the bag is thicker than usual and designed so the bag will easily stand up on it's own, and the &#34;ziploc&#34; type seal on the top of the package feels very substantial and is easy to seal shut repeatedly. I just pour directly out of the bag into my blender jar, seal it up, and it is good to go.
5.0	I used to eat Valentine Hearts from another company and never tried Brachs but they were delicious and I was hooked instantly on them,
5.0	Mixing this in with my veggies and other protein, I do not taste this.  I will buy again.
5.0	These are delicious!  Good Value, too
5.0	My Ty real enjoys the food and the cost is very reasonable.
5.0	these are totally original fun size not that weak store bought garbage that says its still fun size and isn't... don't be fooled
5.0	Very happy with this product, adds zest to all kinds of cheese dishes
5.0	I love this product, I really do, but it is a bit on the pricey side. If you have the money to purchase in bulk do so. BTW the taste is awesome. I have tried every sweetner out there, and this one is the best!
5.0	We love this olive oil. Great flavor.
5.0	Yup, it's a 5! Came fast, taste excellent. I wish it was a little ... ahhem, cheaper. Nevertheless, recommended.
5.0	It came on time xD I'm very satisfied with this order It was waiting for me just outside my door. The packaging was pretty too. Didn't expect that. It's a pretty big bag.
5.0	Deep rich flavor - excellent. I use it anywhere I would use cocoa powder.
5.0	Sesame Rice Thins are the BEST tasting rice crackers I have tried - and I've tried several.  They stay crispy and crunchy and come in several flavors.  You won't be disappointed.  Amazon has the best price, too!
5.0	I've always love pistachios but cannot find them any more at my local store.  It seems as though they only want to carry certain varieties so I'm resorting to Amazon and it has not left me down yet!
1.0	Product came in an open bag.It looked as it some of the product was removed prior to shipping. What a disappointment.
5.0	This is awesome coffee but its rather expensive.  at around 11.00 for 12 oz. its cheaper to buy the k-cups @ BB&B and cut them open at 13.00 for 17oz.
5.0	Taste is exactly as I remember it in the 50s and 60s. Hats off to the people who brought it back. Don't forget to brush your teeth!
5.0	My first daughter didn't like the whole milk so we brought this for up to 24 months.  Now my youngest daughter loves this milk for toddlers.
5.0	OMG! Unbelievably creamy flavored, soft, melt in your mouth goodness !  The second I put this candy in my mouth, I closed my eyes and savored  the moment.  The flavor is so wonderful.  They must use top quality ingredients  making these.  How  and where  can I get more?
5.0	These are great for traveling, hunting camping and stocking up or that bug out time........ Just add water, give it a few min and they taste just like the regular hash browns.
5.0	Extremely Hot Stuff; a little to Spicy for me. If you like burning hot then this is for you. :)    Good product!
5.0	Excellent coffee.  Love the flavor.
5.0	It's a very delicious coffee. If I have brewed left overs I make iced coffee from it.<br />Love it!!Love it!!Love it!!Love it!!
5.0	tasty，like hometown's taste. Will order more.
5.0	I still have not eaten this yet. It is sitting in my drawer, gathering dust. Can't wait to dig in.
5.0	I've always hated powdered milk. Until I tried Nido Full Cream powdered milk. This milk is the best of not only powdered milks. But it's the best milk I've ever had. I use a shaker type Blender Bottle to make it. I try to make it a few hours before I need/want it. I like to give it time to chill. Also I've never had to throw any of this milk away. It has a fresh, creamy taste and is a tiny bit sweet. Really, it's better than any store bought milk.
5.0	I was a little worried it wasn't going to be good, but I will NEVER go back to regular salt. This stuff is very fine salt. Works great and stays on the rim. Tastes super good too! You use less of this than the big honking pieces of clear salt that fall off. Definately would buy again. Makes a great gift item for those Margerita lovers!
5.0	I have been buying PB2 for several years.  Love peanut butter, but not the fat and calories.  Recently it struck me that PB2 was one of the few food items in our home that wasn't organic.  I started searching for an alternative and here it is!  I used to mix peanut butter powder into vanilla Greek yogurt, oh so good, sort of like peanut butter frosting.  I gave up dairy almost a year ago and have found almond yogurt (Amande cultured almond milk) is a reasonable substitute, mix in some Betty Lou's and again, peanut butter frosting.  I have a little bowl of it almost every night.  I have also found this useful in some recipes.  There are a few Thai inspired dishes that are excellent with BL's peanut powder.  Noodles (or No-oodles) with peanut sauce, chopped cucumbers, etc. are very good.  Thank you to Betty Lou for making peanut powder available in an organic version.  It is a bit expensive, but I imagine there are a lot more costs involved in making this organic product.
5.0	For the price this is really good jerky.  Other jerky around this price always seems dry and hard to chew.  This jerky is fairly moist and has a great taste.
5.0	The rice was some of the best rice I have bought, no broken grains and sweet tasting. Thank you. But on the other hand, I found my package in the weeds beside my drive. Being a perishable thank goodness it did not rain. Driver not good with finding addresses or coming to door with delivery. I paid to have it delivered to my door not to have to hunt for it the next day after being delivered.
5.0	Its chocolate and Cranberries!
1.0	Never received it!! Taking forever and have been put of coffee for 2 weeks. So annoying!! I would try and get it somewhere else if possible
5.0	Tastes GREAT on Chicken, Beef and Pork. Grilled or Baked, it doesn't matter. Very good! I highly recommend Pappy's Seasoning
5.0	I have been looking for these for a while and I am so glad I found them. It did take me a long time to eat but you get a ton to it is to be expected.
5.0	I'm not a coffee expert, but this tastes delicious. I use it for both hot and cold brews. The flavor could be described as a rich, but with a hint of natural sweetness. I cold brew most often and it beats any whole-bean, store brands by a wide margin.
5.0	Took a month to arrive but who can beat the price!
5.0	This product is so much better than any other black beans we have cooked that I bought a subscription. A must try!
5.0	The coffee arrived on time. The best part of the shipment was that the end dates on the coffee was staggered! I really appreciated that!
5.0	It's rich and soft even while cold.  That's because it's from cows 100% grassfed year round.  This makes different kids of fat.  For example, it's higher in CLA.  Another thing is this is yellow butter.  This is because of the different genetics of Irish cattle, but also because they are grazing on pastures, grasses and forbs that enable them to make higher levels of beta carotene.<br /><br />Better than Plugra and other butters.
5.0	I have used bistro gravy maker for so many years in Florida and now I lives in Ohio and has been looking for this product and most stores do not sell this until I came across Amazon and found this and placed order and I just loves this, and I will order more of this in the near future.
5.0	Living abroad, it was awesome to be able to get this wee taste of home. Shipped quickly and arrived in good condition. One or two bottles were a little flat, but I expected worse. Will be getting again!
5.0	Brought back memories of being a young boy
5.0	I love this sweetener.  I just add it to whatever coffee I am drinking, and I am in heaven.  The taste is so delicious!
5.0	I liked it.The best sunflower seeds
5.0	Bold, smooth, no after taste.  Expensive.
5.0	Ordering with this seller is a must! I ordered some Valrhona Chocolate and since I live in Florida, I was a little afraid that my chocolate melted by the time it was delivered. Not at all!!! The packaging has a very good protection with ice bags and special paper... So my chocolate was still a little bite cold when I opened it. The Valrhona chocolate is different from all the others since it has a true flavor, not fat, just right, unique... Yes, it's more expensive but if you want to impress, cook with it!
5.0	I found this tea about 8 years ago, and it is now the only type of tea bag I use.  Unfortunately, in my area, there is only one supermarket chain that carries it, and they are frequently sold out of it.  Being able to purchase it from Amazon is a great convenience.
5.0	I stock a drawer for my kid's snacking and these are his current favorite.  If I run out of fresh fruit, they also go in his lunchbox.
5.0	I made this purchase with a bit of caution due to the fact that I'd made a more expensive purchase for Rum Flavored Coffee (different brand, different vendor) a short while back and was highly disappointed:  I'd paid dearly for an extremely poor product that had less taste than Wal-mart great value brand.  Anyway, when I received this pumpkin flavored coffee and opened the bag the aroma immediately told me I had a worthy product.  After brewing a pot the taste told me that indeed I had.  I intend to also try their other flavors.
5.0	"I have used rolaids, tums, pepto bismo and over the counter remedies for digestion problems since the early 1980's.  Then around 1989 a doctor prescribed \\""Prilosec\\"" for me to take two times per day.  I do not like to take medications and when a person becomes older the medications can have a bad effect upon the internal organs.  My best friend has also had digection problems for many years and found this tea and informed me that this is an answer to our prayers.  We both plan to continue using this tea until there is no more or we die (whichever comes first).  If you have any kind of stomach or digestion problems than you owe it to yourself to try this \\""natural tea\\""...Simply AWESOME!!!"
5.0	This is a great item to keep on your pantry shelf.  While I like Spam, I don't HAVE to have it. The reason I bought this was<br />winter was coming, and we sometimes lose electricity.  With no electricity, where we live, that means we can't cook anything.<br />(Our place is all electric, and we do not have a generator at this time.)  These are perfect for a backup in the pantry.  Everyone<br />can make a sandwich from these, and they are even good to take for a lunch.  My husband likes to crumble it into a salad.<br /><br />The price was reasonable, and the fresh date over a year in advance, so very happy with the purchase.
5.0	Nice clean scent. We love our coconut oil and use it for so many things!
1.0	Really puzzled with all the favorable reviews! The coffee I got was nauseating. It had a dry nasty stinky flavor, and was NOT Good at all.
5.0	We have thoroughly enjoyed it.  It is extremely difficult to find in a grocery store.  This makes it so convenient.  Thank you.
5.0	Love my flavor gods happy I decided to give them a shot. Although, they kind of all taste sort of a like. hmmm
1.0	20 out of the 28 coffee bags were expired some of them years old very unhappy. dont waste your time or money...
5.0	This is the best Earl Grey I've ever had. My entire family has switched from Twinnings, and PG Tips to Williamson. I'm very interested now to try their other blends.
5.0	Unlike some of the other reviewers of these, I am not a child. I am a full-grown grey-haired woman, but these do well for either a lunch or dinner. I usually have it with some fruit. *Very* glad I found them!
5.0	We've been enjoying the Ultra Dark Sumatra from Trader Joe's for several years, so I jumped at the opportunity to try a 5-lb bag of these beans.  So smooth, rich, earthy, with no acidic bite - like a finely aged Cabernet, velvety on the tongue.  An excellent buy for anyone who enjoys a deep, dark brew.
5.0	Love my vanilla beans. Now making two batches of vanilla extract. One for me, one as a gift. Thanks!
5.0	Best Hot cocoa ever, good taste combination with the cinnamon (I didn't find it overly done).  Nice to have real chocolate in every cup.
5.0	Best whole grain mix I've found.  Works well with pancakes and waffles.  Less expensive on Amazon then in the store.  Very easy - just add water.  Great for camping.
5.0	Was very pleased with this! I bought it to amp up homemade ginger syrup and it was fantastic. We made a gin cocktail with homemade ginger syrup, cucumber, mint, lime, and a few drops of this - the result was a pitcher of summer goodness with that perfect back of the throat kind of spice. Not a cheap ingredient but worth it.
5.0	I have tried every single neuro and this has the best taste with least calories and little caffeine .<br />Very good cold or warm
5.0	Love these bars they are delicious but expensive in store. They are easy to carry and kind bars are very good for you so definitely would recommend. Healthier choice
5.0	Rich, deep flavor that is always consistant. Holds it's distinctive rich chocolate flavor in everything that you use it for-baking, drinking, mixing with coffee, etc. Try it sweetened, in hot water, no milk.
5.0	Exceptionally Satisfied with this French Raclette. Superb aroma, flavor and texture. A complete delight to the senses. The whole family enjoyed this cheese.
5.0	Using this sugar in my coffee every day makes me feel special.  There's something about choosing one lump or two that puts me in the mind set of tea time in England.  Very refined...for raw sugar.  It tastes great and just has this amazing feel about it.
5.0	"I purchased this when it was Gold Box Deal of the Day, and it arrived in a box, with the 6 bars wrapped up in a plastic bag. One of the outer bars is cracked - doesn't affect the taste, of course. The chocolate is smooth, rich, not too sweet, the sweetness is in between \\""regular\\"" milk chocolate and dark semi-sweet chocolate. Melts wonderfully in the mouth. If it comes without calories, it'll be perfect :) Meanwhile, I think it's worth the extra 1/2 hour on the treadmill.  Ignore the description that talks about chocolate like wine if that puts you off - just know that they truly taste great. And at this price, not too expensive for a little bit of luxury. Except for the diet."
5.0	We've enjoyed this product for years and years.  Nothing compares, especially for salad dressings.  Sweeter than you might expect.  Also -- I've heard it's a good cholesterol lowerer.
5.0	Perfect. Love them. Great taste easy for cooking
5.0	Excellent gum, hard to find in our local stores.
1.0	how long have you had this product, or, where was it stored? STALE is an understatement. I tossed the entire two 10 pac cases. ugh. there is nothing better than FRESH gum.
5.0	These were well worth our time in searching for options.  These are by far the best Matzos we have ever had.  At first we thought the quantity would be too much for just us.  But, we shared with others and still have found that we have eaten two whole boxes ourselves.  So glad to have this option available to us.
5.0	Mystic Chai Hot Tea is Solid Gold.  Before next Winter, I will be getting more !!!!!
5.0	Excellent price for one of my familys favorite candies.
5.0	Bought as a gift and it was perfect and fast shipping
5.0	There is absolutly NO sugar in this. Just water and cranberries. It is very bitter tasting not really sour tasting. If you enjoy dry wines you will probably enjoy this drink. Mixes well with Vodka, too
5.0	I am addicted to this stuff, it tastes great!
5.0	I bought this and another brand at the same time and find this brand is the best.  Both are good if you're not picky about flavor, but I am.  There are dozens of honeys on grocery store shelves and I have no need to spend extra to get some that tastes just the same as common brands.  I like the tupelo flavor because it's not so cloying as some kinds seem to me, but has a slightly less sweet taste.  I haven't been able to find tupelo on store shelves lately and am glad to find it on Amazon, but was surprised at all the choices and decided to compare two.  The Winter Park Tupelo honey tastes like normal clover honey to me.  Its quality is good, but I won't rebuy that brand.  This brand  is cheaper and tastier.
1.0	The box when it arrived looked good bur when I opened it to make some tacos 10 of 12 taco shells were broken. I encountered the same with the other packages I  opened. The best I could do was to make a taco casserole  I wouldn't buy this brand again
5.0	I love how fresh this flour is! I've also used Bob's Red Mill Brown Rice Flour and found this one to be superior. The grind is very fine and I haven't had any of my baked goods come out gritty like they have with Bob's Red Mill. I've used this with the America's Test Kitchens Gluten-Free Baking book and I was able to replace all of the white rice flour in their recipes with this flour. I personally prefer a whole grain flavor and texture so this worked very well for me. I've also used this as a 1:1 replacement for flour in roux with success. If you use this for roux, reduce the butter by half, it doesn't bind with the fat the same way wheat flour does.
5.0	The fondant was excellent. I used it to make tiny leaves as a decoration. It rolled out evenly and held its shape after formed into leaves...tasty, too!
5.0	An ongoing use. Great product for thyroid push.
1.0	My girlfriend received some cheap sandals, hard soap, bath salts and assorted cheap bath junk. NO WHERE near what was advertised or pictured.  Could have done better at the dollar store with 20 bucks.  AVOID AVOID AVOID!!!!
5.0	great deal, and I personally like that they're very thoroughly dried. If I want to shoot for the most aromatic coconut dish I can get, I'll use fresh. If I want a tasty staple for oatmeal, I don't want to buy water.
5.0	Excellent product.  There is no mustard comparable on this side of the Atlantic.
5.0	Best Cappuccino I've had in a long time! Its a great price for how many you get. Love this product!
5.0	I miss bread alot! Paleo Bread is a real lifesaver for me while I do the Paleo diet with my husband. The bread was soft and tasted great. I noticed that it did not crumble like some of other Paleo breads I've tried. I also really appreciate that the Paleo bread is gluten-free because I have a gluten intolerance. Paelo bread opens up a whole world of sandwiches and toast. My last batch has been my breakfast for the past week - I love toast with my eggs! I am so excited to have a great tasting bread back in my life!
5.0	still using teas are ok
5.0	Got it as a gift and was told it was great.
5.0	Kona Coffee.  What can I say?  This is the same brand I drank every day when I lived in Hawaii.
5.0	This is one of my favorite brands of tea.  Good flavor.
5.0	Welcome back, same great taste!
1.0	YUCK....DOUBLE YUCK....
1.0	Like other reviewers, I must agree that this coffee is vile. No other K Cup coffee has tasted this bad. Nothing more than the taste of instant coffee, just like Folgers. Buy some other reputable brand, and avoid wasting your money. It is a real shame that Amazon is selling this. Amazon please stop selling this company's products.
1.0	We ordered this recently and instead of getting a bag like in the photo (marked Teff from Ethiopia) we received an unmarked brown bag. When we used it to make injera the taste and smell were not right and my wife and mother-in-law (both born and raised in Ethiopia) are sure that this is not real teff but some other grain. Even I could taste and smell that this tasted and smelled like no injera that I had ever eaten before.<br /><br />In short, we are sure this is an adulterated product and not real teff - and a waste of $60. Bad! Bad! Bad!
5.0	Great price for a great coffee! It's not easy to find variety of decaf coffee roasts.Convienent and prompt delivery. What's not to like?
1.0	Buc-ee's Beaver Nuggets are awesome! A brown sugar coated puffcorn product, it has the pizzaz of Cracker Jacks without the nuts, the kernels or the toy inside. While in Texas recently, I learned that you can only get this amazing product at their Super Stores.  We purchased a bag in Texas City.  So fresh and crisp, it was an instant hit.  On our way to airport the next morning, we tried to stop by and splurge another $3.99 on a friend to take home to them.  But there was no superstore en route to the airport.  I tried their website, but found that they do not operate a mail order business.  I was happy to find them on Amazon--until they arrived.  No box with a smile, they came in a brown envelope--crushed.  No date on them, they look a bit suspect.  I guess we'll give the opened bag to the friend after all.  Fresher for sure since we've kept it clipped shut and sealed inside a gallon ziplock bag.  Lesson learned: You cannot rely on &#34;Surf Club&#34; to get the real deal!  You gotta pick up those Buc-ee's Nuggets while you are visiting Texas.  Stock up!
5.0	Much better than the ones i have purchased in the local grocery chain. Used in Chicken Chili and Tomatoes and Okra. Could not ask for any better.
5.0	If you love spicy foods and need to clear up your sinuses these hot sauces will do the job. I love hot sauce and these are my favorites. Great packaging and shipping. Will buy again.
5.0	This is the product you need to make a great pasta sauce.  Arrived very quickly great price.  Will order again so nice to find<br />a supplier that will ship to servicemen overseas.
5.0	I've never bought salted cod online before but Amazon had it through Frank & Sal Italian Market so I thought why not try it out.  So glad I did!!  The cod was excellent, really high quality.  The 4lb package came well wrapped and the fillets of cod were nice and big. The package arrived on time.  I'm so impressed with the quality...I will definitely buy from them again.
5.0	this tea is amazing.  it smells really good, it tastes really good, it's really thirstquenching, soothing, and relaxing.  plus there's no caffeine and tons of antioxidants!  woohoo! xD
5.0	best commercial mustard bbq sauce i have found. Excellent on pulled pork!
5.0	Works very well, with one exception that may be a problem with my coffee maker (Mr. Coffee brand). I have to apply quite a bit of pressure to lock the top in place. I usually have to take it out and turn it before it will lock.<br />It's not really a problem with the standard K-cup, but this and other refillable cups have to be positioned in just the right way to close the lid. I think it has to do with the thickness of the top flap.
5.0	I've been eating sardines all my life, from too many different companies...my wife has hated all of them. I received these yesterday and opened a can to see how they were...honestly, the best sardines I've ever had. The kicker: got my wife to try a bite and she loves them, she actually smiled and said she loves them! Never thought that would happen, very happy with these!
5.0	This is the best sparkling water that I have ever had. Used to get it at BJ's but they stopped carrying it. It doesn't seem to be available anywhere in New York State and I can't understand why. It is so good and there are no calories. Great for diabetics and those watching calories. Please keep carrying this product. It's wonderful.
5.0	As a frequent ice cream maker, I end up with a lot of extra egg whites.  My favorite use for these is to make macaroons and this coconut is great for that.  It's tender and sweet.  I ended up subscribing to a box every 6 months because it was cheaper than getting at the store and my family looks forward to a batch of treats every month.
5.0	Better than Dum Dums! The kids love'em!
5.0	Does taste like champagne. Just a little advice: Don't add too much or it will taste bitter.
5.0	I've really been loving this green tea! Definitely the best out of the brands I've tried so far (it also has the deepest shade of green I've seen). It's just amazing, and it's perfect for the price!
5.0	I was very impressed with how tasty this product is. This is a great alternative for those trying to make changes with eating habits without giving up flavor.
5.0	Coffee was great! I highly recommend this product. Better than 'you know who,' that's for sure. Thank you! A rating.
5.0	This Tea is Aromatherapy according to my husband. And I could not agree more. Its soooo good and soothing...best of all u need just 5-6 pearls to steep and these can be steeped upto 3 times. I knew according to ayurveda that sipping on warm water all day increases your metab. What better way than doing it with organic green tea. I just got this and am here to order few more for presents for christmas.  I am in my third trimester of pregnancy and am enjoying every bit of this this...But If you google you would know that green tea hampers folate absorption and is best avoided in the first trimester.  Awesome
5.0	Such a convenient way to get pure stevia.  I use stevia every day and love that this stevia is organic and unadulterated.
1.0	Product is advertised as Spaghetti Sauce and what was received was Pasta Sauce.
5.0	These are great chips, as good as the Sweet Potato and Regular chips.  My link to the review is here:<br /><br /> http://www.amazon.com/review/R3CCSUXG7YJMN9/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00I9I9HRC<br /><br />My only objection to the Salt & Vinegar is they have sugar.  Okay, so potatoes aren't technically paleo...but since I'm mostly paleo, sugar is one of the ingredients I'm very strong to avoid.<br /><br />Other than that, these are perfection!  I eat these when doing a &#34;YOLO&#34;.  :-D
5.0	We used to buy the Swiss Fondue boxes at the local grocery store quite frequently. Now they decided to discontinue them and we found them here on Amazon. Great price for a great product.    Update: Just received our third order for this Fondue. Yes we eat a lot of this stuff:-)    Great taste and nothing else needed. Open up package,cut some bread pieces, heat up the mix and keep warm while eating. We drink tea or white wine with it. Nothing else needed.
5.0	Exactly as promised. Thanks.
5.0	Recently, three friends of mine were joyously reunited after years of animosity stemming from an unfortunate late-night incident involving two pounds of fish and a vespa scooter.  The heartfelt scene was much like what I hoped to orchestrate between myself, this gallon of Tuscan Whole Milk, and my estranged wife, Lillian.  Imagine the look of shock on my face when I discovered that she was lactose intolerant.  Instead of tears of joy, it was the contents of a glass of creamy Tuscan Whole Milk streaming down my face.  Sadly, after ten years of marriage I was still largely unaware of this and her many other needs, be they dietary, physical, or emotional.  How ironic -- the very thing meant to bring us back together, nothing but a cold reminder of the many things which tore us apart.  Thankfully, in the moments after she stormed from the site of our failed reconciliation, I had a supportive jug of Tuscan Whole Milk there to console me.  I can only hope to always have a comforting jug of Tuscan Whole Milk by my side to talk me down from the ledge for years to come.<br /><br />**UPDATE**<br /><br />Over the many trying years which followed the aforementioned incident, I am now ready to openly admit: were it not for this selfless gallon of Tuscan Whole Milk, I would not be here today to recommend what I believe is the single most life-changing dairy product out there.  Through all my ups and down, this warm jug has always been there for me, offering not only physical, but emotional nourishment as well -- be it in the form of images of missing children to remind me that there is always someone less fortunate, or simply helpful nutrition information to reassure me that I am on the right path towards a healthy and productive life of recovery.  Thanks to this jug, I now know that it was not my own shortcomings, but rather Lillian's closed-minded intolerance that destroyed our marriage.  I would like to take this opportunity, here on THE preeminent forum for support and self-betterment, to announce that this gallon of Tuscan Whole Milk has strengthened not only my bones, but my heart as well, and after two years of courtship, we are getting married.  You balance and complete my breakfast, gallon jug of Tuscan Whole Milk, and I wouldn't want it any other way!lf-betterment, to announce that this gallon of Tuscan Whole Milk has strengthened not only my bones, but my heart as well, and after two years of courtship, we are getting married.  You balance and complete my breakfast, gallon jug of Tuscan Whole Milk, and I wouldn't want it any other way! <br />
5.0	Great product and service in delivering it.
5.0	The bags that I recieved were fresh and delicious! I was expecing some average nuts, but was pleasantly suprised. These nuts came on time, and they were just what I wanted.
5.0	Flavorful. Easy to use. Reasonably priced. No refrigeration required.  Good to have on hand for recipe &#34;emergencies.&#34;
5.0	Tastes and smells fantastic. Highly recommend!
5.0	Great fresh product and reasonably priced - thanks!
5.0	"Unlike \\""Maryland Mom's\\"" little one, our kids LOVE these Chocolate Chips. I will admit they are certainly more \\""bitter\\"" than regular Chocolate Chips but you do get used to them & they are certainly better for you with less sugar. (We haven't bought the \\""other\\"" chocolate chips from the grocery store in years.) We use them to put in homemade Mint or Chocolate Chip ice cream. Also one of our favorite cakes is made with these Chocolate chips - absolutely delicious. Worried about them keeping fresh? We store the box in the freezer & just keep a gallon jar of them on the shelf.<br /><br />Great value for a quality product & if you haven't tried Sunspire's White Chocolate Chips yet then you are missing out :)"
5.0	Great for diabetic, low in carbs. and tasty
5.0	I use this at home to make white chocolate mochas. It dissolves completely with no clumps. If you have never used any of this you might want to start with the 3 pound can to make sure it fits your needs although this is the better buy. Also you will need several containers to store it in.
5.0	I love these oats!  Have so missed my morning oatmeal since I became gluten free.  These oats are delicious, have a great texture, and I will reorder soon.
5.0	This honey is absolutelly fenomenal. The only down side to some people - not me - is that it is crystalized. Do not heated as in a boiling pan full of watter as I expect it would loose a bunch of its therapeutic properties.
5.0	I finally ordered some after debating for awhile, I mean it's just ketchup right? How far from reality that was. The spicy is now my go to condiment for everything, it is so much more than just ketchup. I would never put ketchup on a regular sandwich before, but I put the spicy on them now. I actually wouldn't usually put ketchup on a burger I would use bbq sauce instead, now I use Sir Kensington's Spicy Ketchup on them. I've found I use the spicy whenever I'm putting it on something or in something. The classic to me seems better with fries, tots, dipping things like that. I've honestly hardly touched the jar of classic while the spicy jar is almost gone. I like spicy things and so it isn't really very spicy at all to me, but the flavor of it is just awesome. If I had known this is what ketchup was supposed to taste like, I would have ordered it a long time ago.
5.0	I was offered a sample of this matcha powder, and decided to try something new and different. I've recently been having issue with full strength coffee, so when this was offered, I decided to give it a try. I have had it admittedly for about a month without trying it, however decided that today was the day. I made a cup and was pleasantly surprised at the outcome.<br /><br />The good things about this is supposedly this has a TON of antioxidants, which are touted as the &#34;newest and greatest&#34; at cancer fighters. Japan is one of the lowest cancer and highest longevity rates around, so maybe there's something about the diet that's a big positive. I ran into a few almost show-stopping issues with this, but DO NOT let these deter you from trying matcha, because the end product was awesome!<br /><br />To note, I *do* like tea. If you do NOT like tea, you are NOT going to like matcha in it's beverage form. You may be OK with it being in a smoothy or mixed with some baking/foods, but just a little disclaimer - the green tea tastes like green tea.<br /><br />Pro's:<br />Tastes just like normal tea. In fact I would describe the flavor as being downright pleasant! The look and smell are kind of scary, but the actual taste is great!<br />Mixes really well with half and half and splenda - a pre-requisite for my tea drinking. It only changed the flavor mildly, but the end product - again - was kind of awesome!<br /><br />Con's:<br />Even after vigorously stirring, you must continue to stir from time to time because powder *does* settle. If you don't mix it and keep drinking, it *is* gritty<br />When you first mix the powder and water together it looks like Lake Erie algae scum (aka - the look of the tea is accurate with what is depicted in the photo - it looks like a pond with foamy scum on the top of it)<br />If you take a whiff before drinking, the scent is reminiscent of freshly cut grass - to me this was offputting because while I do like a freshly mowed lawn, I do NOT like drinking one.<br /><br />My final assessment is that the CONS ARE OUTWEIGHED BY THE PRO'S BECAUSE THE FLAVOR IS PRETTY DARNED GOOD! If you're interested in getting some matcha, this is definitely a great product to start with!
5.0	These are so good! My husband and I had them on our UK vacation this summer and liked them so much we went looking for them online when we got back. We got two bags and they were shipped quickly and packaged well, too. We will be buying them again!
5.0	I ordered this gum on the grounds thinking it was a flavored sugerless gum- my mistake. people should know the following: this gum is basically Mastic flavored gum. Everyone should know that the packs have SMALL pieces of gum inside each of them; These pieces are basically double the thickness of a Chiclet! Some dislike this gum because they think it tastes like chewed gum(already been chewed) When chewing the gum it is a bit on the strong side to start off but a few chews later is soft. So if ordering, be aware these things. Otherwise, the mastic flavor lasts forever.I guess since this is a calorie free gum that people dont need to worry about sugar or suger substitutes.
5.0	My little one loves the taste and texture.
1.0	Does not have very much flavor.i have tried most of the different colors and pictures and have not got much flavor from them.I had other family try them thinking it was me that didn't taste much but they said they couldn't taste much flavor either.So I have 5 ibs of hard colored sugar.
5.0	I love this product it's sugar free and tastes great!!!.  I wish it was a little less expensive.
5.0	I got hooked on great olive oil years ago from time spent at The Olive Farm in Portland, Oregon. Unfortunately, they closed. I was quite sad, not just because it was a neat place, but where to get my fix? The owner recommended L'estornell organic as a nice alternative, and it certainly is a good oil. Unfortunately, the prices and availability vary quite a bit from time to time on Amazon so I set about finding another option. After many, many, different bottles and samples, California Olive Ranch (Millers Blend) is the first one that I really love as much as L'estornell. The fact that it's domestic with an affordable price is an amazing bonus! Just polished off a couple of bottles and I can't wait to try out the other varieties like Arbequina and Arbosana.
5.0	My son who has multiple food allergies enjoys eating these as a snack and doesn't feel left out when other kids are eating Teddy Grahams or other kids cookies.
5.0	I wish these were not seasonal items. They have a very refreshing taste, are easy to make and I LOVE THEM!
5.0	Love these chips!!!!...arrived on time...wish I could still get them in the store....they were a little pricey so they were eaten a little at a time...
1.0	to over priced. i can get it for 5 bucks
5.0	This was purchased for my wife as a part of her Christmas gift.  She loves the coffee.  Amazon was quick on the shipping, as always.  Cheaper than anywhere else.  Very pleased.
5.0	I love this stuff. I was looking for the steak & chop seasoning that I used to be able to buy but found this instead. It's probably the best marinade I've ever used.
5.0	I was so happy to find this product.  I looked in all of our local stores and could not find it.  It is great in dishes when I use it.
5.0	I am a big jelly bean nut.  My favorite ones are the Startburst jelly beans.<br />They are soft and don't have that hard waxy shell. So Yummmy!
5.0	This was a Christmas gift. I ordered one to give, and one for me....Then my niece came from New York.  I will have to order again just to get a cup for ME.
5.0	Double benefit: great as a topping (for ice cream), and as a healthy snack for the little ones.
5.0	My baby is in love with these puffs. When we bring out the container, he gets so excited! They melt nicely in his mouth, which is good because he sometimes likes to stuff his mouth with a few at a time. Not only are they (to my knowledge the only) organic puffs, but they also have a fraction of the sugar compared to other brands.<br /><br />My baby loves the green, banana, and apple flavors. I've tasted them too (I couldn't resist), and they're not too shabby. After all, I would never feed anything to my baby that I couldn't stand to eat myself.<br /><br />As far as the quantity goes, I was at first wary of buying a 6-pack. However, my baby loves these so much, that we'll definitely use them before he outgrows them or they expire.
5.0	My wife has Celiac and these are the best pancakes/waffles we have had!  Texture is good and so is flavor.  Highly recommended!!
5.0	just as I hoped for.... nothing beats some snails for a great beginning to a great meal... almost gone and will return for another purchase. Thanks Terry
5.0	Nancy Bainter<br /><br />I was introduced to this coffee brand when I stayed with friends in Paris. I loved it in the 80's and try to pick some up each year I visit France. When I noticed I could order it and couldn't make a trip this year, I cheered up and ordered three.  The best!
5.0	i bought this item for my sister. she says she loved it. next time we might order more. thanks. maybe more flavors.
5.0	LOW  CALORIE SATISFYING  SNACK  AND  HIDES  WELL  IN BRIEFCASE  OR PURSE!  SUGGESTION  =  ALWAYS  CARRY MORE THAN ONE SINCE  OTHERS  WILL WANT YOU  TO SHARE!
5.0	lOVE THIS PRODUCT.  I USE IT FOR MUCH OF MY BAKING.  PEOPLE ARE ALWAYS ASKING FOR THE RECIPE BECAUSE THEY LOVE THE FLAVOR.
5.0	Great taste !!<br />They are one of the best sugar free candies Ive had great for you teeth and not at all sticky !!
5.0	"I LOVE this company!!!!! I use a lot of their powdered supplements to add to my toddler son's plain yogurt and I make him \\""superfood smoothies\\"" with several of them added in.  It makes it easy and to flavor up and add extra nutrients to his food.  Since his digestive tract is still not mature I like to feed him liquid things at least a couple times a day so that he is able to absorb more nutrients.  By the way my son is very intelligent, very happy and he never gets sick which I attribute mostly to feeding him healthy :)  These powders taste great and last a long time."
5.0	What more can you say about an organic product like Ezekiel Flour. Basically put, it's not getting the bleachings that your normal &#34;WHITE FLOUR&#34; provides for you.<br /><br />I hate the bleaching because for some reason I can feel trace amounts of it's flavoring (it may be my palette) but I'm all for non-bleach things... (it doesn't even have to be organic)!
5.0	Arrived quickly and tasts great!
5.0	We love these. I bought them as a GF treat for the celiacs in our house but we all fight over them. I could eat the entire box by myself.
5.0	I've found that Celestial Seasonings' Cranberry Apple Zinger and Cinnamon Apple Spice herb teas, mixed together in equal parts and cooled, make an excellent thirst quencher any time of year. No caffeine and it tastes sweet without any sugar. What else is there to say?
5.0	Love almonds as a snack while at work every day.  These have a delicate flavor, nice crunch, and are very healthy!
1.0	I love American chop suey and thought this would be a good option for an easy midweek dinner. However, the sauce was so overpowered with vinegar taste, it was barely edible! White wine vinegar is the 5th ingredient on the jar, but I can't imagine what type of palette this would appeal to. I tried cutting it with water, beef broth, adding brown sugar, and simmering it for longer than needed but to no avail. It was a ruined dinner. Never buying again; do NOT recommend!
5.0	Got these in Warehouse deals and I must say they are awesome...very light and crispy with a distinct taste...some of the best pretzels around..get em on sale..you'll love em!
5.0	This fondant is very yummy! I am in the Caribbean where the weather is hot and humid but I found that the fondant held up well even with added moisture after tinting the antique white version with liquid colouring. It's the perfect fondant to go with buttercream frosting and butter based cakes.
5.0	Perfect! Exactly what I was looking for!!
5.0	This particular formula meets two needs: easy digestability and soy free for the sensitive system.  The baby in question was being ripped up by the strength of full-on milk formula, and struggling with eczema.  I've learned that soy directly and indirectly (breastmilk of a soy latte loving mom) can spur on eczema.  The result of ingesting this formula is fuss-free digestion and clearer skin!  Earth's Best is a go-to for its simplicity of ingredients, consistency, and availability at multiple stores (and online, of course).
5.0	After I was diagnosed with celiac disease, I thought I never would be able to enjoy matzo ball soup again.  Fortunately, I found this wonderful mix on Amazon.  The matzo balls (which are largely made from potato flour)  taste as good as any I have ever eaten. The recipe is easy to make and in a few minutes you're enjoying a favorite again and keeping gluten free.
5.0	I have been drinking this for Years and love the taste
5.0	Thai Kitchen Organic Coconut Milk is one of the items on my auto reorder list. High quality milk, great for soups, curry sauces and more. I like the quality of this product.
5.0	This syrup is delicious, 100% natural and organic, and a great deal, even when compared against Costco or other warehouse stores.  Most importantly, this is Vermont maple syrup, which is required by Vermont law to be produced with a higher level of purity and less water than maple syrup from elsewhere in the US (e.g., New York) or Canada.  Vermont maple syrup is as good as maple syrup gets, and this brand is good Vermont maple syrup.  When comparing this product against other syrups from New York or Canada, keep in mind that you're getting more syrup and less water, since Vermont maple farmers boil it down more to give you a more concentrated flavor.<br /><br />It's worth pointing out that Grade A dark amber is probably your best bet for pancakes, waffles and the like, having more flavor than the lighter Grade A syrups (light amber, fancy), and being a cleaner taste than grade B syrup.  The difference in grades and colors is based on which part of the short maple harvesting season the syrup is gathered in: Grade A dark amber comes in the heart of the season, later than the early-season lighter syrups, and before the trees are really warming up, when the baking-quality Grade B is harvested.
5.0	I use it as a deep conditioner and cannot wait until Trader Joes start selling it again at a cheaper price. It does make your hair soft and add just enough oil especially in cold and dry weather. Make sure to wash it out at least once.
5.0	Nutty and tasty, just a bit hard. Somewhat pricey for quantity. Excellent quality.
5.0	Love, love, love this coffee.  Best I ever tasted.  I do not allow our home to run out -- got to have it!
5.0	This is a hazelnut-almond brittle covered with a thin layer of dark chocolate. <br />Someone brought me a couple of these candies from Italy and I immediately went to the web to see how to get more. <br />The single portion size is just perfect, the individual wrapping is very pretty; even the box is lovely. <br />If you like your sweets very sugary this is not for you.  In spite of the cherub on the box, it's definitely for adult tastes.
5.0	I use for body not cooking... Love the feel after a shower.  Great for shaving girls!  A small amount goes a long way.
5.0	I chose this one since it's a deeper blue than the others I saw on Amazon.  Coincidently, it matches my Le Creuset dutch oven.  Looks great on the counter, and it's the best way to store my chasen.
5.0	My wife and I LOVE this coffee. It is one of our few indulgences. It has a rich, robust flavor without being bitter, and with far less caffeine it is easy on the nerves, too. My favorite part of the day is my first sip of a fresh pot of this aromatic brewed coffee made with freshly ground coffee beans. While it is more expensive than major brands pre-ground packaged coffee blends, it is far less expensive than purchasing premium coffee from Starbucks or Tim Hortons, and it is just as good in our opinion. If you haven't tried it I suggest you order at least one bag to sample it.
5.0	I finally found a flavored water mix I love and now I have trouble finding it.  The grocery stores near me carried the White Grape Crystal Light and now I can't find it at grocery stores.  I've tried other flavors and other brands but have resorted to plain water since I can't find my white grape.  HELP  Please put it back on the grocery store shelves!
5.0	I was most frightened by this product from reviews and found That is not not what people are saying. it is smooth and find it very tasty. This with the combo of the , Kusmi Tea detox works wonders. If your tired of bloated bellies and felling tired and looking tired. I say try these teas and kick the soda habit, I have been off soda for 10 years. only once a month do I indulge in them and it is a 6oz can of DR Pepper and I cant even finish that<br /><br />do your body some good
5.0	I use this product to make a great burrito just like what is made at our local Taco place. I make up the mix according to package directions, but don't add the chicken. I heat up a can of refried beans and then make burritos by putting about 1/4 cup of refried beans, 1/4 cup of the enchilada filling and a tablespoon or two of picante sauce on a flour tortilla and then rolling up burrito style. These have been a big hit every time I have served them.
5.0	This tea is amazing, its aroma is the very best part. I didn't notices this when i bought it but it is a pack of 2! which is even better! i deem it dank
5.0	Tastes &#34;almost&#34; like real raspberries & blackberries.  Haribo has done it again. Great taste and texture. Not too sweet which makes it perfect for the &#34;I just brushed my teeth and now I'm gonna lay in bed and have some candy before I pass out&#34; kind of night. My lips aren't even sugar sealed when I wake up in the morning. I would buy this again.
1.0	The bars are hardened, clearly stale and taste almost chemically (likely from the staleness). The worst part is there is so much to throw out. This is gross. Must be a bad batch or the way they're stored that made them this way. Beware of buying in such quantities if you haven't purchased a particular food product from Amazon before.
5.0	it was a gift & message recvd back was &#34;Love It!&#34;
5.0	this arrived on time and my son was very happy,very good snack food,good to share and trade  !!!! YUM !
5.0	I'm currently pregnant and trying to minimize my caffeine intake, which was quite high prior to the pregnancy!  I have tried a TON of different decafs attempting to find one that was drinkable.  This french roast is not only drinkable but yummy!  I'm definitely going to keep it around even after the pregnancy. It's smooth and full bodied, I honestly can't tell the difference between this and regular (something I never thought I'd say).
5.0	I make truffles, but found these to be of great quality. I would purchase these again, especially if I didn't want to make any. I would recommend these over any others.
5.0	So happy they are finally back in America. These are some of the best M&Ms they have ever made. When I saw the commercial that they were back I had to order them for my Wife. They are her favorite and she had been missing them for many years.
5.0	I normally would not eat truffles because they are too rich, but these just melt in you mouth. They are the best truffles I have ever had.
5.0	I'm trying to eat less animal products and in doing so I'm researching how to make boring vegetable dishes more tasty.  This is great and I'm still learning about Sea Salt.  I've shared this item with some of my co-workers and they are enjoying it also.  Thanks for making this product available.
5.0	The Southern Mills gravy is  a very satisfying gravy for an easy fast topping for either bisquits or hashbrown potatoes.<br /><br />The mix is easy to use and there are never any left overs. It hits the table and it is gone.... everyone seems to love it.
5.0	I really like this product.  I've been using the Celtic Sea Salt in a bag for a few years, and I still use it for cooking.  But I love that I can quickly shake this on a salad or sandwich, or even put it on the table at meal time.  The salt granules are smaller than the ones in the bag of fine salt, and the bottle is very convenient.
5.0	These are delicious  (I bought 6).... I use it where ever it calls for brown sugar and even in place of white ....  I might try it in my coffee ... yes<br />Lots of flavor but stronger flavor that most brown.
1.0	The whole container was crushed when I got it. Box, plastic, cones, wafers, everything. Very disappointing. Especially after paying $11 for expedited shipping.
5.0	Really adds a lot of great flavor to steaks.  We stumbled on the marinade and loved it.  Once we ran out, we couldn't find it again in any stores, so we went to Amazon.  This is our third reorder and I'm sending some to a friend for his birthday!
1.0	It was okay looking for results
5.0	I purchased the decaffeinated coffee & it is delicious. I  will be purchase more in the future
5.0	It is almost impossible to find these bars in stores anywhere, so it is a relief to get them thru Amazon. I will continue to purchase them this way instead of trying to find them elsewhere.
5.0	We used these as rocks for out 8 yr old daughter's Skylander birthday cake. They looked very real....it really made the cake look like a Skylander Adventure scene.
5.0	Happy with product.  I prefer whole leaf but you may want to crush a bit before adding to food.  I would order again.
5.0	My wife's favorite coffee.
5.0	Great seasoning spice. We have been using for over ten years
5.0	delicious and healthy  , i mean  less salt than other .I used to eat this with Annie Chun 's udon noodles .
1.0	Use a reusable filter that you can use every day, with your own favorite coffee.  I can live with consciously create all this recycling or trash.
5.0	The candy jar at the office has never been busier.  A great value for the price and a bit of nostalgia for my co-workers.
5.0	taste so good,my little girl likes it so much.
5.0	The flavor and texture of these biscotti are personal preferences so I will only say that I really like these more than any other manufacturer's biscotti.  But the source and cost of these vary dramatically hence this review.<br /><br />Since our local warehouse store no longer carries the Nonni biscotti in my favorite Originali flavor, I keep trying to find them from other sources.  There are many, but few are any less expensive than my local supermarket, especially if on a promotional sale.  The one exception I've found is this item from Amazon.<br /><br />PROs:<br /><br />1- great packaging<br />2- holds 48, or the equivalent of six 8-packs; but wait, there's more...<br />3- these are the 1.08-oz biscotti size.  All of the others are the 5.56-oz size or about half as large as these, and for similar or higher prices<br />4- best price I've found<br />5- qualifies for Amazon Prime...it just doesn't get much better.<br /><br />CONs: none for me.
5.0	My husband is in love with Tandoori chicken and I bought this to make it at home.  It is a homerun every night I use it, and I experimented with it on beef in the crockpot, CULINARY MASTERPIECE.  Super easy to use, open packet, add yogurt, mix, and cook.  Perfection everytime.
5.0	This candy is delicious and something I remember my grandma having especially during the Christmas Holidays. It is fun to have it and share it with others, enjoying it ourselves.  Wish is were easier to find and have on hand year round. Great seller, rec'd fast.
5.0	This great candy and Black Tie Mercantile did a great job of getting it to me fast;
5.0	I made my first aeropress with this brand of beans last week and I am still going strong! I felt, with each beat of my heart, that my blood was pumping more furious that a 10th grader with no parents home. This stuff works. Do you need to be alert? I bet that that I could drive coast to coast and back without ever having to take a rest.<br />Don't believe me? Try it for yourself. You even get some stickers to show the world you forgot how to sleep
5.0	I'm partial to loose leaf tea.  This is a nice blend.  I sometimes like to put a fresh slice of ginger in it while it steeps.
5.0	The local market stopped selling the Kraft tangy spaghetti and since it is a staple in our cooking we ordered a case of mixes and it is great. We like the tangy mix and use it as a base that we can add meat, tomatoes and mushrooms to. Yum .
5.0	Very tasty chocolate bar! I will definatley order more of these bars in the future. Thank you Milka for the great chocolate!
5.0	I loved this mix!  It had great flavor and the tortilla's were easy to roll out / make even without a tortilla press :)  I would recommend these to anyone who needs to be gluten free.<br /><br />My son (also gluten free) loved these also.  MUCH MUCH BETTER than the store bought ones!
5.0	Add it to iced tea, used it to amp up the flavor in cherry topping for cheesecake and still thinking of delicious ways to use this.
5.0	best tasting popcorn in a bag
5.0	This stuff in amazing.  I am going through two bottles a week.<br /><br />I get it, though, from Uwajimaya locally in Portland (Beaverton) for 2.50$ per bottle.<br /><br />Just get some.
5.0	I like this soda very well, but it's because I like Erythritol as well as Stevia. There's 12 grams (1 Tablespoon) of sugar alcohol in each can. Strange how they don't tout this in the blurb on the side . . . .
5.0	Exactly as expected....great product
5.0	"Can we call these \\""Cheeseless Doodles\\""?  They are delightful, and contain no dairy products, so are perfect for vegans in addition to those for whom they are intended: Jews following the dietary laws, who don't have to worry about consuming them during or adjacent to a meat meal.  I'd never thought I'd find them outside of Israel, except perhaps in a specialty store, but this multipack makes them so reasonable that they will soon be your go-to snack.<br />The only possible problem is the presence of peanut--in some schools peanut products aren't even allowed in the school building."
5.0	Bought these to keep at work and at home so I don't eat chips and pretzels. I love pineapple, but always want to reach for a crunchy snack. These crunchies help to keep me on track and taste great, too. Better price on Amazon that at my local grocery store. I love that these were shipped in a box inside of another box, so they weren't in little tiny pieces. Will be buying more!
5.0	Arrived on time and fresh! The rice has great flavor and works perfectly in my sticky rice basket! A healthy snack that tastes great!
5.0	Wow, I was a jerky fiend before I turned vegan but until Louisville nothing hit the mark. The best!!
5.0	I had never heard of this coffee but I thought I would take a chance.  Order this product. YOu wont be sorry!
1.0	I like the crunchy texture but there is so much garlic flavor it practically burns your mouth.
5.0	revenge is sweet...<br /><br />and nasty!<br /><br />11 1/2 years ago, when I was pregnant with my son, I had issues with my stomach. the slightest thing would set me off and everything I ate would come back up. I didn't have morning sickness, I had 24/7 sickness!!<br /><br />one day, a &#34;friend&#34; of mine, a guy friend, who has never been around a pregnant woman before, decided to be mean t me. he offered me one of those harry potter jelly beans, the one that tasted like fish. when I asked him if it was indeed the fish one, he said it was not. I barely took a bite when my son decided to protest. EVERYTHING came up. violently. for half an hour. just from a tiny taste of it. I was mad...<br /><br />so, fast forward 11 1/2 years later. another friend sent me an ashens review (if you don't know who ashens is, you are missing out on a lot. go to youtube and check out his reviews, wonderful stuff!) of these beans and the idea formed in my mind...<br /><br />see, we all get together to be nerds on Friday nights. I asked that everyone keep quiet about the beans...  very quiet. I bought a box of these at my local store and grabbed one of the fill it your self bags. and left it empty. when I checked out, the cashier gave me a funny look, but when I simply said &#34;revenge&#34; he chuckled. took the little box, put the beans in the bag and went on to my d&d game.<br /><br />I walked in and handed the nag to the &#34;friend&#34; and told him I had spent 3 hours in a cell phone store (which I did) and I was tired of jelly beans. left it at that.<br /><br />2 hours pass. he had set the bag down and forgot about it. we would all glance at the bag every now and then, but we kept our mouths shut...<br /><br />finally!! he ate 1. nothing. 2. nothing. the third one, though, that was the kicker. &#34;something is off with these beans. they aren't the harry potter ones, are they?&#34; nope. I assured him on my mother's grave that they were not. he asked if they were fish. nope.<br /><br />we went on with the game. he ate another one and made a funny face. &#34;i swear that was toothpaste.&#34; we just looked at him  like he was crazy.<br /><br />then one of our friends asked for 1. I glanced at my other friend, concerned if he had spread the word to him. nope... dang! 1 guy was out of the loop, here. other than our &#34;friend&#34;. can't be helped now!!<br /><br />the third one he ate was a nasty one. &#34;yeah, these are nasty!&#34;<br />&#34;see? told you there ws something wrong&#34;<br /><br />2 f my friends stepped up... asked for a bean. one guy got a barf flavored one and the other choked down a rotten egg. both kept their cool, they said the beans were peach and buttered popcorn. our &#34;friend&#34; looked at the doubtfully and bit into a black one... then screamed.<br /><br />&#34;oh my god!! I now know what it's like to lick a skunk's @$$!!&#34; he ran around the small, nerd-packed room trying to get a drink, spitting black jelly bean everywhere.<br /><br />and we laughed.<br /><br />I swear I lost 5 pounds from my stomach area alone from all the laughing I did.<br /><br />it was wonderful! and all because he gave a pregnant woman a fish flavored jelly bean. revenge is done.<br /><br />and just because I couldn't leave my kids out of things, I had another box. put them in a plain ziplock bag. and left them out on the table. I knew just when they got into them without asking from the screams! lol, when my son asked for forgiveness I handed him a black one and told him to eat it. he swallowed it whole.<br /><br />it smelled like a skunk in my house the next day... it came from my son's flatulence.<br /><br />so, I highly recommend these! jelly belly makes it a science to get the flavors just right...
5.0	Buy it, you won't regret it...but wait for amazon to have it in stock, don't pay crazy prices for something that will be back in stock soon.
5.0	Best fondant! It's tastey and very soft and easy to roll out. It did not crumble at all.
5.0	This candy is the perfect combination of chocolate and coffee.  I don't know why it isn't sold throughout the US.
5.0	These are one of my new favorites.  Probably because its nearly half chocolate.
5.0	First off, I love Barilla pasta! I always have. It's a very dependable brand, I always know I am getting great quality pasta when I put Barilla in my cart :) SO when they cam out with their new line of pastas, I can honestly say I was quite excited to try them! I got the Barila Collezione pasta free from one of my BzzAgent campaigns to try out. Free Barilla for me and coupons for the friends/family/anyone who wants to try! I invited a couple people over and got cooking! One of the best things I love about Barilla is how easy getting the pasta to al dente without over cooking. You can trust the time they give you on the box and give or take a couple minutes...perfect pasta! I made a nice light pesto with cherry tomatoes and grated parmesan cheese. YUMMM! I can wait to try the other new types :)
5.0	This licorice is salty and just like back in Europe. This is the way licorice should be.  Fast service and excellent product.
5.0	Just what I expected!
1.0	I know that there are divided camps when it comes to whether or not shipping issues should be part of a product review.  I generally think that shipping is a separate concern, but I'm not so sure after this purchase!  I purchased this product from D.M.E. ONLINE SALES INC (AKA Medical Supply Superstore), but it was shipped by Amazon.  When the package arrived, more than a quarter of it had leaked through both the padded manilla envelope and the box it was shipped in, staining the other item in the box (gloves), as well as the outside of the box that was delivered.  I contacted D.M.E. and they said that it was not their responsability because they didn't handle the shipping.  Which I would agree with, except that there was NOTHING wrong with the packaging; upon closer inspection, the lid of the bottle (beneath the safety seal) hadn't been properly screwed on -something that the company definitely OUGHT to take responsability for!  When I emailed the company to explain this, they never responded. In this case the shipping is very important for the review because losing nearly a third of the product before you get it makes this a VERY expensive product!  Better to buy at the local store for a few dollars more -it will still be cheaper!
1.0	the description said oil of bergamot well there was very little actual bergamot oil in the bottles it was all other fillers, couldn't even taste the bergamot. threw them out
5.0	Love this coffee.  Stores never stocked this flavor because there are so many flavors and so little shelf space.  Was on auto delivery for this product and suddenly the auto delivery stopped.  Checked and found it unavailable?  Yep.  Unavailable.  So I checked another page on Amazon and tried to order.  Order worked. Couldn't select shipping method I wanted.  But coffee arrived anyway.  This item discontinued?  Or not?
5.0	awesome bean sprouts!
5.0	i became addicted to this butter almond i finish it in a week or less it taste yummmmmmmmmm yummmmmm this is my third jar and i will order more before i run out of it .
5.0	Great price for a great product. Nice pick me ups before going out or going to the gym.
5.0	I tried these when I was asking a friend what she eats when she needs chocolate.  She introduced me to these.  1 package = 2 Weight Watcher points.  I love these and they do the trick.  Since they work for me, I am willing to pay the extra price for a small package.  If they rise up in price, then I will not buy.  They are delicious, already packaged and arrived fast.  Buying them again.
5.0	Thank you for my clip and my order.<br /><br />Fog Chaser will be a favorite for life!
5.0	Excellent service from Britain, and excellent price on this popular de-car tea.
5.0	these have always been a staple in our pantry...
5.0	The kit is great for a beginner it has all the basic items needed for making a sushi.
5.0	Our family's favorite crackers! Amazing.
5.0	my kids eat a ton of, I always shop around for the best price on large boxes on gummies. great
5.0	Three things to keep in mind:<br />  - Everything in here is fairly sweet. 'Bitters' is a historical term, but these are really not very bitter. For instance, Regan's Orange Bitters are a much more bitter orange flavor (like concentrated peel) than the orange here.<br />  - If you limit yourself to just alcoholic drinks you're cheating yourself. I have a Sodastream, and adding these 'bitters' to the carbonated water tastes fantastic.<br />  - You're not saving a lot on this. At current price, $100/12 = $8.33 per bottle. But if you get the free shipping suddenly it's reasonable. And having the selection is fairly liberating.<br /><br />Once you have the set of 12 it's time to figure out what to do with them. Your flavors are:<br />  - Fruit: Peach, Lemon, Grapefruit, Cherry, Rhubarb, Cranberry, Orange. Yes, technically rhubarb isn't a fruit.<br />  - Other: Mint, Plum, Old Fashioned, Celery, Aztec Chocolate.<br /><br />The fruit flavors speak for themselves. If you can't think of a hundred things to do with these (at a minimum, fuzzy navel, or gin + flavor + tonic water) you shouldn't be ordering this in the first place. Imagine concentrated flavor + sweet and you know what you're getting.<br /><br />The others are more interesting. The mint bitters contribute greatly to a mojito. Celery works fantastic with tomato juice or bloody mary mix. The plum is very cinnamony, and the Old Fashioned is like the plum but with extra heavy spices.<br /><br />The Aztec Chocolate Bitters are fairly disgusting on their own, but when paired with a good spiced rum like The Kraken are quite amazing, and though I haven't tried it yet I imagine they'd work well with a mole' sauce.<br /><br />So to summarize - you can't do anything with these on their own, but that would be like drinking the output of a duck press. You are buying a set of 12 flavor enhancers, and this set is great for that. And you only need a few shakes, so each bottle will last for years.
5.0	Local supermarket stopped carrying this brand. They only could suggest looking on line. Found it here for a greater price, but can't get it anywhere else. We tried other brands, but were just very disappointed. Bought five bags at once to get free shipping, and we go through a bag in about 2 to 3 weeks. Will definitely reorder. Never thought I was a coffee snob and probably am not. Have tried grinding beans myself, but can't get it to compare with this all Columbian brand. The company used to be owned by Tetley Tea of Boston, but now seems to be owned by a company out of Texas. Quality has stayed the same, however. Yes, it is pricier than other name brands though less so than others, but worth it for us.
5.0	Great product. Nothing wrong with packaging or taste. Will buy this again.
5.0	Love these black Jellybeans. always fresh
5.0	as a Vegetarian/Vegen I have been looking for good nutrition plus good tasting alternative granolas, this is it.  Better priced than buying at WF.
5.0	I use this for lube, deodorant, flyaways, and for my dry elbows. it works pretty great.<br /><br />I haven't actually used it in food.
5.0	I use this for making my own home made metal clay, which I mix with bronze or copper powder (1 part binder, 3 parts metal). It works perfectly as a binder and has lasted me a long time.
5.0	wife likes it I don't drink coffee
5.0	At these prices, I saved over $1.50 a box.  Getting 6 boxes at a time, that's quite a chunk! Reasonable turnaround time.
5.0	This coffee is some of the best coffee I have tried this year. Normally I don't drink coffee because I like to keep my teeth very clean. During finals week in college studying is so difficult for me but once I have this coffee in my system I can study for hours and I passed my finals during my first semester in college because of it. However I have to use two scoopsbecause
5.0	This is, by far, our favorite K-Cup flavor! My husband and I love it. Amazon has the best deal on these. We always keep them in stock.
5.0	Very delicious.....much tastier than a regular pretzel!
5.0	I've read that consuming 6 - 10 grams of xylitol each day for about 5 weeks has been shown to eliminate harmful bacteria in our mouths.  It's best to eat small amounts after meals & snacks.  Too much can lead to cramps & diarrhea.  It is dangerous for dogs so please keep away from pets!  I like the natural ingredients listed in these mints.  I do agree with others that it does quickly dissolve but I don't mind because my intention is to consume the xylitol with the added benefits of natural mint which is also good for you.  Important to do so after meals in order to help neutralize the ph in your mouth.  I had a hard time finding mints like these at my local stores so I'm glad to have found these on Amazon.  I will continue to purchase them for future use.  I also use the &#34;Now&#34; xylitol in powder form and use 1/2 tsp in my coffee in the a.m. and 1/2 tsp in tea later in the day as well.
5.0	all you need is water and presto in stead of carrying Gatorade you mix it with water and saves a lot of weight I don't get the mix right but it does what I need it to do when I'm sweating I take two I have a 40 oz canteen just as good if not better then having a quart in my back pack
5.0	This stuff I found at my sister's place. I tried it and loved it. It made me think of raisin branne [sic] with yogurt. Why don't those guys make that? Or berry bran? Or banana bran? Diversify Brainiacs!<br /><br />Be very very careful. Don't ignore the verbiage on the front that says it has lots of fiber. I am a dude. I don't know or care what the hell that gibberish is supposed to mean.<br /><br />But I learned if you do 2-3 bowls of this awesome tasting stuff, it better be your day off of work. Or else you WILL be racing home from work for the duration of the whole day.<br /><br />It shoots the plumbing with a quickness. Recall or google Pope of Greenwich Village. When Paulie slips the cop a Mickie.<br /><br />I love the flavor and the healthy parts, but I only do 1, that is ONE bowl each day or couple days MAX.<br /><br />Be Smart.
1.0	The flowers were not even close to what was expected!  Nothing like the picture, barely like the description.  There were only two colors of lillies.  The vase was plain, clear glass, again not like picture.  I just feel that I was expecting a little more and feel a little mislead. I would not recommend ordering.
5.0	This product was purchased for my Brother to try out this Taster's Choice French Roast. He reported that this coffee was great and he really liked the taste and aroma.
5.0	Super yummy!! All peanut butter taste.... Hardly any fat!! It only takes a little to make a huge flavor difference
5.0	Remember having this as a kid. Glad I found it on here.I will buy this again, but most likely more then 1
5.0	Nestle's Nesquik chocolate syrup beats Hershey Syrup hands down because it's made with real sugar instead of high fructose corn syrup. Even better, it doesn't need to be refrigerated after opening it.<br /><br />This syrup is delicious and you can't go wrong buying it.
5.0	I have been looking for organic K-cups for awhile now.  I am so glad I found these!  The taste is very smooth, not too strong like many other K-cups.
1.0	Description: &#34;Organic Baby Food - Stage 2 - Chick-Chick-Chicken Casserole With Vegetables And Rice 6-Pack by Ella's Kitchen 6 x 4.5 oz Box.&#34;<br /><br />What I received: A single pouch. ONE. Not a box of 6.<br /><br />Completely unacceptable.
5.0	Safe source and well recommended!
5.0	I am not a coffee drinker but really like this cider.
5.0	"These are \\""It\\"" when you are searching for the most delectable chocolate confection ever!  I can't even describe the taste to give this candy justice!  I have made candy and know good stuff when I taste it.  This is exceptional candy! Worth every bit of the price.  Arrived promptly and well packaged. These would make a fabulous gift for anyone. My daughter still talks about them as one of her all-time favorite chocolate candies. Just Good!!"
5.0	Amazing! Just how I remember them, great size
5.0	What a great find.  I used to buy this in a small Michigan town when I visited. Great aroma and flavor.  I like the larger canister.
5.0	I am not a tea user, but I decide to give this a try. I suffer from a very bad insomnia and after dealing with  the side effects of my prescription medication (Ambien), I wanted a natural way to deal with my problem. I tried several remedies like valerian root pills, but nothing work. This tea really surprise me! Never thought it could work this good. I fall asleep fast and I wake up refreshed. Plus it taste good. I really enjoy it with honey, vanilla extract and Truvia. Usually I hate the taste of tea no matter what I add on it. This is Tea is the exception.  Im thinking on trying other tea varieties of this brand.
5.0	Very good. Family is addicted to them. We finish a pack of 12 in about a week. It also arrives on time and is very fresh. The snow peas are not broken into pieces.
5.0	While visiting family out-of-state we were introduced to this remarkable glaze.  It has become our favorite.  Just a drizzle on cheese, grilled poultry, desserts, caprese salad, you name it, this stuff is remarkable; our family favorite.  Definitely a five star topping to keep in the kitchen.
5.0	Cardamom arrived very fast.  The quality was much better than from the Indian market I usually purchase from and more reasonable.    I like the way it is packaged and appreciate that the cardamom in non-irradiated.  I will in the future purchase only from Frontier.
5.0	It is a very good tea mix -------It is sweet the way it is --------the best tea mix i ever used  ------- i drink it  noon & nite  :)
5.0	Gevalia is so good and the Vanilla Latte is excellent! Everything worked out great with the product and my order, I would definitely recommend.
5.0	These are so much fun!  I already have the glass teapot so I'm able to use them the way they should - &#34;blooming&#34; so you can see them.  The flavor is great. Makes a cup of tea special.
5.0	Unfortunately these liquorice altoids are very hard to find in stores....thank you for continuing making this flavor. Just wish I could buy them in a smaller quantity
5.0	Big fan of this water
5.0	Seemed to work great!
5.0	Great finish for our special dishes!
5.0	I love salted pecans and these are perfect. Fresh, tender and lightly salted. They are large and do not have too many broken pieces.  I had tried another brand and found them too oily and too salty.  If you find these pecans are not salty enough for you, add additional salt.
5.0	It arrived earlier than estimated time of arrival. It looks exactly as what's in the picture and qualiy is great!
1.0	7:25pm.  Wednesday evening before Thanksgiving.  I just made 6 pumpkin pies for Thanksgiving.  I cut into one.  Full of grit.  So, tried another.  Full of grit.  I had written to Libby's last year, and I did not hear back.  Forgot about it until taking my first bite today.  Hopefully, HyVee does not get their store brand from Libby's, because I am headed there to get some grit-free pumpkin and start making pies all over.  Will not buy Libby's again.
5.0	Love love seaweed!  Especially the seasoned ones.  I can eat them like potato chips.  These convenient little packages are awesome.  With a slight teriyaki flavor, it's a healthy alternative to junk food. I am definitely going to order more!
5.0	Used this expresso while living in Italy for 13 years. This is without a doubt the best and the most creamy expresso.
5.0	Great chilled. Good price.  The asian market sells them for 94 cents each (89 + 5 deposit).  Amazon is selling them for a dollar each (in cases of 24) at time of this review.  Wow, saves me a trip to the asian market!  Do not buy unless you plan to get addicted to them like me!
5.0	Item just as described fast shipping. Will shop again.
5.0	I'm done with the rest of the sub-standard pickles. I found the Dern Hots about a year ago and I have not eaten another brand since. Absolutely, hands down best pickle out there.... Great flavor, perfect level of heat.
5.0	I love this gum, and can only find it on Amazon now. I love that this gum uses real sugar and no artificial sweeteners.
1.0	We were talking about candies that were around when we were children and Fizzies were mentioned. I use to love Rootbeer flavored Fizzies when I was a kid. I couldn't get them out of my mind. I checked on Amazon to see if they were still being made and to my surprise they were available. I bought a 6 pack. When they arrived, I was ready to enjoy my first Fizzie in 40 years, but discovered I hated the taste  of them. I remember them being sweet and tasting good without having to add anything. These were not good tasting to me. I gave a pack to a friend and she disliked them too. I threw the rest away. Sorry makers of Fizzies, who ever you are, you should have kept the orginal formula. What a disappointment!
5.0	I had just read about this product and had to try it.  Good flavor, not too sweet, and high energy.  I'm just getting ready to open the last 4 pack.
5.0	Amazingly delicious !!
5.0	When I first received my order it was not correct.  I wrote to the Adams Family Farm and explained the problem.  In two days they sent me the correct order in addition to the incorrect one!  Very professional way to handle things and their homemade maple walnut fudge is the BEST I've ever had!  I will be a repeat customer.
5.0	Just a few drops to a teaspoon in sauces and gravies. You won't taste it, but you will know when it's missing.
5.0	These are sooo good.  I just eat them right out of the can, but if you mash them up with a little mayo and green onion or chives and make a sandwich, I'm sure it would be great too.  If you like sardines, you'll like these too.  Couldn't find them in my local grocery stores anymore and was thrilled when I found them here!
5.0	Excellent value and quality.  I use this for baking and to flavor our regular brand of coffee.  For coffee, it adds unique flavor without adding unnecessary sugar or artificial sugar.
5.0	Our eggs dyed wonderfully according to the package directions for these veggie dyes. I loved the educational aspect of showing my little one how putting the egg into two different dye pots produced a color that was a mix of the two. The instructions were clear and concise and the end result was a set of some spectacular eggs in several rich shades!
5.0	I use this coconut water as the base for my green and fruit smoothies. I've also started mixing it (1:1) with orange juice for a nice creamsicle-ish morning drink.
5.0	These are absolutely mouth watering! If you like pecan pie you will love these. This is the best part of the pie!
5.0	Ouzo flavored candies that I first tasted in a  restaurant in Canada. Loved them immediately, could;t find them anywhere else but here on amazon.  If you like the taste of ouzo you'll love these.
5.0	There was only one broken lollipop. They taste great and are the perfect size for the purpose.
5.0	I tried because I needed extra fiber in my diet, so my expectations were not high.  I am so glad I did buy the brownies because they taste so good! Can't wait to try the other Fiber Gourmet products!
5.0	I love this!<br />It's all I drink now. This might be due to the lovely design of the label and logo. Or maybe its the jolt I get from the stuff. I use this with my french press and get amazing results. I no longer frequent DD or Starbucks.<br />It looks great and tastes great.
5.0	After searching all over town, decided to try Amazon. Have always been happy with this bread mix brand, do not know why grocery stores do not carry it anymore.
5.0	I love the bottled ito en tea, but it gets really expensive....so I bought this and add 1 tsp to a bottle of spring water, shake and I have ito-en green tea to carry with me.<br /><br />It took quite a while to arrive but it was worth the wait  (of course I'm spoiled by Prime...so waiting is becoming foreign to me!)
1.0	Not fresh - pretty tough candy to chew.
5.0	Can't beat a good cup of coffee (or two) in the morning
5.0	YUM!  That's all I have to say about this Matcha tea powder.  But, it is VERY expensive for only 1 oz.  I will look for a better price elsewhere.
1.0	The pickles were not good at all. They had no juice and shards of broken glass. Beware, the pickles were inedible.
1.0	why did ruin this gum?, it is like they cut the flavor in half, taste sugar free, never buy again!! save your money
1.0	Love it, tell me when there is a sale.
5.0	I love these mini-bars. All the varieties are so good. They are gluten free so don't bother my stomach. I have reordered several times thru Amazon. Can't find the mini size in any store. I'm going to introduce my grandkids to them this summer. DJD
5.0	This product is getting harder and harder to find at my local grocer and the price was getting ridulous, so when I saw the price from this seller, I simply stockpiled for a year or so.  It works for me. It is my one indulgence and cheaper that running to the Starbucks!!  :)
5.0	I tried putting these in my smoothie, first just a couple but now I put in a dozen beans.  It gives me a good energy boost that lasts a long time.  I like that it has iron, protein and fiber as well.  Of course it doesn't hurt to think there is chocolate in my smoothie!
5.0	Great mix, just a bit of salt to go with the yumminess!
5.0	This is great. I used the dough stage of the bread maker and then finished by hand in the oven. I put into two smaller loaf pans. Wonderful with cream cheese. I have ordered more; excellent flavor!
1.0	This description as well as the label on the product packages said &#34;12 pack&#34;.  Very disappointed and annoyed when there were only 4 in each package.
5.0	Beautiful!  Mom loves them!
5.0	We love these biscuits!  I love all the 123Gluten Free products.  I will be a regular customer from now on!
5.0	Fresh and fast delivery (ordered Friday delivered Tuesday).
5.0	just what I was looking for
5.0	My son wanted Southern Fried chicken, collards and buttermilk biscuits for his birthday. I learned from various food blogs that White Lily was &#34;IT&#34; when it came to buttermilk biscuits. And do you know what? They were right! White Lily makes fantastic biscuits and we will be forever spoiled.<br />Here in California, we have to go online to get these southern delicacies. It's great to use the best ingredients no matter where you live in the US. Since I rarely cook this way, it's worth the added expense once in a while.
5.0	This mix is GREAT!!  It makes the best gluten-free chocolate chip cookies we've tried!
5.0	I love the taste of French vanilla in the quick stops. This is just like it. Price is great and it comes in the mail so I don't have to buy it at the stores. I have at least one every morning and sometimes in the evening.
5.0	Very happy with item and service!
5.0	I love them, love them and love them.  I used to purchase them at the store but when I couldn't find them this year I looked online.  To my delight there they were and at a lower price than I could find at the store.  The black tea is my favorite.  If I am feeling generous this year, someone might even find them in their Christmas stockings, as long as I know I can get more.
5.0	I like this brand because so smooth and absorbs quickly. This is my third time to use this brand
5.0	though its not from Japan ,but i like the flavor of this green tea powder, it taste even better than the green tea frappchino from starbucks. it has the strong green tea flavor , and u just need to add some milk or soymilk and u get the best drink ever
5.0	The green peppercorns arrived on time and in excellent condition, fresh and fragrant.  I have used them in my favorite recipe and my family and I are very pleased with the taste the peppercorns gave my dish.  Thank you for this great product.
1.0	I've tasted, sampled, and rather enjoy most jerky out there. I've enjoyed homemade Moose and Bear jerky. Deer Jerky.  All kinds....so I thought I'd try this.  It has the texture of wood. Lacks moisture,  flavor, and turns to tiny wet crumbs in your mouth from your own saliva.  Expires next year....but I think it died a long long time ago. It didn't cost that much. ..so, I threw the lot in the trash.  I almost gagged to death on the dried out crumbs of prehistoric fish.  Never again.  Never again. Ptooey.
5.0	We are always out of milk and I liked that these did not have to be kept cold and I would have milk available for cooking when the family drank all the regular milk.  I was out of milk one day and decided to try this milk with some cereal.  I could not tell it was not my normal regular milk.  Now I'm still out of milk because my entire family loves them and they are in a ready to go package.  I highly recommend this milk.
5.0	I was so happy that this type of cheerios was available once again thru subscribe & save.  I got these once before and they went off the list. Making purchases thru this program is awesome, it saves me time and gas.  Multi-grain cheerios are #1 in my family.
5.0	Very enjoyable.  My granddaughter switched and now only eats these.
5.0	I've ordered this coffee several times and am always pleased with the quality and taste.  It usually only takes 3 or 4 days to receive, and I'm always eagerly waiting!
5.0	Love these. I really love Vanilla Lattes from Starbucks and these, while they don't taste the same, are a great alternative.
1.0	I have tried a few of Bear Creek's products and enjoyed them so I thought trying their chili was worth a shot.  In my opinion it is bland to start.  I know it says salt and season to taste but I would think it would at least had some taste to begin with.  Nope.  I added hamburger, didn't really help alot...then added some tomatoes and salt...that helped abit.  All in all it is bland, grainy, and has the consistency of soup more than what I would like a chili to be.  At least I can say I tried it....but I won't waste my money again !
5.0	Mugwort was fresh. Great smell and great tasting tea!<br /><br />The stems were minimal.
5.0	It's a good price and super convenient to have it delivered to my front door.  Would order again.
5.0	I LOVE this balsamic glaze!!!!!  Shared with others who loved it as well.
5.0	The cookies and creme bars are delicious!  They satisfy your taste and are not heavy or too sweet.  I highly recommend these!
5.0	Good price fast shipping
5.0	Love this product. It's real lemon, delicious, and a large size. Of course, this is normally $5.99 or less from Sams club, but when I don't have time to run to the store, I order from here, which happens to be frequently.
5.0	I love raw almond butter.  This is outstanding whether I use it as a dip for apple slices, or on a sandwich of sprouted cinnamon raisin toast and orange marmalade, or on a spoon!
5.0	There are an awful lot of recipes for chili. Many winning recipes from the International Chili Society use Gebhardt's as a base. In my kitchen, it is an excellent start to a good bowl of red. I have used this chili mix several times and always end up with good chili.<br /><br />This mix supplies no thickener, no salt, and no heat. These you must add yourself, which is a good thing; you can really customize to your liking. This my preference per pound of meat: 1 tablespoon of Gebhardt's, pinch each of salt and cayenne and cumin seed and mexican oregano, 1 clove garlic, 1 bay leaf, 1 teaspoon tomato paste, and no thickener.<br /><br />I have always enjoyed chili made with this mix, and highly recommend it as a standard ingredient on your shelf. A fabulous way to prepare a whole pot of meat for those summer events.
5.0	all great, I was happy with the item and what I paid for it. No regrets. I would recommend to others.6
5.0	Because of the negative reviews, I thought I should add my opinion. First, I bought one of these at Wal-Mart. When I realized that it really did make two whole lunches for me, I couldn't wait to buy more. My average daily calorie intake is 1,700 so these fit well in my eating plan. First, the chili is great. I do NOT like hot (spicy) food. The beans retained their firmness, the chicken was moist and edible. I can't say enough good things about the taste of this chili.<br /><br />As for sodium, that doesn't matter to me so I don't care. I can say it has less sodium than the comparable [[ASIN:B0029TECEA Microwavable Chicken Corn Chowder]] (740mg to 840mg per serving). But here's the most important part to me:<br /><br />Total Fat 2g<br />Dietary Fiber 7g<br />Protein 15g<br />Potassium 590mg<br />Iron 10%<br />Calories 190<br />Total Carb. 27g<br /><br />Who knew low-fat could taste so good!! And the fiber! Protein! Potassium! Iron!<br /><br />Also, I warmed this up on the stove, not in the microwave - but that's my preference.
5.0	These were very tasty, soft, and had a great peppermint flavor  I couldn't stop eating them.  The only thing that would make me like them more would be if they were organic.  They didn't have any high fructose corn sugar, though, which I liked.
5.0	very good purchase for me.  If I buy a big container of juice it never gets finish and I end up throwing it out.  This is saving me money and wasted product.
5.0	Best soup mix there is!  (Do add ground beef  to the Minestrone for a little extra.) My husband would eat it every day if I made it. Also love the Cheddar Broccoli! Yum! So very easy to make and tastes great!
5.0	What can I say. You either know this and will agree that it is absolutely delicious. Crisps not chips! It's a British thing.  I can't stop eating Walkers Cheese & Onion!!
5.0	I love good coffee and HealthWise is great.  I look forward to getting out of bed each morning so I can have my first cup...and then the second...      It is low in acid - that means no heartburn, no sour stomach, no acid reflux, and no queasy feeling if you drink a few extra cups.   There is no bitter or harsh taste; it's smooth and rich.      Hazelnut is my favorite morning blend, but I also love the decaf flavors.  It is clear why HealthWise is exceptional and outstanding.  I've been drinking Healthwise for over a year now; restaurant coffee just doesn't cut it.  I even take it with me on vacations.
5.0	HARIBO BLACK LICORICE WHEELS    i was born in Germany where we eat HARIBO Licorice/Gummi Candy the way we eat Popcorn in the US.  Once you start eating, you just cannot stop.    The licorice wheels are just the REAL THING and have been around in Europe forever - around 100 years.  Quality and taste ... through and through. Many licorice/gummi producers have been trying to imitate HARIBO... but no other brand comes even close!!!  The wheels are chewy with a medium licorice flavor....not too sweet and not too salty.  Besides that, you can have fun with them by peeling them apart into many different strings.     And to find HARIBO at Amazon.com is just as wonderful - the price cannot be beat.     You  do not pay taxes, no shipping charges and then delivery directly to your place . . . what a bargain!     Keep those wonderful HARIBO products coming, Amazon.     Your grateful customer.
5.0	Great stuff.  Easy to make and a nice meal(s) every month or so.  Great to share with friends.
5.0	While the coconut patties were exactly what I wanted, I have since found out that they are outrageously overpriced!!!  I paid $14.00 per box and I have found them at Boscov's for $7.00 a box and, on sale, for $5.00 per box.  My suggestion, go to Boscov's.  Save your money.
5.0	Amish Country Lady Finger popcorn is not hull free but we had to search to find any!  This product arrived quickly and well packaged.  It is crisp with a mild flavor everyone seemed to enjoy. Anyone with dentures will appreciate this product, I should think.
5.0	I am totally in love with these packets of yummy goodness.  They are delicious hot or cold, and I love that I just need to add water.  The flavor is perfect, and does not require cream or sugar to taste good.  However, I usually add a little cream.  Most recently, I discovered that I can make a Chocolate Mocha protein diet shake by adding 1/2 a packet to my Chocolate Slimfast shake in the morning.  I was carrying around 2 different travel mugs, 1 with slimfast and 1 with coffee, and now I just need one.  The taste is fan-freakin-tastic!  I just wish these were available on Subscribe & Save.... :)
5.0	We just ate a couple of bags of these peanuts and found them to be fresh and very good. The only issue I have is the price. Seems to me like approximately 75 cents per bag is a little on the high side. The local drug store runs these 2 for $1 sometimes, thus getting the delivered to your house without having to go to the grocery or drug store is a great convenience.
5.0	I love dark chocolate and this is soooo darn awesome..a must have.i add a little milk for creaminess ..yummy good.
5.0	I was so HAPPY to find these on your web site. I have eaten Chocolate Necco Wafers for what seems like forever,  but I have not been able to find them in any retail store in a very long time .  Thank you for having them in your inventory.  I would recommend them to everyone.,
5.0	My husband and I first had these crackers in Florida.  I couldn't find them at any store so, as is usual, I checked Amazon and wala--there they were.  They are wonderful with most dips, cheeses and utterly outstanding with humus.  Ordering is simple on line and well, they are now a staple in our house, thanks to Amazon!
5.0	"My husband isn't a big coffee drinker but loves \\""gas station\\"" cappuccino.  He says these taste even better than what he's used to.  Will definately by again!!"
5.0	I am very happy with the variety in the package. a couple of repeats but really looking forward to using them.
5.0	I love this oil, and I love having it delivered automatically every 2 months!  The flavor is yummy, we use it in everything from homemade bread to dressings for salads, dipping for bread, frying eggs, everything!  Amazon.com has the best deal for Zoe's Organic oil anywhere, as it does on all of the products I use for my family.
5.0	i love coconut water.  Vita-Coco, Zico, One, nirvana, amy & brians, goya unsweetned (The ones where they add sugar are gross).  I've even become pretty good at opening fresh ones.  With that being said, fresh is the best but if i had to go pre-packaged, C2O is by far the best.
5.0	URAsian suppliers are the absolutely BEST!!! I received six bags of 6.6 pounds each of tapioca bubbles and not only were they packed carefully, they are absolutely wonderful in texture and quality!  Lighting fast shipping, but I did pay for the three day shipping, and they arrived the VERY NEXT DAY!!! These folks are the best as are their products and I will be ordering from them again and again!!!
5.0	If your dog is a bit finicky, add a few drops of this on top of the dry food. One pouch will last a week.
5.0	After my gastric bypass it was stressed to me that I must pay attention to my nutrition to avoid anemia.  This product was recommended, and I have used it consistently for the past two years.  My blood tests have resulted in &#34;normal&#34; and above readings every time.  I feel better than I have in years. The chewable tablets are a bit large, but I am not expecting candy.  The citrus taste does not linger.
5.0	My favorite cappuccino
5.0	This coffee has changed my life. No jitters, health benefits, less allergies, more energy, and I sleep like a baby.
5.0	I have been looking for this large size spice for a long time. Used to get it at Sam,s but quit my membership. This arrived before I even thought to look for it being shipped.
5.0	Can't stop eating them!!!!!
5.0	Tried so hard over the Holidays to find this in pure dark chocolate like I'd had before but couldn't find it so got this one since anything by Harry London is great. My granddaughters were delighted.
1.0	The description and packaging leads one to believe this is whole leaf tea. It is crush up mess with stems - probably what is in the tea bags, creating a muddy mess when brewed. I will never buy from this company again.
1.0	Do not taste good to me. I must not be a fan of Wisconsin cheese
5.0	For this who love dark roast coffee and can't seem to find the right K cup brand, you should try Coffee People Black Tiger. Really great flavor and just the right amount of bite that a dark roast coffee should be.
5.0	Bucket arrived sealed and in good shape. I love this banana taffy and this is my third bucket. I used to pick out the banana ones when giving out mixed laffy taffy at Halloween, but once I discovered I could order buckets of banana, I on't pick out some. :)
5.0	Tastes great. Vegan. Low fat.    I love trace of raisins and walnuts slivers. Wonderful blend of spices and curry.     Very filling and satisfying. Super easy to make.    Also tastes great on top of brown rice, potatoes, and/or vegetables.    Great for low-fat curry and rice lovers out there. Another home-run by Dr. McDougall.     Thanks again, great product.
1.0	I bought this tea for the health benefits but couldn't stand the taste.  I couldn't drink it.  Had to give it away and won't buy it again.
5.0	Ingredients are all natural-- I only wish they'd sell these in bigger portions and a little cheaper. Delicious! Did not disappoint.
5.0	This is very good if you like unsweetened green tea. Very smooth. Recommended.
5.0	I bought this primarily as an ingredient for a creamy cleanser I was making, this coupled with oatmeal makes a great exfoliator. It also tastes delicious in coffee or standalone.
5.0	Ever since I bought my Keurig, it's been difficult to find k-cup coffees that taste really good. But Trader Joe's k-cup coffee are absolutely perfect. It makes a strong cup of medium blend (in fact I have to put more creamer in the cup than I usually would, but that's a good thing in my book) and the taste is very pleasant. I bought their k-cups when I was visiting a city that had a Trader Joe's. And now that I'm back home, I like the stuff enough that I will definitely regularly buy it here off of amazon.
5.0	Our Grandson is Support Special Forces Airborne I buy this for him.  He loves them.  I will buy more and have them sent to him.. Thanks for making it easy. Are Service Men and Women need some great snacks also.  Tyler Scott loves Cheetos Hot ones......
5.0	This tea tastes wonderful. shipped and delivered quickly. If you love an intense and yet spicy flavor this is the tea to order.  I let my steep longer since I like an intense flavor. Even liked it cold and iced.
5.0	the most epic 10-pound sugar bag I have ever opened.
5.0	Convenient good taste and it is a very nice way for me to start the day off right and happy
5.0	I used to purchase this one box at a time from a local gourmet food store.  I swear that hands down these are the best cone coffee filters because while the paper is &#34;thin&#34; as some people have mentioned in other comments, they remain very sturdy after use - mainly due to the &#34;waved&#34; double seam on the bottom and one side of the filter.  I've tried both Starbucks and Melitta cone filters which most often rip or burst when removed from the basket/ceramic coffee dripper after use.  Not with these filters.  I wasn't aware until recently that If You Care makes a small but mighty cache of other kitchen/household items.  I look forward to trying those products and I hope that those items are just as great as these coffee filters.
5.0	If you're not making your pea soup from scratch and you need a quick pea soup fix the Progresso soup is the next best thing.
5.0	Excellent product! Not available here in New Mexico so was glad to find them.
5.0	The. Best. Salt. Ever. Glad this product is sold on Amazon. We bought our first batch from a grocer at Aigues Mortes in late November 2013. I'm hooked. Will purchase more when I run out.
5.0	Opening this package of bay leaves was pure pleasure.  I'm a serious cook, and these are, hands down, the most lovely, high quality, bay leaves I've ever purchased.  The packaging ensures that the leaves are protected during transport.  Each leaf is perfection.  All in all, I'm incredibly impressed with this product.
5.0	I enjoy using this product, this is by far the best applesauce I have ever eaten. My friend and husband love it too. I will always buy this brand, there is no comparison. Its delicious. I've had all of the flavors, my favorite one is the Cinnamon and the plain. Will buy again and again.
5.0	I'm totally satisfied with this product. For the airheads that have complaints regarding this product, you need to use common sense and doctor up the oatmeal to your taste. I suggest using vanilla flavored soy milk in place of water. I personally add a pinch of cinnamon and a half teaspoon of sugar before microwaving.
5.0	The ONE and ONLY coffee syrup!  All others are impostors!
1.0	I ordered a plant in a i Gallon Pot, I received a 3/4 dead plant in a 6&#34; pot. A fertilizer was supposed to be included but not found. The plant has completely died. What a waste of money!!!
5.0	Love this drink. I drink it everyday and it helps gain/maintain weight and taste great. Also is good for people who can not eat much but I use it with meals to help gain weight.
5.0	Perfect with cheese or humus! THis crackers are tasty, crunchy! Gluten free is great if you have or friends have issues.
5.0	These sprinkles were great for my son's John Deere birthday.  I ordered the green and yellow and sprinkled half of the white cupcakes yellow and the other half green.  They were a hit and the sprinkles added a nice texture and sweetness.  We had a ton left over so we're still making John Deere sundaes. :)
5.0	It took me awhile to try these - I figured why not just use Clorox and water? But I must admit these work great! I send them to my kids school as apart of their supply list and I also buy them for my home. They smell great and does the job well. Just whip one out and wipe down kitchen counters and tables, door knobs and bathroom sinks and fixtures. This is a great value and they last a long time.
5.0	Amazing fig spread! Goes great w. Brie ! I use w. Baked brie recipe and it rungs out amazingly delicious!
5.0	"I USE IT ON EVERYTHING! Glad to be able to still get it. It is not available in my area of the United States! I have even given it as a \\""gift\\"" but, be sure that the person can eat MSG before you give or serve it to them."
5.0	Received product on time as promised in excellent condition.  Product is a delight to use in my gourmet dishes; adds a whole new level of flavor.
5.0	this stuff is great for cookies, it even makes good sugar free sugar (splenda) cookies, just whatever the recipe calls for must add less/slowly to prevent dry cookies.
5.0	I had this at a party first<br />I loved the light not so sugary<br />flavor and I like that it doesn't give you a sugar hi<br />that you come crashing down later!
5.0	What can I say? Boston Baked Beans are King amongst candy! I know I'm being partial, but they are incredibly great!
5.0	Great blend of Blue Mountain coffee for the best price I've found!
5.0	My grandmother introduce Mrs. Cubbison's cornbread stuffing mix to me years ago and I have used it every year.  I tried making my own cornbread stuffing one year, and never again!<br /><br />I wish the company could create a gluten-free cornbread stuffing mix as I have several members of our family who now cannot tolerate any gluten in their daily diet.<br /><br />Any chance of this?<br /><br />Shirley Collns
5.0	Yum, and a good price.
5.0	I have given and received Harry &David gift packages. My mother loves pears and Harry & David pears are delicious and have always been perfectly ripe and pristine  when received. I gave her this gift package as well as the assorted truffles which were to die for. I &#34;helped&#34; my mother sample each flavor. I highly recommend Harry & David products.
5.0	This is the BEST k-cup flavor I have tried.  The taste is so rich but so smooth.  Its the MOST INCREDIBLE COFFEE period.  I am so in love with lavazza k-cups! I have tried lavazza coffee in Italy and its actually EVEN BETTER IN THIS LITTLE K CUPS! you just have to try this. I got this to try from bzzagent and I am so happy I was introduced to this flavor!
5.0	Love the small size bottles, easy to take any place you need them.  Same great Tabasco taste of course.  Price is a little high, can find them cheaper at World Market.
5.0	Great sweetener! I really enjoy this product! It does not have a bitter aftertaste, a little goes a long way, it blends well with hot and cold items, and great price! I have tried other brands and have come back to this brand three times now. I think I found the my go to stevia :)
5.0	These crispy critters are my favorite go-to when I need something to munch - it is<br />nice to have a variety of densities and flavors...they satisfy alone or with salsa or<br />hummus or avacado or dips....I'm on vacation and there should be some on my<br />doorstep when I get home - I really look forward to that!  I buy them both online<br />and at a Supermarket near my hometown.
5.0	I like the Werthers original hard candy but I really like the caramel filled! The caramel flavor is there but not the texture that pulls out your fillings. I had a hard time finding the caramel filled so I tried Amazon. Of course they had it so I ordered a box. I highly recommend this candy. It really hits the spot after a meal; or any other time.
5.0	I  needed this for a birthday party. Fast shipping . Love the floss.it works great and was at a great price.
5.0	I purchased these yesterday from my local grocer. Not from Amazon. I had read the reviews but found them locally. Anyhow, I and 1 of my 3 children are gluten intolerant. As I am mom and we eat what we are served, my hubby and other 2 children eat gluten free all the time and rarely complain of the gluten free foods.  I thought that everyone would enjoy them. Anyhow, I purchased the cinnamon, glazed and chocolate glaze.  Oh my, my children and my husband could not tolerate the glazed and chocolate glazed. The glaze is great, the donut was very dry. Also, the donuts are very dense like cake donuts. I did take a test bite of these and yes-crazy dry.  However, we were pleasantly surprised by the cinnamon.  Beautiful donut.  Not dry. Texture and taste of a stellar piece of coffee cake.  I will purchase the cinnamon again and again.  Don't waste your money on the glazed or chocolate (I literally had to feed the rest of these to my chickens-what a waste, especially since they are over $1 per donut).  Purchase the cinnamon. They are great.
5.0	Excellent selection of Lavazza coffees.
5.0	Love the combination of whole wheat cracker and not just plain, but dark chocolate. Great for chocolate lovers who want to eat healthy.
5.0	Grrat price and great product. Drinking this is tastier than vitamins! Enjoy and pick this up. Just ask about expiration date!
5.0	"I was eating some Spam, baby lima's and German potato salad. All of out my orange roughy, I thirsted for something unique. I thought about Elvis, and then of my days back in dubya dubya two. I dropped an awful lotta bombs on em. When The Japs bombed the Harbor, I thought \\""Satan has had his way today!\\"" Now the King and I are gettin older, yeah he's still alive. I sang a duet of Amazing Grace with him, day before yesterday morning. Now how bout them apples! Now I had myself a cup of your fine diary product, and its like a miracle elixir! - Major Bill Smith - Ret."
5.0	I have searched high and low for this Jack Daniel's coffee, and as typical, I found it on Amazon!  I am a die-hard Starbucks fan, but for home brewed coffee, this is the best!  I received my order on time and feel it was a great deal. I am making my second order soon!
5.0	I love it. I use it when I make homemade iced tea. I don't need to use sugar the syrup makes it sweet enough
5.0	Love this coffee and so glad we can purchase it on Amazon.
5.0	I enjoy my Chai Rooibos tea with a dollop of milk.  It is flavorful without bitterness or caffiene so you can enjoy it any time.
5.0	The Stevita brand of flavored drinks is really good!  They have refresing flavors and no calories!  They are even good to mix to make a fruit combo!  Wish these were offered in bulk!!!  I really like the idea that I have reduced my sugar intake drastically since discovering these flavored drink mixes.
5.0	Great product to mix with white rice flour and millet flour to make a gluten free substitute
1.0	Nasty stuff.  Tastes bitter and a bit like dirt.  I couldn't give this stuff away.  I took it work right after I bought it and its still there.  That was 2 years ago.  I did finally learn less is better.  This never got better though.
1.0	It never worked for me. It was cheap and I got it fast. They told me I could send it back, but I didn't want to waste my time, I assumed the new one wouldn't work either.
1.0	I thought I have bought these before in stores and liked them. I was wrong. Very hard, crunchy croutons with a slightly odd flavor I can't put my finger on it. They don't look anything like they do in the package's pictures either.
5.0	yum! This is very great. I like the Thai peanut and teriyaki better though. Also the spicy isn't spicy sadly, but it's a really good source of protein for a meal!
5.0	Love these bars, and I am not even gluten free.  I got them for a friend who is gluten free and ended up ordering more for myself.  They are perfect for breakfast when I'm running out the door or even when I don't have time to grab lunch (especially so I don't get the after-lunch crash at work). They keep me full longer than the other bars do but have all of the great ingredients.  Would highly recommend the Gluten Free Bars!
5.0	We drink a lot of coffee and this is the best value I have found, including costco! I just signed up for the monthly subscription, as the price is so good and I found myself ordering on a regular basis.  I really appreciate the packaging of the pods being mostly biodegradable and every variety of coffee we have tried has been good.
5.0	FREAKING RIDICULOUS COFFEE. SO GOOD. Can't go back to Folgers drip after this  :(
5.0	Great product and fast delivery! Highly recommended for other oversea people...
1.0	this product did not have all the items it claim to have. Not happy with this purchase. No variety of items it was someones left over stuff. no chocolate at all in the package.
5.0	Awesome product!! I love it
5.0	This is a pantry staple at our home. Some times we would randomly crave for mac n cheese and it's nice to have some tasty, instant boxed treat ready to be devoured!!!
5.0	Excellent. Nutty, full flavor, perfect.
5.0	Unbelievably Delicious- and impossible to resist once you try them! Thankyou Amazon for carrying these, as they're hard to find in my area!
5.0	We love these k-cups because they are local to us, lowest waste, and the best price. Subscribe and save keeps our weekday coffee routine going!
5.0	I'm not a general fan of Hershey's but this cocoa is well worth the money if you like dark chocolate. The price is the same as my local grocery and with Prime it is a few finger flicks away. I would recommend it.
5.0	This recipe comes with the option of using yogurt instead of milk or cream.  As a lactose intolerant person, I can use yogurt instead of cream and am very happy with the results from this mix.
5.0	"I bought these for the last day of school last year for \\""my\\"" kids (6,7 and 8th graders) and they totally loved them! The blue raspberry and mystery flavors were the most popular, so probably this year I will buy a box of each of those if possible. The texture is different than I remember as a kid though, but makes for a cheap, fun treat!"
5.0	I haven't used Rose's Lime Juice in drinks, but I absolutely LOVE it in oriental dishes.  The easiest is adding a splash to [[ASIN:B000E123IM Annie Chun's Udon Soup Noodle Bowl, 5.3-Ounce Bowls (Pack of 6)]].  Of course, Annie Chun's isn't the only product to which I add this lime juice.  Rose's Lime Juice tastes great on everything it touches!
5.0	Since I got myself a bread maker, I use yeast regularly.  The supermarket jar type is just so expensive consider the volume sold.  After reading other's comment, I just fill saf instant yeast into the jar from my previous supermarket-brought yeast and put the remaining in the freezer for future use.  The unopen pouches/bricks can be store anywhere in the kitchen.
5.0	This spread was really good with granny smith apples it is so delicious I continue to buy it at my local jewel.
1.0	1lb. Value Size $22.86  2 lb. $26.99<br />I've been a Tim Horton's fan for years, but the 1lb value size price is ridiculous. The 2 lb price is much better but still not worth it. Tim Horton's is not a $13.50/lb coffee. I'm finished.
5.0	These cashews are terrific.  We like non-gmo raw organic eats and the cashews were everything we expected!  I am ready to re-order!
5.0	exactly as described, arrived on time, excellent price.
5.0	Very good coffee and a great price. If you love dark roast, you won't be disappointed by this brand.
5.0	I really like it:) i dont know where people got the pepper taste from but with splash of half and half and a a teaspoon or two of sugar it taste a lot like the caramel iced coffee from mcdonalds, to give you an idea of the flavor. Not strong but definitely delicious in my opinion
5.0	These are naturally good, and I keep some out at all times in a shiny bowl--this keeps the sweet hungries in line very nicely, because they have so much flavor.  Well worth the investment.  Thank you.
1.0	Very very mild on its own. You need to use this essence with the sakura paste for it will work its wonders.<br />Why do you need this when the paste can do the job?<br /><br />Sakura paste and honey are way better. Don't waste money on this!
5.0	I loved everything in here except for the peas. They are gross, in my opinion. The chocolates were my favorite.
1.0	"This is the most terrible \\""bread\\"" I've ever tried it doesn't even feel like bread it feels like a sponge. Honestly I couldn't even swallow it. Even with large amounts of butter it still tasted terrible please don't buy this."
5.0	Love my raw nori... usually you can only find toasted nori, at the stores... but I needed raw to make dehydrated crackers and was not able to find them anywhere except amazon. Quality and price was good, will buy again.
5.0	I bought this for my wife with her new expresso machine so she could try and make her favourite Starbucks Cafe Mocha. This product makes a superior cafe mocha. She sticks it into the microwave for 15 seconds and it pours easily into the measuring spoon and into the drink. We find it very rich and flavorful. We highly recommend this syrup for your cafe mochas. I'm so glad I didn't notice it was a pack of 6. The first would have been gone way to fast!
5.0	We love this seasoning, we use it on just about everything
5.0	This tea tastes good, not as strong or spicy as some chai teas I am used to, but still good.  It has done nothing for my weight; my kids and I drink it occasionally for constipation.  It's great for that, although we do have some mild cramping from the senna, which is to be expected.  It's not a big deal.  I found a box of this at Home Goods, and have been keeping it in the cabinet ever since.  The tea bags are not individually wrapped.  There are 20 per box and the ingredients are:  nutmeg, ginger, cardamom, saffron, senna, cinnamon and allspice.  There is no caffeine in this tea, I like to drink it before bed.
5.0	Back East this is a well known brand.  Out West the price of split peas has soared, and this was a huge bargain.
5.0	Great taste, shipped fast, packed in original boxes.
5.0	These onions are Mildly sour, as apposed to pickled,  and are large, and crunchy. The Perfect enhancement for a dry martini.
5.0	I work night shift, so an energy boost is a necessity to get me through the last few hours.  This one tastes the best to me, and I got everyone at work drinking them.  It has very little sugar, and doesn't make you 'jittery'.  It just tastes good, and works well.
5.0	but that's what happens when you buy in bulk.  The nuts came in two large plastic bags containing smaller bags inside.  But these were purchased for eating and nothing else, so I was delighted with the quality of the nuts themselves.  A great product at a great price!
5.0	So far have enjoyed this variety pack.  Found some ones that I enjoyed--when I did not think I would.
5.0	They are beautiful and it is a really large arrangement!
1.0	I was looking for some nice salted caramels for my wife on Valentine's day. These looked promising; but they end up tasting pretty much like the Kraft caramels sold in bulk at the local grocery store. Definitely not worth the cost.
5.0	Works great with my ice tea maker!
5.0	Good stuff for your money  get it every 3 month program
5.0	Very happy with these scrubbies.  I cut them in half (I have small hands) and they work great!!
5.0	Is exactly what i paid for. I am using this for skin purposes
5.0	I recently purchased a newer Keurig and found out that I could no longer use some of my k-cups, until I found these. Wow, these little stickers really do work! They are very easy to use, simply place the sticker in the 9 o'clock position on the top of the k-cup. I would definitely buy again, but doubt I will ever need to as these stickers can be used over and over again! Great idea, great product!
5.0	This tastes soooooo good!
5.0	"One of the problems with being on a low carb diet is lack of \\""crunch\\"".  This is the product that helps.  The small package is also useful to stop overindulgence.  This will be a staple in my house."
5.0	$10.00 for four boxes great deal, does anyone really pay $29.00 for four boxes?
1.0	I do not think the seeds are sterile because I followed all planting directions  and put into planters. It has been quite a while since I started them but none have come up or sprouted out. I have planted other seeds at the same time and they have come up but the seeds I ordered did nothing. I feel that I wasted my money. I do not recommend to anyone.
5.0	I was happy to find these trail mix bars available for purchase by the case, as my husband loves these!  Sometimes they aren't available in my local grocery store or warehouse club.  Pricing was good also, and I enjoy the convenience of signing up for regular recurring delivery.
5.0	I had this on vacation when I was there.  Now I am addicted to it!
5.0	"I picked up a pack of these on a whim at a convenience store (at over twice the price per unit as is available here), and I really enjoyed them. You can eat them a handful at a time and then reseal the bag. They're harder than normal due to the roasting method, not soft and slightly chewy like most normal peanuts. Even dry roasted crumble and such rather than giving it more like a \\""crunch\\"" (though I don't know if that's really the right term to describe it). It gives a pleasant bite and good resistance. It sounds silly, maybe, but it's true. I'd suggest you go ahead and try them out. They've become my favorite peanut option."
1.0	Almond Breeze milk is great! I love the vanilla flavor and the chocolate flavor - but this unsweetened choclate flavor tastes horrible. It's nothing like chocolate. Nothing. The only thing that resembles chocolate is the brown color. The taste is bitter. It's like drinking brown water that leaves a powdery bitter aftertaste. At first I thought I made a mistake by not shaking it up. I admit that I neglected to do this. But after shaking it up immediately after, viciously, it tasted no better. I even let it sit in the fridge for two days more. I tried it each day, shaking it like a madman, but it never tasted any better. I recommend other Almond Breeze products, but stay away from this one.
5.0	Safe size snack for two
5.0	Absolutely my most favorite of McDougall's meals.
5.0	This is a tea you have to like in order to drink it.  It is not like ordinary tea.  I happen to enjoy drinking this type of tea.
5.0	Fantastic beer, easy to follow instructions
1.0	It didn't smell of citrus at all, in fact had a very unpleasant odor. It does seem to absorb room odors, but no citrus anywhere
5.0	These were so life like and none of them were broken!
1.0	These are expensive and not very good. The snacks are just awful. The pepperoni and sausage were greasy. The tuna? OMG... I have no idea what they did to tuna, but it was babyfood and disgusting. The crackers don't match the snack either.<br /><br />The best thing in each packet are the miniscule packets of dried fruits and nuts... but there isn't enough to sustain a gerbil, and the salted dark chocolate candy.<br /><br />I would never buy these again, and wouldn't recommend them to anyone who eats food.
5.0	Great &#34;pops&#34; one of the best you can buy anywhere.
5.0	My husband and I agree; this is the best coffee we have ever had!    Delicate and lovely flavor, low acidity, and no aftertaste.  It is more expensive than other coffee, to be sure, but it is also considerably better.
5.0	I've bought this stuff for years. I like it a lot better than the few other brands out there. I use it in recipes or just spread it on crackers.
5.0	What can I say, chocolate and alot of it equals happiness
5.0	I LOVE this flavor and am unable to find it anywhere in my local stores.  the last time i found it was in New York, until i found it here. it is a light bodied tea with mild berry flavor, not strong, just right. i only brew it for about 2 minutes per cup though. if i do it longer, it seems to change the flavor bouquet a little.
5.0	What can I really say about this coffee?  It's coffee.  But, then again, I'm just a bit of a coffee snob.  While I can happily drink Folgers or other store brand, I definitely prefer the darker roasts like Sumatra or French Roast.  Starbucks offers a very good Sumatra; full bodied and without the sharp bite of French Roast.  Earthy taste and a wonderful aroma while brewing.<br /><br />I had this shipped to my inlaws' house.  They only drink decaf Folgers so I wanted to make sure I had some of my favorite coffee on hand without having to travel with it.  The shipper had it here before I arrived and it was safely packaged.  I'm enjoying a cup right now!
5.0	I just came back from a UK trip and missed this tea so much. I'm please its on Amazon. If they keep it I'll keep ordering.<br />Thank you. Very fresh and a lovely Tea.
5.0	I am a huge pasta lover, but I've never been a fan of the nutritional stats of regular pastas. They have been getting better with more whole grain/wheat options, however this is by far the best pasta I have found. It did cook up firmer than regular pasta, which is actually something I like about it, and it held it's shape much better when used in soup than regular pasta has for me.     The biggest difference I noticed with this pasta was that it was a little more bland tasting than normal pasta, but that really didn't bother me. I found the texture nice, not grainy or chewy at all.     I did have to order this online, as it isn't sold anywhere near where I live. I ordered it straight from the Fiber Gourmet website. It shipped quickly, arrived on time and intact. It was more expensive than store bought pasta, I felt the price was fair for the benefits of this pasta.
1.0	Hali the cans were popped and I had to throw them out.
1.0	I ordered 2 boxes (24 pods per box) & I received a box and a Half - (total 32 pods). The coffee taste stale - will not order again! $54 for 32 pods - ridiculous!
5.0	Best price I have found!  This is the best mint tea I have found.  This deal is better than what I have found from the retailers.  I would purchase this again!
5.0	Recieved Vanilla beans in a nice bundle in a ziploc bag.  The smell was wonderful even through the bag.  My husband and I used the Vanilla beans to make our own Vanilla extract.  The beans were moist and easy to work with.  We were very impressed and would definitely buy the vanilla beans again. Can't wait to see how the homemade vanilla extract turns out.
1.0	"I'm only writing this review to let other people know that this is an insanely high price for this popcorn.  I usually buy the popcorn direct from \\""Amish Country Popcorn\\"" and I choose the \\""Fill the Box\\"" shipping option on their site.  I buy 3, 6 (Six) pound bags of this popcorn and WITH SHIPPING it costs $38.30, which if you do the math, equates to $2.13 per lb.  The other part of going to their website directly is they have about a dozen different varieties of popcorn ranging from yellow to red, to blue to white.<br /><br />Now the popcorn itself is excellent, with very few hulls, a high percentage popping and great flavor.  There is NO comparison between this popcorn and Orvilles corn, the difference to me is night and day.<br /><br />Everything is, of course, each persons preference and decision but I prefer to buy direct when possible, especially when I can save $1.40 per pound on an item."
5.0	"I am the world's biggest coffee \\"" Geek \\"" and I think Kona Medium roast <br />Coffee is the most wonderful way to greet the new day. It is rich, robust, <br />flavorful, beautifully dark in the cup ( I drink coffee black ) and really <br />provides that early \\"" energy boost \\"" that all coffee lovers cannot live <br />without. This is my first taste of Hawaiian coffee, and I must say that <br />I now rate it as one of my very favorite flavors. SUPER  COFFEE !!!!!"
5.0	This is the best coffee in the world; it's the only coffee I drink. It's neither too sweet, too milky, or too bitter.
5.0	This is our favorite coffee for our Keurig! We've tried just about every brand but this one has the best full bodied flavor with no bitter after taste.
5.0	I use this product in many of the dishes I cook.  It's hotter than blazes and tasty as well.  I recommend it highly.
5.0	This is a favorite tea of mine.  I enjoy the tea on its own.  Yet, it is a mild tea to enjoy with desserts.
5.0	I was very happy with this product!!..it cost me less to buy this lot than one by one in Hawaii stores!..I will definitely purchase this item again!!..thank you!!..loced that you could choose your flavors too..that was a big reason to buy it as well..
5.0	I'm a big fan of SweetLeaf Stevia. A year ago, a few of the flavored varieties (Lemon, Root Beer, Chocolate) helped me make the transition from Diet Soda to water. This was a huge deal for me as I've disliked water my entire life. I love it now, and no longer use the flavored Stevias in it. Now the SteviaClear is helping me to add Green Tea to my diet by sweetening it enough to make it palatable to me. (I use about 6 drops in a 16-ounce cup.) I hope that, as with the flavored Stevias I used in water, I'll be able to reduce and then from eliminate the SteviaClear from my tea over the next few months.<br /><br />This is a great product that I really feel has helped me to make healthy changes in my diet.<br /><br />I've seen the SteviaClear for sale locally for $24 for ONE 4-ounce bottle which makes the Amazon price incredibly attractive, particularly with the Subscribe & Save option.<br /><br />Recommended.
5.0	I bought these based on the reviews and they are mild and have a great taste.  If I want it hotter I add some jalapenos.
5.0	These pickles are not exaggerating with the name hot mama. They are big and juicy and by the time you get to the last bite your lips are on fire and there have been a couple of times that I could not eat the last bite. It is almost as if they get hotter the longer you eat them and as big as they are it takes awhile to eat one. If you don't like hot you won't like these but for people like me that love the heat they are great. I am ordering another case today. Enjoy the heat this is currently my favorite.
5.0	Great tasting, fresh texture.  Taste like saltines should taste.  I would recommend ordering this for anyone looking for a good organic saltine cracker.
1.0	NEVER LIKED this Power-C Dragonfruit! Zero stars! Tastes too stout on the tongue! Leaves a very bad after taste!<br /><br />Just a quick note.<br />Coke Company needs to bring the following Vitamin Waters back ON SHELVES IN WAL-MART STORES! NOT JUST ONLINE, IN WAL-MART GROCERY STORES!!<br />BRING THESE BACK! BRING THESE BACK!<br />These:<br />B-RELAXED JACKFRUIT-GUAVA,<br />DEFENSE RASPBERRY-APPLE,<br />STUR-D BLUE AGAVE-PASSION FRUIT!<br />and NEVER TAKE AWAY ORANGE or LEMON-AID or there won't be any that I like!
5.0	I love this creamer. I just wish it was cheaper. I received it very quickly and without any problems.
5.0	This is some wonderful tasting tea.  It has a stronger Earl Gray flavor than other teas out there but then oil of bergamot supposed to stimulate the immune system so I think it is great!
5.0	Met all expectations. Love the calendar!!
5.0	People like to call me a coconut because I'm tan and white on the inside. With that in mind this product is refrenshing and not too sweet. Works for me.
5.0	When I got these tablets, most of my family thought I was trying to give them some sort of drug. After assuring them that it was just a fruit tablet, we were able to begin the taste test.<br /><br />The frooties:<br />-Really do work! Everything sour turns into sweet.<br />-Make lemons taste like fresh delicious lemonade.<br />-Make hotsauce taste like donut glaze.<br />-Make oranges taste like a orange Julius candy.<br /><br />I didn't think they would work this good. Give them a try! For the low price that they are, it is worth it to experience the amazing taste twists. The tablets lasted about 30 minutes to an hour. They won't last as long if one drinks a lot of liquid.
1.0	This was a free gift for valentine's day....you got it for free...and there's no way you can sell them because they were opened....
5.0	these taste great and are a lot less expensive than other brands.
5.0	I add this to my iced tea.  Great flavor.
5.0	So freaking good!  I got these for myself as a treat for my birthday and I ate them all! So good.
5.0	Ordered this for my wife and she's very happy with the soup. Wants to share with our sons. When she's happy, it makes me happy and life is great!
5.0	Great product and really fast shipping.
5.0	Dear Sriracha,<br />I love you. I cannot express the extent of my excitement when I found out that Sriracha is available in packages of three. I will never again purchase a mere ONE bottle at a time.
5.0	I found this nori to be higher quality than what I'd find in a grocery store and less expensive. The bamboo mat is particularly helpful for rolling sushi or maki.
1.0	I got this passion fruit coconut water and it tastes horrible! You can't taste the coconut nor passion fruit!<br />Since I don't want to through it away, I only use it when I want to make smoothies! I cannot stand its taste, it's too fake!
1.0	I love ginger--this tea doesn't have any ginger flavor at all<br />I love citrus--the citrus flavor is almost extinct<br />I was very disappointed
5.0	I miss making Starbucks in my Tassimo coffee maker.  Their products were very tasty.  But I still love my Tassimo.
5.0	Hard to find the real sticky rice.  Now I can make my own and it tastes just like the restaurants!
5.0	Great cheese arrived safe cold ahead of prediction. I am fat and happy. Will purchase again
5.0	this is a very good brand of mayonnaise. I have use miracle whips, for years, and like it very much.
5.0	These are really great and an awesome pick-me-up for my office which doesn't have a keurig in the break room.<br /><br />Honestly tastes just like the brew they have at the shops, so it's saved me some money.
5.0	So long as you can handle corn, these are the best tasting gluten free pastas you can get.
5.0	This coffee is absolutely delicious ! ! It blends rich  white chocolate with raspberries and blueberry, and you can taste and smell the berries as well as the incredible chocolate flavor. This is my first time buying it; but it is definitely going to become a great favorite. Just smelling the aroma from the container  will  have you wanting to taste this awesome flavor of coffee !
5.0	Love these, order all the time!  I toast 'em up in a glass dish coconut oil and a little Himalayan salt, then sprinkle with coconut nectar granulated sweetener, also here on Amazon.  High protein, high fiber, low glycemic, wonderful taste.
1.0	This stuff was really awful.  I know it's all &#34;natural&#34; with no preservatives, but it sure didn't taste that way.
5.0	I absolutely love the flavor & convenience of these mints!!  I've been using them as a quick solution to avoid a rich dessert!  Sorry to see they're becoming hard to get!
5.0	Delicious just like you would expect.
5.0	Great crisp chocolate cookies!  You will love them if this sounds good to you.
5.0	Finding grass fed cultured butter ghee was very challenging, so when we found this we were excited!<br /><br />The flavor and color are excellent, nutty and rich.  We've enjoyed cooking with it, and using it in bulletproof coffee/tea.<br /><br />This is an excellent product,  but it is important to note that the texture is quite grainy which isn't ideal when using it as a spread in place of butter. However, it tastes so good that I still use it as a spread, and have gotten used to the couple seconds of initial graininess before the deliciousness melts in your mouth.  If anyone knows how to make it creamy, please comment :)!!!!  I think I may try using my hand blender?<br /><br />I only wish it was less costly so that we could enjoy it more often.
5.0	Breakfast blend is hands-down the best Senseo blend.  And Amazon offers them at a great price.  I would highly recommend.  Not as intense as dark blend, but still very bold tasting.  Sometimes the darker blends, even medium, have a bit of an acidic taste or a sharp, tongue-piercing taste.  The Breakfast Blend is a perfect balance of strength, taste, aroma, and intensity.
5.0	I bought this product along with a hot air popcorn popper. This make great healthy popcorn, you can add any type of flavoring you like. Just plain makes a great healthy snack.
5.0	long time family favorite, the spice mix is essential to our sauce recipe.  I love being able to buy a whole case of it at a time online.  Stores are too miserly with their 'precious' shelf space to stock adequate quantities of this beloved product.
5.0	I have had these before, but was having trouble finding them in the store.  Not only are they tasty, but the price was great.  Much better than purchasing in store.  Thank you!
5.0	Tasty. Worked perfect for my Walter White/ Heisenberg costume. If you mess with it too much the blue comes off on your fingers.
5.0	Trying to kick my creamer habit so I've just been using flavoring in my coffee. This has enough variety that I don't get bored and a little bit goes a long way.
5.0	This is an old favorite. Not too sweet, great finger food in my opinion, for an average, healthy baby or toddler.
5.0	We enjoyed the variety of flavors!  This set included decaf, tea, hot chocolate, and several different coffee flavors.  I would purchase this item again either for a gift or for us again.<br />Joyce
5.0	Very tasty and not so much that you feel guilty partaking of it.  I truly enjoy this bar.  Can put in napkin and into the microwave for 12 seconds and really gets enhanced.
5.0	Speedy delivery excellent quality!
5.0	I use this for baking and the bag size combined with price and quickness of delivery is perfect.  If you want to bake yourself a sweet but feel guilt free, this is the way to go.  You use same amount of sugar that recipe calls for only calorie free.  No icky aftertaste from baking.
5.0	I see some reviewers complaining of receiving hard Gummi Bears but mine we excellent; moist, juicy, chewy, and delicious! Better than a lot I've bought in stores. I'll definitely buy these again! The expiration date was over a year from the day they arrived, so they're not stale, either, as some have posted. If I remember correctly, these were made in Turkey, but I don't know that it really makes any difference. They tasted exactly the same as every other Gummi I've had before, except fresher.
5.0	Got a whole order of various products. The price was great and I'm satisfied with the spices. Recommended.
5.0	We love this stuff. It goes on everything, from eggs to tacos This is the second time we've purschased it.
5.0	Great product.Great service.
5.0	The best green peppercorns available makes a fine Steak Au Poivre.
5.0	I love this. It doesn't boost my E at all, but it is delicious and I can dissolve my supplements in it very well (creatine/taurine). I have given this to friends who do get their E boosted from it. One friend can't drink it past lunch time or else it will keep her up at night. Keep that in mind when you first try it-- your first few glasses should probably be consumed with breakfast or lunch.
5.0	"I was really distraught to go to my local Walmart and see that they stopped carrying my favorite cereal. But as was elated to find that \\""the site who has everything including a church\\"" made it available to me by the 6-pack. Oh's is an amazing cereal. The one thing i dont like is the box is so small. I get maybe 3 bowls out of the entire box:-(."
1.0	I have used Veri Veri Teriyaki for years. sometime in the last year, about the time they switched from glass to plastic bottles, the product quality has dropped TREMENDOUSLY. in the past, the sauce was nice and thick, after mixing, it took 15-20 minutes for the sesame seeds to rise back to the top of the bottle. You couldn't mix by just shaking, you had to use a utensil to stir it up.<br /><br />Last two bottles I've tried, in the new plastic bottle, the sauce is watery, just like regular soy sauce. After mixing, which you can now do by just shaking the bottle, like salad dressing, the sesame seeds rise to the top immediately without any resistance. Used the new sauce in a won ton recipe that I've made before using the old thick sauce which worked fine,. but with the new watery sauce it ruined the recipe. The won ton mixture was so wet and mushy it was like slush, you could see liquid separating on the bottom of the mixing bowl. I wondered if it was just a bad bottle, but I openned a second one, and it was the same, and the two bottle were purchased at different stores, one at Walmart, the other at a health food store.<br /><br />Also they claim the sauce hasn't changed since moving to the new plastic bottle. If you look at the nutritional information, it has changed. the new sauce has 5% more sodium than what was listed on the old glass bottle, and obviously the water content is much higher in the new. I still hope that maybe I just got a bad batch, but I called their customer service to give feedback, and the person answering finally hinted that yes, the new sauce was a little 'lighter'. Very misleading for their advertising to say that they haven't changed the recipe for the sauce. I will no longer use it, it is too watery for most cooking recipes and as a dipping sauce it is way too light. Only thing it is still useful for is as a marinade for meat BEFORE cooking but if you try to marinade during cooking, like on a grill, it just dribbles right off like water, won't stay on the meat at all.<br /><br />Anyone else notice this new change in the sauce, and agree that it is very watery compared to the older product?
5.0	"I am so glad I paid more attention to the positive reviews for this than to the negative ones.  I wasn't sure what to expect when I first started brewing it because it is SO black, but it turned out incredible.  It is so rich, it feels creamy on the palate.  No bitterness at all, only fullness.  I do have to say that when I first started trying several different coffees, I wasn't giving each brew it's rightful place.  By this, I mean I was making the mistake of adding the same cream and sugar for each kind and you can not do that!  If you drink it black, which I don't, then this wouldn't matter but if you add cream and sugar the amount you add for each kind of coffee will be different.  Every coffee has a certain amount or lack of sweetness on it's own and if you add the same sugar to it, you will ruin that brew.  I start each cup with just about 1/2 tsp. and then work up to another pinch if I need it according the the taste of that coffee.  This one needed very little sugar and a little more cream than for some kinds.  It is different with each cup.  Once I figured this out, they are all unique in their own right.  I imagine as time goes on there will be one I don't like and can't \\""adjust to suit my taste\\"", but I haven't found it yet!  Loving my Keurig and the deal on these K-cups!"
5.0	I cannot find these anywhere but boy do I love it. I Hope they put it back on the market.
1.0	I ordered it because I saw it in the Kosher list, but it was not Kosher.
5.0	I didn't realize Kashi is owned by Kellog. That alone is not necessarily bad, but I saw that some of the cereals have non GMO. But this cereal has very minimal ingredient and only organic. There is an ingredient called &#34;Natural Flavor&#34; I wonder what it is. In general, this is branded non GMO and I trust it as it is a 3rd party company.<br /><br />Tastes good.. Hope kellog does not change Kashi and change the ingredients! Watch out
5.0	I have been a lifetime lover of peanut butter and I have tried most of the brand name products.  This is a fairly new product that I purchased, (Skippy Peanut Butter, Single, creamy 6 CT, 1.5 OZ cups) and when I tried it, I found it to be fantastic.<br /><br />For those of us who like smaller servings in order to keep the peanut butter fresh, this new Skippy product is made for us.  It has 6 individual 1.5 cups so you can take it with you for your lunch or just use it for your breakfast, or actually anytime you need a peanut butter fix.  I hope they come out with a super crunch single serving cup. I think Skippy always puts out quality products.<br /><br />If you love peanut butter you should check out this new product.  I love it.<br /><br />Rating:  5 Stars.  Joseph J. Truncale (Author: Martial Art Myths)
5.0	I'm so grateful to other Amazon reviewers.  They helped me make a decision to buy this olive oil and I don't regret it one bit.  Absolutely delicious and a real bargain in the giant can!  We'll have olive oil for months!  Hubby likes it instead of butter and I love cooking with it!  Yummy!
5.0	Amazing and authentic! Worth every penny! Can't wait for more flavors! Truly a decadent hot chocolate experience compared to anything in the US market.
5.0	Larger than I expected and makes a great herbal tea.
5.0	I have studied and researched for the best option to (unfortunately) feed my infant organic formula.  My wife had to supplement formula along with breast feeding.  Many articles contradict each other and most seem to be biased.  I found Baby's Only Organic Formula to be among the top of my list.  The thing that scared me was the findings of arsenic in an ingredient they use - Brown Rice Syrup.  It is true their was arsenic found at one time but it has since been removed from all newer productions of the formula.<br /><br />Here is an article (Dated December 20th, 2013) that comprehensively explains the differences of most Organic Baby Formulas currently on the market.<br />[...]<br /><br />I hope you find this helpful.  Please share any other helpful information you may have as well.
1.0	As some other reviews have stated, it did come in a brown paper bag stapled together.  When looking through the cups, most were weird cocoa, tea, and decalf coffees.  I also was 1 kcup short only received 34 cups, and 1 kcup sounded old for when shaken it was all clumped together.  I will be going back to the very professional and great tasting crazy cups.  It came in a very nice box with a WIDE VARIETY of ONLY COFFEE.....
5.0	organic xtra virgin coco oil....great for cooking...great as a moisterizer...i love it!
5.0	We've been using this brand for years, and for the most part it's the best and most versatile we've found.<br />If you like sardines, this is your brand.
5.0	I priced it at other places and found it to be competive. I just wish they came in larger volumes to save on packaging. What was nice, is each package is resealable.
5.0	Excellent. Very hapy about the service and product.
5.0	Satin ice is one of my favorite fondants to work with. The flavor is great and the texture is perfect.
5.0	A huge thank you to From You Flowers! The thoughtfulness & sensitivity, the promptness in response & the beautiful flowers; all these made our offshore purchases really simple & fuss-free. We ordered 5 sets in total, with last min changes & incomplete info, but From You Flowers managed to deliver everything in time for the service. THANK YOU!!!
5.0	Great snack option if you are looking for something different
5.0	Absolutely love these bread dipping spices! Great flavor and stores well.
5.0	I have tried every flavor David makes - this is my husband's favorite.  I also like that I can put them on Amazon's regular shipping schedule and save more money.
5.0	love the unique array of teas, and the unusual way of presenting the tea itself. it turns the whole process in to a work of art. and the tea happens to be delicious
5.0	This Greek stuff is the best I've tasted so far. Be careful, it's addictive.
5.0	Really good taste, best I have found yet.
5.0	We all love Big League Chew, and ground ball grape is clearly the best flavor.  Sometimes hard to find due to it's popularity, so this is a great filler item.  Arrived in the box and in fresh condition.
5.0	In my quest for smoked salmon online I happened to stumble across this product and thought to give it a try. Boy was I happy I did...go ahead,try it...rest assured you will not be disappointed. It was well packaged and arrived quite fast.
1.0	The best Major Grey's chutney out there. But at $10.95, no thank you. Instead, go for the 6 pack. It just over half as much per bottle.
5.0	I would highly recommend- this is a rich tasting coffee at a great price, worth giving it a try if you haven't yet!
1.0	Followed directions.  It wasn't hot.  Maybe a bad batch, I don't know.  I do know that it wasn't at all hot.
5.0	Great quality tea, researched the company, I like what they stand for. Some flavors are reallyyyy great, some others, not so much. But that's the point of the variety pack
5.0	So far, my favorite drink mixes.  Beats sodas hands down.
5.0	"Tried shipping this overseas to my parents, but the USPS rejected and returned it due to \\""security\\"" precautions because it was a liquid (gasp).  The return and refund was automatic and pain free.  In the future, all mail and packages will probably be censored like this.  More power to commercial shippers!"
5.0	An excellent product from an excellent company.
5.0	Mouth-watering perfection.
5.0	.I have let three different family members smell this amazing powder. Each one of them said, &#34;I want that!&#34; So, I gave it to them. I just keep buying a new one. One day, I'll get to keep it. A must get. You will be amazed.
5.0	Good product. I like that you can use it on a hot grill. Can't find it locally.
5.0	This tea, along with TOL's Green Tea Orange & Jasmine, are now my only teas. Nothing else compares. I actually crave these teas several times a day. A year ago I did not even think about hot tea, much less drink it! Now that I have discovered these two teas, I ALWAYS have something super delightful to look forward to! I have bought several lovely tea-sets to compliment the tea [though it needs no help of any kind..don't tell anybody but I drink mine 2-or-3 bags to a giant mug]. I am now so 'anti-oxidized' it's ridiculous. Please, LORD, don't ever let these teas leave the market!
5.0	I loved every last bite of these immensely flavorful potato chips! They were crispy and delicious with that wonderful salt and vinegar taste in every chip. There is nothing subtle about the flavor…and I love that. I highly recommend these!
5.0	These jars of the Mrs. Dash are difficult if not impossible to find in a standard grocery store.<br />The stores only have the smaller jars.  I use this product with everything!  Great to have plenty on hand.<br />Its fun using Amazon even for food products. Never have done so before! Thank you Amazon!
1.0	Poor  quality. ..taste is just blah...just  disappointed. ..
5.0	Excellent organic gum. Can't beat its quality as it is not petroleum based as most of the major brands are..... just wished that the natural flavor would last a little longer. Too bad that this brand is not found in any of the local stores.
5.0	arrived safe and sound.  thank you-
5.0	Excellent!  Always well delivered on time and product is consistent in taste.
5.0	It's kind of a small bag, ( but it's my fault for not making a size comparison in my kitchen before ordering.). But, besides that, this is very delicious. I've never gotten any other smoked salt other than Maldon (which I always thought had a lovely, light smoke flavor and light crystal flakiness, like smelling a wood fire). This tastes literally like salty sweet BBQ sauce. It's very strong. I will use it mostly on chicken or beef, or maybe a chili. Reasonable price for the size, I feel, as you don't need to use much.
5.0	The best one  I have used for tiramisu.
5.0	I drink this mixed with 2 other teas to do away with any discomfort i have experienced after kidney cancer surgery 1 year ago.
5.0	I'm in absolute heaven!  I love Reese's cups and to turn it into a spread was absolute genius.  My ice cream and taste buds thank you for it.  Lol
5.0	Well I started out with Shiitake and oyster mushroom kits and have had great success so I ventured into this Lion's mane and am very pleased because I already have mushrooms/fungi growing well.  Really awesome!  I can't wait to cook them with onions and butter when they get a little bigger.
5.0	This is one of my tried and true coffees.  I'll try other brands and flavors, but I'll make sure this one is around in case the others don't work out.  If you like good dark, strong coffee, without being too bitter or acidic, give this one a try!
5.0	Raisinettes! Yummy and fresh. I will order these again!
5.0	Oregon Fruits Kadota Figs in light syrup were great. My husband and friend had been looking for these in the NY area and could find them nowhere! We were delighted to be able to order them through Amazon.
5.0	arrived quickly. Just as described.
5.0	Unfortunately the whole bean Jacobs Kroenung is more expensive ($9 per metric pound vs $7.33). But at least these little 250g packs cost the same as the 500g ones (per ounce, that is) and this way it stays fresher a little longer.<br /><br />I just wish Amazon offered this via Subscribe & Save!
5.0	Excellent product and great old fashioned Grits flavor. As an 84 year old born and raised in South Carolina I grew up on Grits and still enjoy the old fashioned brand.
5.0	this is really good, no fat , no trans fat and a very hard to find item in your local store.  I like this one.
5.0	This is one of the tastiest soups I have experienced - Progresso has become my favorite brand of soup.  Highly recommend for a family soup.
5.0	Excellent product. It has a low glycemic index and is a great substitute for other sweeteners.
5.0	Xlear Spry Spearmint Gum, 100-Count size is a great buy for the money. Taste is good and it does the job as my dentist has noticed improvement since I've been using it. Price is great as well, much cheaper than buying a small tube at the dentist
5.0	Fantastically delicious.  And their packing cannot be surpassed.
5.0	The product arrived on time & was as advertised.  Raw. Pumpkin. Seeds.  Thats it.  If you were expecting flavor, you will be disappointed.
5.0	Patak's Tandoori Paste is a condiment that I have used and savored for many years.  When it disappeared from local grocery store shelves in recent years, I lamented the loss but fortunately still had a couple of jars in my pantry.  Then I located it on Amazon but was appalled to find that this perfectly tastebud-tantalizing, formerly all-natural product now is being adulterated by the addition of red food dye (in which case I will not purchase it).  In a further search on Amazon, however, I was extremely relieved to learn that the original, all-natural-recipe product remains in existence as well (perhaps by popular protest of the undesirable and unnecessary additive), so I happily awaited its availability.  Although I'm drawn to any food product showcasing the flavors of ginger and garlic, I find this particular product especially appealing due to its inclusion of tamarind, that unique-tasting, lusciously tart tropical fruit that lends an irresistible quality to any recipe in which it is used.  I consider Patak's Tandoori Paste (previously labeled Ginger-Garlic Marinade) equally delightful as a marinade when mixed with a bit of plain yoghurt or as a rub straight from the jar (or even as a zingy sandwich spread when sparingly applied to brighten the flavor of chicken or turkey -- or whatever you choose)!
5.0	Insanely addictive drink. The fresh taste of pineapple is perfectly mixed with great orange Tang, especially good on the rocks or as ice cold as you can get it. I can almost guarantee you will have at least two glasses of it the first time you try it. I prefer to make mine a little more diluted, so as not to be too sweet -just thirst quenching and refreshing. American scientists have done it again. The flavor is so 'healthy' tasting, like you just cut open a ripe Hawaiian pineapple and added just the right amount of fresh orange juice. Absolutely delicious. Remember orange creamsicles? Pineapple orange creamsicle beverage is even more delicious. Check this out: Make a glass of orange-pineapple Tang, add ice and a splash or two of CoffeeMate Italian Sweet Cream flavor coffee creamer.* And if you want to go all out and make this extraordinary drink even more insane- add just a drop or two of vanilla extract OR artificial vanilla and mix thoroughly. I don't have a blender at the moment but I suspect the creamsicle drink would be fantastic blended as well as it is awesome just over ice.
5.0	Not only is this the most healthy brand, it is the best tasting.  Two tablespoons a day helps me loose weight.
5.0	I was on the fence about buying these for months. I read the reviews and were impressed by them but, the possibility of being stuck with 24 bags of chips I hated made me nervous. This was my first food order from amazon and I am glad I picked this product to be. I absolutely love these chips. I deiced on the variety pack to start with in case I didn't like one flavor had others I could eat. Turns out though I enjoy them all.    They are thicker than your normal potato chip with a great crunch and more of an airy texture. One bag fills me up as a mid-day snack. The flavors themselves are a bit bolder than you would expect from a chip. For me this was a good thing. I would have to say the bbq is my favorite. The flavor reminded me a lot of lays bqq but a bolder version of it, the sweet bqq flavor with a bold kick at the end. My bags had very few broken chips in them. Everything about this order was great.    My father was around when I was trying my first bag, making fun of them cause they were healthy. I offered him one and he accepted probably to do some dramatic spitting it out and eww effect. He looked at me confused once he ate it, promptly took the bag out of my hand and walked away with it. This is a man who HATES anything healthy, but shows how good the flavors are.    I will definitely be buying these again.
5.0	My wife and I discovered Epoisse on our honeymoon in France and spent years trying to find it in the States.  It isn't pasturized or something and for a long time wasn't available. Now that it is, we are so happy.  It looks like Brie - perhaps a bit runnier - but has much more scent and flavor.  It's excellent on french bread. If you like the texture of Brie and Camembert and also like the pungence of a Gorgonzola, then this is worth a try.  (Not that this  tastes like Gorgonzola, but they are strong in a similar way.)
1.0	These are delicious if you like eating insecticide. Russell Stover should be ashamed. All of their SF candies have been delicious till I tried these.
5.0	I love these mints! They have the perfect amount of sweetness balanced with the spicy ginger. I also love that they are organic and don't have any mystery gross GMO ingredients.. Super fast shipping it's a win win!
5.0	Very fresh and crisp in individual 1 packages this will increase my desire to include raw almonds in my diet.
5.0	This stuff really works!  Why is it so difficult to find?
5.0	As someone who wants every single ingredient in my food to be organic and healthy, not to mention the ethics behind its production, I LOVE these bars.  No added sugar, just sweetened with date fruit.  They taste like yummy chocolate, but provide great nutrition and can get you by for a several hours when you don't have time to make a meal.
5.0	I really appreciate this nut and fruit mix. It's great with a little sugar free chocolate chips mixed in. It's the perfect snack or dessert for me. The nuts are fresh and not salted, and the fruit is sweet. It's an awesome mix. I love it and it's super healthy.
5.0	This product is as anything natural should, be welcome and uneventful to the digestive system. Product arrived as stated on time.
5.0	Delicious. Sweet and delicious in that wholesome, baked treat, honey, cookie kinda.<br /><br />If I eat two of them it holds me over for 2 hours too which is nice because I eat alot, so this is an affordable and healthy snack.
5.0	This is great red palm oil.  Even though most people are using it to cook with, the health benefits are much greater if you do not heat it.  It is great in a salad.  Use with organic vinegar, salt, cayenne, and other spices you would like as a dressing.  CoQ10 is destroyed upon heating, so cooking is a terrible way to get the health benefits.  Also, the vitamin E is destroyed upon being heated.  This product also contains an extremely high content of vitamin A, which is also destroyed upon heating.  The one user who described his birds appearance glow after using this product must have fed it to him right out of the jar, without heating it.  Even though cooking with is occasionally is okay, remember that almost all of the time, it is much better to eat it raw (unheated).  This is one of the truly great raw foods which is loaded with, as far as I am concerned, the most beneficial combination of nutrients that every body needs.<br /><br />The Okonatur Red Palm Oil is Extra Virgin and Organic.  It has all of the characteristics that Red Palm Oil should have.  It remains solid in cooler temperatures, but becomes liquid at slightly higher temperatures (well below cooking temp!!)  A hot day will cause the oil to become liquid.  The color is a deep reddish orange, which means that all of the nutrients that I described above are present.  The pungent taste comes from the way the palm fruit tastes.  The pungent taste is also an indication that this product is fresh and pure.  If Red Palm Oil tastes bland, it is a sign that it is not fresh, and the beneficial nutrients are missing!!  I personally would never cook with it, as my body seems to need all of the nutritional benefits derived from eating it raw.<br /><br />This is a company dedicated to delivering a product with all of the nutritional benefits intact.  They are not concerned with just making a quick profit.  I can tell by the way they take care to deliver the very highest quality Organic, Extra Virgin Red Palm Oil that they care deeply about their customers.  I thank God for people dedicated to the health of their customers, rather than dedicated to lining their pockets with gimmick products.  I can tell you, this product is truly a winner.  I can assure you that this is one company where the owners as well as the employees eat their product.<br /><br />Try eating it raw, (i.e., uncooked), and you will see great improvements in your health.  It is truly packed with nutrition and health.  Everything from your eyes to your hair to your attitude to your energy to your sleep and more will improve upon eating this Red Palm Oil the correct way.<br /><br />It has been my great pleasure to have found such a wonderful product, as well as a great company to purchase it from.  Don't just take my word, eat it raw and you will write the same raving reviews I just did!  An extremely satisfied customer!!!

5.0	It is so difficult to find a coffee pumpkin flavored additive that does not taste like it is trying ta our beloved coffee creamer but almost almost fails, out of season. I was hesitant at first since this was a creamer but instead it was 'just' a syrup, so to speak<br />O! M! GEEEEE! I was so taken aback, in the most amazingly surprised and ecstatic was imaginable.<br /><br />I highly suggest you go out and try this, it may not be your ideal of a pumpkin flavor additive, but I just love this. DOn't take it all.
5.0	Best tea ever!!!  Impossible to find.
5.0	Very nice design on the cap and the bottle well made.  The filter looks strong too.  I have people compliment it.
5.0	my parents cannot drink regular coffee past 3 pm, but they like drinking coffee... no compromise in taste (well, that's what they said... i drink the regular stuff)
5.0	Do you like beef?<br />Do you like pepper?<br />Well let me tell you something son, this $#!* has all of that AND MORE!<br />This product will actually turn you into a mother humpin' Sasquatch!<br />If that ain't your thing, then go get some Oberto or Slim Jim.<br />This jerky will put so much hair on your chest you will have women lost in that mess like majestic man cleavage!
5.0	My first try with coconut oil and I loved it.
5.0	These are the greatest for low carb folks.  I use them to make bean soup, also to make chili.  They taste almost like red kidney beans, so could be substituted for those in almost any recipe.
5.0	This is a wonderful, creamy rich blue with the flavor of roquefort.  Served it on cheese boards with other Spanish cheeses.  Also topped cubes of rare beef tenderloin with it for a fabulous, sexy tapa.
5.0	I use this stuff on a lot of different foods.  It is hot enough and flavorful enough to spice up any food.  Should be a staple in any spice lovers cupboard.
5.0	I love these cups! I had 2 of the Solocups but these are easier to clean and easier to fill, since they have flat bottom.  I have been using the Ekojava coffee that comes in little tubes, but will next try ground coffee.  I had some coffee I ground too fine and it did not work at all, but will try the regular drip grind next time.  I think the key is to NOT fill it too full with coffe, the little packs are the exact amount and the coffee has been great every time.   UPDATE: have been using these for few months and still love them! I buy coffee already ground from Kroger (currently revisiting Starbucks)and it makes a perfect cup of coffee.  For some added flavor I add some cinnamon to the grounds before I fill all the way up with coffee and then brew.  Makes a very tasty and fragrant cup of coffee.
5.0	Love this coffee, but it has gotten too expensive. The coffee is smooth and full of flavor.  The only problem is that I need to buy it in spurts--when I have extra money.
5.0	The flavor is good and tastes like most powdered hot chocolate. The important part for me, obviously, is the caffeine. It is more than a Red Bull and less than a big coffee.  Perfect for late afternoon/early evening when I want a pick me up but don't want it to affect my sleep.
5.0	We have had this set up for auto-delivery for a very long time now.<br />It is still our favorite.<br /><br />Not a strong coffee, but most K-Cups aren't.<br />We will continue to buy this for a long time.
1.0	I was expecting that packaging would be adequate to protect product, but after waiting a week and a half I was told today that the package sustained too much damage to even deliver it. Very disappointed.
5.0	Loved it! Ordered as I ran out of the roasted garlic from Garlic world in Gilroy. When I went to order from my normal place I found out they no longer carry it or make it.. This led me to try this garlic. And. I am happy to say. I have found a new supplier!! Better price by $8.00 and the same great garlic!, Bonus<br />I use in everything I would normally use roasted garlic in. This is the secret to my great steaks.
5.0	And when you do have a hankering for pistachios and don't want the hassle of shelling them, these are a great choice. They're smallish pistachios, but shelled and at a very low price (at the time I purchased them, anyway). There's not much else to say about a pistachio nut. I will be buying more as long as they remain a good value.
5.0	These refillable cups work great.  They allow you to use you to use your own coffee and work just like a Kcup.
5.0	perfect and what a deal for two of them....sometime when i bake i put some for the cake and then take a swig for me.....just kidding but maybe not : )
5.0	I was totally blown away by the aroma even before tasting.  Will definitely buy again.  I am not quite as fond of the chocolate peanut butter.  It is not a Reese's cup.
5.0	What can I say other than this is the salt I needed to set out on curing my own bacon.  I know there are other uses for it, but for me, that's about all it's getting used for.  This is enough curing salt to treat about 100 lbs of bacon, but it is salt, so no worries about it going bad.  Plus, once you start making bacon, the tendency is to keep making bacon as often as possible.
5.0	the flavor is much better than plastic single servings. I would suggest this for all coffee lovers
5.0	the best green/white tea...smooth and flavorful...the only green tea I will buy from now on
5.0	I love this chocolate! for my sister and me this is the best chocolate in the world! The bad thing: it`s very hard to find it.
5.0	Nice product . the price is affordable . I Will recommend this supplier to my friends and planing to buy more of this product
5.0	Reese's is the best quality and their Easter eggs are the perfect blend of peanut butter and chocolate. These were fresh and delicious! And I heard that these could not be found in stores before Easter, so I was very happy to be able to purchase them from Amazon!
5.0	My son LOVES him some veggies!  He gobbles these up every time!  Earth's Best is also a brand I have trusted with both of my children.
5.0	Great product, excellent, will buy it again. First time we ever tried it and no regrets it is absolutely great.
5.0	i first tasted this coffe at a casino and was delighted with the wonderful taste. it has good flavor and is very affordable  i highly recommend it
5.0	I have learnt to tone down on using this one. Wow it has kick. Can get creative with this. I like getting very creative with my mexican omlets. That's how I fist learnt to tone this down. Can't say I stayed cold for long after the first bite. LOL.
5.0	A nice, medium blend that wakes us up in the morning without jarring our still-awakening stomachs.  Highly recommended as a breakfast coffee.  Delicious!
5.0	Wonderful, every flavor, was delicious. I specially liked the Nestea. For summer Time, will be nice. I would buy them again.
1.0	Broken chips in damaged box.
5.0	ICIO's Apple Pear Water is refreshing.  Both flavors of apple and pear are distinct and are a delicious combination.  What sets this flavored water apart from others is the level of intensity in flavor.  It's just right in that it's not too much of one flavor.  Also a big plus is that there is no corn syrup or sugar flavoring.  The bottle is unique with a cool flask design.  It doesn't take up much space in my gym bag and also fits nicely in pockets.
5.0	I really enjoy the pour over coffee pack. I keep it at my desk, so I always have a fresh cup of great tasting coffee when I want. I love my coffee dark and strong and the PourOver is just that with the right amount of water.
5.0	I can't toot more about them. Makes good dip and goes with vegetables very well. Easy to prepare. Wonderful foot to take backpacking.
5.0	This is my favorite K cup on earth! MORE MORE MORE
5.0	the product was just what i wanted ,only thing I could not find was the shipping charge and when I received the product I found out why. It cost more to ship than the item itself . Sorry to say I won't be ordering that item again   Frank H.
5.0	Love this kind of dates, easy to handle package, the self seal is great for on the go. Fresh when you are ready to have a snack.
5.0	My kids (ages 5 and 7) would eat macaroni and cheese daily, so it's fantastic to have a healthy version available made with whole wheat and cheese made from milk from cows not treated with bovine growth hormones. We all love it!
5.0	This is the perfect marmalade! Not too sweet, loaded with citrus peel, yummy enough to eat right outta the jar! If you like marmalade, this is one to try! (This is an 8.8 ounce jar.)
5.0	BEST TEA IN THE WORLD
5.0	I've only used it for pancakes so far but they are delicious - they taste like multi-grain pancakes.  My granddaughters love them!
5.0	My daughter likes collecting pigs. I don't know if she ate any of this pig, being it is so cute.
5.0	I am allergic to artificial sweeteners, and love mint and cocoa flavored candy. The fact that these were made in the USA and not China is a great bonus. I love them and even some friends and relatives that though they hated mint like them. It turns out these use spearmint and common mint not the cheaper and harsher tasting peppermint. They are great and frequently sell out so buy them fast if you like them.
5.0	This stuff is great.  This is the second pack of 6 I have purchased.  The gold dash flax seems to be less noticeable then the regular when added to food/recipes.  I put ground flax on my son's peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.  Both boys don't even notice it when I use this gold dash flax !  I also use it in my pancake batter, muffins, waffles, etc.
5.0	Just one word delicious.... awesome taste and international flavor with Indian tadka ... go for it guys.
5.0	I wanted to eliminate the artificial sweeteners from my diet but also wanted to continue chewing gum. Xyloburst Peppermint Gum freshens my breath and gives me my gum fix. Love it....and so does anyone I offer it to.
5.0	Enjoyed dinner and cocktails at Flemings. Men enjoyed drinks that featured bourbon with luxardocherry cherries -having at home for holidays was a great experience!
5.0	Excellent quality.  Big and fluffy.  I use in air popper.  Stays fresh forever if kept air tight in cool dry place.
5.0	My grand children love this. They enjoy making their own snow cones, and now they have a great variety of flavors .
5.0	Yummy stuff. Saves a few steps and its a great product.
5.0	I bought this gift for my brother and his wife, since my brother and I were big candy addicts in the 80's. He received it on time (which was during the last holiday season) and they absolutely loved it! He thought it was so great to see some of the old candy that you can't get in stores these days. I did not personally get to see the item, but it seemed to make a gift for them and they really enjoyed it.
5.0	"It's quick, easy, has lots of flavor, and can easily be prepared with all type of meats to switch-it-up and create various other meals using the tiny noodles. Everyone in my family of 5 that's eaten this product has enjoyed it, as have our guests. It's not truly \\""Instant\\"" soup, as it does require a short cooking period, but that's to your advantage, especially if you like adding veggies and additional spices (it does not need extra spices added) while preparing.<br />So, cheap, easy, lots of flavor, and yummy in the warmer or colder months (lemon or lime adds some nice zing!)<br />Enjoy :-)"
5.0	Great product!  Fast shipping.
5.0	Great product.  Have used ever since it first came out.  Makes getting two veggie servings very pleasant.  Will keep buying.
5.0	Delicious coffee!! Used in my fillable Nespresso pods ordered from Amazon
5.0	I been purchasing these Gerber Graduates for my twin for a long time now.  They are now 2+ and still enjoy them very much.  They dissolve easy and are low calorie snack.  Great alternative to chips, pretzels and other snacks which are loaded with preservatives and high sodium. I been guilty enjoying them as well.  I buy in bulk since we go through these pretty quickly.  One thing to note if you buy in bulk make sure you don't store them for too long, as they tend to get a bit stale.  Other then that a great product.
5.0	Best canned retried beans hands down!
5.0	I love fiberts and hazelnuts. Roasting them in shells bring lovely aroma to the house from winter to spring. However, shelled fiberts are hard to find locally in California. I'm glad I was able to snatch a bag from Amazon. The orchard Valley Harvest fiberts are fresh and whole. They taste great when lightly roasted in the oven. A gentle rub and the skin comes off (the brown skin is bitter). Very flavorful and nutritious, yet not too fatty. Simply wonderful!
5.0	We used to buy the Fogchaser, this is stronger but is still smooth. Not acidic or bitter.  Fantastic coffee.  If you don't like it this bold, try fogchaser...it's great too.
5.0	these were perfect for my bestfriends birthday party!! the flavor was good and they arrived in a reasonable amount of time
5.0	Crystal Pepsi. That is all.
5.0	I must say, this tuna was most excellent to the pallet and was quite versatile to work with. And with getting a 3-pack, we were able to get creative once we sampled the first can. I pulled up the Island Trollers website and found a section with some great ideas for how to use the tuna other than the standard Tuna Salad that I typically make for my husband. It was a hit!
5.0	Delicious! Same as the restaurant
5.0	This item shipped quickly. I love this K-Kup.Strong coffee taste and aroma.<br />Greate for my morning commute.<br />One of only three extra bold types I drink.<br /><br />Adiitonal UPDATED Review:  ORDER # 2 Update (April 26th 2012)<br /><br />Price went down a few cents but added approx.$6.00 shipping!!??<br />Cheeper to buy Extra bold K-Kups from Dunkin Donut store ( better than Emerils anyway! )<br />My Last order from this place...................
5.0	Delicious as usual.  Haven't had this for years but it is just as I remember. It has stood the test of time.  I love it!!
5.0	I have been slowly moving away from eating meat and use refried beans as a substitute. I want non GMO, healthy beans free from chemicals and additives which limits the choices. After reading numerous reviews regarding people who ordered canned beans and were disappointed by the number of dented cans and poor packing I decided to try these. I am glad I did. They taste fantastic and are so easy to prepare. You can't get any better than ingredients that read: &#34;Pinto beans, salt.&#34; The only down side compared to canned beans is that these have a shorter shelf life than canned but my order arrived with a one year shelf life and they will all be long gone by then. Highly recommend this product.
5.0	I am trying to lose weight.  Have tried several of the prepared food by diet promoters and hated them. Now I am on the Healthy Choice. I am very satisfied and am beginning to lose some weight.
5.0	Great price for a necessary item; will not cause hyper-tension!
5.0	We use this product sometimes instead of wheat pasta. It tastes a bit different and that is nice when you want a change. Take a little longer to cook, but the wait is worth it.
1.0	Ew, yuck, gross.  It's literally like very thin, non-corrugated cardboard that's been oiled and peppered with chili powder.  I can't imagine this is made with real squid, must be miniscule amounts, mixed with cardboard.
5.0	This is the best of any maple flavoring out there.  My mother used it in the 40's & 50's and I used it, too, until I could no longer find it in stores.  I am thrilled to be able to have it again.  The grandkids love it and so do we.  TWO YEARS LATER:  I'm still using these and have been able to give some away.
5.0	I have just recently tried a few Spice Fusion blends and am finding that I really like them. This one in particular has a nice but mild zing when added to chicken on the grill. I imagine it would also be great on fish!
5.0	Today is my father's birthday. If he were alive, he would be 92. He died in 1984 from heart-related maladies. Still, one remembers one's father on his birthday, alive or not, for a loved one is always alive in memory.<br /><br />So why Mrs. Dash Lemon Pepper Seasoning? My father was a taste bud fanantic. No, let me re-phrase: My father wanted taste to explode on his tongue. He's one of those who shook Louisiana hot sauce ([[ASIN:B000H27IGK Louisiana Original Hot Sauce, 3-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 36)]]) or pepper sauce ([[ASIN:B0025UNVXQ Trappey's Hot Peppers in Vinegar, 4.5-Ounce Glass Bottles (Pack of 12)]])--I refer to the hot vinegar that preserved the hot peppers--onto all kinds of food from fried eggs to peas and beans.<br /><br />Many years ago when I visited for the weekend, I brought with me Mrs. Dash's Lemon Pepper. Oh my gosh! My father loved that flavor!! I left the bottle, of course. Every time I visited thereafter, there was always a bottle in his cabinet. I lived in another city at the time. My brother, who lived in the same town as my dad, told me that our father raved over that Lemon Pepper many times over the years!<br /><br />Bottom line: If you are seeking a great taste sensation, Mrs. Dash's Lemon Pepper may be just the thing! It satisfied the buds of a man who LOVED his food flavorful!<br /><br />(Note: There is no salt or MSG in Mrs. Dash's Lemon Pepper.)
5.0	These pods are great!  They work wonderfully in my Nespresso Citiz.  Now I can use my favorite espresso blend with my Nespresso machine.  I recommend using a true espresso ground and that you pack the grounds well by using the white scoop that comes in the box.  The result is a great shot of espresso topped with a nice crema, just like the Nespresso pods.  ONLY use these pods in the Nespresso machines.  Not made for other types of machines.
5.0	Lindt is superior in candy making. I love all their truffles, but especially this kind. Great price for the quantity and quality.
1.0	Dry and stale but that's why I don't like harboro. I shouldn't have bought these. If you like the brand, they were the typical taste...dry and stale. Not due to seller. I just don't like the brand.
5.0	I WAS LOOKING FOR A PEANUT BUTTER SUBSTITUTE AND DECIDED TO TRY THIS ALMOND BUTTER. IT IS CREAMY, SMOOTH, JUST SWEET ENOUGH AND MUCH HEALTHIER FOR ME THAN PEANUT BUTTER. THIS IS A VERY GOOD PRODUCT AND I FIND MYSELF CRAVING IT THROUGHOUT THE DAY AS A LITTLE SNACK. GREAT PRICE CONSIDERING THE QUALITY OF THE PRODUCT. I HOPE AMAZON WILL CONTINUE TO OFFER THIS 3 PACK AS I AM GOING TO BE A REPEAT CUSTOMER! BEST OF THE BEST!
5.0	This is the only soda I drink.  It tastes as good or better than diet coke or diet pepsi and has no aspartame, which has been proven to add to one's propensity to Alzheimer's Disease.  My husband, a faithful Diet Coke addict, is now a fan of Shasta Diet Cola too.  We buy it in bulk, emptying the grocery shelves whenever we find it, which is not often.
5.0	I`ve being using Citrucel for many years, great source of fiber.
5.0	Another item happily found on Amazon.  Only product my husband uses.  No problems with purchase.  Will buy again.
5.0	I've been to the famous Garrett's in Chicago and had the REAL cheddar cheese/ carmel corn mix and would have to say that I was delighted to find this popcorn in our local stores!  The minute I tried it, I loved it!!
1.0	We thought we would love these biscuits to serve with our favorite sparkling wines.  Unfortunately, we didn't like the taste.  Seemed very dry and not flavorful at all to us.  Wouldn't purchase again.
5.0	Kampot Red Pepper has an unbelievable flavor depth and profile not available in other peppers. Try a raw pinch after grinding, and you’ll be convinced to add it to salads, soups, pastas, and favorite meats. Words that come to mind are exotic, aromatic and just plain delicious. Grown in Cambodia, I can believe it’s one of the most sought after peppers by professional chefs.  Jim and the Indochine team are knowledgeable and incredibly responsive.
1.0	The chocolate was bad, appeared very old. I already returned the first order and the second order was just as bad.  The milk chocolate w/o almonds has consistently been good.
5.0	This oil provides amazing flavor.  I use it when I am cooling scallops.  I dust them with the Wegmans searing flour, sprinkle on old bay seasoning, and sear them in a skillet with the basting oil. Yummy!
5.0	I love the flavor of this tea.  I purchased it to help with weight, but inspite of what Dr Oz says, I haven't been successful with weight loss.  The flavor is great and I will be ordering more of it.
5.0	Alo drinks have become a staple in my house since trying these. I love the taste and I feel like my constant tummy problems have calmed down a lot because of the healing power of the aloe. Of course, I'm no doctor, but I do know I feel better since i started drinking one of these each day.
5.0	This is the best all natural creamer I have found. A little pricey but worth it. No trans fats which is what I was searching for.
5.0	I love having Tim Horton's at home. Since we moved from Western NY I &#34;jones&#34; to have a decent cup of coffee from my favorite coffee shop! Thank you for making these available!
5.0	Some tasty honey!  Love it!  I'm a bit of a honey snob, so I appreciate a little bit more complex honey.  This is it.  Don't care for the blandness of clover honey, but don't want something that would upset your tea or breakfast?  This is it!
5.0	I was worried about the heat, but it was packed with cold pack, and Styrofoam.
5.0	One of the best things to add to my protein shakes.  So hard to find and most stores are completely sold out....PBII is awesome
5.0	I have a friend that hoards these. The retail stores were sold out. Amazon saved Easter. Very Good resource when you can't get things local. I live in a rural area where the store do not stay well stocked, and have limited choices.
5.0	Cranberry?  Check.  Cherry?  Check.  Low Calorie?  Check!  Love love love these!  Tart, refreshing, all around delicious!  I hadn't seen these in the grocery store but a friend told me - and since Amazon has everything--I found them quickly.  I've already got a reorder planned!
5.0	Out of the sweet favors these are by far the best.  Better than Strawberry and blueberry.  Yummy!!!!
5.0	The top of the frogs have a slight lime taste and are like big gummi bears. The white bottom is a foamy sugar similar to marshmallow. The combination has a nice feel to it when you're eating them. They're also great for sticking to your friend's forehead, just lick the frog's white belly.
5.0	These were used for a birthday bowling party - they really made them extra special and were easy to work with.
1.0	Love this water, but this price is way too much to pay.
5.0	My favorite hazelnut coffee.
5.0	This coffee is smooth and fragrant! What a great combination!
5.0	Best coffee in the world as far as I am concerned.  I fell in love with it since my first trip to Antwerp.  As far as Belgian coffee goes, this is a popular national brand, so it is the Belgian version of &#34;Maxwell House&#34; or &#34;Foldgers,&#34; but it's still better than the coffee they have here in the states.
5.0	YUM. I wish I could order this more, but price wise, it's not ideal. Tasty and fulfilling!
5.0	I am rating it 5 stars because I like the coffee. I order from amazon(prime) regularly and was quite disappointed with this product's shipping. There's no one to blame, as I later found out there was some mistake with the barcodes. After all it is the coffee that matters.
5.0	This was a gift for my nephew. He has told me that it is very good and he likes it a lot.
5.0	I have looked for whole milk powder for a long time and I look on Amazon. com and the it was. I am so happy. I am storing different items of food supplies in case we have an emergency and will need them. No one know what may happen down the road so one must be prepared. I will most defiently purchase more of this milk. I will also use in recipes. Thank you so much.
5.0	As advertised, would buy again - Thanks AAA+++
5.0	This has a good aroma and flavor as well as being organic which is always a plus<br />I would definitely buy this again
5.0	WoW has amazing tasting Gluten Free cookies.
5.0	Love Love Love this product....well worth the money
5.0	Item as described.  Thank you!
5.0	I wanted a packable and healthy snack for work and travel. The assorted sticks are the way to go.  These sticks have a &#34;clean&#34; flavor and did not taste like other processed beef sticks. Energy bars can get dull, this is a nice savory way to snack during the day.  WARNING- one is not quite filling, so its easy to keep going back for more. I would recommend the variety pack. (Chipotle and the Spicy were my favorites.)
5.0	I love the taste! The only real inconvenience for me is that I like to grab a drink and go. That isn't easy with this because the packs each make 2 quarts, not 16 or 24oz.<br /><br />Then I finally got a brain in my head!! I make a pitcher full, (pour the water from the bottle into the pitcher, rather than use tap),then fill 20oz water bottles and put them in the fridge. They are ready to go and cold!  And because it's sugar-free I don't have to watch how much I drink so I can make as many as I want! Who could ask for more?
5.0	These are the best crackers yet! These are the way to eat really good cheese. They are real thin so you can taste the cheese.
5.0	Our Girl Scout Troop used these for World Thinking Day for our food from Denmark.  It was easy and a nice variety.
5.0	This is beautiful tea and very refreshing. Hope it becomes available, very soon.
5.0	I heard about these on the Hungry Girl website. Always on the lookout for a low-cal snack, I decided to give these a try. I ordered the variety pack in order to try all the flavors and they are all fabulous! The portion size is huge...another plus! I will definitely order again!
1.0	I thought I could handle this stuff as I was trying to find a good chai that wasn't Teavana's overpriced gold in a bag. This isn't it. The word Spiced is totally incorrect - there is no spice at all.
5.0	Delicious. Everyone loved them/
5.0	I've used Subscribe & Save for many products, but this is my favorite! Add hot water, then let it sit for 5 minutes before eating---easy! The soup is thick and flavorful, with bits of onion, carrot, and celery (the label also lists potatos, but I've never noticed them). I've always had ham in my split pea soup, but don't even miss it in this.<br /><br />Comparing the Nile Spice split pea with a brand name can of split pea w/ham & bacon soup from my cupboard, per serving: the sodium content is lower in the Nile Spice soup (600 mg vs. 850 mg), and it has more fiber (8 g vs. 5 g) and protein (13 g vs. 10 g). Nile Spice is 200 calories, the brand name serving has 180.<br /><br />Overall, this is big bang for the buck. I have it at least once a week for lunch at work, and with a piece of fruit, it's the perfect amount to hold me til late afternoon.
1.0	I chose this rating because this powder smells awful and tastes awful and left me doubled over with stomach pain for hours. I tried drinking it mixed in water and tried mixed in the smoothie. Ruined the smoothie completely with that awful taste and caused the same stomach pain. I have not tried other maca powders, so this might very well be the same for all maca powders. After my experience, I don't care to try further. This cannot be good for me if my stomach rejected it so violently.
5.0	A pleasant tasting Earl Grey when brewed in our pod coffee/tee maker.
5.0	I am always trying to find a cereal that is Organic, high in fiber and actually taste good. This is a refreshing new product with everything I have been looking for in a cereal, my children even love this cereal. I think post should brag up the high fiber content also, it is hard to find cereal that has this much fiber and taste great!! You can actually tast a sweet, apple cinnamon flavor, I look forward to eating this cereal. It has also helped me achieve my high fiber goals.
1.0	The pot is nice but the tea bags do not fully open into what they're supposed to - flavor is good
5.0	I love boston brown bread & Ican't find it in any store. It is really great with cream cheese. The items came on time/well packaged.
5.0	The chopped pecan pieces are the right size for baking or just eating right out of the bag. The pecan pieces are not dried out like some other brands. They also store well in the bag.
5.0	I started to buy my cases of soup at amazon a few months ago.Sometimes Campbell's and sometimes other brand. Sometimes there are a few dented cans. I over-look them because of the price which is a few dollars less than other sites that sell food by the case. A few dollars add up in this economy.I have always been satisfied with my orders.  This month both of my cases did not have one dent at all. Way to go Campbell's and Amazon. I received my orders usually early from my point of view. Thank you Campbell's and Amazon, you make my life a little less stress full knowing I can order some of my favorite canned goods to fill my cabinets.Keep up the good work and thank you again for your service.
5.0	It's like franks red hot sauce....I put this s*** on everything !!
5.0	this is the very best tea I've ever had, feel so lucky to be able to get it and enough to share with friends
5.0	These are great.  Not burning like the regular ones.  Good flavor and secure container
5.0	I only drink this stuff when I have a stuffy nose and/or a sore throat. Then it is pure heavenly relief !!!!<br /><br />Upon the first purchase we too originally thought it would be a pleasant lemony ginger thing, mild and tasty. It was nasty!<br /><br />I actually brought it to work and stashed it in the break room as a free for all, because i just couldn't see myself drinking it. Then a coworker with a cold came and asked if it was OK to have some of my ginger tea. I encouraged him to have as much as he wanted :) He came back later that day all delighted and reported how much improved he felt thanks to my ginger tea.<br /><br />That is when it became our favorite 'try this&#34;. Anytime someone had a cold at work, I would tell them about the miracle powers of this tea. So far everyone who had a cold and tried it has agreed and has gone to the store to by some for themselves.
5.0	These candy bars are WAY underrated! I'm giving these out for ?Halloween as a public service announcement that there are other candy bars outside of the Snickers realm. Wish me luck!
5.0	I really love this product.  I put some in my coffee, have to warn that so far I've been the only one in my family who likes it this way. Coconut is a super food and I recommend this manna if you like coconut.
1.0	These are runny and tastes terrible, my son absolutely refused this particular flavor, most of the other onestaste really good though
5.0	These are just so yummy!  I love that they are in individual sized packets, so I don't over do!
5.0	This is one of McCormick's best  condiments.  First Kroger, Tom Thumb and Alberston stopped carrying it and now you can't even find it at Walmart!  This product has the perfect blend of herbs and lemon and because it doesn't already have pepper in it, you can add your own favorite pepper (I like a blend of red,white/black).  Thank goodness there is Amazon.com! It has saved me by offering this and other items that have disappeared from local stores.
5.0	I am not a huge super hot fan but this stuff blew my mind.<br />I would not consider it a HOT sauce as much as I would a fantastic steak type sauce.<br />It reminds me of a much better flavored tabasco.  It is very thin in consistency and it seems to collect at the top of the bottle over time so it requires a little maintenance as odd as that sounds.<br />I don't really know what else I can say about a condiment, but even my friends that do not like &#34;hot sauce&#34; use and love this stuff.  I would recommend giving it a try.
5.0	These are great! My husband and I started a clean eating diet recently and I wanted something besides water to drink. These were some of the only drink flavors that contained stevia instead of aspertame or other artificial sweeteners. They actually taste really good and are great in sparkling water! I particularly like the raspberry lemonade and peach lemonade.
5.0	Very fast service, great product
5.0	Love these! Wanted to stop buying the big jugs in store which have a lot of sugar and other stuff in it. This has an artificial sweetener in it but also MUCH less sugar(zero).
5.0	I remember eating these as a kid…by far my favorite. When we could not buy them anymore, my wife tried baking some from a recipe found on the internet that supposedly duplicated these cupcakes. That was a flop! She could not get the taste even close to the amazing Hostess flavor. So happy to be able to buy them again, and see the Hostess tradition continue.
5.0	Simply the best spicy tomato juice in the market.
5.0	I am trying to get back on the very low-carb bandwagon, since that way of eating helped me lose quite a bit of weight awhile back. So when I found this product on the Amazon site -- at a decent Amazon Add-On item price! -- I took a chance and ordered two boxes. I am really glad I did. Flax seed is a great source of Omega 3 fatty acids, and somehow Doctor in the Kitchen has made it into a palatable cracker, something I wasn't sure was possible!! Out of the box or with some almond butter or cheese on top, these make a great low-carb snack. They are surprisingly filling, too -- six little crackers killed my carb cravings and held me over several hours till dinner. I will definitely re-order this product!
5.0	i just love the taste of this coffee it has a nice bold taste to it i don't like the taste of weak coffee.
5.0	While dating my husband he grilled up some of the best brats I ever had.  He refused to tell me what he used telling me it was his secret ingredient.  It took me getting married to him to finally find out his secret ingredient was the Original Bry basting spray. Finding out about Bry spray was definately worth getting married! We use it mostly whenever we grill pork , chicken & brats.  We even used it on the Thanksgiving turkey we grilled for our large family gathering.  It was so good there was nothing left but bones.
5.0	I grew up on this stuff, I remember my mom using it on everything and so do I. I use it just about in every dish instead of salt. It's great to rub on roasts instead of salt. I used it in soups instead of buying chicken or beef stock. Pasta, Veggies. Can't live without it and people always wonder how my food turned out that great. Well this is my secret.
5.0	Excellent! I grew up in NYC and these are just as good as the ones in the deli :)
5.0	My kids love this chocolate drink - they are not breakfast eaters, so this gives them some nutrition and energy before school.
5.0	This is a great gluten free flour and the Maninis website has plenty of recipes to try.  I will keep buying this for many years to come.
5.0	I am happy to be able to purchase corn that is organic.  I am assured this is accurate as it does have the USDA seal.
1.0	It is great, but the price is crazy! This product cost $ 2.99 and you can find it in many Brazilian/Mexican stores. I cannot believe that someone is selling this for this absurd price , it does not make even sense!
5.0	Hey Guys, I gave this a 5 out of a 5 because the shipping, the feed back, the product its self was the finest to the max. I totally recommend this product for who that would love to make a simple Tasty DIY Candy Kit.
5.0	It is an amazing breakfast option for us. It is much better and healthier than those cereal loaded with sugar and artificial ingredients.
5.0	Love the glycemic index level. Better than sugar; more flavor. Great for cocktails
5.0	Awesome!!! 3rd order :)
5.0	I have Celiac Disease. This gravy is WONDERFUL!  Highly recommend it.
5.0	I'm ordering my second batch now, at the insistence of my wife.  Overall, I really enjoyed the beer as much I'm capable of enjoying a pumpkin beer(my wife is a huge fan and we live overseas, so this brings us a taste of home).  The whole experience of working with Jasper's Homebrew is worth 5+ stars.  The kit is complete with easy to follow instructions.  It's extremely strait forward, perfect for a beginner or a long time brewer looking for a fall batch.  Overall, A+ experience from ordering, timely delivery, awesome ingredients, and in the end a smooth, multi layered pumpkin beer.
5.0	Love the subscription - best place to get my Caramel Drizzle coffee!
1.0	Very high in sugar and there was mold or something bad in a few bottles.  I will never drink again.
5.0	Very delicious peanut butter and a very convenient way to buy it...and it was very close to the price to buy locally.
5.0	I first tried this when my Wal-Mart store had one box on the shelf.  Loved it and have not been able to find it since so I turned to Amazon.  I add one sweetener to make it a little sweeter and I am good to go.  I don't drink ice tea all the time so this is perfect for when I get a desire for sweet tea.
5.0	Not sure how you review coffee. Everyone has their own favorites. I happen to love Kona and because of the draught it is getting harder to find. this came to me very fast and in good condition. So I have no complaints.
5.0	Heavenly smell and flavor.  I usually purchase a different brand, but found this to be a little less starchy.  I was very pleased with the size of the bag also.
5.0	I am in love with puffed rice.  I cannot find it in our local stores.
5.0	Have tried kits from several different companies. This product got thumbs up from everyone that tried it. Paired with the high temp pepper jack cheese it made an excellent venison/pork summer sausage.
5.0	Absolutely the best coffee you will ever have in your life.  There is no bitterness whatsoever, even when brewed strong.  I've never been a black coffee drinker, but with Cafe Oro, I can actually drink it black.  That being said, with a little half and half it tastes divine.
5.0	I have only eaten the raw and they were as expected.  I'll be roasting some up this weekend but I'm always happy with Bob's products.  A+ company.
5.0	I would absolutely recommend this item and it is very tasty and it is really good value for the money
5.0	I carried these packets when I rode the Trans-Siberian Railway across Russia. They were great. I used 2 packets in my 22 oz. thermal mug. There was a hot water heater in each railway car. They're easy to open and easy to pack. They're also available at most Asian markets.
5.0	Smells delicious and iT makes skin glow i use iT allover my Face aT nighT beFore going To bed. A biT slipery you need To waiT unTil iT absorbs
5.0	Salty goodness for sure...right up there with bacon...stores forever seemingly.  Taste is what matters and I really don't get about how it is processed since I don't eat a ton of it...just the occasional biscuit sandwich for breakfast with the family.  Yeah, it is pricey, but try and find it locally and you will see it is not that easy.  Our butcher looked at us and said &#34;well, we have plenty of ham products.&#34;  But your basic ham is just not the same...
5.0	This is the best salad dressing flavor that Kraft/Good Seasons ever made!  My mother first discovered it back in the early 1970's and it has become her 'signature' salad dressing.  Don't let the word 'garlic' in the name scare you off.  It is really a sophisticated vinagrette.  For some reason it is getting harder and harder to find in grocery stores.  I was THRILLED to discover that Kraft sells it here on Amazon.com!
5.0	Davidson's spiced peach tea is excellent flavor and even better if a little honey is added to it.
5.0	I bought this cinnamon because I was interested in adding cinnamon to raw honey as a healthful snack.  I had read online that the cinnamon you buy in the store is something called Cassia Cinnamon which is not from the same tree as Ceylon (or, True) Cinnamon and that when you metabolize Cassia cinnamon it contains a toxin called Coumarin.  This toxin can be damaging to your liver and can also react with blood thinners such as Coumadin (not a coincedence that the name is similar) and Warfarin.  Personally I do not take blood thinners, but I do not want to hurt my liver either way.  All cinnamon contains some amount of coumarin, but the Cassia contains it in more dangerous levels if you are consuming it the way that I plan to. One source about this toxin is here: [...]<br /><br />Honestly I do not know if this particular cinnamon is in fact Ceylon, as it says that it is.  There is virtually no way to tell the difference without a lab.  It comes in a plastic zippered bag with a sticker on it stating that it is indeed Ceylon.  I have to trust that they are telling the truth that it is.  I have been using it for several weeks now either with the honey or in my oatmeal, about a quarter to a half a teaspoon a day, and have suffered no ill effects.  It is very tasty and I now don't want to eat my oatmeal without it!  I do not know if any health benefits have actually occurred, but I will say that I have made it through several head colds that inflicted the rest of my family and did not affect me.  Either way, it is tasty and that's good enough for me!  When my bag is gone I will be back to order more for this great price.
5.0	This tea was fantastic.  I was looking for a Moroccan mint tea for some time and what I found always fell short.  A friend recommended this, and it is exactly what my pallet wanted.  I forsee myself having a stash of this (haha puns) for some time to come.
5.0	Q-Ginger is absolutely the best ginger ale out there. The little kick of cayenne adds the perfect finish. I recommend it to all ginger ale fans.
5.0	The best. Not a lot more to add, really.
5.0	Great price and freshness.
5.0	I love this coffee. Costco stopped carrying this items and feel very fortunate to be able to purchase this on Amazon.<br />Seems like I can find a lot things I miss on Amazon.
5.0	Drelicious coffee. I am very happy with the product and your operation
5.0	I got these on sale on Amazon. Best price I found on the internet. It's a great zero calorie sports drink. I will be buying more.
5.0	Bought this mix at a local grocery store, just made them and they do indeed taste like the real deal!
5.0	I've been purchasing this in bulk via Amazon.com because this mix makes great gluten free waffles and pancakes. I wish it came in bigger sized boxes but the price in bulk here is decent.  I've tried several other mixes and this is my son's favorite tasting, goto request for breakfast.
5.0	After talking to a friend about a recipe he and I were discussing, I decided to give it a go and after several tries with less than desired results, a chef friend suggested I try the Thai Sticky Rice.  Based on this, I started looking and while there were some close candidates I could not find this exact product in the local stores.  Saw this one and ordered it.  Good price as well.  I incorporated it in the recipe and the glutenous nature of the rice, hence the &#34;sticky&#34; component gave me the results I needed.  When cooked properly it adheres and will hold up to a dish with a broth as I was preparing.<br />No complaints.
5.0	There are so many bars in the grocery store, it take an hour just to figure out what to buy. So I did a little research and bars and found out the only one to buy are ones that use dates at the natural sweetener. All the other are junky, especially Kind bar and Cliff.<br /><br />The taste is excellent and now I eat about 2 per day.
1.0	False advertising. Old, shopworn. Lots of shredded paper and mashed silk flowers. Amazon tied 6 inches of green curly ribbon on handle to transform new baby congrats into a Christmas gift for your mother. Disappointing.
5.0	Do not need much in order to add special flavor.<br />The thing is I forgot to store it in the refrigerator after opening it.
5.0	Can't eat hard boiled eggs without it!
5.0	Loved them, and they were fresh!
1.0	Nuts were very small and stale.  Almonds in particular were shrunken and tasteless.  Pecans were the size of acorns.  Hazelnuts were size of marbles.  Waluts and brazil nuts were ok, although some brazils were rotten.
1.0	I loved the taste of these, but they caused coughing (and swelling/irritation) at the back of my throat- I hadn't eaten anything else all day so I know it was these. Then a colleague at work tried them, and the same thing happened to her within minutes. Both of us were coughing periodically for the rest of the day. I looked up sulfur dioxide and coughing and found a connection mentioned that I never knew about before- for some reason I had never noticed these symptoms when eating other dried fruits, some of which also contained sulfur dioxide. In fact, this was the first time in my life I had this reaction eating dried fruit. I can only surmise that this particular product contains more than the usual amount, or that it perhaps contains something else not on the label (certain pesticides?) because both my friend and I were affected from eating from the same bag. It's too bad because these were some of the better dried fruits I have tasted, and pleasantly soft. For taste, they get 5 stars... but I won't buy them again because of the coughing reaction I had to them.
5.0	This is addicting - you'll never see cashew butter (or any nut butter) the same way again. Please make it available soon!! I have not been able to find this for months in Ohio...
5.0	These chips are amazing IF you love garlic.  Just so happens I do.  They have SO much flavor.  Most of the Uncle Ray's line are good but these are by far the best.
5.0	These are great to have a round for those chocolate cravings.  The individual packaging keeps me from eating more than 1 serving.  Very tasty.
5.0	This product really assists my digestion.
1.0	Absolutely the worst Kenya coffee I have ever had.  On top of it all, Amazon does not have a satisfaction guarantee on the grocery items.  So the moral of the story, don't buy this coffee and read Amazon's fine print.
5.0	Fast shipping, great value, used for wedding favors. Pretty and tasty purple treats for all my guests. Thank you for your product.
5.0	my kids love it. I received what I expected.
5.0	I am allergic to peanuts. I have never tasted peanut butter in my life so I never knew what all the raves were about. I think I do now. What have I been missing all these years? I had my first taste of almond butter about 6 months ago when someone substituted it in a recipe at work so I could try the cookies. They were delicious. Then I started looking for it in the grocery store. Upward of 9 dollars per jar -- small jar. So, I figure, I've lived without it this long, no biggie. Then I saw this on Amazon, subscribe and save, 3 jars for the appx price of one in the supermarket. As soon as my shipment came, I made an almond butter and homemade wild grape jelly sandwich. I was in heaven. I  seriously want another one, but the calorie count is keeping me in check. 90 calories per tablespoon. The fact that it is NON GMO is very important to me, as is the certified vegan but mostly PEANUT FREE FROM A PEANUT FREE FACILITY is pretty reassuring. The consistency is very creamy, just like the peanut butter my husband slathers on everything. There is just a thin, oil like glistening to it. The ingredients are: Blanched roasted almonds, evaporated cane juice, palm fruit oil and sea salt.
5.0	Hot chocolate for 3 months :)
1.0	I ordered this one week ago. I was shocked to see that the nuts were all infested --- worms and very disgusting stuff. I called up Amazon customer service, they immediately sent me another pack. But it was the same bad quality. Don't buy this.
5.0	My husband and I love this mix for our pancakes, biscuits, breads, and desserts.<br /><br />The pancakes are better than the gluten pancakes and they are filling so we don't eat as many.
5.0	I accidently ate the last package of these for my son over six months ago.  He got them from a friend who visited New York.  We live in Seattle.  They were so good. My son was so mad at me.  I did not realize where they came from.  I just figured it was my reward for cleaning his room.  Well I ordered him a whole case from AMAZON a few months back, and now when I wanted to order more to send to him in his care package for College, they are no where to be found.  He shared his last box with his dorm mates.   I can't wait for them to restock them.  I whish I knew how I could order more.
5.0	This gives you the taste of chocolate without all the calories! The &#34;fudge&#34; layer is made with cocoa and dates, but doesn't taste nearly as healthy as it sounds.
5.0	Just like I grew up with the British standard Tetley Tea. Great tea good taste and being a Brit I know my tea!
5.0	This coffee is so smooth and flavorful without the bite and bitterness of others.  I wished that Nescafe continued making it.
5.0	This item is DELICOUS! Hands down, the best brand of octopus/squid. The pieces are big and very tender. I would recommend this to anyone that enjoys high quality octopus.
5.0	Someone was kind enough to share this chocolate bar with me a month ago, and I have been obsessing over it ever since. It is simply delicious. Not to mention the fact that it is easy on the conscience with its organic, free-trade ingredients and production.
5.0	These are great and waaaay better than pretenders. They don't break up and destroy your coffee making experience like some fake brands.
5.0	Use this as an alternative to lemon juice. I love it in potatoes.
5.0	Delicous and extremely healthy!  I eat them every day for lunch- I add them to a spinach wrap.  They are soft and very tasty. They have a good amount of protein and fiber and are low in sodium.
5.0	This is a very good typical Moroccan harissa (even though there are many versions).<br />This one is made with preserved lemons. It's tangy, hot without being burning.<br /><br />We use it on everything, not only Moroccan dishes. It's especially good on pasta with all kinds of tomato sauces.<br /><br />To make a great couscous sauce like my Moroccan grandma used to make: use one can of plain unsalted tomato sauce and add ground cumin and harissa to taste. Yum!
5.0	Well there is only one way to enjoy this tasty, piping hot, burn your tongue goodness that is this sauce, and let me tell you what, it is not for lube!  I was enjoying Piranha 3DD on Blu-Ray and things started to get extra DD'ish, I reached over for my trusty bottle of Dave's Ghost Pepper sauce and let's just say, great on lots of things, not on hot dogs!
5.0	My family loves all the flavors of the Gevalia family. We will most definitely be ordering more in the future.
5.0	I am loving how easy this mixes into cold liquids and it's always good to get more gelatin and collagen into your body!
5.0	Constant Comment is a favorite of my husbands.  Although, I am a coffee drinker, I love the aroma of a cup of CC, and on occasion I will have a cup with a tsp. of sugar and a couple of pieces of shortbread.
5.0	We love this baby food! The best part is the consistency - it is NOT runny at all. My son loves the taste and eats it all up. We have ordered this multiple times, as it's a huge hit in our house.
1.0	I saw this in Sprouts Market and wanted to try, the result is absolutely disappointment.<br />The taste was disgusting, it's chemical, industrial taste didn't go away from my mouth entire day.<br />I read good reviews of other Walden Farms products, but this one didn't fit the bill, it's a failure.<br />Save your buck, try something else.
5.0	I like to add flax to my home-made breads, and this product is just what I wanted.  It's organic, packed in a sturdy plastic container, and priced competitively.  With Amazon's free shipping, it's a great value.
5.0	These things are hard to put down.  The different coatings depending on the bean.  There is a lot of chocolate so if you are looking for a thin coating this might not be the bean for you.  I'll definitely buy more when mine are gone.
5.0	This is a good product.
5.0	better coconut water that others
5.0	GREAT suckers!!  Great taste!!  Great variety!!  Healthier than most others!!  Highly recommend!!
5.0	This sauce is excellent especially when combined with Provel Cheese.  Follow the directions on the bottle to make a slammin creamy cheesy delightful treat!
5.0	Fabulous tea, good smokey taste.  What's not to like.
5.0	The best sauce I've eaten to date that comes from a jar.  It is a pricey product that is not found in every store, but I still put in effort to get this sauce to my table.  Tastes sooo good try the Filetto di Pomodoro, fresh flavors no artificial flavorings.
5.0	Perfect Drinking Chocolate in every way. just like a melted dary milk bar in warm milk. great before bed too.
5.0	Big container but a GOOD container.  Very good quality product.  I've used a lot of this.  Big fan of Mccormick products.
5.0	We've been buying these chips because they're made with olive oil rather then the less-healthy sunflower oil or other oils and because I am allergic to sunflower oil.  Probably not the healthiest product but when eaten in small batches these chips are very tasty and a terrific accompaniment to lots of other foods.
5.0	I love these . when you have a craving don't have to make a whole pan. One nice size personal brownie nice and warm and oh so delicious.
5.0	Spelt is my new favorite flour and Barry Farms white flour is my new favorite flour to cook with. You can use it 1:1 instead of wheat flour - it acts the same but makes baked goods a little lighter. I tolerate spelt better than wheat and it also has more protein, fiber and minerals than white wheat flour. Thank you, Barry Farms!
1.0	Theyre definitely a bummer. Not too happy about the purchase, they were stale and tasted completely different that usual
5.0	Every time someone tells me that they've never had a Cadbury egg or doesn't know what one is, I have to resist the urge to punch them in the face.<br /><br />These eggs are delicious and I recommend them for all.  They are a chocolate egg filled with a delicious cream.<br /><br />They are not good for you and should be eaten sparingly.
5.0	This is my favorite flavor of the Go lean bars- it's filling, sweet, satisfies craving every time and it's nutritious- all around yumm
5.0	I was pleased with the flavor, it's not spicy, but has a great smokiness to it that regular chili powder lacks.
5.0	as described - fast shipment
5.0	Fast shipping, safely double boxed. Expiration date Aug 2014 but it will be long gone before then. But, it will last till my next trip to UK where I will be able to get it at 1/3 the price.
5.0	For the price the best coffee ever
5.0	Tasted very good, and helps me alot during Summer
5.0	Best sauce we've EVER tasted!
5.0	Finally found a tasty mix for our bread machine! It was easy and smelled so great while cooking! Love it!
5.0	It's been hard finding a sugar-free candy that I like, and then the local store stopped carrying it.  So I've been very happy to see that Amazon.com can make them available again.  I love them myself, and have fun sharing them with service people in restaurants and diners.  They have no after-taste and are sooooo good.  Thanks.  Grandpa
5.0	I'd heard about how good this instant coffee was and decided to shell out a little extra and try it.  It makes a really good cup of coffee for being an instant variety.  Costs a little more than Tasters Choice, but probably worth it.
1.0	Not worth the extra cost of delivery. Just look locally in your area for a bakery shop to find this little package for less than 5 bucks.
5.0	Great product. I would shop again. Buy with confidence.
5.0	These are excellent sardines. I first purchased these in a healthfood store in Vermont and loved them. I was not able to find them in my markets, so I searched the web.  By far, Amazon was the cheapest.  Quick delivery and I always have them on hand.
5.0	I was pleasantly surprised by how good this nut tray looked when it came-I brought it for a party and we brought it out in the evening several hours after supper and people really enjoyed it with their drinks!! It was a hit! It was gone in only a few minutes. My favorite was the glazed pecans, yummy! I definitely recommend this gift tray and will be ordering it myself agin in the future!!
5.0	These are not too mushy and have a great apricot flavor.  I just eat them plain.
1.0	The bar shown in the picture is a 3.5-ounce bar (check out the bottom right of the picture), but this page is for a 1.3-ounce bar (what you would buy in the checkout line at the grocery store). Plus, we received bars with a contest for the 2012 Pro Bowl on them, which is fine for a grocery store, but not when you want to include them in your wedding, like I'd intended.
5.0	Taste fantastic! First time buying maple syrup online and it taste just like the grade A maple syrup I purchase from the grocery store. What made me buy this product was its organic and a cheaper deal. Made french toast from scratch for some friends and they enjoyed it with this syrup. So 5 stars for me!!
5.0	I just have to say this is SPLENDA in a cheap presentation. It has the same taste and sweeten your beverages with the same number of individual packets. From now on i will only buy this sweetener.
5.0	My husband cannot get enough of these bars.  They are fairly healthy, low sugar, good protein and they taste great!!  I stay away as it is hard to eat just one!
5.0	"Royal Oak Peanuts are simply the best tasting premium virginia peanuts we could find. We have them on automatic delivery every 4 months. These are \\""bliser style\\"" peanuts cooked in high heat causing the peanut to blister and become somewhat crunchy and firm.  The unique taste is much better than any brand in supermarkets. Be sure to check Amazon for specials. I saved 25% off of the $23.99 list price with free shipping.  ENJOY! JJJ"
5.0	Very pleased with the beans.  They were a good size, nicely packaged and priced right.  I will be back for more.
1.0	These cookies are disgusting. They are NOT sandwiches as described and pictured. They are listed wrong. They are FAT one layered cookies with a crumb bottom. They are pains to return and im very unhappy.
5.0	I used these excellent organic cumin seeds to season various Indian dishes that I make for my girlfriend.
5.0	fiance was super happy! and we all know if fiance is happy....everyone is happy!
5.0	Love the coffee. Not bitter. Smooth with a rich taste.
5.0	After researching what are some of the healthiest fish is to eat I found Bar Harbor Smoked Mackeral one of the best on the market. The product is from fairly unpolluted, local waters and the smoked flavor is done just right.
5.0	I had this tea at a Ruby Tuesday restaurant and it was so tasty that I asked what brand it is. I tracked it down through Amazon and have been drinking it ever since. Nice bold flavor and never bitter. I really love this tea for everyday drinking. Good hot or iced. I use the small bags for cups of tea and these family bags for pitchers of iced tea.
5.0	This product is really well made and nummie
5.0	I love this coffee flavor.  It is very hard to find in stores in my area.  Now, I can just order it from Amazon and it comes right to my front door.
5.0	With a rampant craze that spread faster and wider than the freaking cancer, energy drinks have become a common staple of the American caffeine junkie, instantly, from one day to the next. Strolling through obtuse grocery aisles my eyes are hardly at rest. Everyone has an energy drink brand: Monster, Rockstar, Elmo, Barbie, even that guy that guy Richard Grieco who used to come out on that show 21 Jump Street. Well not really, but there are plenty. And with so much variety, how could my daily caffeine intake get any better? Only when The Simpsons entered the market with DUFF.              A delicious orangey taste that mockingly counters the color palette of beer, the low stamina days become high stamina days and the Simpson's brand logo puts a blissfully dorky smile on my face.  The bubbly tonic is rightfully simple in taste, without the excessive extravagance of other energy drinks that make your teeth wonder when they might get brittle and break like the stumpy columns of ancient Greece (i.e. Arizona green tea energy drink).  Don't let a cartoon brand Energy Drink parody of beer fool you either. This liquid delivers with a steady caffeine peak, without a draining crash. It is a drink that delivers in the substance of product and exceedingly well in the décor of its package. Ay Caramba!
5.0	tasty, nice texture. My kids love them. I love to have a whole box in the pantry for treats. I like the mini size, too, although I have to confess, I eat more than one way too often. No tree nuts.
5.0	Yum! Just enough blueberry flavor to take away the blandless of the average cup of tea. Honestly, it's the only tea I will drink.
5.0	Yum,, had this tea at a restaurant.  Had to order my own.
5.0	love this tea! this is the best earl grey, not too flowery , just enough flavor ....very comforting any time of year.
5.0	The only junk food I even have an interest in reaching for now. I can't even describe how delicious these are. If you rate these below a 5 you just don't like old bay in general....and you are nuts. A taste of home!
5.0	Roasted just right and has excellent smell and great taste. Nice big bag for large or small servings. Worth it.
5.0	This stuff is so delicious.  My husband is from Barcelona and told me about this, and since we are both garlic lovers I got it for him.  We put it on bread, chicken, more bread, our fingers, more bread, our fingers again... yum.  It is so impossibly light and intensely garlicky that we couldn't stop eating it.  If you like garlic, you should most definitely try this.
5.0	BEST GLUTEN FREE WHITE BREAD AVAILABLE! MOST REAL TEXTURE AND CLOSEST TO NORMAL TASTE!!
5.0	Just getting over a cold these are better than cough drops!
5.0	I bought my first few canisters of this stellar smoked salt from a consolidator/surplus grocery warehouse. If I had known how good it was going to be, I would have bought I all of their shelf stock on the spot. This salt is smokey good, subtle and tasty right from the hand. Made from salt naturally smoked over alder wood, you will find this salt much more mellow and savory than most on the market. It truly stands apart in everyday use as well as a finishing salt on fine dishes. It makes plain cottage cheese on sourdough rye toast sing. Needless to say, I'm pleased to see I can obtain this salt elsewhere as it has gladly become a regular staple in my cupboard, and a welcome gift to friends and family.
5.0	Pringles chips flavor, it is a little salty and a little sweet? (or some other flavor). As far as the shipping, it was delivered on time and in good condition. Another reviewer said theirs were crushed a little. Not sure on that, maybe what else you have in the order matters, but these were fine.
5.0	I now eat food as an excuse to eat salt. I was exposed to this kind of salt last year when my gourmet stepmother sent me some for Christmas. Just as time is divided between when Jesus was alive and then dead and resurrected, this salt is good enough to register a before-fleur-de-sel and after-fleur-de-sel in the timeline of my life. I do consider it a gift from God.
1.0	Dried out and gross!  Poor quality
5.0	"Love it!  Hearty soup with wonderful flavor...and yes, the beans did break down to a thick \\""soupy\\"" consistency after 5 hours of simmering. Adding this to my staples list."
5.0	I'll admit it, I used to be a Sweet-n-Low and then Splenda junkie. After using Truvia, I've never looked back (er... except when they don't have Truvia available). It has a raw-sugar sort of texture to it, meaning it's much more granular than other artifical sweeteners and it's less sweet I think? A whole packet of Sweet-n-Low is wayyyyy to much for me and I get stuck with that saccharine taste in my mouth. I still only use about 3/4 packet of Truvia, but it only tastes like too much sugar if I over-sweeten.<br /><br />Try a small box if you've never had it and are skeptical, but I definitely order this by the 300-count.
5.0	Arrived quickly, pretzels are fresh and tasty.  These have been my favorites for quite awhile but are almost impossible to find in Wyoming.  The price was okay , too.  I eat them almost every day.
5.0	item arrived fast and in the condition described. i have used it and they are very fragrant, next best thing to fresh leaves!
5.0	Loved my purchase, will definitely buy again!!!!! The purchase was easy, the product came sooner than expected and with a coupon towards future purchases!
5.0	But FYI these are less than $3 per box at Walmart so 9x3=$27 so this is not a great deal.
1.0	This does not have the consistency of the Chunky that comes in the can. Ill probably keep it around in the event of a disaster.
5.0	"Have you wondered (or are you still wondering) why the hotel's waffle mix tastes so good, and it seems like you have a hard time replicating the recipe with the waffle mix you got from the grocery stores ?<br /><br />Well, I have and it was baffling! I didn't give up on my wish to be able to make the YUMMIEST waffle at my own kitchen.<br />I went to Amazon.com and encountered this product \\""Golden Malted\\"" Waffle mix. [[ASIN:B001ELL60W Golden Malted Pancake & Waffle Flour, Original, 33-Ounce Cans (Pack of 3)]]<br /><br />At first, I was hesitant, especially after seeing that it only comes in a pack of 3 -- \\""I still have those 'failed' old waffle flours in the kitchen, why would I buy 3 to simply try? \\""<br /><br />After extensive reviews both on amazon and google, I decided to try it as a lot of people gave it good ratings and agreed that it tastes like the hotel's waffle mix.<br /><br />The result ? OMG, the waffle was mouth-watering. I followed the recipe written: Mix waffle flour + eggs + some water + butter.<br />Using a Belgian waffle maker, cooking was about 5 min. The aroma was just heavenly. I paired it with \\""Grade B - dark amber\\"" Real Mapple Syrup [[ASIN:B00271OPVU Coombs Family Farms 100% Pure Organic Maple Syrup Grade B, 32-Ounce Jug]]. (Yes, there are imitation waffle syrup out there!) It was really the YUMMIEST waffle I ever made -- crispy on the outside, moist in the inside and it's not heavy (like pancakes)<br /><br />I have been buying this waffle mix and truly recommend it to those who have been in 'the hunt of the perfect waffle mix'<br /><br />They have the \\""all natural\\"" [[ASIN:B001EO6BFE Golden Malted All Natural Waffle & Pancake Mix, 33-Ounce Containers (Pack of 3)]] and \\""blueberry flavored\\"" [[ASIN:B0042RNHVG Golden Malted Pancake & Waffle Flour, Blueberry, 16-Ounce Cans (Pack of 4)]]. I have not tried these. And, I think I am staying with the \\""original\\"".<br /><br />Enjoy !"
5.0	I am writing this review after using the product for 3 weeks. I love this because it is 100% chrysanthemum. I love the flavor of the yellow flower. What I get in local grocery store comes with high sugar content or honey. Real dry flower cost so much that I paid $7 for 0.3 oz tea. Even with the shipping cost this is much cheaper. The packaging is very good. Only disadavantage is, it takes almost 3-4 weeks for the product to arrive. I will purchase it again and highly recommend it.
5.0	Use it  to blend with regular coffee.  To me  it is to sweet tasting alone. Love the blended taste.  Makes regular coffee a little  healthier for you.
5.0	Very flavorful.  full rich flavor.  If you like a nice smooth dark coffee this is for you.
5.0	you do need to know that five pounds is a bunch of coffee. if you have two people drinking about 4-6 cups a day (i think our grind & brew carafe counts five ounces as a cup), which i think was our rate, it will take you about month to five weeks to get through it. after four weeks it can lose a good deal of its flavor, so you want to try to use it before then.  we keep the unused portion in ziploc gallon bags, otherwise i don't think we would even get four to five weeks out of it.  for the price, you can't beat it, and if the last little bit gets a little stale then you can always move on to another bag or realize that you need to find someone to coffee-pool with next time you order a five pound bag. they also sell one pound bags, which i've not tried yet.
5.0	I came across this Mina Harissa spicy sauce by chance.  It absolutely knocked my socks off, and I am in love.<br />My first time at it, I started off pretty conservatively with scrambled eggs.  After the first bite, I have since<br />fallen TOTALLY in love with this sauce, I put loads of it on and cover every square inch of my plate, and I refuse to make scrambled eggs unless I have this sauce...<br />no joke, buy this sauce, and you will experience happiness.  That is, until you run out ;)  If you dig hot sauce, you should probably buy two or so right off the bat.<br /><br />Once you try this sauce, you will be hooked.  Gauranteed.
1.0	I wanted a coarse salt, rock salt, not fine grain. I am very disappointed with this product. I wanted to use the salt in my water for rehydration but the fine salt makes the water unbearable to drink. I am having to order the coarse himalayan salt from another company. I will not order this brand again.
5.0	Tasty, Organic , Goodness. I was asked to do a test and review of these tasty lentils. I'm not overly familiar with indian food, but I'm always trying to expand my families tastes so the first thing I did was look up recipes. I tried out these lovely beans in a simple Easy Masoor Daal recipe. My entire family loved it, and I have some pretty picky eaters.<br />This is a healthy, tasty, high protein bean that has no artificial colors, flavors or preservatives.
5.0	We love this brand & my 4 yr old son eats it daily. It's slightly saltier & oilier than other healthier brands, but that makes it more flavorful & less earthy tasting
5.0	Please bring it back... I NEEED MORE!
5.0	I was pleased to find this spice through Amazon because none of the stores in the area carried it.  I made many recipes without this spice thinking it would not make much difference, now I would not ever leave it out. Because it comes in a pack of three I shared the great spice and recipes with friends.  The spice arrived in good condition and a timely manner.
1.0	Gross! I had one cup and threw away the other 23 cups.  It's doesn't taste like coffee.  It tastes just like it's all creamer and sugar.  It tastes completely fake and leaves a nasty aftertaste in your mouth.  It tastes like the Great Escapes Caramel flavored K-cups.  The only flavored and sweetened k-cups that I have found that I like is Great Escapes Mocha flavored k-cups.
5.0	Excellent cola taste and aroma. Perfect water/syrup/carbonation mix. It is like 'Soda Head Fountain' Pepsi in a can.
5.0	This is amazing. What a great way to sweeten things without all the negative effects of sugar for your body, teeth, etc. The xylitol blends in so beautifully with so many foods. As soon as I opened the bag that wonderful vanilla aroma wafted through the kitchen! The vanilla flavor really soaks into the xylitol (and continues to stay strong, thanks to the vanilla bean in the bag), making this the perfect non-sugar sweetener to add sweetness, flavor, and depth. I loved this!
5.0	The best I have tasted since the 2 Kilo bag I had of them in turkey!
5.0	Wouldn't change brands. Drinking Maxwell for 55 years.
5.0	The coconut is is dry but when used with wet ingredients it softens.  It has the perfect coconut flavor and I really like the fact that it is unsweetened.  That way I can control the amount of sugar in the recipe.  Thanks to Bob my coconut macaroons were a hit!
5.0	Hands down the best cappuccino ever. I am so glad I found it on here because I can't find it anywhere else. The price was really good also.
5.0	These are a Great size and healthy.  They satisfy the craving for something crisp and are reasonable calorie wise.
5.0	I got these on a lightning deal.  I'm happy with the flavor.
5.0	An awesome alternative if you have celiac disease! Taste great!
5.0	An excellent product for those who want to monitor the carbs in their diet and increase their fiber intake.  The tortilla taste very good and is vast dietary improvement over a highly processed flour tortilla.  I would certainly recommend the tortillas for health conscious individuals.
5.0	Good tea for the price. I steeped for twice the label recommendation and it works for mornings and ice tea.
5.0	I love this product!  It is tastier than raisin brand. The cinnamon adds a nice flavor and the raisins juicy. Very good. I look forward to eating it in the morning.
5.0	I bought this for my husband for Valentine's. He loved the flavors of the hot sauces as well as the motif. There is a good mix of not too spicy and pretty spicy.
5.0	I found these to be less expense than the local stores. Fast delivery. Even my husband likes these and are better for him since we are in our retirement age we are always looking for healthier alternatives for snacking.
5.0	I tried this today and it was delicious!  It's not the texture you at first expect from eggplant, the flavors bridge that, and are really great.  Next time I will put this over rice. : )
5.0	Melitta's Caf&eacute; de Europa Espresso Toscana, extra dark roast, has taken over as our number one coffee choice. I'm not sure why the previous reviewer had trouble with the product; we have never ended up with grounds in our coffee, and we use it in the Keurig several times a day. If you prefer a robust dark roast coffee, try this one from Melitta. It's a winner.
5.0	so easy to make your own kefir! we are never without fresh kefir in our home. when we get down to the end of kefir, we just add more milk and put it on top of our fridge for 24 hours. the milk we use is already pasturized so no need to go through heating process.
5.0	All I can say is, &#34;WOW&#34;!  I'm a foodie who's wondered for quite some time if the 'authentic' balsamic vinegar from Italy is really worth the price.  Well, now I can say, absolutely yes!  The aroma is heavenly.  The texture is wonderfully thick and syrupy - beats the heck out of having to reduce American balsamic vinegar on a stovetop.  The flavor is complex, sweeter, richer - still tart but not excessively acidic.  It is perfect as a glaze or dipping sauce.  Have not tried it as a marinade yet - and might not because it's quite expensive.  I would love to hear feedback from readers who regularly use balsamic vinegar as a marinade - what type do you use?
5.0	Not one was broken on arrival!  Very cute!
5.0	Fantastic coconut oil.  I will become a subscriber.
5.0	This is very good tea. I'm going to serve this to my friends.
5.0	this is addictive yet good for you! the price is great and got here fast !!! THANKS FOR THE GREAT PRODUCT
5.0	Both caff and decaff teas in a large variety of flavors. I put them in a glass container so I could find the tea to fit my mood. Very nice.
5.0	[[VIDEOID:89db2c50c5cb56b9889645bfef77fac2]] I received a free sample for review, but, as with other Viva Labs products, all that means is that I'll end up buying more.<br /><br />This is great quinoa. It's good on salads, but I made some in my rice cooker (like I make oatmeal), and it was simply sublime. The quality is definitely high, the bag makes it easy to see when you need more, and the only fault with it is that 1lb isn't enough! It just goes too quickly when making hot cereal. For salads and the like, this will last you quite a while, and the bag will ensure it stays fresh.<br /><br />This company makes nothing but great products, it seems. I've genuinely enjoyed every single item of theirs that I've tried.
5.0	Organic cashew butter is not easily available in the stores so I ordered this Wilderness Poet's gallon jar online. I must say that the butter is much more tastier and creamier than the ones I have tried before (Nature Farms brand for instance). There are no added salt or sugar. This works well for me and I will order it again.
5.0	Our club was hosting a walking taco fundraiser, and I was in charge of this items donation.  All the regular places you would think of buying them in quantity was over the top in pricing.  There was no way our fund raiser would have made a profit!  Someone said check Amazon, and lo and behold, I did.  They arrived in good shape, on time, and our club's fundraiser was a huge success!
5.0	So, my father in law was diagnosed with Celiac Disease after 75 years of eating whatever he wanted.  You can imagine how challenging it is to go to a diet that doesn't include so many of the things that he had eaten for years without any idea that they were actually having such an adverse affect on him.<br /><br />The Gluten-Free Pantry items, and in particular, this sandwich bread mix, has made life just a bit easier so there's at least one thing he can have.  It tastes a lot better than any other mix my mother in law has made, and if you toast it, you really can hardly tell the difference.  I know one thing that has also helped, is freezing it in Tupperware to help retain fresh flavor.  Once (and I really think this is going to be any gluten free bread) sits out on the shelf for more than a day or two, it doesn't taste as great.<br /><br />So in conclusion, after trying MANY different mixes, this one consistently comes out great-even after mixing the ingredients wrong at times, it just is pretty much a no fail mix.  Good luck!
5.0	Took about 6 months for the milk to come out thick, but these babies fermented beautifully after some time.  Be patient, will come out watery at first.  Grow well too. I gave away quite a few in the year and a half I've had them.  Glad I bought them!
5.0	Taste great and really helpful if you're somewhere hot and just can't seem to keep hydrated. I was in East Africa suffering from a terrible headache when a nurse friend suggested I try one of these. Halfway through the bottle I felt 100% better. I didn't even realize I was dehydrated! Definitely recommend to keep a few of these handy when traveling, or if you're like me and just don't drink enough water on a daily basis like you know you should.
5.0	It was just what I needed for the family get-together.  Everyone enjoyed it very much.  I cannot find this in my neighbor hoods store.
5.0	I bought this to make orange blossom cakes, but I can't seem to stop finding uses for it!  Candy, cocktails, aromatic rice etc...  It's great sprinkled over vanilla ice cream with a little orange juice.  I also recommend the &#34;white coffee&#34; recipe on the label for a sore throat.  Heck, you could even use it to naturally scent homemade cleaners!
1.0	This tea was not what I expected.  I love cinnamon tea and was very disappointed with this product.  The tea does not have a strong cinnamon flavor which I enjoy.  This tea has a stronger Rooibos flavor than cinnamon flavor.  Furthermore, I found that the product description does not give a full list of the tea's ingredients.  The ingredients listed on the box include:  Cinnamon, Licorice Root, Orange Peel, Indian Sarsaparilla, Chicory Root, Rooibos, Natural Flavors, Star Anise, Almond Extract and Locorice Extract
5.0	I love how this cacao powder is sugar-free and organic.  This allows you to add whatever sugar you choose to your recipe without sacrificing your particular diet.  It takes wonderfully and the powder is nice and fine which makes it easy to measure.  I recommend this product to anyone who would like a conscious minded company that has a product that is well made and tastes great!!
5.0	Although I've never been to Peet's home (Seattle or Pacific Northwest), I had an opportunity to try Peet's coffee somewhere and loved it. So when I saw their coffee in k-cups, I knew I had to have it. Excellent. Very strong (but that's the point!) but not bitter or harsh. You can really 'get your coffee on' with Peet's!
5.0	Robust but Mild - If that can even be accomplished. I had tried so many coffee varieties that I was beginning to think I was not going to find something that suited me.  Well, I finally found it. The Fog Chaser is not as strong as French Roast but has the body and depth of flavor that I want for my morning cup. Because it is so satisfying, I am actually drinking less coffee, if you can believe that! I guess it's like a rich dessert; a little goes a long way.
5.0	I really loved these things...almost too much.<br /><br />They don't have anything in them that isn't identifiable as a whole food.  (That was always my problem with Clif bars...sort of unnatural.)<br /><br />The quality of the dark chocolate is really high in the Dark Chocolate, Nuts, and Sea Salt bar.  It is not that greasy, oily, over-processed chocolate that you see with most granola or energy bars.  I also like when I can taste the sea salt in the bar; it's a nice contrast to the dark chocolate.<br /><br />I think there is a good variety of nuts and seeds in this bar to get a range of nutrients, so that's a plus.<br /><br />I don't think they are filling enough to serve as a meal replacement, but they are for sure a healthy snack that you can feel good about eating.<br /><br />I've actually used them as a quick dessert option after dinner when you just want a little something sweet.
5.0	I got these for a baby shower and they arrived in great shape.  Very cute and I like that they are individually wrapped.
5.0	first off, i am not a chef nor trained in any way in food!! but i know what i like and i love this vinegar!! we put it on fruit & veg, with oil or other ingredients, many, many things!! its almost sweet so its great for dessert but its a match with savory as well!! we love it and will certainly buy it again!! and we have told absolutely every one we know about it!! even our grandkids like it!!
5.0	I ordered it on Friday and it arrived by Monday, and I live in Hawaii. Delicious candy - everyone loves it!
1.0	We love oriental food, and this looked like a good idea to buy and try. I am sorry to say, that this product tasted so &#34;bad&#34; to us, we only ate about half of a serving. Honestly, the taste was extremely cloying, bland, almost to the point of making us gag. This product left a terrible aftertaste to us, full of lingering garlic. We took the suggestions of some other reviewers, adding canned Chinese veggies (we had no frozen ones available). I tried adding a bit of soy sauce, and a dash or two of Chinese five spice. Nothing did much to improve it. If you try it, you may really like it. But for a respected company (Knorr/Lipton), this is something that we will not buy again. I give the product only the one star, because you can't go lower and still rate it. I will state that the actual noodle, after preparation, (you cannot separate the noodle from a flavor packet as you can with most instant raman products), was a higher quality instant noodle than a regular instant raman noodle, in our opinion.
5.0	So yummy!  I bought a jar for my daughter when she was pregnant...took her through pregnancy, labor and beyond!  Bought them to give to kiddies in my restaurant, they are a big hit!  And, just recently bought a jar for my mom who is going through chemo, she loves them!
5.0	My husband and I were inspired by the books &#34;Eat to Live&#34; and &#34;The China Study&#34; to clean up our diets and eat healthier, whole foods. As part of our new diet, we try to get in as many varieties of whole foods every day, from different vegetables and fruits, to a huge medley of seeds and grains. The hemp hearts are the newest addition to our pantry of stable foods. Here's what we've learned about them so far:<br /><br />1. I can't find them at the grocery store--not the regular grocery store I use or the health food store I frequent. I was hoping to find them in bulk for cheaper, but they are nowhere to be found in my city. Therefore, Amazon is my resource, so I'm perfectly happy with the price, even though at first it seemed high to me.<br /><br />2. At first, I thought I'd add them to my morning cereal, along with my regular additions of flax seed and chia seed. However, the taste was just not appealing to me. To be perfectly honest, I thought they tasted like snot. My husband thinks they taste more like mushrooms. I couldn't bring myself to eat them in my cereal though, so we decided to hide them in other foods.<br /><br />3. My husband makes a delicious granola with almonds and coconut. He started adding a cup of the hemp hearts to the recipe. I love the granola and can't taste the hemp hearts at all...so I put about a quarter cup of the granola on my morning cereal and get the health benefits of the hemp hearts. We also add them to breads.<br /><br />The packaging says to try sprinkling them on yogurt, but that just wouldn't suit my taste buds...so get creative! There's definitely a way to enjoy the health benefits of these even if you don't love the flavor!
5.0	I visited a boutique food cafe where I had the opportunity to do a complete balsamic vinegar tasting of high end vinegars. This was the best and until you do a tasting, you can not believe the difference in taste. Since I fell in love with it, the shop discontinued the Elsa so I have purchased it a couple of times online. It's well worth it!!
5.0	It's a bag of individually-wrapped Atomic Fireballs. If you like Atomic Fireballs, and you want a lot of them, get this. It's a lot cheaper than getting them at a candy store.
1.0	It gave me a stomach ache!
5.0	I tried these noodles for the first time last night, and they were delicious. They only take 3-5 minutes to cook. I made shrimp scampi and put it over the noodles. It's a great product - I highly recommend it!
5.0	These chocolates are the best! So rich and full of flavor. I try to eat at least 1 per day for the health benefits of dark chocolate. Plus they donate some of their proceeds to help the animals!
5.0	If you are a meat lover you might not like it as much, however this Cedar Lake Deli-Granks vegan can food is good news to vegetarians.  It's meatless and fat-free, plus it tastes pretty good.  Recommended!
5.0	We love this lemon tea, but we cannot find it in our area. Excellent flavor!
5.0	"Whoah! After the senseo pods because unavailable in any stores I shop at, and getting weird backstock and supply issues from senseos site-ordering, I finally looked at amazon again after a long time, and I found these bad boys! I picked the \\""izzy blend\\"" whatever thats supposed to be, based on the description of the coffee, and its PERFECT. The pods are all oversized, which means when in the single pod brew tray thing, makes an ample amount of really good, creamy coffee. Theyre also all individually wrapped in foil, each like a bulging condom in the wrapper. That keeps them amazingly fresh. This coffee is good, at least the ones I got, really good. When I brew this, people pop out of hiding spaces sniffing around and mutterring \\""coffee! coffee... coffeecoffee! that smells like coffee!\\"" and it does. I love my senseo machine, despite the issues ive had with it, I prefer the idea of ground coffee still instead of weird magical coffee concentrates. I never expected coffee this good to come from that thing! I tried using the \\""reuseable pods\\"" which didnt amount to anything but some watery, slightly foamy, weak dribble. That was with the eco, and the duck, and that other thing. I'm in love with my senseo machine again! If you want creamy coffee, that tastes like COFFEE, without being some kind of awful acid filled starbucks over-coffee, then go for this. Its simply a damn good mug of coffee that does its job when it literally opens my eyes and wakes me up in the morning. Would highly reccomend this to anyone, the coffee is just great, its packaged perfectly, and the oversized pods are something I still cant get over.<br /><br />Thug life homies, may your pencils never dull, your fridge always be full, and may there be plenty of ninjas to snipe in your dreams.<br />Good day."
5.0	Excelent smoky taste from the smoked Jalapeno's.  Just be careful and don't over do it , a couple of dashes will be enough for most folks in their cooked foods.
5.0	My daughter loves yogurt melts.  We got the strawberry ones, and they are really good as usual.  So expensive, but worth it when I see my daughter all excited to get a bowl of them.
5.0	I buy this by the case for my husband. It's his Christmas present every year. It's the only hot sauce he uses.
5.0	EXCELLENT !!!!! i WOULD STRONGLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO ALL OF THOSE WHO NEED TO IMPROVE HEALTH AND ENERGY..IT'S AWESOME
5.0	I bought this hot sauce for my husband for Christmas because he loves hot and spicy anything.  I heard about Dave's on the Food Network and got on line immediately to find it.  I have only tried one small bite of food that my husband had put 2 drops into a large batch.  It burned in my mouth for about 10 minutes.  Not intolerable burn but for what little he used I was impressed.  He LOVES it and I know I will continue to purchase this brand on line.
5.0	Delicious coffee and a fraction of the price you'd pay in the store for the same amount.  I've ordered it a few times now.
5.0	I gave this box of candy as a gift to my pet clinic staff for Christmas.  They all seemed eager to dig in.  Takes care of everybody in one gift.  Who doesn't like See's?

5.0	Amazing flavor!!  Plan on trying others varieties.
5.0	It's a great way to cook for your family and it stretches out by buying it by the gallon!  I will buy this oil again, it tastes great!
5.0	Delicious!!! This wonderful chocolate sampler comes in the perfect little individually wrapped pieces. all three of the flavors are great. so smooth.
5.0	Had been looking for this size in the local stores and they don't carry it.  Use it on everything.  Extremely pleased.
5.0	Recieved product yesterday (very pleased by the fast shipping). It was great. I gave it to my mom for her 50th birthday. She loved the little toys. The toys were a good quality, not cheap plastic things. The time capsule is a cute package to hold all the goodies.
5.0	Great taste.  Highly recommend it.  Way better for you than most commercial oatmeal.  Just look up what the glycemic index is for regular oatmeal and you'll see why this is so much better for you.
1.0	I have eaten the varieties of these for years and appreciate the concept- organic, not over salted, good varieities, etc.    But more and more often, whether purchased here or in the store, in all varieties, the chips come with a sharp odor and flavor that to more suggests that rancid oil was used.  Sometimes it is subtle, sometimes terrible, and I am sick of wondering if I am eating something that has gone bad- and rancid oils are really bad for you, which defeats the purpose of this product. I can return them to a store but not to Amazon.  This is still a huge pain and not something that anyone should have to do.  I had to throw out a whole case of sesame blues from Amazon, which is a bad deal at any price. I am done with your rancid products.
5.0	The good thing is that this bread keeps for many months so buying in bulk is a great idea.  Enjoy the taste of German bread.  Dense and moist.
5.0	I like herbal teas and have tried many different brands and flavors.  This one stands above them all!  I drink about two cups every day and my skin color improved a great deal after several weeks!
5.0	I live in California now and grew up on the east coast. I had to order some to make myself Coffee Milk and share it with my boyfriend who is from the west coast. It tastes like home!
5.0	These are awesome. Wish they would start making them again!
5.0	They were great!!  Can't always find in stores.
5.0	This is REAL popcorn and is delicious!!!
5.0	Good to have when you're on the go
5.0	Our favorite medium-body coffee.  Smoooooth!
5.0	I went to the west coast and fell in love with these Limon chips!  They are the best chip I've ever tasted and addictive.  Of course  when I got back to the south, they were nowhere to be found.  Everyone needs to write Lays Co. and ask them to do another survey in the south for these chips.  It's been since 2000 and people's taste have changed since then.  I'll definitely buy a case if I can find them.
5.0	This is the best Cappuccino on the market! And so easy to get! I love the auto orders! I don't have to remember to order it before I run out!
5.0	Coffeemate lite has always been my preferred pick of the available varieties! Creamy & lite with fewer calories than the traditional Coffeemate!! Hope they continue to offer this selection fir YEARS to come!!
5.0	works great for specialty coffee and frozen drinks. The flavor is spot on with those seasonal favorite coffee shop drinks. It's so good! Will buy again.
5.0	I discovered this sugar while living in Florida and always used it to finish off my fruit pies before placing them in the oven (moisten the top crust w/a little water or milk and dust with this sugar - it remains crunchy throughout and adds a wonderful texture to your pies, especially apple!)  After moving to California, I could not locate it in any of my local supermarkets but, lo and behold, Amazon carries it and saved my reputation!  You will find that it is also a wonderful additive to hot and cold cereals (non-sweetened, of course), pancakes and crepes, muffins, plain yogurt, buttermilk,  etc, etc, etc....use your imagination and  enjoy!  BL.  Just gotta add on another use that tops them all:  My fave hot weather refreshment is the MOJITO...but I usually have difficulty getting it made to MY exacting taste.....BUt, I recently came across a recipe for the drink which recommends using Demerara sugar for the simple syrup (like they do in Cuba)....fresh like juice and fresh mint, good quality WHITE rum ...and a splash of club soda at the end.  You can't believe the difference the Demerara sugar makes!!!!  Soooo good!<br />Bring to boil equal parts water and sugar, cool and store in fridge.  Yum.  BL
5.0	This was great, It came only in 3 days. And, It was in a perfect shipping package. A little pricey but, it's worth it. Delicious 👌
5.0	I've eaten this chocolate almost every day for years.  It's the least bitter and creamiest 100% I've found.  Pralus attributes this to extra-long conching (machine kneading), but I imagine that it also has a lot to do with added cocoa fat.  It's not an especially complex chocolate.  The most complex and &#34;interesting&#34; 100% I've tried is from Dandelion in San Francisco (see their web site); but theirs isn't as creamy as Pralus' (no added cocoa fat) and it costs twice as much.  To appreciate any 100% chocolate let it melt in your mouth--don't chew it!  And if you've never eaten 100%  before I'd  recommend starting with, say, 75-80% and slowly working toward the complete elimination of sugar.  A final note:  some makers of high-end chocolate wrap their bars in thick, sturdy foil that can be unwrapped and re-wrapped many times without tearing, and they score their bars deeply so that they can easily and neatly be broken into squares.  Pralus does neither of these things.
5.0	I've compared bunch of different grade B syrups, and this is up there with the best of them, but mush more affordable.  Item arrived much quicker than was originally estimated.
5.0	Great product from a great honey farm (which I've been to) and sold by great people!!!
5.0	I have ordered this several times and have been very pleased. Initially we had some packaging issues with the bags but everyone was great to work with and the problem was resolved. Highly recommend. Great taste.
5.0	When I found this sauce I stopped making my own.  This is as good as I ever made so now I just vary it to my own tastes.  Fabulous and versatile.  Saves time in the kitchen, who else can help with that!
5.0	We order all our tomato products from Muir glen. They are thick and not cut with lots of water like some brands. Worth the money.
5.0	Great way to relax your dough.  If you are looking hair relaxer, this isn't for you.
1.0	I haven't tasted them yet, but I did recieve one soup with gluten. Ok it says gluten free here on the site. I can't eat gluten so now what?
1.0	Unfortunately these did not taste right  at all. Something is really off... Nowhere near butterscotch, or any flavor
5.0	I love this seasoning mix, and now it's not in any grocery store in Houston. Very disappointed that McCormick has pulled it off the shelves.  I hope they don't stop making it. It is a great additional flavor to pasta chicken soup. I add it and some frozen vegetables & a can of chicken breast meat to make a soup that even guest think is homemade.  I specially like to add baby lima beans and extra carrots. This feeds a family of 3 for 2 nights.  I am so glad to find it on Amazon.
5.0	This is the best full flavored honey ever.  You can't go wrong with this in tea, coffee or just on a spoon; great taste
1.0	The worst tasting Coconut water. It tastes like the water was extracted after coconut is too old. I will never buy this again
5.0	Molinella is great quality Arborio rice, vacuum packed in 6 individual 1lb boxes for freshness. I think the quality of this brand is equal to or better than RiceSelect brand which I was using for a year before discovering Molinella brand. I regularly cook risotto the way I learned it from a master chef in Italy and this brand tastes the most similar to his risotto with the most similar consistency and texture as well.
5.0	We love Skippy and this was such a good deal!!  I couldn't get any better even if I matched sale prices to coupons.
5.0	I am completely addicted to my Chai- and I've gotten 2 friends at work hooked, as well.  We split the box I bought here, and it was less expensive ($2.21/box of 20) than when we get it by the single box in the grocery store ($2.59/box).  Definitely worth it, especially if you can get the free shipping!  Who needs coffee??!?
5.0	Finally Amazon has these again.  My all time favorite thin spaghetti.  Love the &#34;tooth&#34; and the texture.  At high altitude, regular spaghetti takes too long to cook, and other brand's so called thin spaghetti is more like angel hair pasta.  I even contacted De Cecco directly to find out why no stores in my area carry the spaghettini, but if Amazon continues to offer this, I'm thrilled.
1.0	Wow this was really strong and had a bit of a &#34;fake&#34; taste to it....
5.0	This is a very tasty Guatamalan Antigua.
5.0	So excited, because you can not buy these in my area. These are my favorite snack ever.
5.0	This is an absolutely wonderful coffee substitute.  It has great taste without any of the acid of real coffee.  Acid is so bad for our bones--especially if you have osteoporosis.  Thus, Teeccino is another way to limit acidity.
5.0	Round, no string or tag.  Works great in my coffee machine.  We do not drink coffee, we just use it for tea
5.0	This is the best tasting snack I've ever had.  at work they have them in the vending machine, and on a daily basis I get them.  I decided I should order some for myself instead of using all my change in the machine!  They are healthy for you, and taste as though you have scooped up fresh salsa onto a chip.  The brown rice chips themselves are delicious, very light with an interesting taste.  I highly recommend this!
5.0	very good flavor. will order again
5.0	TruVibe's Gogi Berries are very good and soft. This is also a fantastic company with owners that go above and beyond in customer service. Their website offers very informative information for you with regards to their products, history and company mission. This is a company with integrity and one that you will feel good about supporting.
5.0	Delish!!!!!! I want to start taking this with me to sushi!
5.0	Use this product all the time.  Have a hard time finding it in a store so I order on-line and ordering From Amazon was cheapest! And free shipping!
5.0	I love Indian foods.  Working in a small town with no Indian restaurant in sight.  Products from Kitchens of India are the next best things for me when I crave for Indian foods.  Definitely would buy it again.  Not too spicy, just perfect for me.
5.0	These mushrooms are wonderful to add to so many dishes.  They're delicious and so convenient.<br />As science finds more reasons to include them in our diets, they have become more than just a garnish.
5.0	Have a bowl of this cereal almost every morning with Almond Milk.  Really tasty!
5.0	This is the best best hoisin there is. It's worth ordering here where you get 3, instead of getting a sub par one at the grocery store.
5.0	The best Extra Virgo.n Olive Oil , love it the pure, the extreme flavor. So light ! so good. Especially with the vegies.
5.0	It works very well. And it really solved my husband's problem. I will recomend it to my friends who need it.
5.0	Sooooooo good! Easy to make addictive!
1.0	buyer beware,  one small 2 ounce bag, over $3 a ounce, can be purchased for half the price just look around.
1.0	Tastes horrible, leaves a greasy feeling inside my mouth after and made me nauseated. Nooo thanks.
5.0	I lost count of how many jars of the Airborne Manuka Wildflower Honey we've bought after the count got beyond 100. Manuka can be so strong that it just tastes ugly, but this version tastes great and still has the great health benefits of the Manuka. Also, not that this affects the taste or 'food' quality, but the packaging is so darned attractive, right down to the squarish jar...although I DO wish the jar was glass since I've kind of gone off plastic. Overall, though, it's just great. Only from New Zealand! Love that country!!
1.0	About half of these are not compatible with the Keurig 2.0 model.
5.0	Had this tea in Italy I fell in love with it.  Makes a great ice tea no sugar needed.
5.0	Great coffe! I enjoy it! Very good price and quick delivery! I will continue to buy it! Thank you.
5.0	Okay, let's face it. Most of us don't drink as much water as we should because it's so plain. This year, I needed to lose about 40 pounds and I decided to take it one step at a time. My first goal was to drink NOTHING BUT WATER. That's when I was given a free sample of Dasani drops. I've been drinking nothing but water or water flavored with Dasani Drops ever since. I'm more hydrated, I'm losing weight, and I'm not taking in unnecessary amounts of sugar. They tasted a little funny to me at first but I actually really fell in love with the taste and I'm really starting to enjoy drinking water, even without the drops. This has really helped me along and I highly recommend!
5.0	Raw Pepitas / No Shell Pumpkin Seeds (16oz bag) make a nice treat eaten just as they are or mixed into a raw nuts and fruits trail mix.  Even used them in a version of &#34;fruit cake&#34; this holiday season.
5.0	I love cafe con leche and this is very close.  I just ordered more.
5.0	Excellent snack - good quality and price
5.0	Calming, slumber booster.. Major sleep trouble here.. have tried so many things..<br />This product does help me sleep deeper.. great taste too<br />Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
5.0	This seasoning is the best tasting. I make sure I always have plenty on hand for me and to share with friends. The sad part is that McCormick does not sell this in stores.
5.0	Great product, as described, fast service.
5.0	mmm mmm good very nice
5.0	The fragrance and taste of this coconut oil is beyond compare. So glad I discovered this one. Delicious!  I was using a different brand that had very little coconut taste. I will never go back.
1.0	Before you buy this read the reviews. I purchased the strawberry for my home made ice cream. It has a terrible, medicinal flavor. Before I read the reviews I wondered why it rated so high. As I read them I saw that the reviews weren't just for strawberry, they were for all the flavors. I don't know about the other flavors but I wouldn't have even given this one star if I didn't have to give it a rating.
5.0	Its not strong but it has a good taste and its pretty affordable.
5.0	Grandkids prefer this salad dressing to any others, and Costco stopped carrying it, so I ordered it from Amazon.  I like the fact that it does not contain High Fructose corn syrup which appears in so many other dressings.  Many times I simply use oil and vinegar for my salad, but if I am going to use a dressing, this is my preference as well.
5.0	Ordered this because it is supposed to be the healthiest salt there is.  I don't know if it's true, but it tastes like real salt and I will continue to use it.
1.0	I honestly thought, the way the folks at good ole Amazing Grass explained to me about how good the product is. I should of trust myself when it came to ordering this product. It's nasty, looks like dirt, smells awful, and when mixed with water bubbles, something is not adding up, I'm not to sure about this.
5.0	Zero calories, filling, and taste good!  I'm happy that I discovered this product. I will reorder this again. Try it.
5.0	Best vanilla extract for baking!
5.0	Could not do without my monthly delivery.  Love the price, flavor and the reduced coverings to reduce landfill waste.
5.0	I use this in my coffee both at home and at work.  The first time we saw this product was at Big Lots.  When I went back for more, they were no longer carrying it on our area, and we have 3 Big Lots stores in the Shreveport-Bossier City area.  I searched it out on Amazon and was delighted to see I could but it here.  Thanks Amazon, and thanks to Jordan's , too.
5.0	Works beautifully, love it!
5.0	My hair is natural and thick. I've used many brands of coconut oils and this is the best! It  gives my hair the moisture it needs. The texture is soft and it smells just like the actual coconut!  I also use it on my face and body. It leaves my skin amazingly soft! I will diffently use this product again!
5.0	This product is excellent very easy to prepare best results when you heat it on the stove taste like home made dal
5.0	I almost hesitated because of the cinnamon comments, but it is a fantastic tea.  Highly recommend it for chai lovers.
5.0	The ability to get the 100 count box shipped to my mail box made me a happy person. I will continue to shop for my tea here.
5.0	Best candy in the world! Everyone who likes coffee and chocolate should buy this item! Be careful as you're opening the wrapper, sometimes there's a lot of crumbs from shipping and handling.
5.0	Thank you for taking the time to make this jam and making it available to consumers... not many people know about rhubarb, let alone that it can be used in jams, as well as pies and cobblers. My dad grew rhubarb every year while I was growing up... quite a special treat!
1.0	Horrible...tastes nothing like vanilla
5.0	This white tea is some of the best I have had.  I will continue to buy it and will recommend it to my friends
5.0	If you like lime\lime flavor, you will love this product.  Our local stores quit selling this product so I was very relieved that I could find it on Amazon and ordered a case as we use it so much.  It is very versitile.  We use it just in water, in our smoothies, and in cooking.  It's a wonderful portable product that you don't have to worry about spoiling anytime soon like you do with fresh fruit.
5.0	Love it, Reminds me of all the summer trips to Seaside, wandering up and down Broadway. Best salt water taffy ever.
5.0	I love love love these and use them the most in everything. Especially in my meatloaf and the family raves.Also good in stews,etc. Perfect for using in every day cooking or putting away for food storage for future hard times. Just make sure you get the feel of how they work before you want to use them down the road. I make sure I use my veggies now to see what I like and what to order more of in the future to put away in my pantry of food storage items. Just grab what veggies you want as you plan dinner and start to prep and place amount needed in a cup or bowl of hot water. Then in about 5 or 10 minutes you can add to your meals. I loved using these. No more worrying about veggies going bad in the crisper. Works for me and I get compliments from my family. Especially when I use in meat loaf :-)
5.0	I drink many kinds of tea, especially fruit-flavored, but after trying Timothy's Lemon Blueberry Passion tea, I had found a new favorite.  I love the aroma this tea gives off when brewing.  It has a tendency to be a bit tart, but that is easily fixed with honey or Splenda.  The tea itself is a dark purple color, and has a lovely flavor with just a hint of lemon.  I would recommend this tea to anyone who enjoys a fruit-flavored tea.
5.0	Family loved the peppermint pig and the tradition of having it at Christmas.  Will do again this year. Thank you.
5.0	This is a great wellness drink.!
5.0	It's hard to find non-gmo crackers, let alone non-gmo crackers that taste good.  These are just delicious!  I highly recommend them.
5.0	This is just what I was looking for. Our local movie theatre used to use coconut oil but switched to a different oil and the popcorn is just not the same. It takes very little (1-3 tablespoons) oil to pop a large batch of popcorn.  Comes out light and delicious every time.
5.0	Chock-full of anti-oxidants, as per Dr. Greger, it's extremely sour but actually quite edible, I mean, drinkable with a juice. Just add the right amount -- half a tbsp will do. From what I've read in the comments, it's US made which gives it an additional cachet. Very good product.
5.0	Tully's is hard to beat for flavor.  Their house blend in particular is smooth, with enough of a robust edge to be flavorful.  Highly recommend this to anyone with a K-machine.
5.0	the best i have had, it has the right dryness not over dry, and has a great heat range buy it!
1.0	6 bottles were cracked in shipment and I threw them away.I also started drinking one and it tasted bad. I took the cover off of the bottle and it was also cracked.thank goodness there wasnt any shattered glass when I took a sip.not happy this time.I don'T BLAME THE COMPANY I BLAME THE SHIPPER.AFTER all this nonsense I ended up with only 4 bottles.
5.0	These are good spouting and have an excellent tastes. They have a good sprouting without many not sprouting. Alfalfa does not grow well in the heat and should be grown in winter or late fall and early spring.
5.0	prompt service and the product is just what I was hoping for
5.0	I absolutely love Dennison's.  It's not just the great taste, but Dennison's is also the thickest canned chili you will ever find.  They used to advertise that you could stand a fork in a bowl of Dennison's, and it's absolutely true.<br /><br />This stuff is great for making a quick meal.  Heat a can of Dennison's.  Warm a flour tortilla in a large fry pan.  Transfer the tortilla to a plate and spoon on some chili.  Sprinkle with grated cheddar cheese, then roll up.  Instant burrito!  One can makes enough burritos for 2-3 people, depending on appetite.
5.0	So yummy! Bought for using for my toddler as a reward for potty training. Finally tried one and they are amazing! Not fake sugar tasting and not overly sweet! Yum.<br />My daughter takes one lick and always says, &#34;mmmm!&#34;
5.0	This cruncy, multi-grain bar is absolutely tempting and gratifying. Definitely a guilty pleasure. I carry them in my purse frequently, I eat them after I run, and they're perfect in satisfying my desert fix. I have to mention that I've had different kinds of Snickers Marathon Energy Bars, and these are by far, the best of the line. So, I definitely recommend them, and considering that they are a bit pricey being sold individually in gas stations, etc - this price is worth it.
1.0	Any of the Keurig Vue products that contain fake milk have a chemical taste to them, it is not palitable
5.0	I ordered Kind bars after paying ridiculously high prices in retail stores. The Mango/Mac is delicious and it was fresh, soft & yummy. I was a bit worried after reading other reviews on Kind bars that they were old, stale or near their expiration dates - not true the box I ordered was wonderful.
5.0	PB2 is fantastic, and this was a good price. It came in a sealed package. I would order it again.
1.0	I can buy this item in my home town Gro store for $1.39, and you can make it at home from scratch for about 50 cents
5.0	Make this a tradition. It is lots of fun!
5.0	Hooray!! I have been hoarding a set of the tin packaged Mediteranean Spiced Sea Salt for years, thinking it was the last I would ever see. This is the PERFECT salt/spice for eggs, over-easy or omelette. Sounds expensive at almost $7 a jar, but the original was $5 a tin (four years ago) and this includes Prime shipping, so its actually not out of line.
5.0	Since so many recipes call for bay leaves I decided to get a fine quality organic product.  These bay leaves are exactly that - uniform size and unbroken.  I highly recommend them.
5.0	They are hot, very hot.  You may have to take it out of your mouth for a moment to give your tongue some relief.  But I eat them, well, like candy.  Why?  Sometimes I'm not hungry but my mouth wants to be stimulate (maybe that is a form of addiction), and sucking on these long-lasting fireballs is the trick.
5.0	To me, this is nearly the perfect tea! It is a green tea, so just light caffeine. The light fruity taste is just right, and love the little bits of papaya to give it that extra flavor. I love it hot, but have also discovered it makes a fantastic iced tea. A touch of sweetener seems to bring out the hint of strawberry even more. I have so many teas, but this one is truly my favorite! Plus you have the benefits of it being a green tea - who could ask for more?!
5.0	These are my husband's favorite kind of Skittles and we can't find them in stores anymore.  Thanks for making Christmas a little sweeter.
5.0	Everything in this box is great for individual snacks, or all put together for a meal on the go. The Tuna and crackers are very filling.The chocolate and applesauce are great! I like to refrigerate them if I get the chance. The trail mix is also great. The only bad thing is I would add more crackers to the bag as sometimes they get crushed. I always end up with extra tuna and no crackers to finish it
5.0	I started putting this in my morning smoothies about 9 months ago and I'm hooked. It blends well so I don't really notice the flavor (or I'm just really used to it). I like that it packs so much nutrition into such a small serving size. I feel more energized and balanced when I eat it and notice a difference when I get off it for awhile. Maybe it's placebo effect, but whatever it is, I really like the way this makes me feel.
5.0	Being gluten intolerant, I try lots of different GF products, just for the heck of it. Frankly I did not have all that much hope for this frozen pizza. But when I tried it, I was blown away. It is really, really delicious, and compares well to any non-GF fresh pizza I have had. I know. I know. I was a doubter too. Try it and see if you agree. I have offered this pizza to my non GF friends and they couldn't believe it was a frozen GF pizza.
5.0	This Hot cocoa is the best of all the different brands we've tried.  I would definately recommend this especially for kids.
5.0	Great taste and very fresh flavor.  I love the re sealable cap because I use a few tablespoons each morning to cool off my coffee and give it a hit if coconut flavor.  Yummy!
5.0	The product is fantastic! The only problem I have is that Amazon sent the box that the manufacture put the bags in instead of repackaging the box in a larger one. While I am a fan of not being wasteful, I am also a fan of boxes arriving intact. One was partially open when it arrived and the other was just a little banged-up. I did not want to deal with a return so I just kept both boxes. Very few bags had fallen out, if any. Plus, I'm surprisingly self conscious of what others see me buying- advertising that I was buying a box containing bags of kettle corn popchips was not very subtle. The chips are worth any self-conscoiusness I may have felt, though, because they are gluten-free and let me have a yummy crunch!
5.0	Ivory Coast dark is simply fantastic. It is great hot or cold and can be drank anytime of the day.
1.0	to expensive for flavor
5.0	The clear jel is exactly what I needed in my canning recipes. Thank you for the prompt service.
5.0	Super Great Christmas Gift!! Put Smiles on all the faces who saw the candy jelly bean jar!! Fast S/H Thank You  THM
1.0	This is probably the worst coffee I have ever had.  Product was weeks from expiring when I received it.  I love coffes, but would never buy this kind again!
5.0	great product, on-time delivery!!
5.0	"My senior dog who very nearly died from hepatitis has been on this during recovery and for almost two years since and is doing great! The vet said don't change it, it is probably part of the reason he is thriving. When he's finicky, I can encourage him to eat by holding a spoonful near his snout and he will usually lap it up afterward. Although, consistent finickiness may merit a change, during which times I've fed Castor and Pollux \\""Ultramix Whole Chicken Thigh, Fresh Cut Carrots & Sweet Potatoes Entree Grain-Free for Adult Dogs\\"", which is probably just as healthy and maybe a bit more appetizing. The Ultramix contains a very cooked thigh bone inside a whole chicken thigh, which you can carefully remove and smash into paste or leave out, if you're worried about your pooch eating it."
5.0	I was really pleased with the variety I received. It included most of the KCups I was really wanting to try from Brands I had heard great things about! Thanks!!
5.0	I really enjoyed the smooth taste of the vanilla and cinnamon. Not sure what it did for the skin, but was very relaxing to drink. This is my first time buying. I purchased because the price was very good. Yogi tea is normally to expensive for me to buy, if the price is reasonable I would love to try more.
5.0	The almond flour produced the best macarons I have ever made.<br />A guest said he has tasted macarons  in Paris  and these were BETTER!<br />The product is also ideal for making gluten free cakes and cookies.
5.0	Kelp noodles are a great alternative to pasta or rice noodles.  They can be served cold in salads or heated in paleo pad thai or thai soups!  Nice texture!
5.0	I ordered this when I found a few indian recipes that I wanted to try.  It would have been outrageous for me to buy all the spices individually but thankfully I found this.  All the spices come in separate baggies.  My only complaint is that when they arrived they were all jumbled up but there is a list that tells you where each one goes in the box and it was simple to follow,so it was no big deal.
5.0	very large--very good
5.0	Dry leaf, it has a fabulous apple scent! I'd love to have this scent around the house, very lovely!<br /><br />Taste, very nice black tea base with apple and rose flavor - I keep thinking the apple taste is a cross between a golden delicious in flavor, but has that red apple skin taste as well. The apple is quite delicate over the sturdy black tea base. The apple flavor lingers as an aftertaste. I like how the apple flavor is quite distinct and clean in flavor - I'm used to apple teas being either filler (that you can't taste), or paired with chocolate or spices, or tart. There's no tart here! The rose is quite light, but adds a little oomph to the apple - like I'm having tea and there's a fresh rose sitting next to my cup.<br /><br />The downside is the black tea is starting to go bitter. I had sampled it at 2.5 minutes, but thought it was weak, so it sat for another 45 seconds or so. I think 3 minutes at 200F is about perfect.<br /><br />I think I'd buy some of this one - I love the apple in this tea!<br /><br />Overall, very nice apple flavor - if you love apple teas this is for you!
5.0	Great popcorn. The kernels are on the small to medium size, but they almost all popped. The flavor was wonderful & the packaging gave us enuff popcorn for weeks. Highly recommended. The white corn seems sweeter, too.
1.0	This product seemed like the perfect answer to the expensive K-Cup's.  You can barely fill this up half way if you have any chance of not getting grounds in your coffee.  I routinely ended up with grounds floating in my coffee.  My morning ritual had to add time for fishing out the grounds from AM coffee.  Didn't exactly start my morning on the right foot.  I wasn't happy with the unpredictable strength of the regular K-Cups and this proved to only complicate the process. I am now a Pod Man!!  No problems at all!  I pawned my Keurig and this Cup on an unsuspecting associate.  He even thanked me for them!!  I enjoyed a chuckle at his expense after he left.
5.0	Use this every night in my after dinner coffee with a splash of cream a small amt. of sugar. I tried a coffee house version called a black widow with chocolate but found I like it better without the chocolate.
5.0	This is great to take to work or on trips for a little happy &#34;me&#34; time.  I like this because it is not too sweet like a lot of the mixes that have real sugar in them.  This is &#34;just right.&#34;
5.0	I like the taste of the White Christmas Tea, one of several teas that I drink.  Made some for my sister-in-law when she visited and she liked it and ordered some.  Mainly tea is a matter of personal taste.  I never add sugar nor milk to my teas.  I like the true taste of a tea.
5.0	"*****  I love the Sinfully Delicious products.      The taste doesn't exactly match the flavor, but all of them are still good.    You just have to get over the taste of the outer coating of fake sugar.    It's worth waiting for the flavor inside.    I'm so glad that Amazon carries them now so that I can buy them in bulk (CHEAP)   and I don't have to pay shipping.      I ordered almost every flavor because I can't find them in the grocery stores here.      I thought that I would have a lot of help from my co-workers in eating them, but   at least half of them hated these things -- too much like Rolaids -- they said.  I think they're nuts.    You don't chew them -- you let them dissolve.      So great for only a few calories!!!!   ( I AM on a diet so my taste-buds are \\""trained\\"" for fake sugar.)      I have to restrain myself from eating too many (or they will make me sick...like any fake sugar products.)"
5.0	"Like many, I've had a bowflex for a while, but lacked motivation and knowledge to really get into a routine with it. This DVD did that for me.     Here's how I am using it:    1) I have a laptop with XP on it that is just for the bowflex and is kept there at the machine to use during the workout.     2) I have created two routines - one for upper body, one for lower body.        3) I have arranged the exercises to make the best use of where the rods are connected and which additional \\""tools\\"" are needed (hand grips, foot grips, bent bar, straight bar), seat on or off. I have grouped all the seat on routines together, then grouped them by which \\""tool\\"" is needed, and finally by where the tool is attached (even down to where the pins are on the bars - all the way in, the middle, all the way out). This has resulted in a very streamlined workout and eliminates many of the clumsy setup changes that may be needed between routines. This was the key for me to reduce the frustration of changing up the machine configuration all the time.      I don't use the measuring, weighing, heart rate part of the software, but I can see where it can be useful to motivate. The bathroom scale is enough motivation for me, however.  I just needed a kick in the butt to get a routine going. To start, I did all over routines with light weight - just to wake up the muscles again (I'm a 56 year old woman that used to be in good shape, but has gotten \\""lazy\\"").     4) Now, I have settled into a routine of upper body 3 days a week and lower body 3 days a week with Sunday off. I feel so much better and actually look forward to going downstairs to work out now. I get an hour's workout done in about 40-45 minutes with the \\""enhancements\\"" listed above.     This is SO WORTH IT!     IMPORTANT!   * Don't forget to gather up the rods at the end of the session. Don't leave them attached. They will warp and loose strength.     * You need XP (will not run on Windows 7) to run this and it really works better if youcan have a laptop there with the video playing to remind you of where things attach and how to move (until you get it memorized)."
5.0	Donut Shop K-Cups Rule! I love my Keurig!<br /><br />Why this coffee? It has a bold flavor without bitterness or underlying heaviness. It is smooth and robust--a light roast with full-bodied flavor. I use the large water setting (which is the medium setting on newer models than mine) and it's perfect. When I go to someone's home that has a 3-setting machine, I find the large setting waters it down a bit more than I like, so I use the medium setting.
5.0	My little boy LOVES these. they are not del crumbly so they are the perfect wafer for beginner teethers.
1.0	BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO.  Why fix something that wasn't broke!?  Everything has changed about this once fantastic product.  Crispy, crunchy, solid good flavour.  Now its a crumbly, bland, cardboard cracker.  TAKE IT AWAY....will not buy them anymore.  Bring back the old Stoned Wheat Thins....PLEASE.....
5.0	Ooooh talk about YUMMY!!!! Take one .minutes to put the water in it in a minute to cook it in the microwave and it's ready! I will buy these for ever. Thank you.
5.0	Awesome tea and taste great.  Best when u drink at night before going to bed.
5.0	These bars are sinfully good!  Just 110 calories....I dare anyone to try to eat just half a bar.  I only can manage if someone is here to eat the other half before I get to it!  So-o-o-o good!
5.0	These are great. They don't taste old.
5.0	A colleague just came back from Japan with a box of these. They are delicious, not too sweet, taste like real banana.  I wish they were less expensive in the States.  But they are very fresh and come a long way so I guess it makes sense.
5.0	Bob's Red Mill puts out very good products.  Fast shipping, too.
5.0	I am from/raised in Japan, I still miss Japanese food. My husband loves miso ramen after he taste real miso ramen in Japan. This product is our most favorite ramen among all other Japanese instant ramen. They also have a instant ramen bowl, they are very good, but pricey for instant food.<br />I think this product is more affordable, and still tasty! It is easy to cook. You can add some items in soup if you want. After we ordered and tested, we had to buy more because we fight over this ramen. This Raoh has different flavors. Miso is our favorite. Soy sauce is good, too.
1.0	The product was good but over priced. I paid over $5.00 for each bottle and then found it at Wal-mart for $1.50, which was its regular price.
5.0	The best tuna around. I'm a tuna fan and there is nothing like the mildness of the Ortiz tuna.
5.0	Great coffee, rich and not bitter and a great price also.
5.0	Our household loves loves loves this product.  It allows a convenient way to naturally improve the taste of water to encourage us all to drink more of it!
5.0	"I'm surprised I'm the first person to review Kopper's dark chocolate-covered raspberries. Long review short: best chocolate I've ever purchased!    More detail, however:    1. I love raspberries and raspberry chocolate.     2. I love dark chocolate, so this combination of dark chocolate and raspberries (whole) was just amazing.     3. Even if you just let each piece melt in your mouth, the chocolate has the raspberry taste before you get to the whole raspberry.     These arrived perfectly, no broken pieces. I don't know how any piece could break anyway, the raspberries are whole. Plus, the weather was a bit chilly so the chocolate was colder than usual. I ended putting all the chocolate into sandwich bags. I wonder how fast I'll fly through these.     If you like raspberry chocolate and dark chocolate, don't think twice, these are amazing! I have one melting in my mouth right now. ;-)    PS  I was led to this chocolate from a \\""deals\\"" website (a slick one, lol), Amazon had 3 in stock for 15 bucks."
5.0	Delicious!!!  I will repurchase this for the rest of my life
5.0	I've several of the Sweet Leaf, truly enjoy the watermelon and the lemon, but this was a pleasant surprise. It reminded me of my favorite soda as a child, Orange Crush. (But without the sticky)  Now I've not had the soda in many years, so perhaps that's not accurate, but it's my story and I'm sticking to it. I drink it mainly with water, sometimes add a bit of the lemon.  Since it comes in a two pack, I should have known it would be great, and it is!
5.0	Nalley Chili Onion with Beans is great over a hot dog or mixed in with ground beef and Kraft Mac N Cheese.  It was delivered promptly.
5.0	I like the prodect and will purchase again.
5.0	Great service and great product.
5.0	I love this bread - it tastes really good. And it's healthy! Even better, I can buy this bread at my local Biglots for just $2! But you  sell it for almost $9! What a ripoff!
5.0	I love dark soy - it is so much better than your standard store soy sauce - it is thicker and much richer in flavor.  This is the best soy for making sir-fry; especially pepper steak and beef with broc.  It makes your standard store sauce look and taste like colored salty water.  If you love stir-fry (beef & broc; pepper steak even chicken in peanut sauce) this is a must have in your kitchen.  Once you try dark soy sauce, you will never go back to standard grocery store soy!
5.0	this cappuccino is so much more delicious than the cafe escapes brand.. stay far far away from them. now i ONLY use the grove street, and you cannot beat this price.  Thanks amazon prime!
5.0	Gentle delicate tea that does not hurt one's stomach.
1.0	Not liking this brand at all.  Taste and smell are naseating and I will never buy this brand again.  A complete waste of my hard earned money.
5.0	I love these Kippers!  I like them on salads or crackers or even straight from the tin.  I can't take fish oil pills and these are an excellent substitute and are delicious too!  I think they are priced very well compared to other brands and this one is my favorite anyway.
5.0	This is a great product.  We have purchased this in specialty stores previously at double the cost!
1.0	the price is way too high, i hope it contains gold!  this item is sold in indian grocery store for $5.99 for 2 lb bag.  what a rip off
5.0	These are super good but $30 is crazy!! They're around $5 in Japan!! D:
5.0	This coffee was full-bodied but not bitter - the perfect balance. It tasted and smelled fresher than most K-cup coffees. I'm definately buying this stuff again and recommend that you try it!
5.0	I am completely satisfied with this purchase.
5.0	This 5lb container is the best retail per gallon pricing I've been able to find and we go through a ton of agave nectar in our house since I switched.  Shipping always kills any online savings elsewhere.  SuperSaver shipping really made the difference.  The agave nectar is excellent quality, no different than bulk Madhava at WF - and arrived sooner than expected, in the jug.  Seriously, they shipped it just like you see it.      If you have the space in your house and you use agave, this is the bargain for you.
5.0	I just received my bonsai today. The seller shipped priority and I got it in 2 days. Packing was very nice and the tree was not damaged (I am at college and the students working the mail center are not always so kind to the packages, but it was safe and sound when I opened it!). The tree is healthy and looks VERY similar to the photo-- a little less full, but still a sturdy trunk and very nice branching especially for a younger tree. This was the cheapest bonsai on amazon by far, and when I ordered it I knew I was taking a risk on quality by paying such a low price, but so far I am very impressed! Thank you, seller :) Hopefully it doesn't just die on me right after I submit this rating. . .
5.0	I sent this case of soup to my son. Great deal and I know he has food for now
5.0	I am so pleased with this ekobrew Cup.  I can use any of my favorite coffees in my Keurig without the cost of the pre-packaged pods.  I still use them if I get them on sale, but I use the ekobrew several times a day, every day without any problems, whatsoever.  Love it!
5.0	No comparison to Hershey's
1.0	Note that this oil, as well as any other truffle oil which states &#34;truffle FLAVOR&#34;, does not contain real truffle or natural truffle flavor. &#34;truffle flavor&#34; is label speak for artificial flavor. This has very little flavor at all, and a lot must be used to even slightly notice. Artificial, and faint, flavor equals poor value.
1.0	It seems like most of the good reviews were pre-2010 or early 2010.. dont know what changed, but these crackers taste strangely like varnish or paint thinner as was mentioned in a prior review.  yucky yuckness.
5.0	These are the old Cheeters crackers and if you loved them you'll love these.  They are low carb and high fiber.  This is my favorite flavor.
5.0	Excellent product and works fine.
5.0	A marvelous pickle with delicacy and flavor galore, hits the spot on everything from a simple piece of toast to complex curries, always a delight and brings surprise to newcomers!
5.0	I bought this to use with my oil-free microwave popper and it is very good quality.<br />Microwave popping is a bit tricky to do but with a bit of care, this product produces nice fluffy popcorn with very few unpopped kernels - the few left over I usually put in the bird feeder, so nothing goes to waste<br /><br />I eat it bare - that's right without adding anything at all - and it has a nice flavor and texture.<br /><br />I'm really glad it tastes good, because it was very low cost per pound compared to the smaller bags of &#34;Gourmet&#34; offerings.
5.0	very good mixed saunce. we like organic products even though on the pricey side.  My children like the taste. We will buy it again.
5.0	I ordered this variety pack to give my guests a variety to choose from. I drink my coffee black, so I found them too sweet. They did not last long, so everyone else liked it.
5.0	This is the first Nori that I buy online and I am 100% happy with it. dont see a reason to buy any other brand.
5.0	I like all theTwinings loose leaf teas.  Great taste and I just brew them in a coffee maker designated for tea only.
5.0	Do you offer a pack of the three flavors, rather than 3 three pack of one flavor?  Or at least I would like to buy individual jars rather than a 3 pack. I can't wait to try your Salsas, they sound great. Thanks!
5.0	Delicious tea, and the mint green tin is a colorful bonus to liven up my drab cubicle.
5.0	Love this sugar the price isn't bad.
5.0	I am in LOVE with this butter! I will be ordering it a lot. Please keep carrying it!
5.0	One of my friends in CA turned me on to WANU. I've tried all of the flavors and this is probably my favorite. Super pure tasting, subtle flavor, not sweet (love the cucumber flavor notes). I do like the other flavors too.
1.0	I am now baking all of our organic gluten free bread, so this is an essential. It does the job. It's impossible to find GF and organic bread, even at Whole Foods (the manager acted surprised when I told him this--?) so my son and husband are now happy campers. Using single rise bread recipes from Coconut Flour Gourmet and delighted wit the results. Perhaps this xanthan gum powder is making the difference.<br /><br />UPDATE 12/16/14: In searching for a xanthan gum that is more affordable than the one I have more recently used that is certified GF, I queried this company if this is safe for those with celiac disease to use. I had a very strange reply stating that I should ask a physician as they could not give medical advice. Seriously? I replied that it would be impossible for a physician to know if their product has cross-contamination. I have a feeling this woman has no clue what celiac disease is and should not represent a product that is largely consumed by those needing GF alternatives.<br /><br />Obviously, paying a bit more money for peace of mind is worth it. I am most cautious about purchasing from a company that can not give a straight answer regarding their product. The only thing good about this xanthan gum is its price, which is not good enough.
1.0	Bad stuff.  Does not taste like coffee.  Very odd tasting.  I threw it out after two cups.
5.0	I brought the candy for the holidays, I do not eat much chocolate, but it was all gone by the new year!  Will buy more during the Valentine's season and also Easter time.
5.0	So tasty, so delicious; if only I didn't want to eat the whole bag at once.
5.0	Great tasting Nori! (:
5.0	This pasta is very tasty and the kids just love it!  It cooks in about 10 minutes for them (they like it a bit softer).  I like that it also provides a neat presentation, especially with white sauces.  The little serving of vegetables that is hiding in there isn't something to brag about unless this is all the veggies your child is willing to put in his mouth.  I get these on Subscribe & Save and love them, I only wish they wouldn't get more expensive with each shipment.
5.0	I admit to being really picky when it comes to maple syrup, some lack flavor, or are really bitter in aftertaste etc.....this stuff is heavenly and I will reorder it as long as they carry it.  Worth every penny.
5.0	I have to admit that I don't drink broth by itself - I don't like it - but I use broth as an ingredient in many recipes. I cannot tell you how it tastes by itself objectively. I use this in gravy and sauces and I like it better than regular broths - it doesn't make what you are making salty. Plus, my husband has high blood pressure so he cannot have a lot of salt (regular broth has up to 1200mg of sodium depending on the brand). One of my favorite things to do is to put a couple of spoonfuls into the water when I am making rice - it gives the rice good flavor without the salt (like in rice-a-roni - some of those flavors are just rice with broth). It is hard to find this in the grocery stores and when it is in the grocery store it is usually $3.99 a jar. We go through about a jar a month so this is a good deal. We buy the beef and the chicken, although we use up the chicken broth a lot faster - we don't eat much beef.
5.0	I used this as an experiment to make potato soup. I added cooked potatoes,veggies, mushrooms & coconut milk. Ooohhh so good & smooooth. Whenever I make it now I have to make a big batch because everyone wants 2-3 bowls!! Be creative.
5.0	I love Special K and can't find it in bulk at either Sam's or Costco. I had never thought to look on Amazon and was very surprised and pleased at the price. I love having it shipped automatically and the price is locked in. Thank you Amazon :)
5.0	Nice tasting and crispy. Exact seasoning neither too spicy or salty. Ideal as a lunchtime snack
5.0	I really like the Honey flavor ones the best but these Orange are really good also. They are a wonderful treat for the grand kids...
5.0	Great taste.  I mix it 50/50 with the French Vanilla of this same grand.
5.0	great tasting stew not as good as home made but great for a quick meal well worth the money will be buying more.
5.0	My daughter loves these, and I like that they're really convenient to take along when we need a meal on the go. They're a great mix of protein and fruits/veggies.
5.0	Bought to make vanilla. Worked great.
5.0	A very mild marshmallow flavor, but enough to satisfy my desire for all things marshmallow. Great flavored, fresh coffee! I've signed up for their emails, and can't wait to try other flavors!
5.0	Pleasantly surprised. The taste is very good
5.0	they are out of these all the time at our local store.  I am so glad to be able to buy them and get them right at my door.  and the homestyle actually means these are more like you made them from scratch than they came in a package.
1.0	These seeds smelled and tasted rancid. Even though the expiration date said the product was fresh. It wasn't.
5.0	As a mother of someone who can die if she eats nuts I so appreciate Enjoy Life brand! It it great to have tasty,convienent snacks and stuff for lunches or roadtrips that I know are safe for our family. It brings peace of mind to the simple task of eating when often it is anything but simple. And being able to purchase these products through Amazon is so great. I have never had a bad order of anything from amazon, and I order alot!! I highly recommend any Enjoy Life products. This is the first time we have been able to eat trailmix. It's great.
5.0	These are great breakfast or snack cookies. I take the frozen cookie and microwave them for 1 minute. It's like eating a freshly baked cookie. Keep them in your freezer and take them out one at a time when you want them.
5.0	I sent this to my brother for his birthday. I know he likes hot sauce so i thought it'd be a great gift for him. I can't say personally because I haven't tried it YET..I plan on ordering it for myself next but he said it was great. That's the most I got out of him. Lol
1.0	This used to taste awesome but not anymore.  It's horrible since they started using Sucralose in it.  It has a horrible taste and caused me to get stomach cramps!  Shame on you Swiss Miss for not disclosing on the box that your product contains Sucralose!
1.0	I did not receive this item which was part a larger order. I did not receive a response to my complaint. The bottom of the large box containing the other items in the order had a approximately a teaspoon of grits.
5.0	So you're searching for cheese topping for something you are making. Like me, you got tired of the horrible tasting crappy substitutes you could find at local stores. Well, this is the real deal. It's the same cheese, lip smacking, orange finger making stuff that you really wanted, and it's in a large 1 lb size. Sprinkle this over popcorn to take if from so-so to absolutely amazing. Use some of this to liven up your next mac and cheese or scalloped potato dish. It is, exactly as promised, real cheddar cheese in a powdered form.<br /><br />The only downside to this stuff is how to dispense it easily. It tends to bind with any condensation or steam. I've tried putting it into stainless steel dredges, which works somewhat okay, but again, be wary of steam rising off the food as it will tend to make the cheese bind up and stick to the dredge. You can also spoon some over food and shake, but the dredge really helps keep it more even when used as a topping.<br /><br />How good does it taste? I'm on my third order of this already, it tastes amazing if you like cheddar cheese flavor. Trust me, take a gamble here and order some. You will not be disappointed.
5.0	Making bread, gravy and pasta (had to order Durum somewhere else).<br /><br />I used 1/2 Hard Red and 1/2 Durum for pasta.
5.0	My family calls this product &#34;crack&#34;. This is a positive, because it is so good you don't want to stop eating it.
5.0	I mix these into the standard nut mix I buy at Costco to glam it up.
5.0	Excellent will order again!!!!
5.0	Good service with a good product.
5.0	This pomegranate molasses works great for fesenjan. The consistency isn't too thin and the taste isn't too sweet or too tart.
5.0	"I love dark chocolate and coconut. At a chocolate shop, they would be called \\""Needhams\\""  I find that two make a good serving and a bag lasts a long time. They have been worth the money for the case of 6 bags."
5.0	This is my favorite flavor of coffee.  I put SF brown sugar cinnamon syrup by Torani along with cream and it tastes so delicious!  Better than many coffee drinks I get from coffee shops.  If you do like these, order lots! I ran out sometime in the summer and was bummed because it is seasonal and you can only buy during the winter! This year I plan on ordering lots so it will get me through the entire year!
5.0	My favorite flavor always order in bulk
5.0	Arrived with started tea and instructions. I set up a batch and had booch in less than a week. I have continued to brew with different organic green teas and raw honeys and everything has gone well and tastes wonderful.
5.0	this is awesome tea , as always .
5.0	By far my favorite K-Cups. I love dark, bold coffee, and Gevalia Dark Royal Roast comes the closest to delivering the kind of taste I want in K-Cup form.
5.0	Nice English licorice.  Actual licorice portion is a bit thicker then I'm used to making it a bit more flavorfull
5.0	I HAVEN'T USED IYT YET BUT TASTED ONE AND IT WAS YUMMY
5.0	My daughter opens her mouth wide open when I feed this to her.  She loves it.  I am buying more.
1.0	I bought these and excitedly opened the package. To my surprise, I almost threw up from the smell. It was very chemical smelling, almost like fertilizer. I didn't dare try these nuclear teddy bears.
5.0	I started drinking Jolt Cola back in the early 70's, it was good,and a nessasary evil for late night studying. When the Cherry Bomb came out I instantly fell in love with it.  It had a great taste, with no after taste or awful bubble gum smell like other energy drinks. I cant get enough of it, and its really hard to find now.
5.0	These are  phenomenal!! Even more fresh than you get in the local convenient store. They got here in two days too!
5.0	Great crumbs for my peanut butter cheesecake, and my famous smores cheesecake. Easy to deal with!
5.0	The best kosher salt out there. It is pure salt and nothing else. No anti-caking agents, etc. The shape and structure of the salt crystals allows for perfect control when seasoning food.
5.0	IF YOU HAVE NOT TASTED THIS BUTTER  TO BAD FOR YOU.GET SOME LIVE A LITTLE.
5.0	These are excellent. They are larger than regular sour patch kids which I think is awesome. This means that there is more sweetness than sour and they last longer! I got these for my son's birthday to put in treat bags and they are going to be perfect. I love that they are individually wrapped so I can easily make sure each person gets a decent amount and also might have some left over for other holidays. Of course, they are so good that I might eat all the left overs before I get a chance to use them for anything else! The container is also great if you plan on having these somewhere people can just grab a few and go.
5.0	I really enjoyed these cookies.  Nothing like a small tasty treat with my coffee in the morning.  I also like the small packages that are reclosable
5.0	It's the perfect size for my Thai curries, I don't have to waste anything. I have 24 cans in my pantry for future meals!
5.0	I sent this to two persons on my gift list. Both recipients enjoyed them with their coffee. Beautiful wrapping and great gift.
5.0	This is a wonderful product....... I enjoy just a splash in my morning coffee every day.  It is better for you than sugar, and it tastes better too.
1.0	The service and delivery from Amazon was great.  However, the product itself is not worth buying.  No matter what I try, coffee leaks out around the Kcup when brewing....it makes a mess!  Wanted the cups to use my favorite coffee (Tim Hortons), but guess I'll just have to get used to other brands!
5.0	I have done the recurring shipment on this product, and what a steal!  For my carb free diet, this item is a STAPLE in my DAILY food intake.  Items comes well packed, on time, and the quality, flavor, and value are outstanding.  THANK YOU for the recurring monthly shipment option.  Fabulous product!
5.0	I bought this for my husband, we were looking for a seasoning salt for steak on the grill. This worked great not only on that but for many things. I would recommend it.
5.0	This product has a great flavor but kellogs decided to cancel it.  I wish they would bring it back if only on a seasonal basis!
5.0	I know this seasoning looks gimmicky from it's name, but it is perfect for adding a little spice to things that hoy sauce won't work well. I love to use it on salads. Be aware that this review is for SIX cans which is probably a 3 year supply even for me.
5.0	i would recommend this product...soft dried easy to chew..acually tastes like apple..way better than other products ive tried before..very good
5.0	Bought these for my daughter's gumball machine. She has braces now so I steal her gumballs. Very tasty! The flavor doesn't last very long but that's to be expected.
5.0	Choosey mothers choose Jif is the slogan.  Well so do old people without children.
5.0	This is my new favorite brand of kimchi!  It's just the right amount of spice and fermentation.  So good!  I will definitely buy more.
5.0	this product performs exactly as described.<br />it's yeast... just like the yeast packets you can buy at your local grocery store, but there is a far greater value if you're a frequent baker in buying this pouch over the individual packets.<br />buy with confidence.<br />happy baking !
5.0	My favorite of the seasonings, I like to use it generously when I make musubi.
5.0	This is my daughter's favorite cereal. We cannot find it in New York where we live, however, when we were in South Carolina recently we found it and purchased 3 boxes.  When we got back to NY I went to Amazon and found them there. My daughter is working on her 8th box and we will be ordering more real soon.  She loveeeessss this product. Thank you.
5.0	Purchased for kids refill of PEZ Dispensers.<br />Good to have around instead of trying to purchase when need to give to children between age of 3 - 7.<br />Would recommend to others
5.0	great taste and long lasting clean energy
5.0	Handy lunch idea for the kids! So glad that I could get on subscribe and save!
5.0	Very spicy, fresh, and easy to use.
5.0	These are really awesome. Most nutritional diet shakes are full of articial ingredients that makes me question the overall health benefits, and most of them have a nasty aspartame taste. I have bough a couple of Katefarms Komplete products and gotta say these are very good. They are pricey, but you can tell from the first sip that this is the real deal. Don't expect it to taste as sweet and fluid as some chocolate powder. It's less sweet and has a gritty texture, both of whcih I love, because it can hold down as an actual meal and it tastes and feels healthy. If they could bring the prices of these things down a bit, it would be even more amazing, but the product is worth the money and it really is the only one of its kind in the marketplace
5.0	I am head over heels for this stuff. A delightful alternative to peanut butter.
5.0	Absolutely love this tea !!
5.0	They are great for breakfast or even as a snack. I thoroughly enjoyed them. They were perfectly fresh, and not broken or crushed at all.
5.0	This is great in a protein shake .. it adds all the taste of peanut butter without the fat and calories.
5.0	Tasty flowers. If the color red had a flavor, this would be it.<br /><br />Makes great tea.
5.0	GREAT PRODUCT, FRESH AND DELICIOUS !
5.0	My very favorite peanut!
5.0	These chocolate covered expresso beans are very addicting and if I were not starting my diet I would certainly order more.
1.0	Shop and pay sweetener Splenda and I came SAL.<br />I'm upset, not what you buy and pay.<br />I claim the money
5.0	I love the fact that these fruit rolls are made with just the fruit and not all the addtional garbage that is normally in food these days.
5.0	A favorite of ours, well priced compared to competitors and like the squeeze bottle feature.
5.0	I really like this candy. The Country Time Assorted Lemonade Hard Candy come in four different flavors they are- Lemonade, Pink Lemonade, Peach Lemonade, Raspberry Lemonade. There are 78 pieces in each bag. This is a gluten free candy. In my opinion they are all great. My favorite is the plain Lemonade. It tastes just like the Lemonade drink. I will be buying more as soon as I run out. It will probably be a long time from now cause I have got twelve bags to eat.
1.0	Do not buy these if you're expecting San Marzano tomatoes. Nowhere on the can does it state that they are the San Marzano variety, nor do they look or taste like SM's. I don't know which moron in sales decided to put that in the title, but it's wrong. Bella Terra DOES sell SM's, but these are not it. Not worth the price!!!
1.0	It tasted really bad I only took one bit and I threw the rest away
5.0	My husband and I love pho and can eat more of it with this delicious gluten free noodle because it doesn't make us feel bloated.  It's pricey but worth it so I will continue to buy.
1.0	"SHAME ON \\""ARROWHEAD MILLS\\"" for labeling this cereal as amaranth flakes, when in fact they are OAT FLAKES with some amaranth added!!  I AM HIGHLY ALLERGIC TO OATS!!  I have been eating this cereal, thinking it was Amaranth, having all kinds of problems...evaluating my diet...never looked at this label as I have used Arrowhead Mills for years--trusting their products...now angry they have stooped to this level, along with so many corrupting America, all in the name of the almighty $$$$ trying to make a quick buck.  I WILL NEVER, NEVER AGAIN, BUY ARROWHEAD MILLS, AS THEY HAVE LOST MY TRUST!!!!!!"
5.0	G R E A T  rub for my Trager, (I just add a bit more dry garlic flakes) slightly sweet.
5.0	I wish they had this all the time it is YUMMMY and I buy it all the time whenever I can do it as an add-on
5.0	"In the tradition of their famous Gobstoppers - layered flavor jaw breakers, are these small, heart-shaped \\""heartbreakers\\"" that you can bite in half without breaking your jaw - although you should have healthy teeth before attempting to do so. I usually pick out the purple and pink ones for myself (I'm so selfish) and distribute the rest during Valentine's Day.  They can be \\""disposed of\\"" quickly, unlike a Gobstopper that must be sucked on for about 10 minutes before it's safe to gobble up."
5.0	Plump and tasty but a little more than what we can get at Walmart.
5.0	I love pomegranates, but can't chew the seeds. So it's great to have the wonderful pomegranate flavor - in vegetables, drizzled on rice (and dare I say, licking the spoon? *grin*)<br /><br />The label calls this &#34;paste&#34;, though it's more like &#34;molasses&#34; in texture. I was a little disappointed at first, but got over that hurdle quickly. I highly recommend this.
5.0	As a devoted tea drinker, I would have to say that the quality and aesthetics of this product is without peer relative to anything in a bag and that it ranks very high amidst the roster of ANY teas I have ever taken.
5.0	I love this gum! Great taste and fresh breath action!
5.0	These were really fresh and tasted great. One thing, they are not the really large eggs, but about half the size of the large ones.
1.0	Very short shelf life.
5.0	When I was a child my mother made chicken ala king with biscuits and I loved it.  I made this for my kids when they were little.  Then, for a long time could not find it in the stores.  Finally found it here and make it regularly!  Love it!!!!
5.0	great coffee,veryb good,I would recomend it to coffee lovers
5.0	I basically survive on these.  Not much of a soda or coffee drinker.  Penguins are my caffeine source all day at work.
5.0	Timing is everything. My first taste of Lipton's peppermint tea also happened to be the coldest morning of the year and just as I was starting to get into the holiday mood.<br /><br />There is no doubt that this is pure peppermint, from the moment the box is opened to the first sip. It is a clean natural taste that begs to be savored. There is no bitterness, just a calm mellowness that reminds you of why you drink tea. I chose to drink mine to accompany homemade cranberry walnut muffins.<br /><br />Tea makers are falling over themselves to come up with strange new flavors to boost their sales. It is nice to see a company like Lipton offer something so traditional and so well done.
5.0	Really great - nice rich flavor with no bitterness. Good 'waker-upper'!<br />Every coffee lover should try it. I will be ordering more soon.
5.0	tastes great.  everyone loves this mix.
5.0	A bit grainy, taste is fair, the product itself is wonderful. I feel better after an intense workout if I have my 30g of hemp protein
5.0	I have these in the car for a clean and easy drink but it's officially for the kids...As far as some mentioning not having received 'calcium fortified': I prefer natural food and drinks, so the less chemicals added for me is best. This flavor does not mention calcium in ingredients.
5.0	Great taste and deal.
5.0	This is a great tea and, it has great flavor with the brown rice! I will definitely be buying it again for sure!
5.0	You order an espresso.  It arrives with strange brown lumps of sugar.  You add it to you espresso and sip.  It's wonderful.  Like no other sugar you have tasted. You order it, but you keep it for yourself because it is too good to share.
5.0	This hot sauce is full of flavor and a decent amount of heat. I love the garlic flavors and will purchase again.
5.0	We were given this assortment by a friend, and really loved all the flavors!  I really can not understand the last unfavorable review.  They were a big hit with my whole family.  My favorite was pumpkin pie, but every one was good.
5.0	Got these for my boyfriend who is lactose intolerant, but is also picky about his chocolate, he absolutely loved them. I'm very pleased with this purchase
5.0	The 140 gr. pods fit my Senseo perfectly.  I liked the D-E Kenya better than the Baronet Kenya (Baronet is stronger and not as smooth) but it's very good nonetheless.  I prefer the Baronet Columbian to the Baronet Kenya.
5.0	I had almost stopped using my Keurig brewer due to the high cost of K-cups, and the old style refillable cup didn't hold enough coffee to make a decent serving.  This one is perfect; holds enough and is easy to clean.  I just purchased a second one for back-to-back brewing.
5.0	I love this gum. It is really refreshing. Really perks up your mouth and makes your breath smell better every time.
5.0	GREAT Apple Rings!!  Love them!!  Eat a pound a day!!
5.0	I bought a Keurig for work because my office mates aren't big coffee drinkers, so I hated to make a whole pot. I like my Keurig, but I hated the waste of all of those K-Cups. This is the perfect compromise -- the ease of the Keurig, but none of the environmental impact or cost. This model was also one of the few that's compatible with my small B130 machine. Nicely done Solofill!
5.0	Yum!  Small bags but perfect for my preschooler's lunch.
5.0	Best tasting coffee without the fancy price. The breakfast blend is to die for. Definitely won't be disappointed. The smell alone will keep you coming back.
5.0	We used this packs to hand out at a birthday party.  They were popular.  We also liked them so much that we have ordered more since then.
5.0	This is one of my favorite teas, and has been for a number of years!  If you love black licorice or anise, you will love this tea. It is great for when you want a sweet treat but not sugar!  One of the very best on the market, IMHO.
5.0	The Kind brand of bars are tasty, but most of them are pretty high in sugar, which isn't great for your health and also means if you eat one as a snack in the 1-2 hours before bed, it's likely to crank you up more than you'd like before going to bed. This flavor - the ginger one - has I think about half the sugar of most Kind bars, and it's also tasty.
5.0	This tea is not available in stores for me, and I love, love the flavor!  What a delicious and refreshing tea for the hot summer days we've been having.!!
1.0	This particular food producer is a favorite of mine -- they make great Parmesan cheese in shelf-stable glass jars, which I absolutely love but frequently run out of (and very few groceries stock it).  So I was thrilled to see this under Subscribe and Save and promptly ordered a shipment.  Alas, the cheese was stale.  I don't know whether it was the difference in containers (this one was plastic, not the glass I was used to when buying locally).  It wasn't past the printed date on the product, so that wasn't the problem.  A mystery.  I rarely throw out food, but I threw out all of these.<br /><br />If you see the glass jars of Parmesan from the same manufacturer, scoop them up -- they're wonderful!  Maybe they'll offer those here instead of the plastic jars, or maybe they'll figure out what else went wrong and fix it.  I'd be thrilled to be able to order these regularly, but right now something's not working....
5.0	I admit the salmon is out of my price range, but now and then I treat myself. It is pure Alaska, keeps forever, and is so tender. I am a bagels and lox person, but there are many recipes included.
1.0	I purchased a box of these after having tried one in a variety pack upon buying the keurig machine. While that first one was good, the ones from the box that I bought for around $20 taste as weak as water.....no Apple cider taste AT.....ALL!! I was VERY disappointed and will definitely NOT be buying it again. What a waste of $20! :(
5.0	i have purchased this tea many times;  people always enjoy it;  i like to have many different kinds but always go back to this
5.0	Excellent. Came in an insulated bag.  Taste fantastic.  The picture looks like the balls have spots on them.  The ones I got are just plain brown in color, and are a delight to eat
5.0	Nice spicy kick.  Hard as it is supposed to be.  Not many binders.  Wish I had a meat slicer to cut.  But it's good exercise :-)  I saw this at Wally's world for about the same price but easier to have it shipped to your door with Prime.  Recommend.
5.0	I use this spicy daily on multiple foods....love it.
5.0	An organic, sugar free cereal, Jordan's is full of whole grains and nuts with a few bits of fruit.  It is delicious and nutritional.  The supplier manages to ship it from England to California in 10-12 days.  We discovered it at a B&B in Normandy and brought some home with us.  The supplier in England obviously has no difficulty shipping it to us quite quickly.  We appreciate them and their wonderful cereal!
5.0	This is the best sauce I have ever had!  I couldn't believe how good it was.  I use it burgers, steak, pork chops, chicken,everything.  I have actually used it as a dip with potato chips!  Unreal.
5.0	Since tasting this orange blossom honey, can't go back to other cheapo brand at the shopper market. This is a high quality honey that you can now taste the difference when using other cheap honey's. Therefore, I'm a complete fan of this brand. Taste great in my teas. Will continue to buy. I'm gonna try the other flavors from Tropic Bee.
5.0	Quick & easy, great for camping, taking with you on-the-go.<br /><br />Great tasting, and much more affordable than the Starbucks Via.
5.0	This is a really good price and product. If you're looking for a good Nooch that isn't going to break the bank, this one is for you. I really can't say enough good things about it. Remember to store yours in the fridge so it doesn't go bad, though.
5.0	Some of the best coffee I have ever had.  I absolutely love it.  Great kick but smooth and delicious.
5.0	I'm originally from the Binghamton NY area, and am thrilled to finally be able to order spiedie sauce on Amazon!  Salamida sauce is a little less oily and a little more vinegary than other popular spiedie marinades, which is why I like it so much.  Marinate for at least 24 hours - the longer the better.  Now if I could just get my hands on some Felix Roma Italian bread and I'd be set!
5.0	This product has come in very handy with our long-haired cat.  We alternate between lax'aire (the gooey stuff in the tube from the vet) and the hairball treats which are especially helpful when we are away from home and the petsitter can give these without getting near our (rather unfriendly, even to the hand the feeds her) cat.  EG
5.0	The Amablu; St. Pete's Select Gift Pack is the best Bleu Cheese that I have eaten in many years.  The quality is superb and the dealings with the company are first class.    I will definitely purchase cheese from Amablu again.
5.0	These are delicious, the texture is great, and they really add a lot (both visually and in flavor) to a Manhattan.  The syrup is also great for experimenting with new mixed drinks.
5.0	I have been looking for the perfect cup of coffee and i think i found the closest thing to it. So Far i have tried Timothys kona and italian, all of the green mountain brews, coffee people, and gloria jeans. I think i am settled on the caribou med roast, it is not acidy, it packs a nice caffeine punch and has a good coffee flavor. You will not be dissapointed with this coffee.
5.0	This is just the best caramel! Wonderful creamy consistency, rich caramel taste with a hint of salt...My problem is that I eat the whole *** jar!
5.0	We bought them for our kids (ranging from teens to a toddler) and the reaction was fantastic.  They were especially fans of the sweet potato flavor, which I'd never even heard of before.  Definitely will be buying again!
5.0	I would give this product highly recommend. Those bee waxes smell really good, and really high quality, I will put a picture to show you guys the size. I believe it needs more time to be melted. Still good product.
5.0	I bought these cinnamon sticks to use in an apple, cinnamon stick water cleanse.  This deal was a wonderful money saver and the flavor was delicious!
5.0	I had really never used agave nectar or syrup . . . I needed this to complete my arsenal of supplies to make the cocktail &#34;Carter Beats the Devil&#34; . . . .so, I ordered it.<br /><br />From this point forward, it will be my go to for many things - cooking, cocktails, sweetener, etc.  This has a wonderful sweetness, nice flavor and absolutely no aftertaste.  I use honey in cooking, but I'm not a great fan - there's an aftertaste that I don't find pleasant.  Not so with Madhava Organic Agave Nectar . . . it's perfect.<br /><br />I highly recommend it!
5.0	I am hooked on this and until recently I purchased it at out local COSTCO.  For some reason they stopped stocking it for two months.  I was left with no viable alternative other than to buy off the Amazon site.  Including freight, the price per bag was nearly 2X of the price in the store.  TG my COSTCO started stocking the item again.
5.0	My aunt brought me three jars of this from Hawaii (her parents' home), and I was hooked. Used sparingly (daily) and began to panic when the last of the three jars approached the 1/3 mark, because my aunt has been unable to find more in Los Angeles, and no imminent Oahu trip in the planning. Fortunately, I found it on Amazon, and have begun the first of four jars in the pack. Should last me nearly a year, so I can rest easy for awhile.
5.0	For us, this a great replacement for sugar.  I have replaced regular sugar cup for cup with this stuff in all of my baking.  In many instances, we've like the stuff I've made with this sugar better than with regular sugar.  I have been trying to stay away from regular sugar since it makes my heart pound after I eat it.  Using this stuff, I can have my sweets without feeling bad.  Tastes OK in coffee, too, but you can really tell the difference there.  My husband likes it better than regular sugar in his coffee, but I don't.  But then I usually drink my coffee black, so maybe I'm not the best judge of that.  All in all, SO glad I found this!
1.0	Complete rip-off. You are paying $17 for one box. You can get 6 boxes for about $25 so this pricing is outrageous. The description is also misleading. I thought I was getting more than just a little box.
5.0	Taste Amazing While Providing Omegas.
5.0	Arcor chocolate filled mints<br />I searched for these candies and for a good price on them. I think they are just right for stashing in your purse. They are a hard candy, not sticky. They are individually wrapped. They have the right ingredients....mint and chocolate. They are perfect for my use.
5.0	This product is hard to find here.  The purchase on line was quick, and the product was exactly as I hoped it would be.
5.0	I am a closet peanut butter addict - can eat it at every meal. When weight became a real issue in my 50's, I joined weight watchers. Trying to shave off points each day and eat healthier doesn't include a cup a creamy PB. I wasn't thrilled with the consistency of PB2 at first. But I've gotten over it. As long as I have PB2 handy or made up, I use it. I still love creamy PB on dry toast, but this is an excellent trade off. The chocolate PB2 on a rice cake is a nice trade off for a Little Debbie nutty bar - love those, too! Great price when you combine it to get free shipping.
5.0	Large pods, fresh, great scent. Quick shipping
5.0	This is some of the best tea I've ever enjoyed. I look forward to a cup when I get home in the evening.
5.0	Really like the Organic Corn Grits from Gob's Red Mill because the taste is so much more richer than Bob's Red Mill's regular Corn Grits. Really quite a difference.
5.0	I've never ordered a food item from Amazon before.  I ordered this because I could no longer find the brand in our local stores.  Truth is, this is so much easier and less expensive.  I set it up on a regular refill schedule so I got a discount.  It comes to the door and I don't have to think about it.  I can cancel the refill schedule anytime I want.  Very cool.  Now I'm checking out the prices of some of the other foods Amazon offers.<br /><br />As far as rice goes, Arya is the best basmati rice I've ever had.  I look for this brand.
5.0	LOVE them.  a bit high in price
5.0	I HAVE USED THESE PEPPERS IN MANY DISHES. WITH EGGS, MEAT LOAF, SALADS, STUFFED, MADE INTO A SALAD. ONE ODF THE BEST WAYS TO USE THEM IS TO REMOVE THE SEEDS,CUT THEM UP AND<br />PRESERVE THEM IN JARS. I WON'T TELL YOU WHAT OTHER INGREDIENTS I PUT WITH THEM. SERVED ON CRACKERS. I HAVEN'T TRIED THEM IN SOUPS YET, BUT I WILL.<br /><br />(I WISH AMAZON WOULD INCLUDE SPELL CHECK IN THES ENQUIRES)
5.0	Got to have my Nesquick in the mornings.
1.0	Ok, I understand that protein bars, granola bars aren't supposed to be high cuisine.  But there are bars that are decent (but relatively high in calorie), bars that you just eat because of the energy requirements or circumstances, and there are bars that seem to have been created in some lab without any sense of making it palatable.  This bar… it's not just the taste (lame), but the texture;  I think that's it;  the texture makes me think of eating cardboard (I've never eaten cardboard, but if I did, it would have to be similar to this stuff).  Anyway, with the many choices of nutrition bars out there, I can't see any logical reason to get this one.
5.0	I love these and they are much cheaper from Amazon than in my grocery stores.
5.0	Fantastic. Love this stuff. Tastes better than any alfredo sauce I've had. Mixes easily. Wish I had ordered more for I went through a can in 2 months.
5.0	These are the best K-cup for the money.  Great flavor and best price anywhere.  Can brew up to 9oz cup without being too watered down.  Very pleased with these.
5.0	for Michigan State and Ohio State.  We need all three teams<br />to be able to use at our parties. These are fun and a great way<br />to get our kids to have fun with their jello.
5.0	Took me back to St. Lucia and rotis!
5.0	Great mints....give you a nice lift due to the caffeine content.  I usually have a couple in the morning to get going and then a couple more midday to keep going.  Great to have one while working out in the gym. There is no doubt a supply of these mints will be kept close by.
5.0	Great taste, satisfying.
1.0	The package in which it was sent was very poor quality, the seeds reached me in very bad condition since they were mailed from thailand. All were rotten and threw them away
5.0	I came across this brand at the Walmart in Orlando, so i bought a box to try and it was delicious, so I ordered some more!
5.0	One can never, ever go wrong with Astronaut Ice Cream.
1.0	Flowers delivered were wilted and dead.  Recipient said the flowers were in sad shape.
5.0	I REALLY LOVE THIS COFFEE.... FAST SHIPPING, GREAT SELLER, GREAT PRICES... THANK YOU
5.0	These are exactly like the licorice candy from the corner drug store I used to get as a child.  They are perfect!
5.0	I had been told that Himalayan salt was much better for you.  After shopping around, I found the best deal was through Amazon.  It came in a heavy resealable bag and works great in my salt mill.  I would buy this again and recommend it to my friends.
5.0	great food at great prices, we love bob's. i usually get the organic stuff so i ordered these by accident. but everything here is good.
5.0	We have enjoyed three bottles of this stuff and we treat it like gold.  If you use it wisely and sparingly, it can last almost a year. We enjoy it with Campari brand tomatoes, fresh basil, fresh mozzarella and Ariston's extra virgin olive oil.  Heavenly.
5.0	It came quickly and was very fresh.  This purchase is better than what I can get at supermarket.  Will definitely purchase again.
5.0	I usually get my artichoke hearts from Sam's club, because I can get them in a very large jar.  These were great, but with shipping and getting a minimal amount of them means I will go to Cheyenne and get the large jars again, altho if these were available at Sam's I'd get these in a minute.
5.0	I tried several green teas based on (&#34;best-of&#34;) recommendations from an article I read and this came out as my winner. I have been drinking it ever since that original taste test.
5.0	Great!!!  Just as advertised and arrived quicker than expected.
5.0	I love Stevia because it's the only non-sugar sweetener that doesn't give me a stomachache (I am a reformed Diet Coke addict for this unfortunate reason).  This form of Stevia is super convenient (no more dealing with a zillion little packets), and I love the vanilla creme flavor!  My favorite uses (besides the usual tea/coffee) are for plain yogurt and club soda (trust me, it makes it into a really tasty pseudo-cream soda!).
1.0	"First of all, this isn't real jerky - it is reconstituted beef sticks (similar to the products labeled as \\""beef steak\\"" by the national jerky brands). Second of all, it is high in sugar - 7g per 1oz for Original. I was extremely disappointed with this \\""jerky\\"" - both for its deceptive labeling and for its lackluster taste."
5.0	"I love these boxes. I sent this one to my DH for Valentine's day, and I've done others for birthdays and the like. They are so much fun to \\""sample\\"" the old treats from childhood. I recommend them often to those who have a sweet tooth."
5.0	I bought this today from my local health food store. It was totally yummy and truelly refreshing. I cannot belive how good this tasted. I will definitely be buying this again.
5.0	"I have struggled with LOW blood sugar (hypoglycemia) all my life - and its such a pain - especially the fatigue. Now I found CHIA SEEDS and the low blood sugar is HISTORY! The very first time I took it (half a teaspoon) I immediately felt steady and stronger. I was amazed! And the Dr has since confirmed that my blood sugar is \\""under control\\"" (Doctors avoid the word \\""cured\\"" of course.) Such a simple change, adding Chia seeds to my diet, and such remarkable results, especially the steady energy, which I have NEVER had, even as a kid. Before finding chia, I simply could NOT lose weight, but now my weight continues to DROP - steadily and effortlessly. I was cautious of the FIBER, so I slowly increased my Chia seed and now am eating 3 tlbs a day. This is DEFINATELY a MIRACLE Food! TRY IT!  (BRM also has good chia seed: [[ASIN:B003LPKEPC Bob's Red Mill Chia Seeds, 16-Ounce Bags (Pack of 4)]], if u use a lot."
5.0	Love the taste.  Love the excellent packaging & delivery.  Love the price:))  Thank you Amazon!!!! A++++++
5.0	Great as a soup or sauce for other Mexican food.
5.0	we love this coffee, it is smooth, not bitter coffee.<br />you want really good coffee you need to get this one.
5.0	Good price for 3-pack.
1.0	"I used to be a big fan of Thai Kitchen's coconut milk and green curry paste. Now the coconut milk is thinner in consistency and flavorless and the curry paste has lost all its fire. Bummer, as it's hard to find quality products (of any kind) these days. Interesting note?--Thai Kitchen was recently acquired by another, larger company. Looks like the \\""recipes\\"" have changed. As will mine."
5.0	Not sure what the reviewer from Ohio was thinking.  These are the best selling soaps in the ultra-luxury category.  The soaps do contain shea butter-- it says it right on the label.  Vegetable oils are contained such as olive oil, because the soap needs a base to make it in.    The soaps last a long time and there are many other varieties and they have the ingredients they advertise.  Pomegranate has actual pomegranate right in it, and you can smell it in the soap.  They are well maid.
5.0	Will purchase again. I had first purchased from local discount store. Time came to restock and they didn't have it in stock. Convenience and taste is reason I prefer over instant tea. Not as good as brewed tea but that is hard to beat.
5.0	Great taste and I always like tea.
5.0	Freshest Liquorice I've ever eaten. Fast delivery and made in USA, what more could you ask for. 2 lb bag didn't last very long!
5.0	My wife's favorite. I agree t that the Back to Nature brand tastes better than the comparable more familiar name brand. We purchase these on the subscribe and save program of which I am a big fan.
5.0	Great replacement product for Celestial Seasonings discontinued Pear tea (which I Absolutely LOVED).<br /><br />Very Peary, can get at least two mugs of tea from each bag.  It smells wonderful, and has a great flavor.  Also, it's at a better price on here (when I bought this anyway), than at the grocery store.
5.0	I love this product because I love Stevia! Stevia is an excellent healthy alternative to sugar and goes a long way because it is a lot sweeter than sugar. Now brand has it available in this affordable 1 lb. container. I just keep refilling my shaker bottle and we use it on anything that needs to be sweetened. This is a product that is 100% Stevia. That's why I love it because there are other products that add other stuff to it so make sure you are getting a quality product like this one that is 100% Stevia. I will continue to buy this and hope it will always be available!
5.0	I used this coffee for Vietnamese coffee ice cream. The folks are still raving about it!!!
1.0	It was below average tea with no aroma and no taste.  It definitely was not Earl Grey.  Don't fall for this expensive junk tea.  Even Lipton regular black tea is much better.  I returned the two boxes I ordered.  It must not have been the real deal.  I cannot believe this guy gets away with this junk at such high prices.
5.0	This variety pack is great.  I like all these flavors so it a great way to get a good mix of them.  The PB cups are a really nice treat after a workout.  Probably the best tasting protein bars on the market today.
5.0	Great soba!  This is a great company.  Their organic food is of such high quality that they won't use the USDA organic grade, because it isn't good enough for them.
5.0	Very nice assortment and very attractive packaging.
5.0	Other companies make nut free cookies, but Skeeter Snacks has created fantastic tasting cookies that everyone loves to munch.<br />Choc. Choc Chip variety is very tasty !
5.0	Received these delightful nuts today and absolutely love them!!!!  I have tried a LOT of different brands, but think these are the best!  Wish there was a little key attached to the can for easier opening, but not a big deal  : )
5.0	[[ASIN:B0048II9PI Sushi Chef, Sushi Making Kit, 1 EA (Pack of 3)]]Gave this as a birthday gift for a sushi lover. LOTS of neat ingredients. Great value
5.0	Love these bars! The taste is great, excellent quality.
5.0	Finally a treat my dog likes that is not made in China!  This is her big treat of the day.  I love the  wholesomeness of Tucker products.  They must be good because I cannot find these treats locally.
5.0	GREAT SPICY FLAVOR ITS IS UNIQUE AND WILL BE BUYING AGAIN! PLease bring these to canada aswell as other pnes!
5.0	This contains a good assortment of regular coffee. I have purchased this one many times.
5.0	These were perfect for my daugthers shower and were a hit.  I had a candy buffet and variety, these were the perfect addition
5.0	This rice medley is delicious.  I bought a bag at Costco and now can't find it anywhere to purchase.  It is the BEST rice ever and sprouted rice is the most nutritional to eat.
5.0	This is a wonderful product! It is delicious, nutricious, has a reasonable caloric content and the absolute go-to product when I need a tasty side dish. I highly recommend it!
5.0	It is my wife's favorite.  Found it at Sams club web site.2 cans  for the same price.
5.0	I bought a Keurig a few months ago to brew tea--I don't drink coffee.  The machine came with samples of tea and coffee.  I tried each of the tea samples.  I started researching and found that there were many flavors.  So, I bought a 50 k-cup variety pack in order to taste lots of different teas to figure out what I liked.  My variety pack contained one k-cup of Bigelow Tea French Vanilla.  I knew as soon as I tasted this that it was my favorite.  I bought 4 boxes.  I brew the tea in my machine and pour it over ice.  It has just a hint of vanilla that makes it perfect.  The vanilla is not over-powering--but just right.  This is really good tea.  No regrets!
1.0	Judging from the photo, this is a very sad example of Tahitian Vanilla. Looks like a piece of old firewood. Tahitian Vanilla is world renowned for its plump, moist, and heavenly fragranced beans. I am a home gourmet chef. I order from Tahitian Vanilla Company and have always gotten excellent beans for cooking/baking/flavoring etc. You may pay more up front, but the value is definitely in high quality beans actually from Tahiti, not the New Guinea type.
5.0	use this to make Mexican Rice just like we get at our favorite Mexican restaurant!
5.0	Great pasta, especially for the price. We make a lot of homemade mac and cheese and the Barilla pasta is our favorite, no matter the type. The quality and texture are consistently great. However, our local grocery store sells it for more per box than the bulk packaging price we got on Amazon. We go through enough of this pasta that the bulk packaging really paid off. It's convenient to buy a bunch at once and it's cheaper.
5.0	Excellent chili and just the perfect size for me.
5.0	Hard to find and yummy.
5.0	This is my absolute favorite flavor of tea!  I generally drink it in the morning and it helps get me going!  I recently discovered the Stash brand and love the way they package each tea bag so it is fresh when I'm ready to use it.
1.0	Product doesn't work as stated, cant use regular k-cups,  they don't fit as stated; very disappointed if I had box I would have returned.
5.0	Love, Love, Love this product!  We use this all the time to season our food. We love the fact that is low salt and low heat as I don't like overly hot n spicy on my food. This delivers just enough heat so it doesn't cover the wonderful flavor.
5.0	I absolutely love this oatmeal  and for some reason, I can only find it in the assortment boxes, no matter where I shop at here in Indiana. I don't like any of the other flavors (believe me, I've tried all of them) and luckily for me, I've been able to find them on-line at Amazon!!!
5.0	This tea is so beyond good. I ordered this large pack from Amazon because sometimes it's not in the stores & I drink this stuff so much. It's nice and sweet without being bad for you.
5.0	Good nutritional value, and easy to prepare.  I reinvented use for my old rice cooker and hot breakfast is ready by the time I get out of the shower in the morning.
5.0	The taste is awesome and very fresh
5.0	Necco Candy Wafers are an old and enjoyable candy but hard to find.<br />Especially the Chocolate Wafers.<br />As usual, if you want something hard to find, go to Amazon !!
5.0	They came in two days, just before Christmas.    They're delicious and there's a lot of them. I highly recommend them if you like cookies.
5.0	The leaves took about a month to get here (obviously since they shipped from overseas)<br />But... I expected them to take a while and that was not a problem.<br /><br />They were a great price and seem much more fresh and have a better aroma than what I was paying 3x more for at the asian market.<br /><br />Overall I'm very happy.
5.0	i get them for work. we love them and its a great buy. just wish the sizing was a little more clear, because I would have gotten the larger ones
5.0	I am never disappointed with Lindt Truffles and buy them often.
5.0	"Based on reviews I decided to try this, and panicked when I received it and the expiration date appeared to be April 2010.  Things became worse when I tried to do an automated return, and found it wasn't possible, not with coffee. Thank goodness for Amazon Customer Service Chat!  (Something I have never needed before but was thrilled to find they had under CONTACT US).<br /><br />The rep explained to me the following pasted from the chat: \\""The date is the production date, not the expiration date.  The first letters is the lot number, the next letter is the production month (A=Jan, B=Feb, etc.). The product has a two year shelf life. For a package with the date \\""API610,\\"" the expiration date is September 16th, 2012. The 'best by' date is printed on the left in the format: ddmmyy.\\""<br /><br />My code was AP1710.  I wasn't sure how P=Sept since P is the 16th letter in the alphabet and Sept is the 9th month.  But on the left, the code was 300812, so the expiration is August 30, 2012.  Somehow the Italian math works.<br /><br />Opened the coffee and Yum!  Great product."
5.0	I ordered this coffee and mmmmmmmmmm i fell in love this Coffee, I drink this coffee in Russia before!!! I did't find in USA this kinda coffee!!!!!!!!!  Seller do you wanna be rich????????? What is going on with you??? Where is coffee? When it'll be available again????????????
5.0	My wife loved the phosphate drinks from a local place, until they stopped serving them. I looked everywhere, and besides a place with ridiculous shipping from canada, this was all I could find. A bit pricey, but one bottle goes a long way. She loves the authentic flavor, and it's a regular nightly treat. Good customer service from KegWorks, too.
5.0	This is my absolute favorite hot chocolate and I've come to Amazon for my supply because my grocery store and Target sell only the single packets (10 to 20 cents apiece) and French Vanilla is often sold out or there are only a couple packets remaining on the shelves.  On Amazon, the 12 pack ranges from $10-$13 so it is substantially more expensive, but I cannot find it elsewhere and love it so much that I have succumbed to the price.  I like this mix made with milk or with water, with or without powdered coffee creamer to make it even creamier.  It's not too rich and has a nice vanilla/white chocolate mixed flavor.
5.0	Just what I wanted with prompt delivery
5.0	I first came across Soda Pop Shoppe at the Jelly Belly website and ordered it there a couple of years ago.  Reportedly, they use the actual syrups provided by the Dr Pepper-Snapple Group (that currently owns the brands), and it tastes like the real thing (no pun intended, Coca-Cola).  Some of the beans can be tricky to decipher in low light, but here's what they are:<br /><br />white = A&W Cream<br />faint-green = 7-Up<br />brown = A&W Root Beer<br />dark reddish-brown = Dr Pepper<br />purple = Grape Crush<br />orange = Orange Crush<br /><br />If you're a jelly bean addict *and* enjoy soda flavors, this will do the job on both fronts.  I try not to buy too much, or else I'll eat them all very quickly (not a good thing), but in small batches, I can make them last.  Definitely a repeat buy once you try them!
5.0	My kids love these and I feel good about giving them to them. They're all natural and sweetened with fruit juice instead of sugar. We like to pop them in the microwave for about 10 seconds - then they taste like fresh out of the oven chocolate chip cookies. Yum.
5.0	This stuff is amazing! We have eaten it on just about everything. Great on steak, chicken, shrimp skewers. We even put it on our foil pack veggies. We will absolutely order this again, it is now a family fav!
5.0	These saltines are packaged in sleeves that are about a third of the size of a regular sleeve of saltines. This is great for keeping the crackers fresh when you're not going to eat a full sleeve of crackers. They're topped with sea salt, but I didn't notice that they tasted different from saltines with regular salt. If you like Nabisco saltine crackers and are concerned about keeping them fresh then these Fresh Stacks are for you.<br /><br />The allergy information on the nutrition label of my package says that they contain wheat.
5.0	Produce arrived in a timely fashion.  Seems fresh.  This is hard to find in the local stores.  Try to stock up.
5.0	The best altoids flavor
5.0	Bought this by accident and found out I liked it to .I would and have recommended this product to friends
5.0	Tastes like brown sugar!  What a great, healthy alternative.  I'm glad I can use this since I'm on the paleo diet :)
5.0	We love this coffee when we visit NOLA, it's nice to have some of the big easy back at home
5.0	It was the prefect amount for what I needed it for. I used it for the candy table at my daughters sweet 16 party
5.0	We had this tea in Peru & loved it. Couldn't find at any local stores, so very pleased we could find online & it's delicious!
5.0	Yummy! I make it all the time.  Cooks up well.
5.0	What's not too like? Easy to make, low calories, and most importantly, they taste amazing!!!!
5.0	I am a bit late to the Keurig game and figured by this stage there would be a a myriad of variety boxes that would suit my needs... After reading an exhaustive number of reviews, I found myself coming back to the Brooklyn Beans variety pack.<br /><br />The product came faster than I had originally expected and I was pleased to find that all 40 single-cup coffees were intact.<br /><br />Typically I shy away from flavored coffees finding them overly artificial tasting and too sweet, how shocked I was when I fell in love with the maple! I am very impressed with the quality and taste of the product, I will absolutely be purchasing from Brooklyn Beans again (despite the arrival of my refillable cup).<br /><br />Great value and excellent taste!
5.0	These were absolutely awesome! To this fan of 'spicy' stuff, these chips were a delightful surprise--the taste was just right! The best of both worlds for fans of both hot wings and chips!
5.0	Gift but family enjoyed it.
5.0	Only like the Orange and Cherry Tootsie Roll Pops, so I save a lot of money and aggravation by ordering them separately. Wish they would run specials on the prices once in awhile or offer discounts for repeat customers.  Great product and fast delivery time.
5.0	Nothing is better than the nutty flavor of this oatmeal on a cold morning. So much better than rolled oats.
5.0	Some of the best pre-cooked vegetarian food I've ever bought ~ my 3 teenage daughters LOVE these!!  Very convenient after school snack for our life-long vegetarian family :)
5.0	"My husband really loves these salts. They add unuque flavors to the \\""old standards\\"". The price was great and the shipping was fast.I recommend this vendor."
5.0	My GF and I use grapeseed oil as a personal lubricant.  This product is excellent for our needs and highly recommend it.  Much cheaper than synthetic oils and is food grade quality, so no problem if consumed orally.
5.0	"Haribo Gummi Licorice is simply the best of all the licorice. It is imported from Germany and Amazon always seems to have it in stock fresh. I open the 5 pound box and repackage it into heavy duty zip lock bags. Freeze two and keep one open to nibble. I share it with special friends and even if they don't like \\""regular\\"" American style licorice thy frequently love the Haribo Licorice Wheels. Try some at this great price and I think you will like it too."
5.0	Can't make authentic polish food without this and it is just the right size for my occasional use. It really adds a nice flavor to a range of dishes including those that are not polish.
5.0	great coffee with great flavor !!  enjoying Kicking Horse coffee tremendously! I have brewed about every type of coffee available and this coffee has one of the richest flavors - highly recommend!
5.0	Excellent in every way.
5.0	"Received with 2-day delivery via USPS priority mail.  The insulated box had freezer gel in it to keep the kimchi temperature stable.  The flavor tastes very good with a level of heat that slowly builds on you. The only issue I have is that it is not fermented as much as I would like.  It seems like kimchi is ether very tangy and active or pretty quiet.  I can see that shipping tangy (product undergoing some pretty strong fermentation) kimchi can be problematic and I'm trying to increase the lactic acid content in mine by leaving it at room temperature for a few days.<br /><br />If I can tweak the fermentation more to my liking, I will most definitely order more!<br /><br />Update 10/25/14<br /><br />One of the packages I purchased was placed in a reusable Ziploc container and left on the shelf at room temperature for a couple days.  After 3 days (I think) the cover began bowing outward indicating that fermentation had started back up.  The kimchi was developing the tangy flavor I like!  I put it in the refrigerator and a day later, it's still slowly fermenting which is what I like to see.  This is most definitely going on my \\""buy again\\"" list!!"
5.0	we just love this popcorn. it is our favorite. We hate it when we run out of it. it is the best
5.0	every time i eat one of this i feel closer to jesus.  My heart warms.  this is truly manna from heaven.  if god where to make a breakfast confection there is no doubt in my mind it would be apple strudel pop tarts.  You don't eat an apple strudel pop tart you let it inside of you and lets its hardness become moist.    god bless America   and god bless apple strudel pop tarts
5.0	We bought this sea salt in Spain the first time, my husband used it a lot in pasta dishes with seafood and we really liked it, it is also good in salad dressings! we found it in Amazon and enjoyed it again, you can add more flavor to your cook.
1.0	The photo is very deceptive.  You cannot tell how thick the blocks of cheese are looking at the photo.  In reality, they are really thin, giving you just a few bites.  I would not purchase this product again.
5.0	I mix it with Green Tea, it fills me up when I'm hungry.  The amount of ginger in this product is excellent, and the taste is awesome.
5.0	Very delicious tea, very refreshing. Can be made as hot tea or ice tea for a hot summer days. it is all natural and no sugar needed, it already comes sweet and delicious. The seller is great, good communication and fast shipment, Highly recommended!
5.0	Based on enjoying their Sheppard's Mix spice, bought this set as a gift.  Excellent gift!  My friend from India complimented the rich flavors, nice variety, and packaging - steel canisters will lock in freshness for a long time.  The next day, she prepared  a dish with only rice, mixed vegetables and the garam masala.  So simple, yet so, so sumptuous - spicy but not hot.  She's looking forward to cooking different dishes with the other spices in the coming weeks and I can't wait.
5.0	Get this box of jelly beans and plan a quiet evenning with your significant other.  These are great jelly beans and you can have at least a couple hours of fun trying these with someone an making up your own mixed flavors.  This is quite a bit of candy.  Worth the price if you like gormet candy.  You have to try buttered popcorn with either blackberry or blueberry, simply amazing flavor.
5.0	Used this flour in the bread recipe and it was delicious. So much better than having to buy several flours and mixing my own. Bob's Red Mill is always a good quality product.
5.0	I love the taste and the energy it gives me. I add a little honey to it.
5.0	Marie Sharps is the best.
5.0	Excellent.  Glad I was able to find it on Amazon.  Taste is wonderful.  Adds an extra something to mayo.
5.0	Great deal, put this in my protein shakes to add flavor without adding the sugar calories of regular peanut butter.
5.0	I love Watkins products and used to be a dealer for them. I will only use their vanilla, cinnamon, and pepper.
5.0	We grew up with these flakes in an ice cream cone - they were called &#34;a 99&#34; - and that's how I used them. A wonderful treat!
1.0	This stuff tastes gross!  Would not order again.
5.0	After a lot of searching, I have found the tea mix I have been looking for. This is the secret my local Thai restaurant doesn't want me to know. Now instead of spending $4.00 for a single glass of tea I spent $7 for 2 pounds of it. Easy to make, comes loose so you will need an infuser, I use a french press, as the infuser is a bit small for the amount of tea needed. I like to use half and half and agave nectar replace sweetened condensed milk...which I find a bit cloying. This Tea mix has become a daily ritual for me this summer.
5.0	My wife and I experimented with these by adding milk, ice cubes, and fruit (bananas, strawberries, blueberries, or other) to our blender.  They make incredible (and healthy) drinks.  To be honest, we have never simply added milk to them and used them for a breakfast drink.  However, I will be a regular customer on this product, which is not always easy to find in the grocery stores.
5.0	I've been using this flour happily for a year now to make gluten-free bread for my teenage son.  This flour by Red Mill is just as good as the more expensive Authentic Foods' Garfava flour.  This flour does give a distinct beany taste, but when I add chopped onion to any bread recipe, the beany taste is not noticeable at all.  I make onion gluten-free bread every week---it can be used for sandwiches when just baked.  After 2 days it's best toasted.
5.0	I add a little of this sugar free chocolate syrup to my morning coffee in place of sugar and/or cream.
5.0	I dare anyone to tell these from the ones with sugar(they may be a little bit sweeter), but overall they let people on low or no sugar enjoy a very good tasting candy.
5.0	I have not tried the product personally, it was a gift. My mom loved it and says that it works and tastes great!
5.0	Best natural peanut butter that tastes great and the price is better than Walmart. I use one a day with celery sticks. Highly recommend
5.0	Real sea salt, the name says it all very true to what salt is but a little gritty just like real salt would be if we harvested our own..
5.0	This mix is so easy to use and it tastes amazing. Definitely recommended to anyone who loves making smoothies at home! All you need is the mix, ice and water!
5.0	I have been ordering the turkey bits for quite some time now and I really like them.  I think they are probably better for you than beef bits too as they don't have as much fat.
5.0	If you don't want a normal sized biscotti but crave the taste, then these are the ones to get.<br /><br />They are bite sized.  A bit hard to eat...be careful biting into them.  They are a bit hard.  But, if you like dunking biscotti in coffee or another beverage, they are great.  Bite sized and taste great.<br /><br />You may be tempted to have two or three at a time.<br /><br />They are individually wrapped which is just what works for me.
5.0	Organic Aloe Vera to drink with organic lemon and fiber.  More natural that other products I searched for.  Great for digestion.
5.0	These are fantastic!  I love flavored sunflower seeds but don't want to the artificial chemical that are common in brands available in my local stores.  I got the southwest fajita and toasted onion/garlic in my first order and can't wait to try other flavors in my next order.
5.0	Finely found where I can get theses, I love theses Vegan hot dogs I was introduced to them from church family when I was a little kid, this is the only place around here to find them, thanks!!!
5.0	I've bought several of these and they are wonderful! Keep out of moisture and high heat---common sense, right? Great taste and ALL NATURAL, if that matters to you. It does to me. Try it and you will be jumping up and down like the little man on the box!
5.0	I read the reviews, figured I'd give this a shot. Tastes great, adds an amazing flavor to your popcorn. Nice finely grounded salt and buttery flavor. You can't go wrong with this. Just don't forget to have an extra shaker around. It's kind of hard to pour out of the container!!
5.0	I LOVE this coffee- it blows pretty much all the others<br />away, including Starbucks and Gevalia-- and it's a great<br />price.<br />I was turned on to Melitta by my aunt in New York, but that<br />was the Traditional and it worked for me for several years-<br />then I saw the European Roast and that's all I drink now.<br /><br />I get this coffee shipped to me monthly, cheaper<br />than I can grab it at Publix. I love Amazon!<br /><br />Try this coffee, don't let the great price deter you-<br />it's dark, rich and yummy!
5.0	i bought these ones for my sister in law , she's vietnamese and my bro and i are ecuadorian (we all live here), of course it is impossible to find these things here so i happily bought these for her and she thinks they are great for her vietnamese rolls! :) i also have tried them, they taste great, she says it's good quality
5.0	Love them love them love them....
1.0	I am a longtime satisfied amazon customer but thought i made a mistake when i recieved this product until i read the other reviews. It's seems the mistake is not mine but amazon's (as several other reviews have noted )
5.0	"Being from Wisconsin, I wanted to offer something from my home state to colleagues and visitors to our office -- as I work overseas representing our Country.  Finding something individually wrapped to do this wasn't easy, so I initially \\""settled\\"" on these cookies.    WOW!  These literally are The Most Fabulous Shortbread cookies ever.  There's no settling for anything about them.  Everyone loves them and I simply can not keep them around long enough.    Wisconsinmade makes me very proud and this company can be proud to be spreading their great tasting cookies with other cultures.    Thank you and I'm placing another order now."
5.0	Tastes good, colors are muted and more natural compared to M&M's but consider that there is no chemicals or dyes used. Great resealable bag.
5.0	The GBP was shipped very soon after order and arrived in good condition. Had to put GBP in fridge for a couple days before I could get started. Following the included instructions the SCOBY took off right away. I am on my 5th batch now and have doubled the size. Experimenting with some flavors now.
5.0	A scotch old fashioned (blame my mother) is my winter cocktail.  This mix is no longer available locally, so I grabbed a case when the cost was about the same as it once was in the store. Is this as good as making one from scratch?  Not quite.  But, I add a little extra bitters and call it good enough.  We live in Wisconsin, the brandy drinking capitol of America.  My marriage contract requires that I have a brandy old fashioned waiting for my husband after church council meetings.  I add extra bitters and he calls it perfect.
5.0	Works well instead of formula or soy milk for my daughters bottle. Easy to mix as long as water is warmed. And she loves the taste! Plus much more affordable than buying goat milk cartons in the store.
5.0	Tried these in Florida, fell in love. Alas, my love was not available to me at home in Hawaii, but Amazon played match maker, and we were reunited. Now I find myself wondering where oh where...wait, I ate them all!
5.0	I bought this at Costco.  Thought it was amazingly wonderful and went back to get more.  It was gone.  I had the manager look it up and discovered that Costco had discontinued it - but the manager found some at a store 15 miles away.  I drove there right away and bought them out.  160 packets.  That's how good I think it is.  We are half way through, and I was getting a little anxious tonight as I made dinner.  So, yeah, Amazon carries it.  My kids love this.  90 seconds and it's done!
5.0	Thank you Amazon for offering my favorite granola at an unbeatable price.  I have this product on auto-ship and the savings are well worth it...kudos to Amazon...I love this stuff!
1.0	Amazon charged me $4.31 for this when it was supposed to be free. Be sure to check your statement to make sure you did not get charged. I'm sure anyone getting this is getting it on the supposedly free promotion since no one in their right mind would pay over $5 for a handful of granola. Tastes like a handful of hamster food.
5.0	Burton & Burton was ingenious in putting together this adorable snowman kit.  The various elements contained in the 'snowman' bucket are colorful and durable...will last through decades of fun snowman building!  The best snowman in the neighborhood will always be at my grandchildren's house!
5.0	Pioneer gravy packs I think are the best!  I don't like<br />pepper, my husband does.  We buy this variety<br />and he adds pepper at the table.<br />  It's smooth, easy to prepare. Grate on the frozen<br />biscuits we buy!  Beats eating out!
5.0	This is our second container of these lollipops in more than a year. They taste very good, fruity and are nicely sweet. The size of the lollipops is perfect. I have tasted all flavors and think they are all good. Now being used to these, other lollipops have a strange artificial taste. We also avoid artificial colors. We are dairy free and these are great treats for all occasions.
5.0	Consistently delicious.
5.0	This is indeed a huge seed of pumpkin seeds. They are un-roasted, un-salted, totally nude. Also they're pretty fresh. The bag is thick plastic so you can use it for storage and it won't rip. Nice seeds guys.
5.0	This coffee is really good. Was very surprised. Have ordered more for the wife, plan on ordering more in perpetuity.
5.0	Yes just sipping a tablespoon of this mixed with 12 0z hot water is the ticket.<br />Tastes like pure sweetness in every way. Definite attitude and energy boost from all the good nutrients.
5.0	Love this coffee. Always lovely in the morning for a quick &#34;get me up and moving&#34;.
5.0	good night, what is the expiration date of the product? I need to Venezuela for my daughter but I am concerned about durability
5.0	I love these. I love having half-and-half in my coffee, but I can't use up a whole pint by myself before it goes bad. These are perfect for that. I also love being able to know precisely how much cream I'm adding, instead of sloshing some in. And I love taking these along when I'm traveling.<br /><br />As others have mentioned, the expiration date is pretty soon: it's real half-and-half, so even with whatever they do to it so it doesn't have to be refrigerated, it's still going to go bad in awhile. Mine arrived May 3rd, and they have an expiration of July 27th. That gave me approximately 3 months to use them---though today is the 29th and they still smell/taste good. I couldn't use them all up in that time, but I got a good enough price on them that they were still a better deal than buying pints of half-and-half.<br /><br />My main concern is all the little plastic trash I'm generating by using these. I've wondered if it would be better to use the pints after all, for that reason.
1.0	Disappointing, sweet cardboard with coconut taste. Gave them away
5.0	Boston baked beans are the best candy
5.0	all those machines/systems costing hundreds of  dollars..UGH!...Senseo is &#34;under pressure&#34; and each single cup is almost like having cappucino!! Same price on Amazon as anywhere and better service and delivery!! Thanks
5.0	I use this stuff everyday and it is excellent! It is better than the one I had prior and I like it a lot. Highly recommended.
5.0	This cereal is excellent for the fiber content and actually has a yummy flavor.  Now, don't take your first bite expecting it to taste like Raisin Bran.  After I finished my first bowl, I thought...Wow! That was actually good. A++ for the Cinnamon flavor and crunchy granola.  I eat this cereal every other morning.
5.0	I suppose I've gotten tired of the spicy bowl noodles. This has a seaweed and broth flavor that doesn't seem to get old to me. Also, unlike the spicy seafood which had coworkers telling my office smelled like a swamp, this seems to not elicit that response, though, really, this has seaweed. You'd think it would be the other way around.
5.0	I start my mornings with a cup of coffee & this biscotti. A great way to start the day.  DELICIOUS!
5.0	Thanks for the refreshing blast from the past these are great, a little on the tougher side and chewy but still they are wonderful!
5.0	I was reluctant, not knowing what to expect.  I'm glad I took the chance.<br /><br />Ancho chili is a spice that instantly recalls flavors of Mexico and the US desert SW.  But it's not -hot-.  I've added it to make chili, sure, but also in any other recipe where I'd like to add a little extra southwestern pizzazz from some seafood recipes to macaroni and cheese.<br /><br />Now that I have it, I won't ever be without it.  It's now an essential in my kitchen.
5.0	Simply put, I get a good burst of energy with no sugar crash.  Bloks taste good and are easy to carry around.  I pretty much always have one on me, in my car and a couple in the bag for travel and outdoor adventures.  This new flavor is probably my favorite, right ahead of strawberry and the lemon-lime.  I also prefer the non-caffeinated bloks for all but emergency snacks at work.
1.0	I ordered vanilla latte and got Cappucino.
5.0	This is the only true &#34;white tea&#34; I can find, wonderful drink for anytime of the day.
5.0	It organizes the k cups and also saves room in my cupboards. Easy to see brands of tea , coffee, flavoured beverages.
5.0	WOW! What an amazing taste for my Senseo!! I was previously using the Melitta Buzzworthy Pods --- these ones win hands down!!! ...and they are organic!! Will definitely order more!!
5.0	My absolute favorite Davidon's tea!!! The subtle sweetness is perfect.
1.0	Why am I giving this product a 1 star? I believe half filled bottles prove to be unfair. I am a committed and constant shopper on Amazon, but this order was disappointing. I opened one to find it a little above half. I opened a 2nd to find it below half and so on. That defeats the purpose of buying bulk. The white cheddar seasoning tastes fresh and delicious. Again, my disappointment is with the purposely low filled containers. Which will have you needing to reorder faster than expected.
5.0	Very nice milk. We use this for the cooking~
5.0	I was really hoping the positive reviews were accurate for me (meaning same tastes in food) as I have been expensively disappointed in the past w/ a few of the 5 star food reviews. I just finished my first pancakes. They were very good as they looked and tasted like typical pancakes-well, maybe a little lighter and tastier. I was VERY pleased and will try the other recipes on the package. To make the standard pancakes, it only took one egg, one tbsp. of oil and 3/4 cup of water. Since i cooked them using my Anolon titanium pan, no oil was required. Quick, easy and delicious topped only w/ organic maple syrup. Enjoy!
5.0	Great Stuff, seamless order.
5.0	My infant son really liked this product. I even tasted it and found it palatable. I try to find foods higher in protein because that translates to higher nutritional value. I started him at about 7 months on these, and he had no problem with the texture. I would buy again.
5.0	It's chocolate. It's coffee. How can you go wrong?!? I'm impressed with the company and I received my product way before the suggested delivery date. Item came with a re-freezable ice pack that worked great. I'm using it over & over again when I pack a lunch.  Trust this seller. Nothing but great words for the entire transaction.
5.0	I am so glad I purchased this for my mother's birthday. You can only get Big Red in the southern United States and we have been living in the Midwest for almost ten years. My mother was so happy to get this and I was very pleased that the sodas arrived on time and in good condition.
1.0	I didn't like these crackers at all.  They had a horrible texture, taste, and after taste.  I threw most of the bag away.  If I want a cheesy crunchy snack I'll stick to Nut Thins Almond Cheddar Cheese crackers.
1.0	Overrated and overpriced. Make your own goodie bag for much less.
5.0	This is the best curry paste ever..!!!
5.0	I love this, I also add Madhava Organic Ooh La La Vanilla Coffee Syrup to it. Oh yeah.  I just wish it was made with Steel Cut Oats.  That would be a plus.
5.0	I gave it five stars because this soup taste great the 10.1 ounce bags makes a meal for the whole family. you can add chicken or pork if you want more. I recommend this to everyone.
5.0	Jasmine is my favorite tea.....can't go wrong with this flavor.
5.0	One of Starbucks's best new brews.  I only wish it was available year round!  Thank goodness for Amazon and its sellers or I would have to wait clear until next December before I could enjoy a delicious cup of this coffee.<br />Thank you!!
1.0	It looks like I'm not the only one dealing with this issue - The expiration date on these bottles was 15 DAYS AFTER ARRIVAL. Yes, that's right, 15 days to finish 6 bottles of creamer. Needless to say - a lot of this stuff went to waste. I wish I would have read some of these reviews before purchasing. Shocked and upset.
5.0	My family loves these and I like to add them to their lunches as a special treat!
5.0	We LOVE this spice mix!!!  Awesome for our Whole 30!!!!  Thank you!
5.0	I mean, they're delicious.
1.0	What a ripoff! Bought these for Mother's Day. Only one ode the blooms is open. Very sad looking. Very disappointed.
5.0	They are very nice and very reasonable.  I was surprised at the quality of this order.
5.0	We lived in Tampa, where this coffee is very well known. Take it from a Cuban...Cafe Con Leche made with this coffee is unbeatable. I did not purchase it from Amazon, as I can get it much cheaper in Publix stores and I do not have to pay shipping charges.  I just wanted to comment on how wonderful this coffee truly is.
5.0	These are so good.  They even fit in our jelly bean dispenser even though some are rather large.  I just wish that they were still Amazon Prime available...or at least free super saver shipping eligible!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5.0	I knew they were still making it; but finding it around my area was &#34;hit-and-miss&#34; - mostly &#34;miss.&#34;  Great price; great packaging; good product.
5.0	exactly what i was looking for!
5.0	We love all the different flavors and different uses for these salts. It was a great gift for my husband.
5.0	Got these for my Dad for Fathers day to go with his pistachios I got him either Fathers day or Christmas.
1.0	I grew up in Germany, and I have found that German made gummies to be sold in the US are nothing like the originals. These were too soft and too sweet. Gave them to my very American niece and nephew. They loved the smurfs.
5.0	Mung Beans cost an arm and a leg in the grocery store, and they are so easy to sprout.  These seeds are great, and sprout well.  I'm very pleased with the purchase.
5.0	It is reliable.  It arrived as advertised - no added sugar, no sodium. I love it's sour taste with no sugar. It has Iron in it as well. I am ordering it again.
1.0	the 10 little pieces of gummy candy in each bag tastes cheap and chemically. The kids definitely were entertained by the light up tongs...for about 3 minutes that is. Not recommended.
1.0	I opened this product to find that the lollipops were all broke, I was very disappointed.  They did not package this product in a way that would help keep it from breaking.  You are better off buying them from a store around your area.
5.0	Fresh and Delicious! Purchased with a Nordic Ware 12-cup popper. Fills exactly to the top ... follow the instructions and ENJOY!!
5.0	10 year old daughter loves this stuff - she can't have gluten. i'm sure it isn't healthy, but it makes her feel more like normal kids, so it's worth it.
5.0	This brand is always good
1.0	This tastes terrible. I can't even describe it. It's like a bad aftertaste- from the first second it touches your tongue.
5.0	Thank you! These caramels are delicious!! They arrived quickly and in very nice packaging! This was perfect gift for someone who was kind enough to share them with me!
5.0	Great flavor, strong enough without bitterness. Automatic delivery means I never run out too, couldn't ask for a better deal !!
5.0	Im in love with these little meals! I could never find him anymore except for walmart... But i think the alfredo is the best one... Its even tasty and soft for children to eat once in a while.. I would recommend it hands down!!
5.0	I love Israeli cous cous or as my husband calls it pastine...it isn't always carried in our local grocery stores and there are 3 big ones in less than 4 miles of our house. So I thought why not get it online? I followed the directions for cooking on it instead of doing it my own made up way and it was so delicious.
5.0	So much better than the one made for the Keurig and you do not have to remove the holder of the KCups to use it.
5.0	This is the best pancake mix on the market, the only drawback is that it is expensive.  King Arthur needs to reevaluate the pricing on this product.
5.0	Yummy!  A fun way to get extra protein.
5.0	For me, it's the best tasting coffee on the planet! Strong, robust, full-bodied and after I add some amaretto and a splash of french vanilla with 2 tbsp of hot cocoa, it tastes like Mocha Grande.
5.0	This was my first time eating these and they were fantastic, I was recommended them by a friend. They are somewhat of an acquired taste I suppose but good.
5.0	You MUST try this...take one segment, dunk in your coffee a few seconds, then let the molten chocolate delight your mouth. Or take a small bit and keep it in your mouth while sipping. I have even made a hot chocolate with it by melting a few slices in milk. Unbelievable!
5.0	This item is a must have for the pantry. There are so many things you can make using this simple ingredient, and with the ease of having it shipped it right to my door - I can't beat it!
1.0	I tried these caps with 2 different Nespresso Machines. Simply does not work! The water from the machine instead of passing through cap and make coffee - simply goes as water to trash bag! Same to other caps of this company. But with some other machines - it works. At least you get a refund easy and the company is working to improve!
5.0	I loved this product when a child and still do.  Nice peace of home while deployed. Even enough to share.
5.0	Best vegan protein I have had. Takes like chocolate graham crackers, instead of dirt like most of the other types I have tried.  I used to drink with vanilla almond milk because the powder tastes bad, but now I can drink with unsweetened almond milk and cut about 20g of sugar. That makes me happy, plus its cheaper than the alternatives, win/win.
5.0	Great tasting molasses and it's organic! Can't go wrong with that! It tasted so good, I had to look at the ingredients to make sure there was nothing else added to it, but nope, it's just molasses. I grew up with molasses in place of white sugar (strict healthy family, long story), but I don't remember it tasting this delicious...maybe just knowing the benefits and all the goodness in them now that I'm older makes it tastes better to me. I bought it here on Amazon for $9+, I think it was a good buy considering that sometimes, with work and kids and endless things I am pulled to in every which direction, I just don't have the time to drive to a health store or local store to buy just one organic item. One click at work on my break and it's one thing crossed off my to buy list.
5.0	Fantastic product. I was it everyday!
1.0	I thought it just tasted awful - an overpowering aftertaste that could only be tamed with massive amounts of garlic, lemon and salt.
5.0	Put this in my coffee!  Delicious and nutritious!
5.0	My husband is a diabetic and he loves sweets. This is the best tasting substitute available. It's great on oatmeal or in any cookie recipe.
5.0	My wife prefers rice based products to wheat or corn, and we were out of brown rice spaghetti, so I bought this.  We like it just fine.
5.0	This is the best decaf I have had.  Usually I am not a fan of   decaf coffee but this one is bold and taste good. It will be my  regular choice.
5.0	This jam was very good. Not overly sweet like other companies.  I did find a few jars broken by FedX though. I would buy again.
5.0	Best flavor, good nutrition, low sodium, only 50 calories per serving.  Very satisfying.  Don't want to be without it.<br />Please bring it back.
5.0	They were good but now they are even better. This batch contained all five flavor packets like they do in Australia. I'm so happy
1.0	it started out pretty good....I transferred some to an airtight container and used those berries, leaving the rest int he bag in my pantry. When I went to refill my container...I found that worms had hatched and spun webs throughout the bag. GROSS!
5.0	Very tasty but pricey. I would prefer if they sold the milk pods separately. The coffee was goo. I don't know if I would buy again
5.0	I read a lot of reviews on this filter before I bought it. I was afraid I would have trouble with occasional spills, but it's been great! I even fill the grinds all the way to the fill line, which is says not to do, to avoid overflowing. This is a great alternative to buying the expensive K-cups. Now, I can use less expensive coffee on most days and splurge on a K-cup when I want a treat. I would highly recommend this!
5.0	Just love this coffee!!
5.0	I LOVE this product!  In fact, I'm a little addicted to it.  Mix it with an avacado... oh yum.  The taste is a bit strong, but thats why its good mixing it with something else.  Actually, I like eating it by the spoonful.
5.0	OMG good for how easy it is to make.
5.0	never tried this before. It tastes great, but it goes against my diet. Gotta portion my monster drinks.
5.0	thank you great seller!!!! this kit tasted nice the strawberry tasted like strawberry, vanilla tasted like coconut to me it just  had a unique texture kinda like a paste.
5.0	Perfection in every bite! And I know I don't have to worry about weird chemicals or compromising health issues.
5.0	This reusable  cup works awesome in my Keurig vue. It saves you loads of money! I'd recommend it to anyone.
5.0	My favorite cereal product, this one is a value pack , it is cheaper as in the store and each pack have 133g more, 4 packs of this product is like 5 and half of the regular one , and I really love to start my day with and sometime end the day also and still losing my pounds , I don't know why but when I stop eating it I stop losing my pounds even if I don't eat to much , it just run my metabolism the way it should be ...
5.0	This is by far the best coffee for making real espresso without breaking the bank. There are better alternatives,but they cost way too much. For around $20 per 2.2 lb bag this one is a great deal. You could get cheaper coffee, but the quality will be nowhere near. It is perfectly roasted, not burned like most espresso type coffee found at the stores. Because of that it can be actually gridded very fine and that makes the espresso rich and strong. To get The best deal on lavazza I recommend getting e package deal - I usually buy 6 bags.
5.0	Brought me back to the days of my youth when my grandma used to always have them in her cupboard!!
5.0	Today was the first day to try this. Fabulous! WE like rich, dark, aroma coffee. We stopped using plastic coffeemakers (that is, all drips) and went to the old days with a peculator. At last aroma that fills the room and a great cup of coffee.
1.0	Purchased lemonade, advertised as a 5 lb 2.5 oz canister.<br /><br />Received 4lb 3.3 oz canister.<br />Will not buy from them again.<br />If they are going to providing the 4lb canisters, then their description and picture need to accurately reflect this.<br />This is false advertising on the part of the seller.<br />They will not let me return it, or I would.<br />Be advised when you buy.
5.0	You can customize your cup of coffee, from strength to how hot you want it brewed.  I also like herb tea and use this machine to regulate the temperature of my brewed tea.  I love its versatility.
5.0	I love this mix. It is the only one I was able to find that has you add real bananas. Very easy to make.
5.0	Easy to use, dissolves easily, produces a clear gelatin, no unwanted extra flavor. I use Knox for many cooking and craft related uses.
5.0	Out of all the *dried* tortellini I've tried these are the closest to the ones I used to have as a kid in Europe. I just subscribe and save order a 3pack each month and my kids love them.
5.0	I loved this, making it was as much fun as eating it. Though I wouldn't recommend it to those who don't have an open mind or lack patience.
5.0	I always have these in my pantry. The granules are very hard to find in grocery stores anymore. There are a million uses for this product. Any recipe that calls for chicken broth - this can be used instead. I put about a tablesponn and a half in the water when I cook frozen peas. It gives them a great taste. Also, anything you have to saute can be simmered in this instead. It really cuts down on the fat!! Everyone should have a jar of this in their kitchen.
5.0	If it is not &#34;Dutch washed&#34;, as I believe, it is a good source of phytonutrients.
5.0	David Pumpkin seeds are the best.  Most pumpkin seeds have such a thick outer shell (or layer of salt) that  you can't eat the whole thing.  These are light and crisp and you can either eat the whole seed, or bust it open and just eat the inside.  My only complaint with these are the price.  After signing up for the automatic shipments, Amazon hiked the price up.  So, after my first automatic shipment, I had to cancel.  I guess from now on, I'll have to wait for them to be on sale, (Conagra is the maker, and Amazon puts Conagra items on sale every few months), and stock up on them when they are.
5.0	cooks great in the rice cooker! Add flavor by cooking it in stock :)  I can digest this much better than brown rice. I also love the jugs... we reuse them in the garage for screws etc!
5.0	Best Wing Sauce Ever!!!!!!
5.0	I was nervous what the flavor would be like, but happy to report it tastes just like most of us would expect a regular Italian seasoning to taste!  This is a lot of seasoning and will last a good long time.
5.0	This one of the best flax seed I have bought.  Great product.  Will buy again.
5.0	Awesome coffee!  First bought it at the Reading Terminal Market in Philly.  So good, I had to get more.  I was so excited that I found it on Amazon.
5.0	Very nice small olives. Can't believe they ship this for free.
5.0	Super fine blend that makes excellent baked goods and breading for chicken and fish. We use it in place of grain flours since my son and I cannot have grains.
5.0	I gave these to my husband for Christmas, and we had them over the holidays.  They were sooo tender and juicy!  They arrive so quickly. I am always thrilled with Omaha steaks.  Thanks for such a wonderful product!
5.0	I love creamy peanut butter, but then found out how bad it could be and how much sugar is in it! This stuff is amazing and fun to cook with too!
5.0	"I was expecting a rather small bonsai tree with an extended shipping time. I received a wonderful tree in record time. The tree is lush and healthy and arrived packed well. I opened it when I got home from work (it was waiting by my apartment door) late one night. I didn't realize when I started the project that it would take me 30 min to get all of the \\""popcorn\\"" packing material out of the box just so I could get to the plant. The work and time was well-spent however when, as mentioned, I found the glorious, undamaged plant complete with rocks and  tray to set it on. I have gotten rave comments with it."
5.0	We love these and very reasonably priced.
5.0	I love Eight O'clock coffee, and I love grinding my own beans. This was a great price for this product, and I'm set to drink coffee for a while.
5.0	Bought these since we are trying to cut down on our meat intake. They were really good and had a nice texture. I thought they had better flavor than a lot of meat hot dogs I have had. I even went out and bought another pack the next day since we both thought they were fabulous! ( Careful of their Smoked Chipotle sausage though - they are ridiculously hot. We couldn't eat them.)
5.0	A great, affordable alternative and really tasty! Everyone eats it without blinking an eye.
5.0	The best grown up cereal out there imho... These arrived in good shape. Bran, raisins-check. Not much else to say other than I prefer it to most of the of the similar ones out there...
5.0	These little guys work perfectly. They fit perfect and perform great. They do not cause my machine to leak at all which was a concern from some of the reviews.
5.0	Great Yeast!  I haven't been able to find this locally and I've to order it and I'm ordering all the different one I can try.
5.0	I had no duplicates. There were many flavors I had wanted to try included in the mix. A small selection of teas (4-5), which was great since I am not a big tea drinker, and a selection of decafs (6-7) which I was very excited about because I had been looking for a good decaf since I am pregnant and now I can try all of these, many of which were on my short list to try--including some flavored decafs. The rest was a wide range of flavors, brands and strengths of coffee. I also read one review where the reviewer said that many of their cups were expired, I checked everyone of mine and all were perfect. Although one brand, Grove Square, does not have expiration dates on their cups--very unfortunate. I only had 4 of that brand included, and those cups seemed very light weight compared to the rest, I don't have much hope for those.<br /><br />Get it, it is worth it.
5.0	Popchips was a known quantity to me, I love their sweet potato chips, so I jumped at the chance to try their kettle corn chips. They are awesome! Light and crispy, way better than [[ASIN:B008JBDFG8 Kellogg's Special K Popcorn Chips, Sweet and Salty, 4.5-Ounce]]. They are slightly bigger and more airy. A 1-ounce serving is 130 calories (35 from fat), 125mg of sodium, 20 carbs (2g fiber, 3g sugar), and 2g protein. They are even gluten free. As great as a fresh apple or carrot sticks? Not by a long shot, but one of the better snack choices out there!
5.0	Love this stuff!  It really does make everything taste better.
1.0	This fire cider may be a great product, but it's something that does not have to be bought here on Amazon, or anywhere. As a community herbalist for over 15 years, I do not recommend anyone buy this product from a company that claims to own the name &#34;Fire Cider&#34;, when in fact, the word 'fire cider' is as common as the word 'herbal tea'.  I truly believe in karma, and the energy that is attached to this product now, after the backlash of the trademark issues, is not worth it. Better off to learn how to make your own. Pick up Rosemary Gladstar's book and see for yourself.<br /><br />Rosemary Gladstar's response to the trademarking of &#34;Fire Cider&#34;:<br /><br />Dear Friends, I just found out about this situation a few days ago and, of course, was surprised and extremely disappointed that someone would think they had the right to trademark a name and product that's been in public use for over 3 decades. I had written to the gentleman directly, hoping to be able to persuade him that this wasn't his name to trademark as I didn't want it to go public without giving him the opportunity to rescind his trademark. Unfortunately, he seems pretty set in his 'right' to own the name even though I first made fire cider and gave it its name over 35 years ago. In the meantime I've taught hundreds if not thousands of people to make it, who have them taught others…this product is clearly a 'peoples medicine' and isn't to be 'owned'. Of course, as with most herbal products, its based on old formulas, so it's even pretentious for me to say 'I made it up'. My grandmother used herbs, vinegar and honey and she probably learned from her grandmother. We all learn from one another…..<br /><br />My guess is that this man or his sister (I think its actually his sister or sister in law who makes the product) learned how to make it from someone who read the directions in my book or from one of my classes, or, perhaps, one of my students. They thought it was a great recipe, whichit is, and decided to make it for others, as so many others have done, and have been doing for centuries. That's the beauty of herbs, learning and passing the information on. Like so many others, he, too, decided to make it and sell it. All great, but then to lay claim to something that's clearly not his to lay claim, is wrong. And to then tell others they can't use the name anymore!! What am I suppose to do, remove it from all of my literature, copyrighted books, class handouts and correspondence course?!<br /><br />Personally, I don't think that a good response is necessarily anger, but rather a clear message that this isn't to be tolerated in the herbal community. That we as a community are here to teach, educate, heal, and share information, recipes, and ideas. Furthermore, with something like Fire Cider that's been in use for so long, and a product whose name is already well known and circulated in the world, he nor anyone else has the right or privilege to take ownership of it. He can certainly make the product and even call it Fire Cider, but if he wants to trademark it, he needs to make up his own name, and, ideally, a product that's uniquely his own. If we allow Fire Cider to be trademarked, then it sets a precedent. Next we'll see Rosemary's Famous Face cream copy righted or Kloss's lineament, Kava Chai, Chaga Chai, etc etc. Its one thing when you make a totally unique product and give it a name that's not been used before. But this clearly isn't the case in this situation. He may have brought the trademark and thinks he owns the formula and name, but he's doing it at a great cost to himself, and his company.<br /><br />I spend hardly any time on the internet or Facebook so am behind the times in what information is being passed along in 'cyber space'. But please do feel free to post this response. What I would suggest is for people to actively respond to this person with a kind but clear and straightforward that this isn't going to be tolerated. He needsto rename his product. Fire Cider was around long before he ever starting making and using it and that unless he rescinds on the trademark, we will spread the word like wildfire. He may end up owning the name but he won't have a very popular or successful business. We also needed to cc Etsy on all correspondence, as they too, need to understand the situation.<br /><br />Thank you again for contacting me.<br />With you in herbal ways,<br />Rosemary Gladstar
5.0	Just as great as ever!  delivery was speedy and the candy is just great! this is a good item to have in your purse.
5.0	Will order more at another time. I have also sent several tubs to friends and family members, who greatly love the cheese
5.0	I love this sauce...recommend to anyone who loves BBQ sauce...
5.0	I did not think I would like this.  I was wrong.  I loved it!!  I want more!  Although I will admit, it cost way too much on online at this time but If I could find them for $5 a bag or so, I would go for it.  I was originally given this by my grandmother, but she doesn't remember where she bought it so I will be hunting for these while out shopping.<br /><br />I am not normally a fan of white chocolate but the way it is drizzled over the kettlecorn and toss in just a dash of peppermint delight and it is something for the tastebuds to behold!  This is one of those snacks you can keep munching at and before you know it, you are holding an empty bag.  The flavors work together in a way I would never have expected.
5.0	Love the Trinidad Scorpion will buy again
5.0	Product was beautiful & did not effect the flavor of the icing.  I would buy again.
5.0	This is a very tasty gluten-free cereal which I've enjoyed for over 10 years.  It has become impossible to find in my local groceries.  Glad to get it here.
5.0	I've been experimenting with it.  It doesn't take a lot to impart a very nice toasty flavor to foods, it should last a while.
5.0	This is a great snack for when watching TV, sitting at the desk working or late night snack. I will order these chips again.
5.0	this is wonderful barbeque sauce!  its tasty and you dont have to use alot and it gives whatever you are bbq'ing a wonderful flavor!  and the bottle when empty will become a collector item to be used for flowers- both real and imitation! its cute and appealing!
5.0	yum, the flavor in this bar is great and it's good for you too. the best of both worlds..bought them for stocking stuffers and ate half of them before they made their way in!
5.0	great coffee good price i read the reviiews and was sceptical about ordering works great with my Kurig will order again
5.0	It's suppose to help any problems so I'm trying it.  I've heard nothing but good things
5.0	We use this product because we read information in another source about it's health benefits.  Taste much better than most instant coffee that can be purchased.
5.0	One of the best coffee I have ever tasted.  Taste is just right.
5.0	These make a great healthy snack.  Easy to carry, organic and good price
5.0	this is a GREAT SNACK. so healthy and enjoyable.  This is the snack i grab after I do my boot camp workouts.
5.0	This product is amazing I am hooked it's so delicious and versatile you can do anything with it. It can be added to shakes or into your baking.
5.0	"You know how some schools want \\""halloween\\"" parties to be called \\""fall\\"" parties, being sensitive to folks who don't celebrate Halloween?  Well, our school is one of them...and this treat makes the perfect contribution to our fall-themed party.  Even though it could equally be used to create spooky jack-o-lantern treats, it can also be used just to make pretty pumpkins that fit right in with our fall theme.  And of course you can't go wrong with a rice krispies treat!  Kids love them (and so do I).  My daughters loved the rice krispies treats pumpkins (which were easy to mold with the enclosed molds and fun to decorate, too) and can't wait to make some to share with their friends."
5.0	Okay. Got this this product and was a bit afraid to try because of all the bad reviews but those people never tried a green juice or smoothie or ate a veggie in their life. Just follow how it says to make it you'll be fine. It actually taste good to me but I add banana, pineapple, strawberry and grapes or blueberry whatever I have. If you don't like grittyness don't add an apple. I'm in love. This product is perfect.
5.0	What can I say, I'm an instant coffee person...and who can complain about Folgers?  Although I've had tastier brands, this one is good...and at this price, nearly half the cost in the local grocery store.
5.0	Best protein bar I ever had - little expensive!
5.0	YumEarth Naturals has an excellent product.<br /><br />I wish more companies would do gummy bears with artificial colors and sweeteners.<br /><br />Just amazing
5.0	use daily  good price for the amount.
5.0	I wanted to write this review to voice how much I love this mayonnaise.  Being organic and GMO free just adds to the overall goodness.  It will hold its own to any mayonnaise on the market.  Amazon's price is a lot higher than what I have found it for locally.  Note, the jar it comes in is smaller than your normal size glass jar by about half.<br /><br />The mayonnaise is creamy, light colored, and has a pleasant taste with no funny after taste.  I love using it for sandwiches, salads, and my all time favorite is BLTs.
5.0	I like this bag since everything is good --- not filler candy.  I like to buy candy mixes that, if there are leftovers, I can eat myself.
5.0	I'm sure sucralose will be the next sweetener to be declared evil, but for now I'm thrilled that we found one that doesn't contain aspartame.  It doesn't taste much like the big names you find on the grocery store shelves, but the flavor is very good, and we like it almost more than the big names.
5.0	Love Love Love the Diet Snapple teas. Green teas are usually delicate but you can actually taste the tea leaf in Snapple.  It is perfectly sweetened and is my new favorite Diet Snapple Tea.  These packets are so convenient.  I appreciate not having to lug those darn 64 oz bottles home.  Be careful of the caffeine!
5.0	We bought this product online because they quit selling it at the stores where we used to buy it. I was told that it was discontinued.
5.0	Works just like it says it would.  Definitely enabled me to use way less sugar! I would definitely use again!
5.0	Some of the best coffee you can get!
5.0	Tasty with a slight citrus taste.
5.0	This is a great snack when you are working all day out in the field and haven't eaten.  It takes the edge off and is nonfat, non-cholestrol and refreshing.  The flavor is that same great grape Welch's grape juice flavor. I keep them in my camera bag and in the car.  Wish you could buy them in the store in just the grape flavor.  Don't care for the mixed fruit variety pak.
5.0	Great value, great taste.  I keep the opened bag stored in the fridge and a jarful in the pantry to grab easily for a snack.
5.0	I received this pasta free from Barilla and Bzzagent. My family loved the pasta and it has became a staple in our home. It is very similiar to a homemade pasta but much more convenient! Highly recommend that you try that prodcut at least once
5.0	Amazing! Started drinking at 27 weeks and I believe that this tea really helped me get my natural VBaC (vaginal birth after cesarean)<br /><br />active labor to when my second was born on this tea was 3.5 hours. Only needed 3 pushes and she was here.
5.0	Our son made short work of these when he was drinking formula. They are great for road trips when you don't want to make a mess with powder.
5.0	Really, it's the closest to regular pasta you can find. We have this auto ship on Subscribe and Save because it's our favorite.
5.0	We love making sausage balls, and were so happy to find this GF Bisquick so we can keep the recipe the same while just eliminating the gluten. We can't tell a difference, and we have started using this to make a GF pot pie as well.
5.0	I am a loyal fan of peanuts. Once I found the price of planters peanuts on Amazon, I knew that I would no longer purchase from anywhere else. If you participate in subscribe & save, you even get the shipping for free!!! 5 stars out of 5
5.0	I don't actually know if this would work out to be more expensive than buying bags of espresso, but it's certainly much, much cleaner. We've tried S*bucks and some other blends, and I think the only thing I miss is a variety. This espresso tastes great, and is so convenient that it feels like a much better solution than buying espresso beans or grounds and having to wipe up the mess after every cup.
5.0	My husband and I just love this delicious green tea with mixed berry flavors! We used to be able to buy it locally, but the stores no longer seem to carry it. So I was thrilled to be able to find it on Amazon.com. Now we buy it by the case here and hope to be able to for a very long time! We just hope that Lipton continues to make it. It's the very best green tea flavor they have!
5.0	I am quite addicted to sour things, and this candy is by far better than warheads. The candy doesn't turn into a razor blade riot in your mouth after sucking off the first layer like warheads do. Very pleased with this product as a sour candy and a hard candy.
5.0	These are my very favorite candy and I cannot find them in my city.  While I hate paying the exhorbitant shipping, I'm just glad to have them.  And it is nice not to hunt down different stores' candy aisles looking for them; they're delivered to my door!  And getting a 12-pack does keep me content for quite awhile--unless my Granddaughter comes; they've become her favorite too!
5.0	My favorite cup of coffee.
5.0	MMM.  Yummmm.  I wish they were cheaper, but candy is going up and up in the stores so this is still a deal, even by Wally World standards.
5.0	I love this tea!  It has a great and it's good cold.
5.0	I was glad to find this item in this size, it's a big save for me because I like to put two in my tea every night.  The favor is exactly as it should be.  I will order this item again.
5.0	This kale is delicious with just the right heat. The individual bag says it contains 2.2 servings so you need to realize that the calories, fat, etc. are based on your being able to stop munching before you eat half a bag. If you like some spice and cheesy taste without actually eating any cholesterol, you should enjoy these chips!
5.0	I've been eating it every morning, I'm on weight watchers and this keeps me full most of the morning. I like the taste and it has plenty of fober.
5.0	Love this product. Never had milk a and white chocolate in a truffle. Had to order it since it was on the kindle sale, only 5 dollars. The flavor is great and the texture is smooth and creamy, just what you would expect from this product. Needless to say, they didn't make it to Easter. Will order this again.
5.0	"I really love these shakes. They taste reasonably good (very good for a protein shake), are healthy and do not have the additives that most other shakes have. If you have lots of allergies or are looking for a \\""clean\\"" protein shake without sugar substitutes, this is a fantastic option. I have bought  these many times. However, there was a problem with this order and Amazon said they would not fix it. I contacted Orgain directly and they responded immediately and fixed it immediately. I am so grateful that now I have found a good tasting protein shake without soy, artificial sugar substitutes, or stevia.I cannot recommend this product and company enough! Like some other reviews said, it tastes best cold and out of a glass, but I also take it on the road with me."
5.0	This product tastes delicious, I loved the different flavors and the snappy tartness. A wonderful product, I would buy again.
5.0	I got these because my daughter likes to snack when she is out and about and she absolutely loves these. They are just right: nutrition and quality wise - these are the best.
5.0	delicious; 110 cal.;great with salads,soups; substitute for rolls etc; using 1 cracker which is stable enough to hold sandwich fillings; no top piece
5.0	Received as advertised plus my favorite flavor.
5.0	My son is in love with this snack!  Came in great condition and did not last long at our house!  Great taste.
5.0	Tastes great!  No extra chemicals or bad after taste.
1.0	I would have loved it if it had come but I am still waiting for it.  When will it be here?
5.0	I make it with the recipe for regular eggs yolk and all its still the best white cake ever, I eat it plain no frosting like a loaf cake!!
5.0	steel cut oats are superior to all other oatmeal. HOWEVER!!!! the same 1lb Tin is only $5.89 at whole foods. Look for them locally!!! not on this site!
5.0	We've been eating this for a long time when every store near us stopped carrying it. Thank you Amazon for making this available again!
1.0	It died after a long struggle.
5.0	Delicious decaf coffee for a coffee taste lover but without the caffeine. I love the packaging, it preserves the full flavor of the coffee. The best value out there!
5.0	Great cereal and for cereal prices not a bad deal because it is the really big boxes of it at 17.5 Oz. Love the little white sweet yogurt pieces that are in it. This is the 3rd time I have ordered this product and I will be ordering more once might 8 boxes runs out...I buy two orders at a time because I really love it and eat alot of cereal...lol
5.0	I can barely justify these at the subscription price, but I wanted to try 'em & am glad I did -- if you're looking to snack less & keep it healthier when you do, give these a go.
1.0	Perhaps the product is a quality product, but it's not worth anything if you can't actually get it.  They show item in stock, charge your card, then cancel the order afterwards.  I found out a week later.  Thanks!
5.0	Considered by many to be a &#34;superfood&#34; whatever that means. This cacao powder has been a great addition to my cupboard of staple items. I use it to flavor my coffee and also in cooking  It has a very smooth taste and hasn't been bitter like some cacaos I have tried. I will be ordering more
5.0	We use this seasoning on chicken all the time. Love it.
5.0	I absolutely LOVE the caramel and vanilla Maxwell House liquids. I mix the two for my own special blended flavor. But $23 is double what you'd pay normally for 3.
5.0	Received in good shape. Thanks Bob
5.0	I really like these, although I don't like whole wheat pasta.  The texture is right and there's no (or very little) veggie flavor to distract from sauces.  Fooducate gives these high marks for pasta, no sodium or saturated fat, etc.  Nice to have the veggie back-up without sacrificing pasta-ness.
5.0	Love this rimming salt the best around
5.0	"Moxie has a powerful yet elusive flavor --- antiseptic dental-packing soaked in Dr. Pepper, perhaps? I tried it years ago on a visit to Boston, and found that with one swallow I'd \\""acquired\\"" its notorious taste. It is delicious despite the fact that I can only describe its flavor using very odd combinations of words. I buy it by the case, and consume mass quantities with gusto and joy."
5.0	"This is a favorite of my husband to have with his morning coffee. The price is great!! 1/3 of what a package cost at your local supercenter. Buying by the case means less trips to the store which is most pleasing to me! Product arrives fresh and these cookies are the best for being \\""soft and chewy\\""."
5.0	Clean flavor, consistent grind, and good heat make this a great product.  Use as spice or dust for great flavor additive.
5.0	love this stuff! ready to eat in an instant, have for breakfast or snack. taste is great, almost a little too sweet for me (I try hard to stay away from sugar). rich dark chocolate flavor. I add my own ground chia too it as well!
5.0	I used to live in St Croix and Miss Anna would go around selling to who she met.  I purchased the 1st bottle in 1970 and after tasting that first bottle I found myself searching the island to find her.  Once while living in Key West I purchased a case but my friends found out about it and the case disappeared.  I was at one time president of the Southern Most Peppers Eaters of America in Key West and feel I qualify for knowledge of hot stuff.  This is by far the best Island style hot sauce made today.  She has the hot (Bird Peppers and others) along with just the right mix of island fruit.  Try it and like me you will most likely end up searching all over for another bottle and we are so lucky to now have it at Amazon.
5.0	I am a certified chocoholic and no longer need to continue my search for a non-sugar alternative, this is the best tasting stuff!  It compares with sugared chocolates and wins with my entire family.  I am so glad that Ross has made such a great no-sugar chocolate, it is definitely a high quality Belgian chocolate!
5.0	"I'm no vegetarian, and am certainly not a \\""granola girl,\\"" yet I find these so amazingly tasty! There's just a moderately salty crunch at first, and then they basically \\""melt in your mouth.\\"" The flavor is exactly like the seaweed wrapped around sushi rolls; no \\""fishy\\"" taste.<br /><br />Like other reviewers, I initially decided to try these because (1) they're crazy-low in calories, and (2) I'd heard about how healthy seaweed is. So glad I did! These - remarkably - satisfy my husband's salty-crunchy cravings, so we don't buy any potato chips/tortilla chips/pretzels/popcorn anymore!<br /><br />I really wanted to dock a star for (1) wanting to eat more than are in each package (aka: the package is too small), and (2) because they're pretty pricey compared to other salty-crunchy snacks. But, I just couldn't do it. They are too darn delicious! I would buy these in bulk at Sam's Club if I could!<br /><br />Side note: I haven't done any research on the health benefits of dried v. fresh seaweed. I suspect that fresh has many more vitamins/nutrients, but that's purely my own speculation. If anyone has any info on this...please comment on my review so I can take a look. Thanks!"
5.0	Worked wonderfully, I used the jamming book from Pomona's and my jam turned out wonderful!
5.0	Purchased for granddaughters 12th birthday and she was very pleased with it.  Plenty to share with her friends and siblings.
5.0	I love this cereal for breakfast.  It is very filling especially if you add a little peanut butter.  I make baked oatmeal using these oats, eggs, egg whites, milk (or almond milk)cinnamon and Splenda and cook in oven or crock pot and it makes great breakfast bar that I can grab and go all week.<br /><br />I like it because it is so healthy - It is whole grains and fiber. And of course gluten free is very important to me since i have Celiac disease.
5.0	Helps my knee pain and my skin is more hydrated.
5.0	I read the product information wrong. My mistake. I thought it said Chocolate Power. The Power of Chocolate is good, especially Dark Chocolate. Gave some to my Dog Chitty-bang-bang and she dropped dead an hour later. Maw took three tablespoons and was constipated for a week. Otherwise it is good stuff.
5.0	Not sure what to say other than this is super high quality real-deal basmati, in a nicely re-sealable bag. I've tried many brands and quality varies widely...from tons of broken grains, to less aromatic/bland basmatis, this one does not disappoint..
5.0	For me Chia seeds are chia seeds, doens't matter who sells them. I like these as they are the cheapest available.
5.0	These were so good and creamy.  I would love to have just the chocolate without the nuts, but still very good.  I can't decide which is better, Milka or Ferrero Rocher...
5.0	I sprout beans and grains in my sprout bag and it is wonderful!  No mold and no fuss.  The bag is a good quality bag that will last a long time.  I am very pleased with it.  Bought 3!
5.0	This cold first pressed olive oil is our family favorite. It is full of flavor, fragrant and worth every penny.
1.0	Very disappointed :( This is advertised as 170g. The wrapping they sent it in even says 170g. The jar & it's label confirm that it is only 100g. I bought 2, so sadly my expected 340g is now a mere 200g. The product itself is awesome,I know that for a fact. So so tasty. but beware of being scammed by this distributor/seller regards the actual size of this jar.
5.0	Great Company to work with. Easy to get in touch with and were willing to work with us. Thanks for taking initiative.
5.0	Buckwheat flour is getting hard to find, and this eliminates shopping around.  The brand is reliable, and it's hard to beat the convenience.
1.0	This stuff is disgusting. The smell that emerges from a freshly opened pouch reminds me of burnt coffee and charred wood. It smells over-roasted and cheap. It tastes even worse. Upon looking at the packaging it turns out it's made in Texas. So much for Douwe-Egbergts. Don't buy - it is not Senseo coffee.
5.0	Best and most natural Jerky available.  Minimal processing and better for you than Beef Jerky.  Can't go wrong on the price either !
5.0	I recently got hooked on these while visitng Sweden. It is so unfortunate how few simple, good choices we have here in the US. At first I thought these were awful but with a little raspberry jam they grew on me. I have IBS-C and I swear these are the reason I was able to stay &#34;regular&#34; while traveling. I'm thrilled to be able to get these at a decent price with free shipping!
5.0	The candy came quickly as ordered and was delicious. They sell this in the base commissary but only around christmas.
5.0	Great product,  Great price!  Would buy again.
5.0	The best decaf coffee out there.  You can't tell its decaf (which is exactly what I wanted to try to cut back!)
5.0	Tried many different ones searching for the best. This came close to my top selection, See's. Liked the dark chocolate.
5.0	I bought this product for my daughter. She loved it. She loves the smell of lavender. Great Christmas gift among other things.
5.0	I can't get this particular flavor at my coop. They carry all the others but not Chocolate mint. They say it's not popular enough, so I say, everyone, drink Chocolate Mint and get hooked on it like me, so I can buy it locally instead of having to order it :)
5.0	We love cheesy popcorn.  This cheese powder is pretty good.  I think we will purchase more in the future.  We have tried two other brands, this one works the best for us.  Yum!
5.0	LOVE, LOVE, LOVE THIS PRODUCT!  I have Colitis and can't have chocolate or mikshakes and drinking the chocolate coconut juice is like getting the best of both. Thank you!!
5.0	I am obsessed. Throw it on everything. It's like a pb flavored protein to add to whatever you want. The chocolate one is amazing!
5.0	Have you ever discovered something that you always want to have on hand. How could all that flavor in such a little piece of hard candy?  I don't know but pop one in your mouth and you have a glass of tea swimming around. Even if you are a diabetic the sugar/carbs a low for 1 or two. Mmmmm good...
5.0	The BEST coconut oil I have ever used! Don't hesitate, buy it. Totally worth the $!
5.0	THis is a very good product, however… it is available at my local TJ Maxx, Home Goods, and Marshall's
5.0	adds a depth of flavor to stews-soups etc be careful if you use too much of this anti inflammatory item you'll get yellow teeth--break out the toothbrush,
5.0	These are a great treat if have rabbits! Both of my bunnies love it when I put some of these in with their other food.
1.0	This stuff is way too sweet. It's basically a muffin mix, not a pancake mix. Pancakes should not be this sweet since you're going to put syrup on them anyways. Also the fake blueberries taste awful. Not all Krusteaz pancake mixes are like this, just this one for some reason. I like the others, they are okay. But this one here is not a pancake mix, it's a muffin mix which will taste like blueberry cupcakes.
5.0	Great deal! Work great! Taste great!
1.0	This item is extremely overpriced. I was not careful in reviewing the quantity offered and was surprised at the cost of one package. Definitely a rip off!
5.0	dose the work easy to use. made pics transfer a breez. i recommend it and worth the money you spend.i bought two gave one to my daughter an she loves it
5.0	"I was very pleasantly surprised to receive this product as a Christmas gift.  The box, pyramid-shaped tea bags, and rigid tea leaf \\""handle\\"" are a very attractive introduction to Tea Forte teas.<br /><br />I've enjoyed every cup I've had so far and am ordering additional varieties.  And I'll _try_ to save these for guests."
5.0	One of the best I've ever had! Delicious and fresh expresso!
5.0	A good friend sent me an email a year ago regarding the health benefits of Green Giant Asparagus Spears (health-full all by itself, and contains no pesticides or preservatives).  Having a number of health challenges, including fibromyalgia, I decided to give the asparagus regimen a try -- and am I ever glad I did!  It has helped in so many ways, and if I happen to forget and miss a day, I can tell right away the next day in the amount and location of increased pain.  I put the whole can in a blender, plus a tablespoon of minced garlic for added flavor, and puree.  With four tablespoons taken twice daily, the benefits are noticeable within a few days. When you sign up for the subscription service with Amazon, this product is delivered to your door for free, and at the best price I've been able to find anywhere.<br />I highly recommend this regimen as a dietary supplement. As I am not a doctor, I have included an excerpt from someone who is:  As a biochemist, I have made an extensive study of all aspects of cancer, and all of the proposed cures. As a result, I am convinced that asparagus fits in better with the latest theories about cancer.  Asparagus contains a good supply of protein called histones, which are believed to be active in controlling cell growth. For that reason, I believe asparagus can be said to contain a substance that I call cell growth normalizer. That accounts for its action on cancer and in acting as a general body tonic. In any event, regardless of theory, asparagus used as we suggest, is a harmless substance.<br /><br />The FDA cannot prevent you from using it and it may do you much good...  It has been reported by the US National Cancer Institute, that asparagus is the highest tested food containing glutathione, which is considered one of the body's most potent anticarcinogens and antioxidants.
5.0	This is so much fun. I took it to the office and played with my co-workers before a team meeting to break the ice. My Niece & Nephew also love tricking their friends with this harmless gag.
1.0	Taste like cheap grape soda...not worth the price you pay for it. Very expensive product for carbonated grape soda...can get the same stuff cheaper elsewhere.
5.0	Excellent liquiorice.  The touch of salt adds to the already great flavor.  Worth buying and eating.  Especially great gift for liquiorice lovers.
5.0	Best Gluten free pasta around.  Only I wish they would make some more different shapes and sizes.
5.0	It tastes good. Not too sure about health benefits. Better off buying local kombucha tea or making your own  for peace of mind.
5.0	Great flavor and one of the longest lasting chewing gums on the market, if not the longest lasting. And one piece has almost as much flavor as two pieces of the other leading xylitol gum.<br /><br />And of course there is no aspartame !!!!
1.0	These are excellent cookies in the retail store at $2.28 for the same size bag.  This is not even thinkable at this price.  This must be limited by Stauffers, but they are just animal crackers, not gold.  I hoped to buy them from Amazon in bulk not available in the stores, but not at this price.  I will have to find other strawberry and blueberry cookies to fall in love with.
5.0	I have bought this coffee in Brazil and was thrilled to find it at Amazon.  It has been my favorite coffee for 5 years.  I hope to be aable tp purchase it in the future.
5.0	Fabulous cardamom flavor!
5.0	I've been searching for a dairy and sugar free creamer without carageenan for a couple of years that I didn't have to make myself!  Finally it is here and it is sooooooo good!  Love this in my tea, it's creamy and not too coconutty... absolutely perfect :)
5.0	They are an excellent buy, fresh and well-packed - as it is a large quantity, we are careful to keep all but one month's supply in our freezer (hot, here) and they are still as fresh as the day we got them.  Many halves, large pieces - good for baking or eating in your cereal.
5.0	You can make just about anything with this product. Even an exact replica of an egg yolk. How cool is that?
5.0	FANTASTIC TASTE! VERY LOW CARBS! TASTES LIKE BBQ SAUCE! NOT VERY SPICY! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
1.0	I am a huge fan of most of the Tasty Bite meals. I'd tried almost all of the Indian flavors and had never been let down. I ordered the Green Curry meal without ever having tried it before based on the good reviews here and my past experiance. Unfortuantly, I found it to be nearly inedible. The rice is clumpy and unpleasant and the spicing was just... wrong. I love Thai Green Curry, and this tasted nothing like it. I still recommend the Indian Tasy Bite Meals, but track a box of this down and sample it before you commit to a pack of 6.
5.0	START WITH A BLENDER LIKE<br />Clean blend 3HP 1800-Watt Commercial Blender .<br />1/2 cup Hemp protein power<br />1/3 cup Hemp seed nut<br />1 Tlbs. Chia seed powder (this will gel if you let it sit)<br />3 Tlbs. Acai<br />1to 3 Tlbs. Lucuma<br />2 Tlbs. Gelatinized Maca<br />2 Tlbs. Dulse flakes<br />1 to 3 tsp. Camu Camu<br />1/3 cup Cacao (strong tasting, you will know if you use too much)<br />1 to 2 cups Frozen Blueberries or cherries, mango.<br />Navitas Coconut Palm Sugar (or YACON to taste)<br />Also I add some goldenseal root.<br />1 tsp. KUDUZU ROOT EXTRACT<br />1/3 CUP KOMBUCHA TEA BLEND<br />1-2 CUPS GOJI BERRIES<br />Start with the blender of Hemp milk or COCONUT MILK. About 1/2 full.. Mix the frozen fruit first; on high, till it makes a &#34;milk&#34;.<br />Then the rest of each item, you want in it, THEN I ADD DARK CHOCOLATE ALMOND MILK.
5.0	Love this product! Been ordering and using for a while. Usually have at least 2 table spoons a day in my tea, or smoothie. This makes my skin soft. I feel a big difference if I stop using it for a while. I'm currently breastfeeding 2 kids, so I'm challenged to keep my skin hydrated. This helped me more than any lotions or other moisturizing oils. Got my mom using this, and her hands, specially fingers by nail bed got so much better, they were very dry for a long time....
5.0	I was very lucky to be able to get a box of this chocolate at a discount to try, share and review.<br /><br />The box arrived and it was like Christmas morning :) The box is bigger than it looks in the photo and is great for gifting.<br /><br />The kids and I each had a few. They were very good. Because of the colors I would love to put these out in a nice glass display piece around the holidays.<br /><br />The texture of the chocolate is very smooth. I like to savor it, and cheap chocolate gets grainy. This is literally melt in your mouth chocolate.
5.0	I've been using stevia from Dollar General (35 packets for $1) for several years now; this had been the only local outlet that carried them. This one in powder form cost less and, for me, is much easier to use. Plus I don't need to dispose of or recycle all those unnecessary empty packs.<br /><br />Having grown up using Sweet 'n Low, I've been used to sugar substitutes for over 50 years. Stevia tastes better, is better for you, & it's all I use these days (except in baking). Tried growing it myself, but with little success from the plants; still, may try again from seed.<br /><br />Can't recall whether I can place this on subscription here or not, but would definitely do so. Now I'll take advantage of the company's free product trial for bulk tumeric which, along w/ cumin, I've been adding to my food with some regularity.
5.0	love this hot sauce, not too hot not mild. my husband agrees and we will be purchasing more ! the company actually sent me a personal email asking my opinion of their product. this makes a world of difference to me as there is no such thing as good customer service with most places.
1.0	First, they were totally liquified when the package arrived.  No &#34;crystals&#34; to be found.  Now its a solid block.  Second, I was surprised by the ingredients - I thought it was some &#34;special&#34; additive to help the candy melts but its just plain old palm kernel oil. I could have just used my coconut oil (and felt better about adding &#34;fat&#34;).  Won't buy again.
5.0	I just finished my first bag and I think I'm addicted!  These are a fantastic high protein, low carb snack.  A third of a cup has 9 g. of protein and only 3 grams of net carbs.  A great treat when you are in the mood for something crunchy and salty. I will def buy again.
5.0	I love this tea! I have the loose leafed tea as well, but the tea bags are handy when you are away from your teapot!
1.0	I remember a Sex and the City episode all about this a few years back, but I don't see what all the fuss is about....
5.0	Great Value for the flavor.
5.0	I've always loved this cereal.  However the price was so much better here at Amazon, and the package arrived faster than I expected.  I still have some left but I will be re-stocking my shelf from here!!!!
5.0	This Thai Tea is very close to the Thai tea you'd find in restaurants.  I make 2 packages at a time in a large glass.  I fill the glass with water from my Keurig, mix until dissolved and then fill the glass with ice.  If you want to drink instantly, just make sure you use a glass large enough to add a lot of ice to make it cold.  It is thick, smooth and delicious.
5.0	THESE WERE GIVEN AS CHRISTMAS PRESENT TO MY SON-IN-LAW HE LOVED THEM. MAY BUY THEM AGAIN WHEN NEEDED FOR A MEN WHO NEEDS NOTHING.
5.0	Very yummy. I will buy this again. This is my new favorite coffee.
5.0	I have tried other Bob's Red Mill products.  Gluten free cakes and baking mix, they are all great.<br />I would recommend them to anyone especially  people that must be gluten free..
1.0	I was so disappointed once I opened the lid. The safety seal was cut from 2 sides and the Nutella spread had leaked out over the seal. I didn't bother returning as the shipping would have been a good portion of the refund value.
5.0	I was expecting this product to be pre-sliced with plastic inserts so was a little disappointed to learn that it comes in one block. Let me tell you, eating three pounds of cheddar in one sitting is no easy task but having got through two packets of Jacobs, deep fried a slab and grated the remainder over a plate of grits or two, i can confirm that this is indeed, quite cheesey.
5.0	The only lemon jam Ive had and I sure began with the best. Good quality.
5.0	Always a favorite in my snack drawer.  Fresh and stay fresh for a month or two when I place them in upright tins.
5.0	Some of the Amazon tagges for this product are incorrect.  I was looking for cat food, and unilt I zoomed in on the front lable to see that it was a dog.  I have seen IAMS cat food listed as dog food and dog food listed as cat food.  Double check the pictures on the lables before ordering, or you might end up with a unhappy pet.
5.0	My favorite tea. I discovered it five years ago in Pikes Market, Seattle. When the supply I bought there ran out, I was able to order more on Amazon.com. I've been ordering it every since. Great tea!
1.0	Although the product taste good and my son liked it, this is how much product it comes with! It's missing half of the container! I was so disappointed I paid $23 for this!!!!!!!! Won't be purchasing again
5.0	These pies were Fresh and excellent without the overpowering sweetness that is so common with the Hostess brands. Not only that but these 6 cherry pies were 200 calories less and 100 mg sodium less than their Hostess counterparts. Initially I had a minor problem with my shipment - BUT these good people went out of their way to insure that I received what I had ordered and that the product was in my hands within an expeditious manner..
5.0	Seep it til it's a nice deep, clear orange color. Very smooth. Remember it only takes a teaspoon.  I'd definitely order this again.
5.0	Of the snacks that I gravitate towards, this is one of my favorites. I'm a fan of Kettle corn, so this is an obvious choice. Light, crispy and just the right amount of salty and sweet.
5.0	My hubby is so thoughtful. I am a tea drinker, and can't have caffeine. I was pleased with the nice mix in this set. We already have other teavana teas as well. Unlike another reviewer I like the fruity herbal teas  - as they are usually caffeine free.<br />Love the tea pot/ its very easy to clean! I used to go to this old herbal shop in my old town..  :( where  I live now there isn't a store except Teavana that has loose tea.
5.0	I've been reading The Economist for the last 10 years or so, and during that time the magazine has earned my utmost respect in every sense. I just wish I had heeded their advice concerning the stock market bubble back in the late 90s.
5.0	"I am rather picky about my baking products and was hesitant to use this product but it has turned out to be perfect for baking.<br />The \\""flakes\\"" in this product are larger than most products and hold together when mixed into batter or with other ingredients (as in cooked oatmeal or other hot cereals).<br /><br />The flavor is excellent and having an UNSWEETENED product that tastes the way freshly processed coconut tastes is a great advantage.<br /><br />If you have a recipe that requires softer coconut - as in non-cooked puddings, you can retain the shape and texture by STEAMING the coconut for about 5 minutes before folding into the prepared pudding or a meringue."
5.0	Do you know how hard it is to find soup that doesn't have sugar in it? Really, really hard.  I do not eat sugar and discovering Amy's soups (well, most of them) has been such a gift.  Despite their very healthy ingredients, they are all delicious and they make dinner or lunch on a busy day so much easier.  We order them on subscribe and save and they come out to a very affordable amount per can.  Not bad for an entire lunch! (P.S. I throw them in my Stanley thermos after heating them up in the morning and they are still hot by lunch time...)
1.0	The cashews I received were dark and smelled stale. When I tasted the nuts, they were actually rancid. I have purchased cashews through Amazon before & received light-colored, mild-flavored cashews. The ones I received from Sincerely Nuts were unusable.
5.0	Made this the other day, so good! and so much fun!
5.0	Love illy coffee. The fine grain grounds, packaging, and taste are all quality. The delivery time was great *prime* and getting a two-for-one helps a ton. Tip: keep it in the freezer for longer lasting flavor. I was stuck in my condo for a solid week due to snow, Illy kept me going...
5.0	This pineapple is really delicious, sugar-free except for the natural sugar, chewy and a bit hit at my house. Amen (I needed one more word.)
5.0	I've served Canadian Finest maple syrup to friends and family over the course of several weeks and everyone has given it a thumbs up, including my husband.  That's saying something, because he usually prefers the fake stuff.<br /><br />I admit, I expected a lighter flavor from this.  Instead, it's very sweet.  I had to look to see if it was pure maple syrup.  Yes, it is.  No wonder my husband likes it.  Sweet tastes good.<br /><br />This product was provided for review by Canadian Finest.
5.0	This is not your typical soft ladyfingers. It's the hard cookie version which cook nicely when you make tiramisu dessert. I enjoyed using this product tremendously and my tiramisu came out perfectly. Thank you for a great product!
5.0	Bought these for my son. He loves them!!!!!
5.0	"Insanely delicious.  I had never tried hot oat bran cereal before and wasn't sure I would like it.  The cooking instructions (2 c. water, 2/3 dry cereal) are for two generous servings.  I did not realize this but happily consumed a bowl and a half, sweetened with 1 Tbs. organic Rice Syrup.  Ahh, bliss and good for you too.  Only takes two minutes to prepare.  This is my kind of \\""comfort\\"" food and hit the spot with all its natural flavor.  No way will I ever buy junk they call cereal in regular stores.  Super fast free delivery!  Thanks Amazon."
5.0	The price per product is great and my family loves it. We have been gluten free for over a year and it took me at least six months to find a cost affective way to get this product. Thank You
5.0	I have purchased this product many times.  It adds the flavor of long simmered goodness.
5.0	I purchased these apples to take on a backpacking trip with my Boy Scout troop, and they were perfect! They're soft and chewy, with just the right amount of apple flavor and sweetness. Most of them went into a pot of steel-cut oats for breakfast, but some of them got snatched for eating before breakfast was ready. The boys all gave these a hearty thumbs-up! Next time, we'll definitely get more of these.
5.0	We love these orange drops/candies. the flavor is great and they are hard to find in just the orange flavor, which is our favorite.
5.0	I'm not an expert on the quality of turmeric, but this works fine for my needs. I use it to make turmeric chai tea & for facials. If you use it for a facial pay attention to how long you leave it on, it leaves a goldish tint. You can mix it with honey, yogurt or plain water. For the tea I use the turmeric, cardamom pods, fennel seeds & a cinnamon stick. Boiled on low and mixed with milk and sugar. It makes for a great holiday treat!<br /><br />I received this product in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.and all thoughts reflected in this review are solely my own.
1.0	Yes I was disappointed since this product comes from Spain. Octopus I buy in a can because I always overcook it when I prepare it.99% of the time canned Octopus is not overcooked and chewy. This product was chewy and would not recommend it.
5.0	I absolutely LOVE Salad Pizazz!  We spend 5 months in AZ each year and I first found it there. When we returned back to the northeast, I tried and couldn't find it anywhere.  I finally resorted to ordering a case through Amazon.com.  This is the perfect product to dress up any salad - I have to stop myself from not eating a whole bag as a snack.
1.0	Does not work in keurig 2.0 even though it says so in the description!! Very disappointed!!! Had to return.
5.0	love them, wish they were still making them !!!!!!!!!!!!
5.0	This product is great.  Thank you for carrying it.
5.0	"these \\""plain\\"" croutons are actually made of high quality light rye bread, caraway seeds and all. i like just snacking on them!"
5.0	Great price and no sugar.  What else do you want?  The kids drink it.
5.0	Supermarket brands can't touch this.  The taste is amazing. This is the first peppercorn I tried after receiving a pepper mill as a gift and I will be buying more when it is gone.  It is much stronger than ground pepper so you don't have to use as much.
5.0	By themselves the noodles are pretty good, but add some beef and you have a quick, tasty meal. I like to add a spoonful of sour cream for even more flavor.
5.0	This makes really delicious pancakes! There is no grittiness like some mixes we've tried. The pancakes are light and tasty. I will mix up a box at a time and make waffles in my no stick waffle maker and freeze them. Pop them in the toaster on school mornings and they are just as good as fresh.  I found this with the regular pancake mix at Wegman's which equals great pricing because it was not over in the `Gluten Free' isle. Try slicing bananas into the batter or adding a little cinnamon or nutmeg to give it a twist! Yummy!!!
5.0	I use it to thicken my goats milk yogurt.  Works well and the organic factor makes me feel better about adding to my homegrown milk.
5.0	100% pleased with product,value and service !
5.0	Love quinoa and this brand was no exception. Great, healthy alternative to using rice.
5.0	My family just LOVES this and the parm. rosemary popcorn from Quinn.  They pop up well and do not contain all the nasty chemicals of most brands.  The way we like it is to substitute butter for the included oil, but that is persoanl preference.  Either way, this is a really good popcorn!<br /><br />If I had one criticism it would be that there are only 2 bags per box.  For a company that tries so hard to provide a healthy, environmentally friendly alternative, I would think they could come up with more efficient packaging.<br /><br />But that doesn't change the fact that this is a really great tasting product.
5.0	Omg, please keep the reviews coming! I haven't laughed so hard on such a long time!<br />Think I shat myself in laughter, who needs to buy these things...<br />Although... Did have an argument with the wife that she won... Hmmmm<br />(Evil laughter echoes darkly through the hallway)
1.0	$5.11 for 1 can really?!?!?! It said .11 per oz so I thought 3 cans but them it showed up and 1 wow
5.0	I really like this risotto rice, and use it in my rice cooker as well as for real simmerered risotto.  Since I had moths in some of my whole grains last year (Bob's Red Mill, which I love but now freeze first), I especially appreciated the fact that the containers are moth-proof and re-usable.
5.0	I wanted to find and get this product for my mother's memorial of her life celebration as it was one of her favorite foods and I wanted to share many of her favorite foods at this celebration.  It met and exceeded my expectations.
1.0	This product, regardless of positive sentences on the box is essentially:<br />inexpensive water, sugar and salt in excess flavoured with carrots, and few other organic foods prominently displayed on the box.  And yes, the product is inexpensive but hardly nutritious food. The taste is incredibly sweet (mostly from the sugar) and salty (read the label) which is hidden by the sugar and starch.  I will not bother next time.  Pacific can make some good products but this one is not one of them.
5.0	This is one of the best seasonings out there.  It is consistently outstanding on whatever meat I'm preparing either for lunch or dinner.
1.0	I ordered these flowers for my mother's birthday. Unfortunately, they arrived late and dead. Very disappointed!!
5.0	I bought these for my 20th birthday party as a type of theme, and it was incredible!! I was nervous about them working since I'd never tried them before, but trust me. They work!! We were eating so many bizarre things, it is DEFINITELY an experience my friends and I will never forget. (Greek yogurt on a Ritz cracker turns into cheesecake. ;) )
5.0	Try putting a few drops in your favorite beer.
5.0	This was my first experience with amazon and it was excellent. The  hard to find elderberry preserves was shipped quickly and extremely well packed and arrived in perfect condition. The product itself was also excellent and would make a nice gift presentation.
5.0	I will be using this product for meals on the road.  This rice is a good side dish with many types of food, not just Indian food.
1.0	Had stones in the package and Jura machine got damaged!
5.0	The product is great however it was sent to us without ice to protect it from melting so no I would never order it again this way.
5.0	Great but took a while to receive
5.0	Bought to prevent browning when I dehydrate fruit -- works beautifully
5.0	Tastes great. Keeps me awake for hours. I don't notice any crash.
5.0	I have purchased this rice three times already. Yes, we love rice in our family. We are picky about what we eat. Lundberg has been very consistent. I was reluctant at first but it arrived in great condition. When I opened the bag, it smells fresh. Sometimes even in stores you get a bag of brown rice that has some musty smell. But that has never happened with Lundberg. So it passes the freshness test.<br /><br />The rice appearance is very pleasant. They are uniform and clean. I have not seen any impurities in the rice. It is very easy to wash. A couple of rounds of rinse is all it needs.<br /><br />We cook it in our zojirushi rice cooker on Brown Rice setting. It comes out perfect. It is fluffy and tastes great. I meshed some up for my 8 month old a couple days ago so it was a bit more sticky and he loved it too. So, it certainly passed the taste test.<br /><br />It is organic which is important because rice is one of the most polluted crops. Organic is the way to buy rice. Healthy, check!<br /><br />Price is great on Amazon. It is cheaper than the bulk organic rice At Wholefoods. In fact, I saw them refilling the bin in the store one time and they were pouring from a bag of Lundberg! So this rice is of great value.<br /><br />For all those reasons, we have this on auto ship. If you love good rice, you will love this product.
5.0	Starbucks French Roast Beans are my favorite & these were well priced & delicious. Love the availability to order from Amazon.
5.0	Great taste-you wouldn't know that it's gluten free unless someone told you! So easy he can make them himself-which is a bonus!
5.0	I searched all over the internet with prices from this to 5 gallons pails.  This was the best price/oz.  I will defintely be ordering again.  Agave nectar has a clean taste like corn syrup.  Unlike corn syrup, agave nectar is good for you.  Its good for cooking (makes solids moister), good for drinks.  Goes easily into liquids even if cold. Makes a great fake 7 up with lemon and lime juice, sprakling water and agave nectar.
5.0	I love 8 O'clock coffee. I usually order the whole bean coffee. I mistakenly ordered this. Since it is 4 small bags I have taken one to each daughters house so it is there when I visit and took 1 to work and still have 1 at home. I have since ordered a larger bag of the whole bean but this came in handy.
5.0	The natural powder smells very well, my baby love it.<br />I am wonder that 4 scoops of powder to 6 fluid ounces of water. can anyone help me that 6 ounces equal to 6*29.57=177milliliters?<br />it means that i will put 4 scoops of powder into 180ml of water?  i was told by my friend 1 scoop of powder to 60ml of water.
5.0	This flavor was originally available everywhere but no longer.  I can not find it at any store (grocery, drug, etc) within a 30 minute driving distance. So, I now order them via Amazon.  I don't like candy but this specific life saver is just too good.
5.0	Great price and great flavor.  Have been getting it for quite a while now, and will continue to order it.
5.0	Finally I found a true vanilla for baking. It's a great find.
5.0	I've always like the Simply Organic brand and been pleased with the spices, and this one is no exception. Plus, it is so much less expensive than the local grocery store! Thumbs up!
5.0	I was introduced to Rooibos Tea by a South African ex-pat.  I love it, but it can be hard to find where I live.  Davidson's brand smells and tastes like it should and is a good value.
5.0	priced beautifully and delivered very quickly to my front door so nor transporting it through NYC is necessary  The Coconut Pineapple flavor is not readily available in retail stores.
5.0	I was buying a quart of Buttermilk every other week and if I did not use it I would have to dump it!  The last purchase of Saco Buttermilk I bought will last on the shelf until 2016!  After opened, store it in the fridge and you have plenty of time to make buttermilk.
5.0	I love this tea. In these tiny containers, just add to water and it's delicious. Easy to carry around anywhere you go ... tasty and calorie free.
5.0	This has become my favorite jerky. Pieces are tender and flavorful from good cuts of meat (i.e., one some other &#34;gourmet&#34; jerky I've found tough, sinewy pieces). Knowing that taste is by definition a matter of preference, I enjoy the flavor of this brand (peppered). It's somewhat spicy but not overly, just a hint of sweetness, and great texture. Individual piece size ranges from coin-sized to larger.
5.0	The almond flour  weight was accurate. I reweighed the bulk amount into one oound freezer bags for the freezer. Fast shipping, It's nice to get a product at such a good price so easily that will last for many weeks of baking. Thanks.<br />Marianne Donald
1.0	There's exactly the same deal as this product from Walmart ([...]) but way cheaper, almost half the price. This product is $14.31 per 43.6oz (.33c per oz) while the Walmart Deal ([...]) is $7.76 per 43.6oz  (.18c per oz).<br /><br />Other things not true about this product but included in the picture<br />- There is no cherryberry swirls like it says on the picture<br />- There is no Toucan Sam mini Bean like it says on the picture<br />- There is no Funhouse like it says on the picture<br /><br />Of course Froot Loops is GREAT! No questions, We love it my family loves it. But will have to get the Walmart Deal ([...]) moving forwards.
5.0	I love the full bodied flavor of this coffee.  Dark and rich with no caffeine.  There is nothing like this at my local grocery store and you can't beat the price.
5.0	We always loved sesame sticks that were in other snack mixes, but when we made the switch to natural, organic, and healthy foods, I was so pleased to find Sunridge Farms. I took a chance and ordered a case - YUM! We loved them right out of the bag, crispy fresh and delicious, and it felt good knowing that there are no nasty ingredients like partially hydrogenated oil or MSG, these are tasty and healthy too! I made an amazing trail mix that I served at a recent party: deluxe mixed nuts, dried tropical fruit (pineapple, mango, papaya, and coconut), and these sesame sticks - it looked inviting and tasted amazing! These will be a permanent fixture in our pantry. We highly recommend!
5.0	Packet received on time with boxes neatly packed in.<br />Personally, I find the flakes in it bigger & better than the ones I got at costco.
1.0	This is nothing comparable to matcha powder.  Its coarse and grainy and mist of it settles to the bottom. I hope Amazon does something about this false advertising
5.0	I love this protein powder. It is tasteless and I add it to puddings, yogurt, smoothies even fruit juice when I need a protein boost. I use it along with Benefiber most of the time.
5.0	This is THE BEST cinnamon. It's stronger than regularly cinnamon, but the flavor is just wonderful.
5.0	"I love this bar. It is so hard to find a good protein bar that doesn't have any \\""bad\\""stuff in it.  And I think it tastes great.  My stomach is ver finicky, and it felt great after eating this bar!<br /><br />Update: the last order I received was stale.  The bars taste awful and not the way they usually do.  I canceled my monthly subscription and will buy them locally in the future."
1.0	I know why they have zero calories/carbs etc... Its because this is not food. It tastes like nothing and the texture is utterly revolting. If you are someone who is sensitive to textures of foods (mushrooms, for example) stay away. And if you aren't someone who is sensitive to textures of foods, you will be after you try these.
5.0	This product is so delicious!
5.0	I recently moved to Texas and searched in vain for Skippy Roasted Honey Nut Super Chunk peanut butter. I found it impossible to believe that, by the unfortunate circumstance of geography, I would not get to enjoy what could be the best peanut butter ever made again.<br /><br />But then, like a flash of inspiration, I checked Amazon and LO AND BEHOLD, one can purchase it by the case! Mirable Dictu!!! What's even better, one can set up delivery so it's delivered at a set schedule. My wife thinks I'm weird for ordering peanut butter online; I told her at least I'm not ordering [[ASIN:B00032G1S0 Tuscan Whole Milk, 1 Gallon, 128 fl oz]]!<br /><br />To be honest, ordering food from Amazon does make me feel a little bit like a hermit... but then when I make myself a sandwich with this peanut butter of the gods, it's SOOOO worth it! It's a good thing that the grocery stores down here don't carry it, other wise they'd never be able to sell the other peanut butter brands!
5.0	These were extremely fresh and exactly the right flavors. Since with these types of purchases who you buy them from is as important as the product I will mention that I got them from Casey Anns and that the service was prompt and the candy fresh.
5.0	These are the best flavor of the Fiber One 90 Cal bars! BY FAR!! Very lemony. Kinda small tho but what do you expect for only 90 Cal! Totally worth it!
5.0	One full teaspoon works best for me. Love this product.
5.0	I made this product last Christmas.  Everyone loves it.  I served it with vanilla icecream.  Everyone will love this Chocolate Raspberry Lava Cake.
5.0	Cheap Delicious and a Great KCup alternative. If you haven't tried SFB Coffee you should. At .37 cents a cup you can not go wrong.<br />Sick of paying so much for your K-Cups then this is a great alternative at almost half the price.
5.0	I was pleased to find Ideal on Amazon after searching all of the local grocery stores once my favorite store quit carrying the products.  Ideal does not leave a bitter taste in the mouth like some other plant-based sweetener.  It dissolves well too!  I like to buy the box of packets to carry with me.
5.0	I give these to my dog for treats and she loves them. Also going to give to my &#34;grand-dogs&#34; for Christmas. Great gift idea, and seller provided quickly.
5.0	This oatmeal is so delicious, and the texture is awesome.  The downside:  once you try this you'll never want that 'instant' oatmeal garbage ever again!  I have a small slowcooker:  I like to put in 1 cup of the oats and 4 cups of water, and then I put it on low to cook overnight. It's ready for me when I get up in the morning, and I have extra for later! For flavorings, I like to add a little salt, butter, cinnamon and sugar.      What amazes me most is that it keeps me satisfied for so long.  With other oatmeals, I'd be hungry again within a couple of hours, or worse: still hungry when I finsh the bowl.  When I eat a bowl of this oatmeal, I'm good until lunch time, easily.      And it's perfect winter comfort food!!
5.0	If you ever had the desire to bake a pie that looks &#34;professional&#34; ... this is all you need. Makes that goopy middle like the pies you buy from a restaurant, or may remember from back when. Easy too.
5.0	Drinking it right now! Does the trick and delivered right to my door at a great price thank you!
5.0	These are seriously the best jelly beans available.  Every single jelly bean is a delicious flavor without the chalky taste of real sweet tarts.  I'm just glad my birthday is in the spring so I can still get these for reasonable prices since these are an Easter thing.  If you are tired of the starburst, jelly belly, or jolly rancher jelly bean mixes where there always seems to be at least one flavor you can't stand, pick up a package of these.  You won't be disappointed
1.0	I can't believe this was made and packaged for human consumption. I am still reeling from my attempt at eating it- spare yourself.  <br />Open the package and breath in the heady scent of... ammonia. But wait, they warn you of the authentic scent of Shirataki, and recommend that you parbroil the noodles to reduce the stench, excuse me, aroma. <br />Once cooked you can enjoy pseudonoodles with the scent and consistancy of overcooked squid. Mmmm, so difficult to chew. <br />Described as the perfect diet food for good reason. You won't be able to finish more than two forkfulls.
5.0	If you know and are used to what  a guayaba is, you will adore this chocolate, it is just sublime!!!!
5.0	Healthy Cheerios knock-off.  My little ones love them dry and graze from them all day long.
1.0	I received my order today and opened it ready to enjoy it, but not happening. The fudge was rock hard and it tasted like crap.I don't know if it is the way the fudge was made or if it just old.. Save your money and just go to a candy store and pick up real fudge there.
5.0	I've used many fondants and fondant recipes over the years for decorating cakes and this is hands down the best I've had.  It tastes great like a homemade batch, but you don't have to go through the mess of making fondant.  Plus the black is so pure and looks better than anything I could make on my own. It's also really easy to work with, even for the beginners who were helping me decorate. I highly recommend this product!
5.0	These taste wonderful.  I have never been able to eat the &#34;regular&#34; cupcakes so I do not have anything to compare these to.  To me, the taste is wonderful.  The cupcake is moist and the cream filling is wonderful.  My husband tasted them and said, &#34;These tasted like the real thing.&#34;  They are low in carbs which is a plus!
1.0	I was dissapointed because when I received the product there was mold on the muffins.<br />I tossed them right away !
5.0	"As the name itself says \\""Earth's Best\\"" it is best. My baby accepted it and she is enjoying. when baby is happy ...mom is happy"
5.0	SO GOOD AND TASTE JUST LIKE THE ORGINAL
5.0	Use it on steaks and ribs or even on salmon, anything you BBQ will taste great with this rub. Fantastic!
5.0	Been buying this tea in bulk for years now and am very satisfied. Tea stays fresh in sealed bags nearly forever and you can't beat the price!
5.0	I just love it, and I am Not a major Indian cooking fan--just enough. Really, it mixes with anything you are doing like [[ASIN:B000FIXT2I Steamed Brown Rice Bowl, Organic, Microwaveable, 7.4-Ounce Bowls (Pack of 12)]] (I use these for convenience, and then I don't eat the whole pot of rice). In many kinds of soups, etc. Beef it up with some [[ASIN:B001FA1KLW Amore Tomato Paste, 4.5-Ounce Tubes (Pack of 12)]], which is so, so convenient. Sweeten to taste if you prefer. Here's the best artificial sweetener on Amazon [[ASIN:B0019LTH3U NuNaturals Nustevia Alcohol Free Stevia Glass Bottle Liquid, 2-Ounce]]. (Stop using Splenda which contains three Chlorine moities. It's essentially bleach, folks.) Enjoy, lentils are so healthy, and this way they really have flavor!<br />FYI: This costs $3-5/PER PACK at our local stores when you can find it. It is Not overpriced, as someone here said.
5.0	This is the best tasting coffee! My dad loves it and I always buy it from here!! It has a nice smooth taste!
5.0	Great coffee at a great price. Wish I could order more at that price.
5.0	Bought and sent these to my husband while he was deployed. The men LOVED it! I actually bought it two times after this because they loved it so much. They said the flavors were really good and it survived the trip to the middle east. So sturdy and delicious.
5.0	This is a LOT of Jolly Ranchers.  This would be perfect for a teacher needing a little snack-type prize to give his/her students.  In fact, after I bought these and hadn't gone through them for several months, that's exactly what I did.
5.0	Watkins is the only black pepper our family eats.  Awesome!
5.0	"I first tried Chantal's strawberry jam at her restaurant and had to bring some home for my husband.  He is the strawberry jam expert.  He has tried every one out there.  His exact words were, \\""this is the best strawberry jam I have ever tasted'.  I alway have 2 jars in my house because he eats it every night as a snack on toast, Ice cream or tortilla's.  If I didn't have it he would be very upset.<br /><br />I suggest everyone try it and they will never go back to thier favorite because this will be it!!!"
5.0	These are exactly how  I remember them from buying some at the Scottish Highland Games. the sweet lollipop and the sour powder make for a unique and delicious candy. will likely buy again
5.0	This was a gift for my son.  At Christmas I always give him an array of Beef jerky and this year the array I purchased on here was somewhat different, buffalo, alligator, elk, etc. many unusual types.  He was very pleased with this gift and I would certainly suggest it for gift giving.
5.0	My friend tried to convince me to eat chia seeds for a long time. I was hesitant because it sounded like a bird diet. I finally decided to give it a shot, and now I am eating it everyday. I can feel the health benefit after a month or so. It gives good energy. When I wake up late for work, i ll just skip breakfast and drink a bowl of chia seeds with juice
5.0	I love this trail mix! Just the right mix of chocolate, nuts and raisins. The packs are very convenient and make it easy to take along in my purse or lunch bag.  They provide a great pick-me-up in the afternoon. Best of all, the individual serving packs do a great job of keeping the mix fresh and tasty.<br /><br />It seems often with the larger bags of trail mix the raisins dry out and turn hard or the nuts just don't taste right after a few days of the package being opened.  No problems with that here since the generous portions are measured out and individually wrapped.  I think this gives you a very good value trail mix and I am very happy now to see that I can order it through the subscription program and save even more money!  Thanks Amazon and Planters!
5.0	These little portable mini dispensers are just great, very convenient, some restaurants do not offer Splenda this is the perfect option to carry with me at all times, any where.
5.0	Good goods delivered good.
5.0	These are absolutely delicious.  They are super crunchy and good for you.  A great healthy snack.
5.0	"I have tried about a dozen types of k-cup coffees, and so far, this one is my favorite.  I normally don't like \\""bold\\"", much less \\""extra bold\\"" because that usually means it's a little bitter to me, but this isn't bitter at all!  The cinnamon flavor is strong enough without getting too spicy.  You know you're drinking CINNAMON coffee.  There are a few other flavors out there that are hard to distinguish, but not this one.<br /><br />My Keurig machine is for 1-cup, so I frequently get 2 uses out of one of these k-cups.  The second cup is just as good as the first.<br /><br />Highly recommended."
5.0	fast shipping and the nuts were very tasty
5.0	LOVE this product but bought too much! These bags are huge!
5.0	Unsweetened, dark chocolate is good for you. This product was recommended to me by my son.  It goes very well with other items on my morning oatmeal.
5.0	Great price and soooo delicious!!!!!
5.0	My favorite oatmeal!  Easy to fix and delicious!  Cooks quickly but is more similar to slow cooked steel cut oats.  Learned about this product at Costco and was thrilled to find on Amazon for those times Costco does not carry!
5.0	Nice size, great taste. Fast shipping
5.0	The drink tastes really refreshing for a canned sparkling water. The flavor is relatively strong but not overpowering so. It is a bit sour but not as overwhelming as the lemon counterpart. The cans are also protected with an extra bit of plastic at the top part to keep it clean when you start drinking. Nice to know Amazon carries these in case Costco runs out.
5.0	Works very well, cheaper than other electronic parts suppliers' products.
5.0	This is a very good bidet. I have the Mercola Bidet, but this one is much better. The water force is strong, and it works very well.
5.0	the scale works in perfectly conditions, i just bought good product at good price delivered in good in good condition.<br />thank you very much.
5.0	This was my first &#34;staining&#34; effort.  I found the Java Gel easy to use and after three  layers my bathroom vanity was beautiful!
5.0	These are the most handy things you can own in your home.<br />What else can I say.  They are perfect and the price is awesome!!<br />MUST HAVE to dim those annoying lights that are just too right.<br />Perfect for the bedside lamp so you don't even have to roll and reach up and turn on the light.<br />Just slide the easy switch without hardly moving!<br />LOVE THEM!!
5.0	buy this product now. dont wait. this charges my smart phones and tablets super fast. i love this no more transformers sticking out of outlets all over the house. i bougt 4 of them and placed them were we were chargeing all of our electronics. so much nicer then before, and we can control the cords and clutter 100% better. Thank You Levinton.
5.0	they work real nice thanks.
5.0	great for the price. Yes it is plastic louvers below - but top is metal and for this price...<br /><br />Not sure it if rattles or not as still is summer.
5.0	AF Lighting 671508 12-Inch W by 5-Inch H Decorative Wall Sconce, White, projects 6-Inch<br />This is made out of a heavy material and light does not show through it. That is what I was looking for so I am happy with it.
5.0	This circuit board is an exact replacement for one that failed.  Easy to install.  Just  plugged in the terminals and it worked.
5.0	We finally upgraded our old-fashioned, obviously energy inefficient thermostat with this model. We are extremely satisfied with the performance and ease of use. Highly recommended!
5.0	The only way to turn on the light inside my garage is from inside my house. Coming home at night meant I had to walk through a dark garage and fumble with my keys to unlock the house door. No more with this gem! It's also handy leaving early in the morning before sunrise.
1.0	Super dim and horrible colors.  Don't bother with this.
5.0	I received package promptly... Very secure packaging.  Product in great condition.. fit perfectly.. EASY to install! You don't even need a wrench as recommended on package! Matches my new decor perfectly! You can tell it's high quality!
5.0	I have a mini fridge on a wheeled cart that I wanted to stay put. These were just what I was looking for.  Now the fridge can be opened without the whole cart from moving forward. The chocolate color blends fairly well into the dark wood floor so you don't even notice the cups.
5.0	Give my perfect soft glow
5.0	And participate in a forum dedicated to flashlights. Yep, there is such thing. Lol. Excellent, small, super bright light with wonderful control to step up and down the lights power.
5.0	I GOT THIS TWO YEARS AGO, AND IT IS ABSOLUTELY SO PEACEFUL AND SOOTHING.  IT GIVES A FEELING OF INSTANT PEACE, AND I LOVE IT VERY MUCH.  I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS IN THE STRONGEST WAY POSSIBLE.  IT IS ONE OF MY BEST PURCHASES EVER.  THANKS.
5.0	This light is perfect.  We love the tropics so this is a great reminder as well as lighting our way through the night.  It does not have an on/off switch, but it really isn't necessary to have one because it consumes so little power.  Can't recommend it enough!
1.0	Bought this product because it had the Genie name only to find out its junk pure junk.  Made the mistake and bought a 2nd one after giving one to my wife. She complained but I didn't listen and ordered another one only to find out she was correct the distance was fine with the older clunkier ones, not with these. The button was incredibly hard to press which was very frustrating, has to be a defect. There's just no way any company could possibly believer these are of any quality. Returned them both.
1.0	I am in complete agreement with the two previous reviews.  I shopped a long time for the Houzer as I wanted a product that would last.  The specs are excellent...Stainless bottle...brass and stainless pump...heavy duty build quality.  Result is a disaster that corrodes everywhere you look and the soap not only discolors but actually gets rancid. The inside of the bottle is badly rusted making an excellent argument for plastic.  Disappointing product.
1.0	I ordered three of these lamps and 2 were broken.  They are not durable enough to be shipped.
5.0	The price and product are perfect!
5.0	We'll made soap dish, finish is very nice and has balance.  Glass dish is easy to clean and the fit is tight
5.0	These are a great addition to any tool box. We use them regularly at out pattern making shop for layout as well as drawing curves and circles. You can use this tool to lay out right angles, ninty degree angles, and to bisect angles, just to name a few. As far as I'm concerned it is invaluable!!
5.0	Nice quality for the price. Made In China.
5.0	Product works great. loud alarm. Cuctomer sevice is impeccable.
1.0	Did not operate properly. One, the light sensor did not work and it stay on constantly. The other one, the high/low control  did not function.
5.0	Good one. Good seller.
5.0	Aside from the stickers starting to peel off it's great. Includes all standard necessary parts which is awesome.
5.0	This product did exactly what I wanted it to do.  The explanation was very helpful and was fulfilled in the product.
5.0	This has worked out wonderful with my 93 yr old mother who is able to care for herself.  The on/off switch is very easy to use.
5.0	Quiet, powerful. Automatically comes on when needed (steam from shower).  Too bad it can't detect odors.  Grille looks good.  Nice and minimalist, not like most others that look cheap because the designers get too fancy with shapes.
5.0	Nice, quality product.
5.0	Everything was fine. No problems
5.0	plugged in to compressor, fridge started right up.
5.0	Adorable doorbell. Brightened up the front door. Ceramic, so be carefully screwing into moulding. Making screws too tight will crack it.
5.0	Beautiful chrome light fixture, looks better in person. Nice quality, easy install. Very happy with purchase. Price was better on Amazon than other lighting stores.
5.0	very pleased the item was well packed all the parts were there it has now been installed and working .
5.0	I've used other Howard brand products before with good results.So I thought I'd try this one out to see how it would work.I was totally amazed! The results were amazing and wonderful. The table looks like new! It filled in every scratch and sign of  use our little table had. The only place it didn't work as well on was the area where the table splits in half.One side of the table has an area that is just slightly higher than the other side. So the raised side has become very worn on the corner and that one corner didn't get 'restored' as well as the rest of the table. That corner is still lighter but it is also still better than it was before I used the product. This stuff is wonderful, I wish I knew about it sooner.
5.0	This product works great and looks amazing. make sure you follow the directions and do a good job with the prep work.<br />mite look even better if I would of used a sprayer.
1.0	From Navien Website: CONSUMER PURCHASES THROUGH THE INTERNET OR OTHER E-COMMERCE CHANNELS SHALL VOID<br /> NAVIEN'S WARRANTY.<br />There are no authorized online Navien Sellers
5.0	Both for the price of one - very good deal. Interesting to use too. Everyone should check for strong magnetic fields for health reasons. I was shocked - have been sitting in a super strong magnetic field. Looks like there may be a wiring problem - will check that out before we have a fire. Thanks!
5.0	Bird is a cutie and nicely made.  Looks great hanging among the plants from the patio ceiling fan.
1.0	There are two picture images for the drill pump.  One is as shown on this page.  The other is not shown here.  It is with a much bigger inlet/outlet to rim ratio.  My order is for the bigger inlet/outlet to ratio with a higher price.  The delivered item is the smaller inlet/outlet to rim ratio.  I feel being cheated and did reply to your previous email survey with my comment.  The supplier requested me to send it back.  Who pays the fee???  It is wasting of my time.  I am totally disappointed with the purchase.
1.0	My bike got stolen in Astoria, NY.
5.0	Product was great and as described in the picture. It is the same recommended by the manufacturer and by buying this 2 pack I saved a lot!!!. Delivery time was perfect too.
5.0	it was exactly what I ordered, and exactly what I needed.
5.0	Absolutely fabulous! The depth is perfect, the finish is excellent along with accessories.  Very pleasantly surprised.  I'd get another one in a minute when I have a place to put it.
5.0	They were perfect for my son's wedding reception.  The lights gave enough of  light to show off the centerpieces.  Thanks
1.0	One piece came chipped.
5.0	These have been difficult to find. They are great
5.0	My mom says she loves it.  Looks identical to the red one she once had.
5.0	If space is at a premium in your bathroom, then this is the perfect solution. It holds enough towels and washcloths for the average person. My linen closed is in the hall and I don't have enough storage space in my bathroom, so this solves the issue of having run to the hall for extra bath linens! The added bonus is that it looks nice, not cheap.
1.0	For the first time, I am disappointed with an Amazon product. The shade is not glass and is plastic and very flimsy.  Very sorry that I have this lamp
5.0	This is exactly what my bathroom needed, it's beautiful! Was easy to apply and so far it hasn't peeled at all.
5.0	I have 3 sinks in my kitchen.  Unfortunately 2 of the larger ones had Disposal sink splash guards that had worn out and were loose, grrr.<br />It was so irritating.. every. single. time... I used them, the guards slipped out & I would struggle to try to put them back.<br /><br />So I went on Amazon & found what I hoped would be the correct replacement Waste King sink & splash guards to replace them. These fit so nice and snug and I can now use my sink disposals without further grief.  I am so happy!
5.0	I was nervous about spray painting our kitchen cabinets, but this sprayer made the project much easier. We tried using a brush or roller first, but the results looked very amateur. The results with this sprayer look professional. Everyone that sees our kitchen can't believe that our cabinets look so good. I highly recommend this sprayer for professional looking results.<br />My only complaint about the sprayer is that for smaller projects, the cleanup will probably take longer than the actual painting.  The cleanup is straightforward, but it does take 10-15 minutes to really clean it properly.<br />Overall I'm very happy I bought this sprayer.
5.0	Product is has advertised.  Works great!
5.0	This heater is fantastic. I can't believe that have lived without this heater for so long. It works great, is built very well, and has a thousand uses. I am going to buy a second one very soon. Fast shipping and great customer support.
1.0	Waterborne epoxy is the worst you can buy.. it deteriorates so quick.. listing 'industrial' is misleading.  Look for 100% solids epoxy for real 'industrial' coating.. and @ less than $100 per 1.5 gal
5.0	Nice shades for the price.
5.0	This stuff is amazing; works very well.
5.0	This was very easy to install took only a few seconds to put it on. These work great. I got these because the kids kept sneaking out of their bedrooms at bedtime and I am now able to hear if their door opens even when I am down stairs. I use the chime which is loud when you are next to them but not too loud when you are in another room. The alarm is really loud.
5.0	They shipped fast and the price is great.
1.0	Don't order this it doesn't work
5.0	I'm very hard of hearing, I would never hear the smoke detector.  If my wife is home it is not a issue but, it is a issue when she is gone.  This light is very bright and it would sure wake me.  I picked-up a piece Wire Mold PVC and mounted the strobe 15 inches from the smoke detector.  It looks fine and works fine.<br /><br />WRD
5.0	I used this to repair my ice maker in my fridge. This worked perfectly. Now I have a working ice dispenser.
5.0	Not as pictured but it is very good!
5.0	Item was exactly as shown.  Works great. I am very satisfied and would come back if I need another like this.
5.0	Exactly like the ones that came with my refrigerator.
5.0	Just love this and it works on battery so no need to wire.  It is great where you would like and extra light like a hall but do not want to bring an electrician in.
5.0	I couldn't find a train rack without spending way too much money... Went to Amazon and here it was... It looks beautiful in my new renovated bathrooms.. The only thing that I find issue with, it's not as polished as I would have liked...
5.0	They arrived as advertised.  In all but one instance the swapping out of the old builders knobs with these &#34;classy&#34; levers was quick and easy.  The only real effort occurs when you have to reverse the lever due to how the door swings.  It is simple enough to do, but can require some effort depressing the notch, which is needed to remove the lever from the unit before you reverse it.  However, that is a minor issue.
5.0	It was shipped 2 day USPS free. Old part out, new part in 15 minutes, programmed remotes, worked great!
5.0	I purchased this bulb for my outside freezer when it finally dawned on me after years of previous bulb being burnt out that my freezer actually had a light...............I know...DAH!!!! Anyway, amazon as usual came through and had what I needed as well as a good price on the bulb...thanks so much!
5.0	Redid the cabinets in my bathroom and it looks beautiful and way cheaper that replacing them! Also have had many complements.
5.0	These are AMAZING. Spending a little bit more for these was well worth it, and recommend others to spend a bit more for these. I used the adhesive to line them on the wall where my stairs on. Works amazing at night. Flicks on when I approach the stairs, turns off soon after. Amazing product, please consider getting these.
5.0	The quality and functionality of this brass tank tee is excellent. The tank tee greatly simplified the piping for connecting a 1.5 HP pump and pressure tank with a ranch domestic water system.
5.0	works all night  have it in my widow  aimed the light  into the room  and beats  paying higher  electric bills at night
5.0	Worked better than expexted, sure beat trying to solder 16 gauge wire with a propane torch!!!!!  Attatched wires soundly and waterproofed them perfectly.
5.0	It arrived early and just in time to move a washer. It's very sturdy and easy to use. It folds up small enough to not take up much room. Highly recommend product and seller!
5.0	I got these for use inside of my bar-b-que where it is very high heat - they work fine!
5.0	I purchased these LED R14 Dimmable lights to go inside my lighted china cabinet to replace the 40 watt incandescent bulbs. Wow, these new LED bulbs are wonderful and provide just the right amount of light to illuminate my crystal and china. According to the package, these LED bulbs will last over 22 years if I burn them for 3 hours a day for a yearly cost of about $0.54. Another great advantage is that I will not have to replace the bulbs for decades and that is great since these bulbs are somewhat difficult to find in the stores. I can afford to leave these lights on all night for about the cost of burning a nightlight and provide some home security as well.
5.0	very cool lamps<br />they are just what we were looking for!
5.0	Very good pricing and hard to find at retail outlets.
1.0	This item arrived yesterday and I unpacked and tested it today.<br />It is defective.<br />One of the locks does not work. It will not lock to show the green button.<br />The manufacturer instructions are very clear about this. The product is UNSAFE and MUST NOT BE USED.<br />I am returning this item a.s.a.p. for a refund.<br />I do not want a replacement because I have no faith that a replacement will be any better than this one.<br />My experience with this item tells me the maker of this item has POOR or NO QAULITY CONTROL.<br />It should not have left the factory in this condition.<br />It seems the maker of this ladder (like so many others in China) assumes the purchaser to be their Quality Control.<br />This is unacceptable.<br />They have wasted my time.<br />If Amazon were to charge manufactures' like this for wasting customer's time and reimburse the customer they might get the point.<br />Clearly they are not doing this, and so I hold Amazon to be as responsible for this as the maker.<br />I am also disturbed by the makers' return policy.<br />They say they will repair or replace the faulty item so long as the purchaser pays for all shipping - both ways, without any assurance about how long this might take.<br />How cynical can they get?<br />They produce defective and unsafe products and then hold the customer as victim when they wish to get satisfaction.<br />This has been a bad experience all round.
5.0	Product arrived quickly. Very satisfied with the quality of these candles. Great Price.
5.0	so easy to use, great product, seller was very acurate in description, this is the easiest heat gun i have every used, the finished product is great.  been doing cosplay work and this heat gun is the perfect addition to an artist looking to work in thermal plastics like Worbla.
5.0	I was a little skeptical since the price was so low, but the hand truck is excellent: folds easily, is compact when folded, sturdy when opened and in use. Perfect for my needs: light to medium-heavy cartage.
5.0	works as described.  Just be careful if you have something that screws on alot as the relief holes may not function well.  May have to add more washers.
5.0	While lightweight it fits the Toto Drake II perfectly. The slow close lid is an attractive feature that prevents the annoying lid slamming.
5.0	Great for my Ski sports tube
5.0	I bought a ten pack and got them well before the estimated delivery date. If they are made in china you wouldn't know it. Important to know; they don't come with screws. This could be a challenge too as others including myself have reported that some truss screws actually don't fit, being to wide and not fitting in the forward holes. Good luck with this, I used high quality diagonal cutters to nip off one side to make it fit. Also, clearance is tight and screw (if to tall) must then be centered in the track otherwise it will cause binding.
5.0	What can you say about glue, it sticks !
5.0	Love the Pur system over Britta - removes a lot more impurities/chemicals, and the water tastes great.
5.0	Bought this showerhead to replace the standard one that was installed in my house 10 years ago.  I removed the water restrictors to get more pressure and the shower feels great.  I'm really happy I purchased this from Amazon as I saw a similar one at Lowes for $109, which is significantly more than the price here at Amazon.  Oh, and the install kit comes with the thread seal tape, so you don't have to buy a roll of that.  It's a high quality showerhead and installs simply.
5.0	Battery Operated Security light, Works great I put mine up in a hallway leading to the basement. I did find it hard to screw off the face/light part-I have smaller hands which made it somewhat difficult to get it screwed back on. But other than that, I was truly impressed on how bright this light is, for only being run on batteries. And because it uses batteries I can really place this anywhere without the worry of having to plug it in somewhere, or having to drill holes for wiring. I think this is a great idea, and this could be used in many area's of the home as well as in the basement, where lighting is darker than normal.
5.0	Simple to put together.  Strong enough to load up. Keeps the wood off the floor so you can vacuum, or sweep, underneath the stack.  Light weight, and easy to stack and move to the barn in the off season.  Nothing fancy, but the rack works and blends into the background.  I burn a lot of wood, and have two of these located near the stove, with both stacked in sub-20F degree weather I'll get 3-4 days out of the stacks.
5.0	This worked great for our Bosch model sch3032uc/u12 dish washer.  It was easy to install and glad to find on Amazon as no local store had the part.
1.0	I can not use this item as it is the wrong voltage and plug for the UK, I should have been made aware that this was the case!
5.0	As they seem on the screen, they are excellent replacement for MR16 bulb holders.  Arrived safe and in good condition
5.0	Great transformer works perfect.
5.0	This is a great product.  Looks and feels real so noone will ever suspect the truth.  Exactly what I needed..
5.0	In my opinion 26-28 Guage wire is abit too flimsy and this is where i want to be 4-6 wraps make this a shot gun killer vape!<br />Oh 2 day shipping prime... whats not to like...<br />Better than buying at a local vape shop where they charge 50$<br />Kudos
5.0	Sticks well but I have to see whether it comes off cleanly in the future.
1.0	So far of the ones I've use, one was bad on putting it in, one lasted a day, one lasted a week and only one is still working a month later.. Stay away from these. Thought I was saving money, but not a good deal after all.
5.0	Arrived quickly and was very easy to install. I took the advice of others and replaced the whole unit rather than individual components. I'm glad I did! The dryer works great!
5.0	These are great for lighting up areas where you do not wish to trip in the dark, I ordered a couple of packs and used them all.
5.0	Unit was fairly easy to install and it works very good.  Would deviant recommend it to a freind
5.0	I got this and installed it just last week. It covers well but a little shy of the space I needed covered. But, hey, my power bill will be lower this year than last as we are almost 100% LED now.  This was installed to cove the pool and patio deck area and a little bit of the spa. So, from that standpoint it will do its job well.
5.0	This is a great little doorbell. I installed the transmitter outdoors on a protected porch and put one receiver on each floor of the house. I can now hear the doorbell from nearly anywhere. I especially like the fact that the receivers don't need batteries.
5.0	Get this one rather than one with a lower wattage-capacity if you need to power a bunch of kitchen lights.
5.0	it works perfect to add similar remote and comes with battery. A+  just match the dip switches and its good to go
5.0	Work but take a little more thought when you go to install if you have installed standard hinges in the past. Very good quality, heavy duty hinge.
5.0	Equivalent to the factory tool at a much better price. Having this tools makes repairs on my Moen faucets so much easier.
5.0	Fast delivery.<br />Used one candle to see how long the item would stay on........FIVE DAYS!<br />Would purchase again but would prefer them not so bright.
5.0	High quality product which worked as expected. The only area which needs improvement are the gaskets provided at the bottom of the enclosure where the wires enter the enclosure. The gaskets are a bit fragile if the wiring needs to be inserted and removed several times to get the routing into the enclosure optimized. Overall, this is an excellent product.
1.0	Ours burned out in one year of light use.  It also had a hard time getting Insteon signal.  In the JUNK PILE.
5.0	Everyone that walks through our bedroom as they view the new home comments about this fan
5.0	I installed these in the garage to replace the builder installed fixture.  Installation was super easy!  I didn't even bother to read the instructions.  Everything that you need for the installation comes in the box. Now there is ample light in the garage and all of the dark areas are finally gone.
5.0	Superb, well designed, accurate, and functional incubator. Would advise anyone to buy this with rock steady temperature control and good humidity control
1.0	The concept is great - that's the only good thing I can say about this product and SkyBell as a company.<br />SkeyBell doesn't care about customers... My unit started ringing randomly and after a month of investigation with their support team, they agreed that light sensor was defective (my SkyBell unit was not exposed to direct sun light), and they will replace the defective unit. Unlike most companies that care about their customers, SkyBell sent me an email which supposed to include an attachment with the exchange form - I received the mail, but the form was not attached. Two week after the email confirming the exchange, I followed up with SkyBell and requested the exchange form - I was REALLY surprised to learn that I have to return the defective unit (at my expense) before they can start the exchange.<br />I'm glad I purchased the unit from Amazon, a company that put customers' need first, and they allowed me to return the defective unit even though I was not within the official return policy period.
5.0	Light strips are easy to use and work great for small places.  Only product that would replace 12 inch incandescent light strips.
5.0	Perfect. Just as advertised.
1.0	Bulb lasted maybe two weeks at the most. I would try another brand
5.0	I tried everywhere to find this product , hardware stores such as Lowe's home depot.I needed it for my bathroom the old one was so old that i couldn't even use the outlet all it was good for was turning on the lights.I found this one on amazon it was easy to install and the outlet is great.This is exactly what I needed ,because with the way the bathroom is set up it's the only product that would work.I can finally use the outlet again .Thank you !
5.0	Exactly what I needed. Good price. Arrived quickly.
5.0	I love this faucet. I attached a hose from our Enagic Water machine and it works perfectly. The faucet handle activation is smooth. It is a nice looking faucet and was easy to install.
5.0	For those of you who had a poor user experience with the DoorBot, please understand that the Ring Video Doorbell is far removed from that product. The video quality far exceeds the Doorbot.  The new product is also designed to look less futuristic and more handsome mounted next to your front door. Ring is also available in a number of colors to harmonize with your home exterior.  Wifi setup is easy. It took only one try to set up the Ring to my iPhone. The Ring app is also available for android phones, but I can't comment of the ease of set up on that OS. Once the doorbell is rung, the notification on the phone is quick and there is very little lag before video begins to stream. Audio quality is acceptable, but not outstanding.  A feature just activated is Motion Detection. There are a number of settings for the motion detection system. Some people might enjoy tailoring motion settings, but others may not.  It will take some tries before the adjustments are just right. The ring staff is working to improve the motion detection.  The ring also records every door event to a Subscription Cloud service.  Always know who came to your door even if you were not able answer the Ring.  Very neat feature and works very well.  The device does work, at least for me, as advertised.  Also, I have found the support staff a huge improvement from the doorbot days.
5.0	Love it, wish I would have bought it sooner
1.0	These arrived with some of them broken and some needing batteries replaced. Some have had batteries replaced and still don't work. Do not buy these!
5.0	This tool does exactly what it's supposed to, not to mention totally saves the day when a tire won't ''grab'' the bead during inflation and otherwise holds up the whole job!
5.0	This was just like the original.
5.0	Got item, as described!...Had a small issue with shipping, but received on a timely manner!......A++++  :-)
5.0	Very useful gift- will last a long time!
5.0	I prefer the 3000K light temperature to the 2700K because it is just a bit less yellow, but still warm white. I was comparing it to a Cree Warm White  2700K 60 W replacement LED bulb, and the Cree sheds slightly more light downward, but you see the LEDs in the Cree, and with this bulb the whole bulb glows evenly.  The bulb stays cool, only the base (where the electronics are) gets slightly warm. The base of the Cree gets much hotter.<br />It's overall the best LED bulb I've tried so far, just the price is high. Hopefully it will come down.<br />It has a 5 year warranty  and is NOT dimmable.
5.0	Quick and easy install, had a 1/4 hp motor on last one but 3/4 hp motor is just right and quiet.
5.0	Excellent Price and customer service I used the bulbs in a church sanctuary to get better lighting. The bulbs replace 40 watt incandescent bulbs providing a much needed increase in usable light.  I would recommend these led bulbs to anyone. Thank you
5.0	These have held up to my 3 year olds all summer.
5.0	Great Product=Great Price=Fast Delivery=Thank You
5.0	I'm alive today because of one of these gizmos.  It's as simple as that.
5.0	Great item the saves money, time, and the mess of trying to replace the whole fan.  Works better than expected - clears the air in record time.
5.0	worked perfect for what I wanted
5.0	Work perfect, easy to pair with Smartthings Hub .
5.0	We placed it on a table in our entry way.  I love the subtle colors.  It goes very well with our French Country decor.
5.0	Great item keeps you from having to drill holes in the concrete or the bricks.
5.0	Does the job. It was a great price, much cheaper than what other companies were charging me.  Easy to replace. Would buy again if needed to.
5.0	Cool product.  A little pricey but the effectiveness of the tape is pretty impressive.  It's very sticky, can hold some weight on the wall and the best thing is... you don't have to drill holes to attach your items now.  I used this to put a carbon monoxide detector up in my trailer and it did a wonderful job.  Two thumbs up.
5.0	Love it! Where I live is very busy during the summer. The motion option is great and phone notification is great too. Nothing but great things to say about this product! ALSO the fact that you can talk to the person at your door from your phone. People that don't know about the skybell when they ring it get a little freaked out when you start talking to them hahaha.<br /><br />Set up was simple<br />Install was simple<br />Great product
5.0	Excellent as a low cfm whole house fan without all the typical noise. Added a digital timer,flex duct,and grille to complete<br />the installation. Does not have the capacity of most whole house fans but is way quieter and energy efficient.Had it set<br />to come at at midnight and off at 5:00 am. In our temperature region this works well,yours may be different.
5.0	So cute and went on pretty easily just pull of the paper slowly especially around the whiskers.
5.0	These lights are perfect for what I wanted. Just some accent light in my flower bed... I love them! Highly recommend them to anyone looking to put the finishing touch on your flower bed!
1.0	Would not start out of  the box.  C=H sent new parts. Had to take it apart,insert parts, reassemble.  Never started again.  Sent it back for a refund, which  Amazon promptly provided.  Very disappointing product.
5.0	looks good and dims well as described.
5.0	Great way to decorate a boring wall!!! Simple to put on. Although, make sure you have someone there to help you put it on (especially for the big branch part)! Looks great when your done!
5.0	Perfect fit and works great!!
1.0	The door screen is cheap. The velco is useless. It won't stick to the door. Ido not recommend to anyone.
1.0	This product wasted a lot of my time, it does not work and the support is horrible.  I do not trust the brand now.
5.0	Wasnt sure if this was going to work.  We had to replace one of the smoke alarms.  The other alarms were older and no longer available.  So we had to buy the adapter so the newer model would work with the older ones. It did work.
5.0	We got some plastic ones at Home Depot that seriously pissed me off. They kept coming loose and they'd shift all overt the place. These don't move a single inch. They're very sturdy and well made. Wish I had bought these instead of the crappy ones at Home Depot.
5.0	Item is exactly what I wanted and it works great with my Bravo dryer
5.0	If you aren't familiar with this whole Legrand line you should be aware that it is an entire system. The normal single, double, and triple gang sizes apply, but you must purchase the corresponding wall plate/frame as well as the switches. The wall plate has removable plastic spacers pre-installed which make the openings for switches square. For the basic paddle switches, which are also square, you leave these in place. For some dimmers and touch switches, which are more rectangular, you remove the spacers. The finishing plate is available in dozens of finishes. Additionally, the 'nightlight' accessory can be inserted into some switch and some plates for illumination. It connects in parallel with the switch wiring.<br />So, it's not exactly a cheap or easy swap for existing switches. That said, I splurged on these for a remodel, and I love them. I put paddle switches in most places, but these touch models in a few places are absolutely delightful. They are a completely luxury purchase - well made and high quality. All of their switches are 3-way capable. Since I needed 3-way switches for about 40% of my needs this helped me justify purchasing them....a little bit.<br />My two complaints: 1. The price is painful - over a thousand dollars for an entire house. 2. Their efforts to make this product appear simple have resulted in being oversimplified. You absolutely need to understand the basics of 3-way switches (commons, travelers) and the lighted accessory diagram took me many readings before I got it. Regular diagrams or more details would be appreciated.
5.0	Exactly what we wanted.
5.0	now i can turn my light on and off with my feet.
5.0	looks great, but I have not installed yet.
5.0	This doorbell is a great asset to the sanity in our home. Wait, it's just a doorbell... How special can that be?  Well, we're using it in a bit of a different manner.  We put one of the sensors (ringers) in each of our kid's room and use it to alert the kids that it is time to emerge from their rooms and join us for dinner, etc.  No more yelling up the stairs for the kids to come down and hope they heard us... Now, when we push that magic button, one of the 50 custom tones that each kids gets to individually set on their ringer bellows out with that &#34;get your butt downstairs&#34; urgency. Yes, our kids are bell trained and it's amazing, thanks to this great doorbell kit!
5.0	Unlike the wireless controller, this works fine.
5.0	I've reseated several toilets and installed new toilets so I'm comfortable with the process. But being comfortable with it doesn't mean I like dealing with the gross wax ring. No matter how careful you are, you still end up with that gunky wax in places you didn't want it to be.<br /><br />This toilet seal by Danco does have a wax ring, but it's mostly encased in rubber so you never have to touch the wax (after you scrape away the old, disgusting wax from the previous ring.)<br /><br />I wanted to re-tile a tiny half bath and getting this seal convinced me to go ahead and do it. Because of the design, it's perfect for use after re-tiling because it easily accommodates changes in floor height. Installation was simple and went without a hitch. No leaks and no mess. I'm a convert.<br /><br />If you've never re-seated a toilet or installed a new one, watch a few YouTube videos first. It's not a hard task and this seal makes it a little easier.<br /><br />My best tip is when tightening the bolts after installing the ring and setting the toilet in place, tighten each side a little at a time. Loose bolts are what cause many toilet leaks but tightening the bolts too much can actually crack the toilet itself. If you tighten one side a little and then the other side a little, going back and forth til the bolts are tight enough that there is no rocking or movement when you sit on the toilet, you should safely get a solid seal.
5.0	This is exactly what I was looking for.  A no-nonsense package with a clear indicator.  It's trivial to recharge (a couple of hours in the oven).<br /><br />I use this in my safe.
5.0	It's so awesome<br />I've made an indoor/ window seal garden
5.0	Love the lamp.  the only complaint is that the saddle base piece is loose where it comes out of the top of the lamp, making the harp, shade , final disk and finial, WIGGLY and hard to keep straight.
5.0	Two days after I placed my order, I received this shower head and I can say I am very satisfied with the quality. It was extremely easy to install and did not require any tools. The packaging came with plumbers tape so I did not have to make a special trip to the hardware store. The shower head fit my pipes perfectly and took maybe 4 minutes in total to install. With the extender arm, I am able to get the shower head directly over the center of my walk-in shower.  After years of having a traditional shower head, it will take some time to get used to a rainfall shower head's water pressure. The water pressure is good and it does not come out forceful, but with a nice steady flow. The extender arm has two pivot points which allowed me to perfectly place the position of the shower head for my height and location in the shower. At 8 inches, the diameter is large enough to get a nice flow of water for a very relaxing shower. I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a rainfall shower.  I did receive this product at a discounted rate for my honest and unbiased opinion, but that does not discredit the results that I received.
5.0	Used to light up the top of my kitchen cabinets.  Provides a great ambiance in the evening.  They are heavy duty in construction and comes with both light strip and extension cord.
1.0	It is lovely when you first install them- it is not as lovely when they start not working so well with the &#34;auto&#34; night light- and it is absolutely awful when they all stop in less than a month- when they were installed in places that doesn't require them to work often at all..
5.0	It would be nice if it had an auto-shut off, but that would make it bulky.<br />You have to keep your eye on it, and unplug it when the water is gone.<br /><br />I use this to pump out water that pools in my driveway at a low spot...lots of water.<br />A few related problems I had to solve were how to keep the extension cord connection dry, and keep the pump from falling over, due to the wind and the heavy duty lawn hose attached to it.<br /><br />I did it by putting the pump inside a 5 gallon plastic bucket with a lid.<br />Drilled hoes around the bottom of the bucket, for water to get in, holes around the top for hose output, and extension cord input.<br />Wired the pump so it couldn't fall over, wired the cord/ext cord up high in the bucket, so water could not reach it,  connected the hose, then snapped the lid on.<br />It is self contained now, and easy to set up and run.
5.0	we are very happy with it. thank you Elvia heyermann
5.0	I purchased this item for my 7 year old son. It is made of quality metal and looks very nice.  The edges below the bike are a little sharp, but so far they have not caused a problem - its been 2 months.  I am happy with this product.
5.0	Works great. Great $$$
5.0	"I LOVE this lamp! It casts the most beautiful, relaxing light, and it has an undefinable \\""presence\\"" that's quite mysterious. I sometimes put colored Christmas bulbs in to change the ambiance, but I like the peachy fire-like glow the best.<br /><br />It's the recommended size for my 150 square foot living room in order to create the right amount of ionization according to the instructions. It looks just right. It's the exposure to the surface area that's important, so I think that if you like the large salt lamp baskets better [[ASIN:B0025VO3DW WBM 8-Inch Wide and 7-Inch Tall Round Basket Lamp filled with Himalayan Natural Crystal Salt Chunks]] that they have just about the same surface area for a little less money.<br /><br />Supposedly by cleaning the air of dust particles these lamps help asthma and other respiratory disorders. I wouldn't notice because I don't have any trouble with my lungs, but others swear by them. They're also supposed to neutralize the electrical impact of electronic equipment. I keep it right by where I use my laptop which I lay directly on my knees, so hopefully it will offer some protection.<br /><br />The price on Amazon with the free shipping is better than you'll find anywhere else. It arrived quickly and without any damage.<br /><br />As I've said, I love this very unique lamp, so I'm going to buy another for my bedroom, and buy several of both the lamps and the baskets (which look like miniature fire pits)for gifts.<br /><br />Very highly recommended! One of my favorite things!"
5.0	As a Fairy collector, I could not be more happy with this item. Not only is it perfect in size but also incredibly beautiful. I actually thought it would be plastic and NOT glass so I am really impressed by that. I will say that the glass is fragile though so DO BE CAREFUL. I was not and broke one of the pieces. Thankfully it was just a small piece and nothing that couldn't be repaired with superglue. The touch works nicely and is perfect for my bedside. A marvelous product.
5.0	Have these units on every entry door (front, side and back) on my property. It is a superb unit, keyless and easy to use, and I only wonder why I didn't do this sooner.
5.0	Visually attractive and functions well.
5.0	This product is amazing.  My drayer has a long vent  110 foot vertical and then another 12-14 feet to the outer wall.  Drying time for a large load was over two hours before the product.  With the product, drying time is about 1 hour.
5.0	Outstanding solution to a difficult problem...
5.0	Looks beautiful and is so much kinder to my eyes than the drafting table lamp that it replaced. Wish the darn thing had broken sooner.
5.0	Beautifiul. Fan is not super strong but definitely adequate and reversible, and light is brighter than we expected.
5.0	quick shipping good price
5.0	It came quickly and I couldn't beat the price.  It programed into my two separate garage door openers without any difficulty.
5.0	These hings are small yet heavy-duty.  I used them on a 6ft solid wood desk and they work perfect.  I would definitely recommend them.
5.0	This is a high quality adapter.  The part is molded out of plastic with standard contact parts, like a decent extension cord would have.  Compare this to the &#34;universal&#34; adapters made of rigid plastic that accept global plug input.  They are a compromise and tend to have poor contact and holding power, and they tend to come apart.  Now, this does mean that only US and other NEMA 5-15 users can plug into it, but that's OK; the company makes adapters for non-US customers, too.<br /><br />Have been able to successfully use it on a variety of modern Type E and Type F outlets, and it fits snugly to stay put.  This kind of adapter (CEE 7) is specifically designed to fit both of those, and is typical for *most* of Europe outside of the UK, et al.  While it appears similar to Type C (older two-pin ungrounded) outlets, the pins are thicker and spaced differently.  Type C _plugs_ will fit in Type E _sockets_ but not vice-versa.  The company also sells Type C adapters.  Note specifically that Italy has its own plug and socket standard, which you will likely find in older places.  It is being replaced by the more modern Type F.  Some reviewers note that &#34;it doesn't work in country X&#34; and give it one star.  Double check the country you are traveling to, and especially if you will be staying at older homes, inns, etc. vs. modern hotels, offices or other accommodations<br /><br />If you want to know what will work in a country before you travel, consult a site like<br />http://www.worldstandards.eu/electricity/plugs-and-sockets/<br />  or<br />http://www.iec.ch/worldplugs/<br /><br />Both have good pictures, and the latter goes into gory details about pin size and spacing, but has a handy tool for finding out what works in each country.
1.0	most of the batteries in this pack are either carry half charge or close to zero. Terrible!
5.0	works great with my old multi code receiver. So much cheaper than what the local retailer was asking.
5.0	Love it! it came with a dent in it and I couldn't get a response from the seller but all functions work at the same time and I need it with my pain issues.
5.0	Thinner than regular paracord but strong enough for most of my needs. tarp/tent/small bear bag/ etc I love the refective part, it really helps me find my shelter at night and hopefully looks spooky enough to keep criters at bay... that parts probably not true but it makes me feels better so I tell myself that.
5.0	This product is working as intended.  Hooked it up to an Elk M1G and it has been great.  No complaints.
1.0	Number of screws per box is not given! No one is going to order any until that crucial information is available.
5.0	Great price for the right product
5.0	Very nice lights.  Clean lines- and easy to hang.  Looks more expensive than it was and lots of bright light when using LED bulbs.
5.0	My oven vent hood bulb burned out so I picked this one to replace it. The light is warm and matches the previous bulb. I considered LED but could not verify an glass replacement. Cooking oil and grease could discolor plastic bulbs common with cheap LEDs.
5.0	This turned out to be a package of yellow thumbtacks, which is what it was sold as, and is also what I wanted. It's nice when everything works out so smoothly like that on the Internet.<br /><br />Interestingly, the thumbtacks are almost exactly the same color as the stars I'm rating them with here. WHAT DOES IT MEAN???
5.0	If you have to have this type buld with the twist/lock base, these are a good deal for both price and quality.
5.0	I recently purchased the iSpring RO system and it wasn't as difficult to install as I thought. I made a mistake with installing the tubes by not inserting them deep enough and called customer service. I spoke with Pearl and she was fantastic! She helped me over the phone to troubleshoot this and I got it up and running in no time.
5.0	Was exactly as expected. Prompt delivery.
5.0	Exhaust fan failed and it will be a pain to remove and wife misses the overhead light. So, I purchased the RiteLite LPL704, added batteries and easily mounted it over the cooktop. Wife loves it. She can direct the lights, as needed, to whatever she's cooking.
5.0	I, too, am using this as a nut milk and stock strainer.  So far the bag has taken a lot of abuse and has shown no signs of strain or ripping.  Great idea.
5.0	These 'Grippers' are an excellent, and much cheaper alternative to using sorbothane pads when it comes to isolating your audio/video equipment and/or speakers.  Place them underneath your CD player, DVD player, tubed or solid state preamp/amplifier, and speakers to isolate each component from sound-robbing excess vibrations.  In order for them to work best, I find that carefully sticking 2 together (glue side on glue side) allow for just the right amount of thickness to effectively damp vibrations and to maximize isolation.  Since 8 come in one single pack, each pack would be sufficient for just one speaker or one component (remember, sticking the 8 together gives you 4).  In closing, the one's I have were purchased at LOWE'S, are 1 1/2 inches, and the product number on the package is #0054257.
1.0	thought it would work with a pulse action like a water-pic but it only has a weak spray. also have to change fittings on sink.
5.0	Came quick,very very quick, just as what I wanted and needed. They do seem very strong, but you can still cut them with scissors, and they will hold tight even the smallest of cables.
5.0	This water dispenser is bomb! It's pretty, works great, perfect for my counter top.  Fluoride free hydration with style ;P
5.0	These bulbs look quite nice. I bought 5 of these to replace the 5 35watts halogen in my ceiling spot light. Didn't know whether these are bright enough substitutes before buying, and I bought 5 of those 9 watts cool color ones just in case. It turns out these are very bright LEDs. I would say they are on par with the 35watts halogens. I don't really notice much difference between these 6w warm lights and those 9watts cool LEDs I bought. Hope they last long.
1.0	didn't work filter was way to thin<br />when furnace kicks in it would pull filter in to motor<br />went back to filter I used to use
5.0	I bought this filter to replace my existing filter because the ice machine was taking a long time to produce ice and the water dispenser in the door was coming out very slow. I hadn't replaced the filter for almost a year because of the price, but as soon as I replaced it I noticed a difference. Since I can get 6-8 months out of the filter I would say it is a decent price and I received it in less than 2 days with free shipping!
5.0	These are nice. Met my expectation.
5.0	We've had such a lamp dimmer for over 25 years, and it is a pleasure to have.<br />I replaced the old one with this, simply because I felt that 25+ years was enough.<br />I am absolutely amazed at how fast this order got here! This is a sturdy product,<br />and we recommend it highly. I prefer this to using the 3-way bulb. You can choose<br />exactly how dim or how bright you want your light. I love it!  (I bought two.) I might<br />get another one or two for the bedrooms. (My spare dimmer will go right here at my<br />desk.) Such a great item for the price!
5.0	Work great over a year now. Love them
5.0	Fantastic!! Thank you so much!
5.0	Easy to install and a lot cheaper than a new chair.
1.0	I've written about the fact that while this was on the invoice, it was not in the box, twice!  Never arrived and no one responded to my request for assistance with this order.  There is no option to explain this error in the customer service help areas.  It just dead ends by saying that sometimes orders are split into separate shipments for faster delivery.  The end.  So, no money back and no thingy that was supposed to go in my husbands stocking and no response to my inquiries.  TOTAL FAIL AMAZON.
1.0	I bought it, installed it, and uninstalled it and threw it away.  It is an extremely low quality copy of a classic Leviton outdoor switch.  It has a flimsy tactile feedback when operating the switch lever, and there is a lot of play in the lever itself.  The outdoor metal part of this unit is made in india, and also has a low quality and uneven finish.  The inner switch part of the unit is made in china.  I replaced it with a NOS (new old stock) Leviton switch that I purchased from an auction site, and it feels/works a million times better, and is all American made.
5.0	Awesome, works like a charm.....
5.0	Excellent item works well on boat
5.0	Pretty much like all the other EL wire kits out there - battery pack, multi-settings (on/off/blink modes), but at a really good price compared to some of the other resellers.  It would be nice if the unit were more modular (e.g. add additional strings) but hey, like I said, the price is good.
5.0	These work so well I purchased more for family members.
1.0	After working well to control my radiator system for a couple of weeks, this morning I woke up to a very cold house.  The display on the thermostat was completely blank.  Replacing with fresh batteries did not change this.  Fortunately, I kept my old analog thermostat, which I swapped back in place.  The heat immediately turned on.<br /><br />After a few minutes, I put the original batteries back in the Hunter 44260 and the display came on normally.  I therefore suspect that hitting the reset button might have also fixed it, but I did not try that before leaving the batteries out for a few minutes.<br /><br />Nevertheless, I don't trust this thing.  I would hate to have it decide to lock up again when I am out of town leading to frozen pipes and thousands of dollars of damage.
5.0	Just want to concur with everyone's opinion: Very sturdy piece of equipment. Shipped very quickly, too.
5.0	I have been using this product for about two months, and it is a great solution for the gaps between the stove and the counter. Because of its flexibility it adjusted very well to both surfaces. I completely recommend this product.
5.0	Works grate and very bright and colorful The remote is very handy it is great for setting any mood!!!😉 only one thing I don't like it is directional which ever way it is facing is the way the light Will point
5.0	Works great.  During Christmas I have it connected to the trees lights so no more crawling around on the floor to turn on the tree.
1.0	STARTED TO SMOKE WHEN IT WAS ONLY ON FOR 5 MINUTES. FIRE HAZARD AND DANGEROUS. THIS PRODUCT SHOULD BE DISCONTINUED. IT WORKS BEST IN THE BOTTOM OF A TRASH CAN.
5.0	This fit perfectly, very easy fix.  Saved a lot and I was able to get the part and replace it quicker than calling a repair person.
5.0	It arrived timely and packaged well.  It was easy to set up and simple to use.  Great price.  What else do you need?  It's perfect.
5.0	"The quality is good, the zipper works well, and it does the job. I had to build up a small wooden \\""lip\\"" over my attic opening, as I only had a flat surface and it works best with a 6\\"" ( 6 inches high) lip to fit around - but that was not a big deal. I then had to hammer fastening staples around the edge to seal it to the surface. Those are not complaints, just FYI.<br /><br />Once that was done, it has been everything I needed. We were losing a LOT of heat through our attic. Now, when I go up the ladder, I can feel a warm pocket of air on one side, and cold air when I open the zipper for the other side (or vice-versa in the summer).<br /><br />If I were to make a suggestion to the manufacturer, I would have liked to see a velcro \\""flap\\"" around the zipper to seal even the zipper teeth. I can still make out tiny specs of light creeping through the teeth (especially where the sipper closes and meets). It would be nice if this was also able to seal.<br /><br />Overall, I highly recommend. The product is good and works. It seems to be well made.<br /><br />I have now owned this for just over a year."
5.0	I'll keep this short and straight to the point.  This spackle sticks very well and fills most holes you need to cover.  It spreads smoothly like a creamy peanut butter and the time indicator is very accurate.  Logically, the center takes the longest to dry and that is usually the last part to turn from pink to white.  This should be an industry standard and I will never go back to using any other brand.
5.0	A great purchase to replace the lights in our range vent fan. Easy to install, very inexpensive and long lasting! What's not to like!
5.0	"Duck Brand duct tape is the universal fix-it for campers and hikers. Sticky on the inside with a heavy-duty adhesive and slick and waterproof on the outside, Duck Brand duct tape reduces the friction that causes blisters.<br /><br />Type \\""hiking blister\\"" on YouTube and you'll find step-by-step instructional videos that illustrate how to prep your feet with duct tape to prevent blisters as well as how to protect your feet after a blister forms. Blisters can quickly ruin a hike, so it is important to wrap strips of this silver-colored duct tape around your trekking poles or water bottle. For longer trips, I recommend taking a whole roll.<br /><br />As a repair kit, Duck Brand duct tape is second to none in the outdoors. Patch holes in your tent, reinforce a torn backpack strap, or hold together a pair of shoes long enough to get back home. I've read about hikers using it for rope, zipper pulls, belts and camp sandals, too.<br /><br />I use Duck Brand duct tape on my own feet and I take it along on my hikes and camping trips. I can't imagine going hiking or camping without it.<br /><br />Rating: Five stars"
5.0	had it for about a month now and it is a superb product for the money...very satisfied, easy installation and user friendly
5.0	Great bulb. This is a spot bulb. By the look of it I assumed it would be a flood. It's exactly what I was looking for.
5.0	I had one of these but moved to a bigger home.  Every time I needed the ladder is was in the other room, so I got one for both rooms.  This a sturdy, light weight ladder that offers just the right amount of strength and stability.
5.0	Makes moving furniture easier and doesn't scratch the floor.
1.0	I bought two of these plugs for my 1952 American made tractor restoration and was shocked to see &#34;China&#34; cast into each part.<br /><br />There is no way I can present my American made antique with such parts.<br /><br />I wonder if Anderson Metals has any U.S. employees any more, because they certain paid China to make what they sold me.<br /><br />This is sad and shameful...
5.0	I installed this in my garage and it has been great for finding the switch. Also, the light is bright enough to illuminate part of the garage without having to turn on the lights.
5.0	All metal construction makes this much more durable than the plastic handle it replaced on my toilet.
5.0	Works well w/LED fixture.
5.0	Works as advertised. I will be buying  a second one.
1.0	It doesn't work. People still stink up the bathroom. On top of that, the toilet seat is uncomfortable and slips on the seat. Very cheaply made.
5.0	This is just what I wanted! Very well made and pink is really a nice shade of pink, not peachy like one reviewer said. Love this!
5.0	Very Happy with the product, my heating bills are going down, I plan to install this every year from now on.
5.0	I've got this bulb in an overhead fixture in my bathroom, replacing a 175W incandescent flood light.  This bulb is amazing - the room is much brighter and the grooming process is much easier.  As an added bonus, having such crisp, bright overhead light in a bathroom reflect off the mirror mitigates the shadows created by the vanity lights directly above the mirror.
5.0	There are several soft closers to choose from and it's hard to tell which will be the best from a small picture and reviews.  However, I'm delighted I made this choice.  The product is excellent, very well made from metal (not flimsy plastic) very easily fitted with a single screw and fully adjustable for different door sizes and hinge strenths.  Overall an excellent item (I bought 20 and wish I'd ordered more to do all the bathroom and utility room cupboards)
5.0	This model was recommended to use by our plumber. he suggested I shop around and get the cheapest price and he would install it. Compared to our old flapper and bal float  contraption this model has super force and does what it is supposed to do in a second. Bottom line = faster and more powerful.
5.0	As described, fair price
5.0	Nothing too fancy....basically a folded piece if plated steel.  They securely hold the rear of drawer glides to the cabinet back wall.  The glide can move in and out over a substantial range to allow for different cabinet depths.<br /><br />If you need them, buy them.  They're cheap and work.
5.0	Arrived quickly and was exactly as described.  It looks exactly like what I imagine an old-time bulb would look.  It creates the mood I was looking for.
5.0	My dual inlet valve was leaking did'nt mind on the water side but when the icemaker started freezing up had to replace it.Local parts supply house wanted double the price for this part.Sure I waited a couple of days but was delivered to my door with easy to follow instructions that you cannot make a mistake job took less then 1 hr. and I am happy.
5.0	Well, I was surprised.... these lights are so bright and the light is white, so pleasant after 2700K CFLs....come on instantly.<br />Great product!!! Fast shipping and great package!
5.0	This Stinger remote is a big improvement over the old original Stanley remote.<br />Pros: good switch w/audible click, cover is easier to open than the old style remote, range (at least with its new batt.) is a little better than the old Stanley 1050, small and compact for pocket-carry.<br /><br />Cons: uses a non-standard 12v battery (the old remote uses a reg. 9v batt), cover is a little tricky to slide back on..a tight fit with components BUT no harder than the big black 1050. As mentioned elsewhere, the switch settings are the apparent reverse of the old box..one not knowing this would think the unit not functioning.<br /><br />At $12 w/free ship., I bought two and have had no problems during the 3 months owned.
5.0	"I love this.  It is perfect in my kitchen. It's very \\""rich\\"" looking and matches all my other bronze decor. I can always count on Amazon to find what I want at a reasonable price."
5.0	Grease buildup ruined my original burner (it caught fire and then stopped working). This replacement fit perfectly, was easy to install and has lasted for the past couple years.
5.0	I was skepital when I ordered this bulb for the fixture on my basement stairs. We are always running up and down with with an armful of laundry or something or just don't take the time to flip the switch. And since the house is fairly old and there is no switch to turn it off at the bottom of the steps, the light would get left on wasting energy. This bulb was the perfect solution. I just open the basement door and the light pops on - then stays on for 1 minute before turning itself off.  And, although the fixture is at the top of the stairs, it's bright enough to illuminate the whole stairwell!
5.0	Very nice and substantial handleset.  Opperates very smooth.  Fully reversible lever & smart key feature make installation a snap.  Bottom of handle requires drilling through the door to mount.
5.0	Panasonic makes the best and quietest vent fans. Truly whisper quiet and it moves a ton of air. Sure you can find cheaper vent fans but they won't be nearly as quiet and still move this much air.
5.0	For years, we have put up with low water pressure (it's the water company which wasn't willing to upgrade their ability to provide high pressure with new pipes in this rural area), including for our shower.  Then, I found this showerhead on Amazon and decided to give it a try.    I have no idea how it works, but it somehow makes the amount of water that comes out of the showerhead greater and more forceful.  It's been such a boon, and we love it!
5.0	Works well and fits.<br />As advertised.
5.0	Home Depot wants an arm and leg for this s-paper, so if you can get free shipping it makes for a great deal. Does everything you want it to do. (Suggestion, keep a bit of good used s-paper but throw out the rest or it will take over your shop. I think it reproduces when you are not looking).
5.0	I needed some rainbow makers for prizes for my Sunday School class.  These fit the bill admirably.  I was impressed that the mailing fee was moderate as opposed to others who dinged you $100 for shipping.  I have been looking for these for over a year. Thank you . Thank you<br />lb
5.0	I use this to see when I tweeze.  I can bend it in any direction and it makes the job much easier.
5.0	This thermostat is very user-friendly and nice looking.  Before installing, we read the instructions and watched the installation video.  Both were very easy to understand and helpful.  I think it only took an hour for us to take down our old thermostat and install this one, and the bulk of that time was finding our C wire in the wall.  Once the wiring was all connected, programming the thermostat and setting up our online account was very fast and easy.  I'm very happy with this purchase.
5.0	Looks and works Great!
1.0	Super cheap looking and very spaced out.  If you combine it with a fuller curtain it might work.  Returned it.
5.0	I purchased this with it's matching border for my daughters room, it is fun, bright and very easy to work with.
5.0	It's perfect, and such a good price too.
5.0	I can reach all my kitchen shelves now and find it handy in other rooms.  It rolls (&then stays) nice.  It is well construted and nice looking.
5.0	This little remote programmed quite easily with my yellow button Sears Craftsman garage door opener.<br />It works from a good distance (~45ft).<br /><br />Also it flies! No, just kidding, but it is pretty cool.
5.0	After nearly burning through a billow with a very hot halogen bulb, I searched for an alternative for our headboard lamp fixture. These bulbs serve as the perfect replacement. They not only fit perfectly, they also are perfectly bright without any heat.
5.0	Yes they are plastic, but great quality and look real nice on the jewelry cabinet.
5.0	Amazing product! Looks great in our game room. Would definitely buy from this company again.
5.0	I replaced my 10 inch sink that was only 5 inches deep,in our travel trailer and this is a major upgrade to the (kitchen).Quality and finish is excellent.Perfect design for a camper sink. Very happy with purchase.
5.0	SWAG! Just what I needed!
5.0	I bought a bottle of this excellent polish to get rid of the haze on a clear gloss varnish I used on a piece of wood. I wasn't sure if it would work, but I followed the directions and was surprised at how quickly the shine came up, the haze disappeared, and the result looks very professional. There is enough of the cream to do a number of jobs, and will probably last me for years to come. Excellent product, really easy to use and extremely quick to reach the desired results. Works much better than 1500 to 2500 grit sandpaper, extra fine steel wool, or any other method I have used in the past. If you are looking to take that gloss wood finish the last ten per cent to perfect, try this burnishing cream. It works really great.
5.0	Great for adding high power led bulbs to candelabra bases.  Had no issues installing them and they feel sturdy!
1.0	The prongs are too thin and weak to clean any amount of dirt from any file. A complete waste of money, but also too inexpensive to benefit from returning.
5.0	Nice compact wireless doorbell ( plus other sounds) set. 1 used batteries, the other plugs in to outlet. I like all the options for the settings, I am just going thru them before I mount the doorbell outside. Also reasonable price.
5.0	Every time my ice maker dies, it turns out I just need a new filter. This one is easy to install and does the job. Cheaper than Home Depot, too. This time I bought a spare so I will be ready next time!
5.0	For the single T12 (not T8) 48&#34; fixture in my pantry, I wanted to convert it to LED. You can't use these directly in a T12 fixture with the ballast intact (though you can in most T8 fixtures). You have to rewire the fixture, which is really better as it's more efficient and the ballast is gone. This turned out to be really simple. My fixture already had 2 wires connected to one tombstone, and 3 to the other. With power off I cut the wires to the Ballast, joined all 3 wires at one end to the white neutral wire, and then both wires at the other end to the black &#34;hot&#34; wire using wire nuts. That's it. It was really quick and worked great. The only &#34;problem&#34;, if you can call it that, is there were no included instructions, and I also couldn't find any markings on the tube to tell you which end is the &#34;+&#34; (hot), or &#34;-&#34; (neutral) end for direct wiring like this. I guessed that the end near the large silver label was the &#34;+&#34; which was correct. The best part is the light is &#34;instant on&#34;, extremely bright, lights up the whole room up to the ceiling, and has a white, near sunlight color like my other 5000K lights around the house. This product couldn't be better.
5.0	2nd try with this part, installed the whole unit instead of just the fuse, since replacing just the fuse, like others have reported, only lasted about a month.
5.0	It is illegal in my state to leave an unattended firearm in a motor vehicle, but there are times when it is the safer alternativve to carrying. This is a solidly built, secure means of storing your weapon. It holds my full-sized Glock. It has a padded interior and most importantly, slides easily under the seat where it is out of sight and easily secured. Tuffy makes an under seat gun safe but it doesn't fit my 2012 JK.  This slides right between the seat rails and is secure and easily accessed.
5.0	This product was exactly as advertised.  It took me all of 10 minutes to install it, and works perfectly.  I bought 4 of them, and have already installed 2 of them.  Highly recommended.
1.0	Doesn't take much out of my city water. Ran a bunch of tests, both tap water and filtered tested the same. What a gimmick.
5.0	Works great!  I have this outside next to the front door.  Using the Tasker app on my android phone, I have it set up so that it will automatically turn the light on for 5 minutes after I arrive home between 9pm and 6am.  Now I no longer have to find the right key in the dark since it works beautifully.  It has lasted outside through multiple storms too.  It was well worth the investment.
5.0	well made and reasonable cost. I use them for hearthside cooking.
5.0	All of roommates decals are amazing and excellent quality.
5.0	Heavy duty warehouse ready fan. Comes all set with the safety cable and hanger. Excellent design of the two shrouds for quick and neat install.
1.0	Worked for 5 days, not even on 24 hours a day, perhaps the light is on 5 hours a day max, and BAM it stopped working.  What a waste of money - when I can find some time I'll send this junk back!
5.0	Super easy to set your personal combination. Sturdy TSA approved lock to keep your luggage secure while in transit. My oldest daughter once traveled across country and when she arrived, someone had stolen her dental retainer! Really?  We were pretty shocked and even more shocked to find out the airlines don't really seem to care if items are stolen from your suitcases. I had to shell out another $400 to have another retainer made.  Now when we travel, we always lock our bags. I like that these locks let you know if someone has used a key to open it. In reality, if a thief wants to steal something from your luggage, they could just cut the lock, but these at least give you an extra measure of security.<br />Update 8/10/15: On a recent trip someone in baggage handling or a TSA employee removed the lock and kept it. Nothing in my suitcase but dirty laundry so why they would need to take the lock I have no idea. Another reason to always put your valuables in your carry on bag.
5.0	Very flexible and easy to work with. Very nice wire. It worked perfectly for my application. Buy it and you won't be disappointed.
5.0	This is the same product that sells in the &#34;Big Box Stores&#34; at about the same price. Manufactured by Mason.<br />I'm writing this review mainly to rebut the two star review given by .....someone else.<br />When performing any electrical additions or repairs it is imperative that one knows what one is doing. Before attempting any electrical service. The &#34;other reviewer&#34; obviously knew nothing about the NEC or proper electrical connections to mains voltage. They should stick to &#34;solar powered, stick 'em in the ground lamps, both for their safety and future repairman's safety.<br />Review:<br />This is an extremely well built product that will last for decades, and only need to have the lamp replaced occasionally, the fixture is very heavy with an enclosed glass envelope around the bulb. The housing is a cast metal with an enameled finish, dark brown, medium gloss. Just right in my opinion. It attaches with standard threads for a 1/2&#34; riser, either grey pipe or galvanized. I would use the grey pipe to prevent electrolysis, unless you needed a very tall pipe and the stability that comes with galvanized pipe. This should be mounted on top of a (waterproof) Junction box which is approved for exterior applications. If you don't understand this, get an electrician to do it for you......<br />Bulb / lamp life: Because the bulb is completely enclosed within the glass, (think of a bulb within a bulb) a high wattage incandescent bulb will burn out relatively fast because of the heat generated and contained within the enclosure. The three tiered model has a maximum rating of 75 Watt bulb. Using a smaller wattage will make the bulb last much longer. An LED bulb would be economical and practical purchase. Long life and little energy consumption, win, win situation.<br />This is a fantastic metal product in a world of cheap plastic throw away in a year lights. It's not as easy to install as a self contained solar lamp, but it will last longer and provide anextremely wide / diverse choice of lighting options from soft warm glow to bright white depending on the wattage / type of bulb used.
5.0	It was very easy to install (I already had a deadbolt in my door), and the instructions were complete.  The lock itself is easy to program with new combinations, it works like a charm, and is very heavy and substantial.  The only, and this is minor, drawback is that it is very hard to hear the beeps and clicks the lock makes; I live on a busy street and street noise is substantial.  Nevertheless, once you know how the thing works, you don't really need the cues that the beeps provide.<br />This lock means that I can have a safe way to let in friends who are visiting, kids home from college, workers, and ME WHEN I LOCK MYSELF OUT.  I don't know how I ever lived without it!
5.0	Really brings the furniture to life, pleasant odor.
1.0	I am giving the Amber Glass turtle a one star.  The amber glass pattern of speckles is only on part of the glass shade.  I feel it was of second quality.  I know this because we had a Amber glass table Lamp just like this ( I broke the shade)  and the speckles covered the entire glass shade.<br />Not very happy.
1.0	I ordered this faucet for my tub, been in the house 7 weeks and still not able to use my bath tub because of the faucet.  The inner pipes are very fragile. They were willing to replace them which they did, however the 2nd once did not hold up either.  Took to local plumbing store to see if they had something we could use in place but the fittings do not fit together as most faucets.  Loved the look of it but cannot connect it to our plumbing.  Giving up and having to order a whole new faucet.  They are not willing to give us our money back because of the time elapsed in the whole process!!  Would not recommend.
5.0	Purchased this belt for my teenage son.  He love it.  He received comments the first time he work it.  Definitely recommend it for the impressionable teen.
1.0	Very poor quality and broke right away.
5.0	I almost never leave a review. This product is one of the few exceptions. It really works. My two labs and a border terrier have used this since day on. Very easy to install and is made well. Sometimes it doesn't close all the way at the very bottom but that is because I should have installed it a tad higher. The sticky backed Velcro really sticks and I hesitate to take it off just to move it up 1/2&#34;. If you are looking at products like this and are unsure, I think you would find this a good choice. Enjoy.
5.0	I triedd many, and some costing alot more, this one fit, works, and lasts. The others all broke within a few months, this one goes on and on.
5.0	"My husband is 6'4\\"" tall. After a stay at a Holiday Inn that featured this product he was sold. We ordered one for our bathrooms at home and for our vacation home in the mountains. Everyone Loves It!!"
5.0	very sturdy, and doesn't shift or wobble around like I worried it would.  I bought a pair, but turns out I really only need one, If I'm the only one up there.  My roof is so steep I wouldn't try anything without these, or some repelling gear, Ha-Ha!  Quality product.  I recommend this for anyone who has a use for one.
5.0	I've had the faucet for over a year now and it works like the day I bought it, period.  Bold look, easy to clean.
5.0	Necessary hard to find part if you are assembling a smoking pipe! I buy as many as I can find!
5.0	I've been using this for about a month to control a grow light for a plant in my office. It has been working very well -- reliable, and simple. I debated getting this or a fancy digital timer, but the simplicity of this one won. I'm not a huge fan of fiddling with digital timers and all the settings they offer.<br /><br />I haven't noticed any clicking or other noises that other reviewers have mentioned. It sits right behind my monitor, so I should notice it making strange noises.
5.0	Love the touch feature!  Color is a perfect accent to my new counter.  Seems to be well-made and easy care (only been installed 2 weeks).
5.0	These are fantastic!  It is realism without the danger of fire.  The remote works well.  Shipping time was much less than originally stated and they arrived in perfect condition.
5.0	I succumbed to the temptation of buying the Danze opulence copper fixtures set and accessories.  Everyone compliments me on them as soon as they look in the bathroom.  These fixtures made a teensy powder room--which has a shower, lack of space notwithstanding--into something so special that no one remarks on the small space anymore.
5.0	This Superior Tool Basin Buddy will save you from having to take time off work to wait around for a plumber to show up to replace your old kitchen or bathroom sink faucets! And that means you'll save $$$. Because I have a huge kitchen sink, there is limited access underneath where the hoses attach. Basin Buddy works with a standard socket wrench handle (which I had, see photo). Loosened/tightened the plastic fastener thingies and loosened/tightened the steel nuts that connect the hoses to the faucet.
5.0	I bought one first for my 12 year old daughter to clip on her bed and it was perfect. So I bought the second one for the younger daughter. Both of them now can read in bed with bright light. I had one before from ikea but this item is a lot brighter. Just the clip cannot latch on something thick, probably within an inch is fine.
5.0	I heard about this item on television to close a garage door automatically if it is accidentally left open. Easy to replace old one that came with door. And it really works. Takes some getting used to. If you go outside to get mail and end up talking to neighbor, suddenly you hear the warning and then the door closes. Warning is pretty loud and I am still unsure of what it is when I hear it from inside. But now I no longer have to worry about driving away and accidentally leaving the garage door open. That's what I bought it to do and it does just that.
5.0	A nice, simple flue pipe that completes the above roof part of an installation and prevents rain water from entering the flue.
1.0	I purchased 2 for a party through another source.  They both leaked like crazy, so were thrown in the trash.
5.0	It was much smaller than I expected but it works great, lots of torque.
5.0	I love them plan t make my own blinds and they are excellent for the job.
5.0	I was certain I had 5&#34; gutters.  I was wrong.  So I went to Home Depot and bought waterproof 3/4&#34; x 3/4&#34; trim moulding, and set that on top of the gutter mounting brackets.  Works well, though a 3/4&#34; x 1&#34; would probably have been even better.<br /><br />Installation could not be any simpler - push the rear of guard in, up against the back of the gutter (or in my case, the moulding piece), then push down on the front lip of the guard and it snaps in place.<br /><br />I have river birch trees that drop tiny seedlings, and they always fell through the prior guards I used and I was still up cleaning the gutters twice a year.  The through holes in these guards are small enough that I will no longer have that issue.  These guards can also handle a decent load, so I think I'll be good as far a snow loading.  Only question is how long the plasic with hold up to sun loading / temperature extremes / snow loading.  They may become brittle over time.<br /><br />I'm very pleased so far, and ordered more.
5.0	Originally, after reading many reviews, I purchased this bulb to start seeds in Grodan starter cubes for my hydroponic grow system. Although the bulb was larger in real life than I realized, it did fit nicely into my reflector, although it does protrude quite a bit. The light is very bright and the seedlings did well with it. I would recommend it to anyone. A great bulb at a great price. The only negative  I noticed is that if you screw it into a reflector like I did, you have to be careful and turn it holding the white part closest to the threaded end. If you turn it on the lower section below the green stripe, the bulb base came apart on mine. I just snapped it back together and it works fine. I have used it off and on a few months with no problem. I have also used this bulb when I take close up pictures of items that I sell. It is nice and bright and leaves no shadows, really a nice day light color to the photos. So it is good for that too.
5.0	These work great and are a good price.
5.0	Perfect signs and convenient roll
5.0	works well and looks great
5.0	Works great<br /><br />Had to connect a clamp to a glass door- It worked as promised. I would buy this item again
5.0	I live in a Townhouse with no back yard so not walking the dogs at night is NOT an option. On my night walks I would usually not carry a flashlight because it was so cumbersome, especially with two dogs. I ordered this mainly because I liked the flashing red light on the back of it. I didn't realize how much I would really like it until I got it. It's very small and lightweight. Smaller than I had imagined, but it is still just as bright as a regular flashlight. It's also very easy to hold. I love that it has one light that aims straight and one that aims down at your pup. It brightens up the floor where you are walking and you can easily aim it at your pup if she is in the grass. I have already spotted a few (toxic) frogs that I would have otherwise not seen. I actually love using this.   I highly recommend this flashlight for anyone who walks their dog at night.
5.0	Wonderful quality, simple to install and so easy to change roll.
5.0	We purchased this light for our dog yard. I am amazed at the amount of light it produces. We will order several more. I was very happy with my purchase and will buy from this vendor again.
5.0	Genie no longer supports the garage door opener I have. Liftmaster does. Easy to program, easy to install. I highly recommend it.
5.0	My daughter is so fascinated with her growth whenever she goes to a doctors appointment.<br /><br />She absolutely loves and frequently uses this.  The chart reinforces the measurement skills in she is working on in school.<br /><br />Easy to use and you can get creative with how you place it on the wall.
5.0	Nice quality, nice weight. Bought as a present for a little one who was thrilled with it, particularly the little fairy figure which is part of the base.  Only wish is that the bulbs came with the lamp.
5.0	Good light switch and dimmer toggle has enough resistance to where accidentally hitting it a little while turning on light doesn't affect/adjust it.
1.0	I received this switch and it is yellowed from sun exposure or whatever.... I was going to use it with a bank of switches, but I will not use it due to the yellowing of the switch. Why would they mail this out to customers when there's obviously a problem? Even the packaging was discolored. I will be returning it.
5.0	This is a great product and is made very well! Great price too, I would definitely reccomend this to anyone.
5.0	This was easy to install and arrived in a timely manner. I'm not thrilled about AAA batteries over the longer lasting 9V, but we shall see how it goes. Thanks
5.0	It's quiet.  Its revolution rate for cold fused dichroic glass art is perfect.  After 24 hrs.+ of constant running it is only slightly warm, which makes me think it will last a long time.
5.0	Just tried this oil yesterday and am 100% satisfied.  While other oils have a distinct  smell  this has none at all.  Burns clean  with no soot  and no smell  , Its the best you can buy.  I'LL never even consider another oil  and I'm  sure  no one else will after trying this product.  Those  Lamplight wicks work great too.
5.0	Using these in several closets. Works really well and no wiring or fuss. East to install.
5.0	Well made, easy to fit and makes door look good, Matches colour of Han Solo Carbonite door wrap to my toy, sorry, Office room
5.0	just what you need when you want to clamp one probe or both, for the price well worth it.
5.0	I recently bought my home and it came with a quality bathroom except for the drain.  Now it's perfect.  Quality item. Thanks!
5.0	Nice -looks much better than regular light bulb- it does cast a very yellow light- overall nice for a lamb that shows the bulb
5.0	it's the greatest and what a time saver.  I love it.
1.0	LED work light stopped functioning after six weeks of usage.  While a warranty claim was in order, I could not justify a two-hour round trip to the service center across town.  Nine months later, I was near by the center and got a replacement.  We will see how long this one lasts.    A few weeks after my work light stopped working, I attempted to report my problem on the Milwaukee Web site, only to discover the CAPTCHA would not confirm and blocked my submission.  A CAPTCHA is the human interpretation of some twisted letters included with a submission.  So, I called the support folks and asked them to send me a mailing label.  The first support person refused my request and told me to use the web site.  The second support person, supposedly the first person's supervisor,  agreed to send me the label and took all the relevant information.  I informed both support persons of my problem with the CAPTCHA.  The label never arrived and the CAPTCHA remains broken.  (Please inform Milwaukee of this review, if the CAPTCHA is working for you.)    I own a number of Milwaukee products and enjoy their innovation.  Sadly, their customer support needs improvement.  I suggest you investigate the customer support of any line of tools, before you invest.
5.0	This is a wonderful night light and I have purchased more - so now I have them throughout my house.  I recommend them highly.
5.0	Looks gorgeous in my rooster themed kitchen!
5.0	nice, and fast elivery
5.0	Great knobs - finish matches other Amerock items.  I used these on bifold doors and I have used other Amerock items before - pulls, hooks, etc.
5.0	I used this to replace a smoked transformer in a 5 light 12volt halogen track light.  It fit perfectly, installed in about 20 minutes and saved my landlord 300 bucks on a new fixture.
1.0	Received bulb that didn't work.
5.0	Very cute. Used it to cheer up  my kid's room. It sticks well but can be moved easily. Would definitely buy again
5.0	This is one of the best kitchen faucets that I've ever used. As simple to install as any other and the counter weights work well in keeping the pull out head retracted when not in use.
5.0	This is an excellent product to turn the light on as you enter the room.  The sensitivity and duration time are both adjustable.  It is a very good device for older, handicapped or anyone who needs a light so that they do not have to search for the light switch.
5.0	Used for bundling my wiring.
5.0	I got this a little over a month ago and it has worked flawlessly. I have 14 things connected to it (6 outlet controllers, a door sensor, moisture sensor, two wi-fi cams, and 4 smoke or CO detectors).  After suffering through a truly awful, unreliable Smarthome system, I couldn't be happier.
1.0	It did not fit my door!
5.0	This is a gorgeous light and it was offered at an excellent price.  I am very pleased and will recommend it to friends.
5.0	Fits on our kenmore fridge, just has the extra steps of submerging it in water for 15 mins and flush it out with 20 cups of water after installation. I think it is worth it, since it is cheaper & eco friendly than the other brands we use. It tastes like what we did use, so it is good to save. Will buy again.
5.0	Good product.  I used it to fill some cracks in my insulation.  Would recommend it.
5.0	"Very well made, they hold a 48\\"" butcher block bar top directly to my masonry kitchen wall with tapcons.  I Couldn't be happier."
1.0	This is not a product I would recommend.I never even got it on my wall.It was stuck too much to the sheet it was on,so when I went to transfer it,it wouldn't come off the sheet,crinkled up,and was basically ruined.A serious waste of money!! It actually comes in two sheets,but they give you one transfer sheet.Looks good in the picture,but that's about it.
5.0	Very happy. As advertised.
5.0	Great quality - heavy.  Only came with one key, though.  Arrived in a very timely manner.
5.0	I have no complaints with the product.<br />I just wish there was a option to buy it with more filters.
5.0	This shower head is amazing and screws right on to any shower assembly so unscrew the old and screw in the new. It's nice, durable,  lights work great, looks sleek and even works on cheaper plastic shower heads. The best part is the water it doesn't hurt it conserves energy and is just amazing. I have health problems at 32 years old and have a wife and 7 year old daughter ans 2 year old son. For the last year showers have been miserable because it hurts so bad the cheap white shower head with no settings sprayed hard and with my trigger points under my skin it always felt like bee stings. Now I take showers for a long time and even in the dark sometimes ans they don't hurt. The different settings are amazing and you can even turn the flow off to conserve while you lather and stuff. Anyway enjoy it's amazing
5.0	Basic shower head that just works great. It is NOT low flow can definitely tell.. if you like long showers.<br />I paid under 25$ and this is just an unbeatable shower head in that price range.  Not like the cheapo &#60;50$ ones I've had in the past.  I gave this 5 stars because of its incredible value  if you had to pay 50$ I'd drop to 4 stars.
5.0	Recently received this light.  It was easy to install, and works great.  It's  light is comfortable intensity to achieve the visibility needed, and goes out again in a reasonable period of time.
5.0	The warranty that comes with this product it's very impressive. If the product brakes they will come out and fix it apparently. The installation was super easy...almost too easy! I somehow want to tighten it more, but there doesn't seem to be any need. It sits snugly and there is no leakage. We'll see how long it lasts!
5.0	I bought this as a gift for my spiderman loving friends and she loved it. Its been on her wall for a while now and does not show any sign of coming off.
5.0	This ladder/stool is the best thing anyone can have.  You can finally balance on a high step with plenty of room to shuffle your feet, it's a platform.  The weight is lighter than my light weight 6' ladder. You feel secure on this ladder, it hold tools, paint cans, drawers for screws.  This is the ladder.
5.0	worked in my AC unit.  Had to buy a dual run (3-Prong) capacitor separately
5.0	These are really awesome to hold everything you need for the shower.  I probably have about 10 pounds of products in this caddy and it doesn't budge.  I also take really hot, steamy showers and the strips stick like they are put on with cement.  I'm sure after awhile, they will fail; but I've had this for almost 6 months now and it is still sticking strong!  Would highly recommend!
5.0	Works for Me..<br />Thanks
5.0	Would like this to put over her bed to set to small lamps. It is beautiful and it suits us perfectly. The construction is very solid and the mounting supplies were very adequate. I would suggest this piece to anyone.
5.0	"This seems to be a bit of an odd duck when it comes to watch batteries. It's a small thin cell and I needed one to replace the battery on my \\""Titan Edge\\"" an extremely thin quartz watch. I checked out 5 stores locally and even my jeweler, but could find none. I finally went here at Amazon and found it. After removing the case back and the old battery I put in the 346 and everything was fine. I'm glad to have found it here, and the price was low. Changing out your own batteries saves time, a bit of money and is relatively easy to do."
5.0	Bought unit via Amazon from Garage Intel Inc. to replace board that seemed to be fried by recent lightning storm The unit was shipped by USPS Priority and arrived in 3 days. Unit actually has both the logic board and the metal face plate included. (I had only expected the logic board that is attached to the metal face plate by 5 screws. When installed, the unit worked and fixed the problem.<br /><br />Only issue I ran into has nothing to do with the board itself or vendor but rather installing the board to the connector wired into the main unit. It is tough the see or feel and get it attached. I had to unscrew board from metal face plate to get my fingers in and be able to slide connector on the board pins; then replaced screws after board was connected.
5.0	This is the easiest edging to use. All you need is a hot iron and you are ready to go. I have used it on plywood and MDF. Sands and paints great.
5.0	Great little safe.  It is big enough for my important valuables and small enough to keep in a discrete place.  Very, extremely heavy.  You wouldn't want to transport it unless you had to.
5.0	Fit well in my range hood, protruding only slightly more than the 50W halogens they replaced. The light provided is much brighter than the halogen floods. Works in both the low and high switch positions. Highly recommend.
1.0	Never turned on. My son ordered it and was so disappointed.  Reuturned. Only plus was it was refunded quickly.
5.0	Needed something taller than a 2-3 step stool but didn't want a regular ladder; already had a similar lightweight ladder for our garage but wanted one to keep in our house. It is perfect for the vast majority of tasks that require getting up to them and it has a nice tray at the top to hold things (tools, lightbulbs, etc.) while you're working. When folded it is very thin so it can stand up in a narrow vertical space, and it is very light but stable and sturdy.
5.0	Works perfectly. Great for connection that do not require surge protection, e.g. wireline connection.
5.0	I love this lamp.The colors are gorgeous and the quality of the bowl and stones is excellent.
5.0	Good quality general purpose masking paper at a very reasonable price
5.0	Works perfectly.<br />Very good price.<br />Fitting may require some effort but after that you are good to go.<br /><br />Bettter than the PureClean one which I bought earlier and returned.
5.0	It worked and fit great. Part was hard to find in the hardware store. Thaks Amazon.com.
5.0	I ordered this shade for a very little lamp that I will use in my kitchen.<br />It's exactly what I was looking for and looks just like the picture.<br />Very classy with a little sass.  Delivery took a couple of weeks, a<br />little longer than I thought it would take.  But all in all everything is good.
5.0	I read a few poor reviews about this vacuum so I was not really sure of what to expect. I can't understand anyone swearing that this item does not work. It works great. Yes the accessories can loosen up during usage but only if not inserted properly. It's only a matter of using a little force and twisting to get each one to stay on. If I, with my 100lbs structure and tiny hands can do it so can anyone else. The suction is strong, it is light weight enough to hold with one hand. It is electric therefore will run as long as you want it to run. The cord is plenty long and can be added to an extension cord if needed. Nothing out of the ordinary. It is an electrical accessory and working just as described. Great tool to have on hand. Buy it!!
5.0	This cross looks beautiful at night.  Unfortunately we could not keep it at the cemetery, so I purchased a tree in my loved ones honor and added the cross stake.  It is beautiful.
5.0	I used these to hang 40 lb paintings, and they worked fine.
5.0	So far very pleased.Have used them for 3 months with no burn outs.Previously replacing frequently! Good bright light.
5.0	Installed these in my kitchen.  Work great.  Used a Wi-Fi remote as the included IR remote is sometimes hard to aim.
5.0	Easy to use and apply, but covers less than advertised.  About 60 square feet.  Dont buy the expensive drylock bristle brush for 40 bucks.  Go to home depot and get the same thing for $8.00.<br />I had some water seepage in my basement and a lot of excess humidity.  Applied this stuff as directed and the humidifier now accumulates nothing at all and the walls are dry.<br />We also prepped with drylok etch and applied the drylok paste at the floor/wall junction.  Very simple, very easy and a cheap, effective solution to a vexing problem.<br />Dont pay for some contractor to rip you off for a bunch of money.  Follow the simple instructions on the web site PDF manual and save a bundle.
5.0	"This cord reel is anything but basic.  Yes, you might have to guide the cord in the last few feet once and a while, but come on, stop crying.  If your that lazy you should have stayed on the \\""lazyboy\\"".  This is a great home shop cord reel without paying 300 to 400 dollars for the top of the line reel.  Very high quality and works like it should. Easy to hang with a #12 cord at hand when you need it.  I have had this reel for a few months now and have used it almost daily with no issues.  Great cord reel for the money.  The jury is still out on how it works in the cold.  I turn the furnace on when it gets that cold, so I might not ever find that out."
5.0	My wife uses these extensively for upholstery work and they fit correctly in her air stapler.
5.0	This light is beautiful! And besides that, it's beneficial.  I keep mine on all the time and it adds a warmth and softness to my office everyone enjoys. The best of &#34;mood&#34; lamps, this one always makes me feel a quiet joy and peace. The shape is ancient and timeless, so it's very form lifts the mind to higher places.<br /><br />It is a lighter shade of pink so it glows a brighter light yet it still is soft on the eyes. The wooden base it sits on adds an elegance and quality other lamps don't offer. It's a valued aspect of it for me.<br /><br /> If you want a presence in your room that is attractive, warm, luminous, beneficial and ever so satisfying, I recommend this salt lamp.
5.0	Very simple installation. Great customer service.
5.0	Great Fixture. Unitary customized my order and it was delivered quickly and as expected. Works great and was easy to put up
5.0	Exactly what I wanted
5.0	I bought this from Amazon to fit my unitized washer and dryer. It works perfectly!!! I'd defn recommend to others, esp. at this price.
5.0	great MACHINE @ A GREAT PRICE AND WITH A GREAT SELLER, BY THE WAY THANKS!
1.0	Not easy to install, had to send it back!
5.0	I received this lamp to review at a super discount price and I am thinking about ordering another at the full price because I adore it so very much! It has 3 different light settings and the neck can be bent and contorted in every different direction! It is perfect for reading and I can adjust the position so that it doesn't shine in my hubbies face like my book light tends to do. And best of all it is cordless so I can put it nearly anywhere. I just love this little light and give it two huge thumbs up!
5.0	If you want a heavy gauge cord this is it!  It is very solid and looks well made.  didn't have a problem using my snow thrower with it.
5.0	Far less costly than what is available in the stores, and is the same item as was professionally installed years ago.
1.0	I've used Schalge locks before but I figured I'd try these because of the substantial price different; they aren't worth it.  These were a lot louder, the buttons were extremely stiff, the master code didn't always work, the installation was more difficult and didn't come with all the pieces you needed if you had a different type door (Schlage came with other options).  I returned these right away for Schlage locks.
5.0	I moved into an old house with a dirt basement. I could not get rid of the smell of dirt coming thru the heat registers. I bought this product and cut to size for each vent... No more smell!! I am very happy:)
5.0	Love this faucet, it loos great, works great! At first was a little hesitant to purchase because of the low price and only one review but glad I did.
5.0	I adore this product! I love everything in its place especially in a work setting and this piece does the trick well.. I am a working mom with home office and the kids always go for my Ipad. With this product, I know where it is at all times as it is out of the kids reach! It also gives me extra lighting support as my eye sight is challenged on a daily basis...
5.0	Perfect for our very dark house and our nursery. We have one in every room!
5.0	My faucet handle broke off and this is the exact part I needed to fix it. It comes with instructions and is easy to install. I will buy this<br />part again if needed.
5.0	Top of the price range but the features make it worth it.  The installation was a breeze, the set up is easy and the solar timer works perfectly.  One of the true joys of this timer is it never needs a battery.  It is wired in a way that it works well with CFL bulbs and well as LED.  We have had this for several weeks and it works flawlessly.
5.0	We are very happy with our purchase. The lamp is a nice addition to our family room. It was packaged quite well. I would recommend this lamp. It looks even more beautiful than the picture.
5.0	I did a remodel a couple of years ago and did not install knobs until I found these to match the same ones I had in my house.  Great Shipping and arrived as prommised.
5.0	We remodeled a bathroom and used this sink.  We have received numerous compliments on the sink.  I highly recommend.  It has a good base so I don't have to worry about a grandchild pulling on edges.
5.0	My lights arrived quickly and securely packaged;  not a single bulb broken.  They are just what I expected and am very happy with them.  I may purchase another set once I decide how I want the deck to look.
1.0	I was told it would work on my model door opener and it will not
5.0	Easy to install.  Works great.
5.0	Used this to replace an outlet in the kitchen. Everyone loves it. It was pretty simple to install, and provides a convenient place to charge phones, tablets, etc.
5.0	Bought it 3 years ago and has been a great disposal, never a problem, I'm a little late writing this review.
5.0	Lost a good flashlight during camping, wanted to try this to see if it met the hype. It does. Nice bright light, compact flashlight  -small enough to keep in car etc. Will buy more
5.0	I am very please with this product. It went up easy and looks great!
1.0	light not bright and batteries run out quickly i had to replace it already twice and the sticky on back doesnt stick well especially to metal
5.0	Exactly like its description, very pretty. Great value for the price.
5.0	When I placed the order I was told it was in stock, I later received an e-mail saying this item was out of stock. The company kept me informed during the processing of my order.  The product was well worth the delay in shipping. Easy to install.  <br /> <br />Roger P Pizio
5.0	Great showers now.  Better pressure than my previous water pik shower head.  I noticed instantly the difference, during my shower and after.  Skin and hair is soft and not ashy.  Lotion not required.  Now this is wager the first day.  Even my husband noticed the difference....the install, it was more difficult to remove the old shower head.  Great product for the money.
5.0	A very nice little piece of machinery.  I will not bring my dog to a groomer, I don't find them necessary.  This is YOUR dog, YOU wash it.  This dryer really does the job!  It is warm without every getting too hot and has an amazing strength to it.  Dry your golden retriever in 10 minutes!
5.0	Watco goes on easily- you only need a little. And because it's in liquid form you can apply just what you need. It buffs up beautifully. Not too much sheen with two coats. No more bowling alley wax for us!
5.0	Was the right part easy to buy,price was great,did not had to purchase it from Germany which would had cost me a third more.Good experience!😄 Hubert
5.0	Beauty and function in one.  First, it arrived in a foam casing that was fit for the crown jewels. Even my builder commented on its protection.  Secondly, the plumber installed it with ease without incident.  The house is not even finished and we are getting comments on it already.  Great product Whitehaus!
5.0	These are PERFECT for my cane tip and my purpose...
5.0	We needed a replacement for an older lamp after an unplanned fall off the stairs by a new kitten.  It was what we needed and arrived perfectly intact.  This style is hard to find now so letting my fingers do the walking over my iPad was so easy!  Nancy Day
5.0	Has huge variety of sounds, including Christmas music.  Really good price for what you get compared to other stores I checked with.
5.0	We took a chance and purchased two of these from Amazon after seeing one in a showroom.  Came via UPS fright with a lift gate and were packed well on a pallet.  They were installed by our plumber without issue.  No issue with power as it was preplanned when building the homes. They are much nicer than an add-on washlet, much cheaper than retail.  The toilet lid automatically opening scared our contractor when he checked out the throne room.  The only downside is that you will refuse to use a &#34;regular&#34; toilet ever again.  Go for it!
5.0	Looks great for with our fan for our 20 ft FR.
5.0	works great with the LED!!
5.0	My husband and I were frustrated not to find the two year warranty product any longer available locally,  He thought I was crazy for ordering the product online, because it was a little more expensive than the two year warranty product was locally.  He grumbled all the way to the lattice and fence we were updating.  It wasn't long before he was bragging about it like he had found it himself!  The honey coloring really makes the fence and lattice both look new again!!  We both noticed that this product has a three year warranty  and we hope we can continue to find this available.  Thompson's needs to advise the large box stores that their customers like it so well, that we will purchase on line if necessary.  We're impressed with the product!  Thanks for making this available.
5.0	Works great. I was able to control my pool pump with my Lowes Iris system with this.
5.0	this is a very nice faucet for the price. I love the look of it and it works great. love it
5.0	Looks good. It is easy to install.
5.0	What's not to love about duct tape? And when it doesn't leave residue it's even better!
5.0	I love my captive cable sleeves.  I received my order free of charge to test and rate them. I am using one sleeve to manage the mess of cable behind my entertainment system and one sleeve to manage all of the cords I have running to a previous purchase of cable holder press-ons that I purchased from Captive Cables.
1.0	"Never got to use this \\""Home Pro Soft 'n' Swivel\\"". When I was putting the dusting sheet on, the blue plastic base cracked in several places and rendered it useless. Took some pictures of where it fell apart but I don't know how to load them into this site. Don't throw your money away - buy a better brand name. Of course the manufacturer doesn't put their address or contact information on the package.  Made in China... I should know better, especially one with no contact information on the package!"
5.0	More expensive than the other Litex, but the remote was a much smaller, handy size.  Installation was easy and the fan speeds are more usable than the speeds we originally had on the fan.
5.0	This product surpassed my expectations things don't have to be expensive to work well. Thanks
5.0	My husband loved this gate latch. Easy to install.
5.0	What can I say? Command makes some wonderful products. I live in a hundred year old rental house. The walls are plaster board and the outside ones do not take nails. I use and reuse these. They don't ruin the finish or the walls and hold the amount stated on the original package.<br /><br />Great for holding any cords that fit.
5.0	My husband just finished installing these glass tiles in our kitchen. Love the color- matches perfectly with our accent wall! The glass was a little more difficult to cut to fit the outlets than expected, but would not have wanted any other tile. LOVE LOVE LOVE!
5.0	Great sewing working light for my wife!
5.0	We were having a water flow problem with the refrigerator, but the change filter light was not on.  My service professional told me they are set on a a timer, rather than volume.  Once changed, the flow was improved by 3-4x.
5.0	Great quality and very quick shipping. Looks great! Would order additional items from this seller. Thank you!
5.0	Used this under some laminate flooring I layed. It worked great
5.0	A little bigger than the Cinderella of the same brand. Easier to peel and apply than Cinderella was. Absolutely gorgeous and perfect for my daughter's princess room. I love the little extra stickers that came with it too.
5.0	works exactly as described. I have it placed right behind my 23&#34; widescreen monitor and it lights up my whole desk while giving me access to the LED dimmer just below.
5.0	The title says it all. This thing does its job perfectly. The package even has two wall brackets so i can hang the winder in the front or the back of the house.
5.0	This is my 2nd one of these vacs.  I simply think they are the best utility vac out there.  I've tried so many different kinds and own very expensive shop vacs from Fein, Festool and Jet.  This holds it own and in fact is probably more powerful than all of them.  Mounting to the wall is a breeze and the accessories are top notch.  On my second one, I think I forgot to upgrade the wand extender, so it came with a plastic unit.  It's very nice, way nicer than what you'll get at the local store, but the chrome unit is simply fantastic.  I'm a tool junky and seriously appreciate equipment that is well made and performs as advertised.  If you're in the market for a Vac for shop, garage or wherever - look no further.  I now have one in my garage (orange) and the newest one (silver) in my work shop.
5.0	It's exactly what you'd expect, duct tape strength and colored white.  I used it to fix a cracked fridge drawer and it worked great.  It holds fine and the color kept the redneck repair as subtle as possible.
5.0	Good product, good price at amazon.  I replace my water filter on schedule but I am always surprised how much faster the water is dispensed with the new filter.  I have bought this at amazon for years, never a problem.
5.0	Nice floor lamp behind my recliner but it requires athletic moves to turn it on and off. I plugged it into one of the remote outlets and instantly was gratified. Easy to use and worth it.
5.0	Just as stated! Very easy to install and then - MAGIC - works like a charm. I had a specific question and<br />Made a simple phone call and they walked me right thru my solution...... What a delight! No problems.<br />Great savings for a wonderful system. Thanks so much. Will definitely recommend to friends and neighbors.
5.0	Can't beat the price.
5.0	Fast shipping, reasonably priced. Easy install, looks great and much brighter than I anticipated. Quality product would definitely recommend this to a friend.
5.0	Worked perfectly, was brand new and easy to install.
1.0	after about a month of use, the pads keep slipping off from underneath the chair legs.  The adhesive that keeps the pads joint to the chair legs is not strong enough.  Would not recommend this product.
5.0	Great tool and fast delivery ...
5.0	The Joy Bidet is a delight to use. Personally, I have many of them for years now and have been very reliable and always easy to use. I would definitely advocate the purchase of this product as it works perfectly.
5.0	I like this product so much I bought another set!!!!
5.0	This was a hard to find item at local hardware stores.  I have been using this item for over a year and I am very satisfied that it has served this long.
5.0	Love the lights, wish I could string a whole mess of them together. Two bad you only have a five star rating cause I would give you ten. Very...very....pleased.
5.0	Don't settle for immitations.  This tape does it all (except tape duct work.  (Use the foil sticky stuff for that).  The quality of the sticking and fabric on this tape lasts and lasts.  We use it for everything.  I live on a ranch, and have even used it to create a temporary shoe for my horse.  I recommend it.
5.0	Incredibly easy to install, and once painted, it blended with my wall perfectly!
1.0	This is incredibly cheap and we do not want to use it.  The picture on the site does not clearly represent how cartoonish this arrives.  It also came wrinkled and almost a month after we ordered it.  The directions say to leave it laying flat, but we don't like it.  Trying to return it.  The tree is much smaller than it appears in the image as well.  We'll find something else for our daughter's nursery.
1.0	Don't waste your money. It does not work.
5.0	Am happy with my recent purchase of the Lordear bath hose.  It is working well and is what I was hoping it would be.<br />5 Stars.
5.0	the panel is a little large but the lights are perfect for steps. bright and nice. I want to purchase them again but they're out of stock.
1.0	"Very disapointed because they are made of super cheap shiny plastic. There is nothing \\""Natural\\"" about them. They charge a $20 restocking fee which deters people from returning them."
5.0	I've already seen this item in action, so I knew it was going to be able to perform to my needs.
5.0	The price is the same as at the store.  Love the free shipping.  I had surgary and could not leave my home and I needed to change the filter on my frig.
5.0	This item is exactly what I wanted!!!  thank you for the fast shipping, the item arrived in great condition A++++
5.0	Lots of characters, perfect size and stays stuck to the wall. My 21 month old grandson loves to point to and talk to &#34;Gil,&#34; &#34;Molly,&#34; &#34;Mr. Grouper&#34; and all the rest. Very satisfied with this purchase.
5.0	I tried the Nest and Honeywell before the Ecobee, and this one is hands down the best of the three.  The remote sensors are one of the best features, it helps control the temperature much more efficiently.  Also, the online reporting is terrific.  I've been able to monitor the efficiency of my house after air sealing and adding insulation. I would highly recommend this unit!
1.0	This was soooo much smaller than I figured it would be. I ordered two, but neither of them fit any lamp in our home.
5.0	Easily removed old battery and replaced with this new one. Took a couple seconds for system to recognize it had a new battery. Since replacement, alarm is working perfectly
5.0	It produces a soft full flow.  Our old one felt like needles piercing.  This is such a pleasure and looks nice also!
5.0	Great night lights. They are perfect for what we needed.
5.0	BioBidet offered me an Amazon gift card to write this review, so here we go! I purchased this model over other similar models because I liked that the wand was stainless steel, and that I could sit on the lid without breaking the seat. Overall, I'm quite happy with the purchase.
5.0	Reviewing a simple extension cord is tough... its an extension cord!<br /><br />Its exactly like the one in the picture, and its also just like any extension cord you've seen in your life, but for a great price.<br /><br />Its kind of difficult to tell from the picture, but there are 2 outlets on one side and 1 on the opposite side, which I needed.
5.0	Haven't had the chance to put it in the heater yet, but for the price of a new fan assembly, this is perfect.
5.0	"Very happy with this purchase.  It arrived in a timely manner, in good shape, and ready to go.  It almost has a soothing sound when you sleep.  It can easily become \\""white noise\\"" and takes no time to get used to it.  I would recommend it to anyone.puri"
5.0	This pump was purchased for smaller of 2 sump pits. For 2 years it has transferred water approx 40 feet (8' vertical) through 1/2&#34; pex. This abuse would likely destroy an inferior pump (pun intended).  It doesn't come with a float switch, so consider getting a watchdog float switch add-on for automated use. (Utili-tech's equiv does come with a tether float, but it's worth its weight in plastic and doesn't work 75% of the time)<br />NOTE: Consider purchasing flexible rubber couplers if you're connecting it to your sewer (per code in many states). They make connecting the unit to ABS/PVC  *much* easier.<br /><br />Update: unit is about to be re-assigned for powering a below-sewer utility sink through 20' of 1-1/4&#34; PVC. Update to follow...
5.0	I got this to go with Fern Green Whitetail border to add variety.  They went together very well.
5.0	Gorgeous #1!!  Not surprised--it's a Baldwin!
5.0	The part arrived quickly and when installed, so far works great. The last one we got locally, only lasted a short time.  Had the washing machine for 15 years before it needed a new pump.  That replacement only lasted 3 years.  I hope this one last longer!
5.0	I got this lamp to use on my desk for many tasks. One is doing close up work and carving my clay for pottery. It works perfectly for that. It is built very well and I love the bendability of it also. I believe it will also come in handy for photographing small objects.
5.0	We have owned this for about 4 months.This faucet is very well made the controls are so smooth! I love the fact that it does not aerate the water. Yes it splashes more on full blast, so I turn it down some, and when you want a high volume of water like when you are filling pots of water and cleaning out the sink it's great. The magnetic pull between the spray head and the body of the faucet is just right. As my wife would tell you I am very picky and while I wanted a pre-wash faucet to start with, the quality and functionality of this one has won me over. The only thing I would change would be that the spray pattern is too tight, around the diameter of a golf ball. I would prefer it to be the size of a tennis ball. Still, I would highly recommend this!!<br /><br />Oh, and my 13 year old daughter installed this by herself with only some verbal guidance by me - her dad. I removed the old faucet and it took her about 45 minutes to install the new one.
5.0	Just like I bought them at the store; Great exp. date and work perfectly.
5.0	Part was perfect great fit.
5.0	After reading so many reviews to figure out a good solution to keeping me front garage lights on during the night, I'm so glad I went we these rather than installing photo sensors or socket adapters. These things work perfect and are on and off exactly when I expect them to be!
5.0	These were absolutely gorgeous.  Everyone that has seen them, remark how beautiful they are, and how they compliment the decor in the living room.
5.0	I had a bathroom sink that was always slow and sometimes would even stop. I have tried drain cleaner and a sink plunger. I would get minimal short-term improvements, but the drain would continue to be slow. Because of the installation of the drain, I wasn't able to get an auger down it.    My father recommended that I try the Cobra Cleaning Water Bladder, as he had used it successfully in his home. I viewed it as my last resort.     I'll admit that I was skeptical. I read online reviews to see if there were horror stories of clearing bladder accidents. The only thing that I found was Plumbers trying to dissuade people from trying them. I decided it was either try it or call a plumber. I put the Cleaning Water Bladder down the sink and my wife ran the hose. As soon as the pressure filled up the bladder, it stuck in the pipe and I could hear the water running. It took about 5 seconds to clear out the pipe!    Now the sink is working great! It drains perfectly and it only cost $11!    I would strongly recommend this product with the following caveat: I used this because the drain blockage was isolated to a single sink. A lot of the Plumber's horror stories were due to people trying to clear the main line from outside the house. I would only recommend using this where small pipes got to bigger pipes; otherwise you'd risk flushing a clog deeper into the house.
5.0	This product was perfect for my purpose.  I needed handles that covered existing holes that don't match any of today's products.  It is great quality that looked just like the picture and was shipped quickly.
5.0	I bought this garage door opener as a replacement. It was very easy to program and in full operation in 2 minutes.<br />I recommend this product.
5.0	Part fit perfectly and saved me $80 by me doing it for myself.  Thanks
5.0	The product labels and instructions indicate that this unit should not be used with fountains and such, but only if it in close proximity, I have 3 fountains that have 12 volt transformers that failed over time, so ran low voltage lighting wire from them to this unit located on a wall. Measured the ac out using a RMS voltmeter and was 11.75 volts, and with a timer I can turn off the fountains for extended life. Nice price and performance for what I will use it for.
5.0	oh yeah 1969 all over again, the summer of love, very very groovy, run two next to each other...2001  all over again..
5.0	Works great, Love the swivel top. Stays on! ++++
1.0	**READ THIS** Do not buy at all it will kill your plants from the enormous amount of heat it probuces and its now even a grow light , it just make plants look greener ! THIS PRODUCT IS COMPLETE GARBAGE , IV BEEN ''GROWING'' FOR AROUND 20 YEARS !!!!!!
1.0	Had to return - did not work
5.0	Allowed me to place programmable multicolor LED lights into our china cabinet. The LED lights are a different base size then the sockets in the cabinet. Easy to install.
5.0	These shipped promptly and worked perfectly. I couldn't be happier and the price is right.
5.0	Made it so much easier to plasti dip my rims!
5.0	Good price, great product- this is without a doubt the best scent I've found yet in stick incense, yes it's that good !
5.0	Filters work just fine. Water is clear and tasteless no chlorine at all.
5.0	This item is exactly what I needed for my Christmas tree, and will be perfect when I take it out again when I set up my grow lights for seedlings. The step-on button makes turning on and off otherwise hard to reach plugs a snap.
1.0	If I could give this tape NO stars I would. I used this tape to paint my office which has some very intricate designs. Additionally my paint scheme was a very light/very dark contrast. I taped per the directions along the edges of my wainscott, and then painted my very light wall color being careful to not over soak the paint on the tape, but not using the upmost caution necessary due to the fact that I spent the past two hours taping off the darker portions of my wall, and thinking that the tape would work as was promised. It DID NOT. OMG, what a mess, there is white paint all over where the dark paint is, in little bubbles even after I made trebly sure that the tape was completely sealed along the edge of the wall. Not only that it also peeled up the paper on my DRYWALL right down to the backing, so that now I have to PATCH and repaint my drywall in that spot. This is the worst tape ever put on the market, it's marketed as painter's tape, but is nothing more than glorified masking tape and my painting results show how poorly it works. I am so disappointed, what a waste of money and time.
5.0	Our previous handheld showerhead was so bad it was actually unpleasant to take a shower. For one, it had a habit of &#34;jumping&#34; out of the holder if you used a power setting, like massage, a phenomenon that was both scary and dangerous.  Further, on the spray setting it had an unpleasant &#34;halo&#34; effect where the center of the spray was just empty, and the outside sort of misted so that when you were getting into the shower you got spritzed with cold/cool water, and then once in the shower you had to move around to get under the actual water.<br />None of this stuff happens with our Ana Bath...very powerful, sturdy, settings work exactly as you would expect, and install in 5 minutes with just a wrench.<br />One thing that I didn't read on the other reviews, and it's for sure a bonus, is that you can have both showerheads on at once, and since they are oriented in sort of a staggered/tier configuration (when the handheld is in the holder), it gives you a very full, relaxing shower.<br />I would recommend this product to anyone who is not happy with their current shower setup!
5.0	This set has a great assortment of sizes. I have a use for every size in this set. The bungees are durable and seem to hold up to heat and sunlight well. I will purchase the same brand as a replacement for this set when these bungees come to the end of their useful life.
5.0	This was an easy way to order my bulbs when I ran out so I didn't forget to get them at the store.  The price was competitive and the bulbs arrived intact.
5.0	Excellent product! This product is very inexpensive and I don't have to go all the way to the store to pay for something that cost more.
5.0	This stuff is great for filling/patching holes in wood.  I've been using it for years and it works great. It is, however, very hard when dry so try to get it close to the right level before it sets up.  One of the best pro's for this putty is that you can mix it to whatever consistency you want, thick or thin.  Great stuff!
5.0	Hello All,     I don't usually leave a review on products that I have purchased, but this thermostat has been one of our best investments for our home. Ihe installation was simple.  Just connect a few colored wires and program.  The programming set up was simple and easy to read on the large display.  Buy the Lux TX9000TS! Why bother shopping for any other home thermostat? You won't be dissapointed...
5.0	THIS PLUNGER WORKS GREAT ON THE NEWER TOILETS I SEARCHED FOR A PLUNGER FOR THE NEW TOILETS AND COULDN'T FIND ONE BUT AMAZON HAD IT
5.0	This is the first flashlight I grab when I'm doing most every day things: walking the dogs, need light under the counter, etc.  It's bright enough to light up a room, but not too bright where if you accidentally shine it in someone's eyes, its going to blind them.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Good level of light output<br />Comfortable to hold & small enough to put in your jacket pocket (although I wouldn't want to carry it around all day - but it has a caribener clip on the end, so if you're carrying it a lot, you easily can)<br />Runs on AA batteries, not expensive digital camera batteries (i.e. the CRV123 type batteries)<br />Excellent (and I can't stress this enough, EXCELLENT) battery life.  I bought it about 4 months ago, use it every day for about 25 minutes and the batteries are still going strong.<br />Yellow case so its easy to find.<br />Stands up easily<br /><br />Cons:<br />Not bright enought, at least for me, to go deep in the woods with<br />Could have had one flat side to avoid rolling<br />(admittedly, these are both nitpicky cons, and I haven't had any issues with it rolling since I stand it up)<br /><br />If you're looking for something to go deep in the woods or you need A LOT of light, try this Dorcy [[ASIN:B002OOZERY Dorcy 41-4750 180 Lumen High Flux LED Cyber Light Flashlight with Batteries]].  If you're looking for more of an every day, go out and walk the dogs, looking for something around the house, this is absolutely perfect.
5.0	Love this high quality product, most cost effective water heating solution out there. Easy to install if you are handy and have a brain. Simply slide copper lines into old or new water heater tank, mount it with included hardware, hook up condensate drain (most water heaters already have a drain line near them). Get free cool, dry air and really cheap hot water. Basically, you get 4000 watts of heat for about 600 watts of electricity, with the benefit of about 5000 BTU of cool dry air. On the Gulf Coast where it is hot and humid 9 months out of the year, that is a BIG benefit. My water heater is in a bedroom closet, so I ducted the air from this machine out to the bedroom with parts and air register available at any home improvement store. Very quiet operation. This water heater supplies half my home, including the kitchen, laundry room, and bathroom, and I have never wanted for hot water. We have 7 people in the house, it keeps up!
5.0	Yes it is a bit expensive but it works really well. I installed this for my home garage and it works flawlessly. The ones they sell at Home Depot doesnt work with both electronic and magnetic ballasts.
5.0	great fit  works like you should except  this is my second one and i love it
5.0	My older upright Dyson animal vacuum has one flaw (I don't know if this has been corrected on the newer versions since mine still works great).  I can't use the handheld extension nozzly thingy (sorry, don't know what to call it), with the cord wrapped up neat because it keeps me from detaching it.  And, I'm in a wheelchair so I like to keep the cord as neat and contained as possible.  I keep the vacuum right across from several litter boxes so it is convenient to vacuum the litter particles when they get strewn outside the box.  But, I don't like having to unwrap the cord every day even when the vacuum itself doesn't need to be moved and I just need the nozzle to quickly suck up the stray litter.  So, instead of wrapping the cord on its intended posts, I have two of these set up opposing each other on the wall and wrap the cord on them.  That way I can very quickly, in a matter of seconds, do the vacuuming without dealing with the cord.  And, of course, these are removable so I haven't permanently damaged my cabinet wall.  Maybe there is a better way, but I'm not handy and this works for me.
5.0	Used this to seal around a tub spout pipe and a showerhead fitting when retiling my parent's bathroom.  Easy to use, and definitely adds an extra layer of water protection.
5.0	I love this wall decal, in the room of my soon it's just magnificent
5.0	This is a great assortment of decorative butterflies in various sizes. The body of each butterfly is molded plastic, and the wings are a sort of medium weight glossy paper. I checked and you *can* tear the wings, but not easily – I had to actually try to start a tear on one of them. The colors are bright and vibrant, and the wing patterns vary so you're not stuck with a bunch of boring identical butterflies.<br /><br />The butterflies arrived separated by color into two clear envelopes; in addition to a small magnet on each butterfly, each package contained a sheet of 12 round double-sided sticky circles. The magnets aren't super strong – plenty strong enough to hold the lightweight butterflies to your fridge or other surface, but probably not enough to use them to hold up anything other than the weight of the butterfly itself. The sticky tabs, on the other hand, are super sticky – I tried to move one of the butterflies after sticking it to a wall that has a flat paint on it, and the butterfly came off the sticky tab before the sticky tab came off the wall. I was able to remove the tab without damaging the paint, but it took a little bit of effort and might possibly damage some kinds of paint. You could, of course, use your own mounting tabs instead of the included ones if you wanted to make sure you could remove the butterflies without damaging the surface underneath, though. I did find that the included tabs didn't stick very well to a textured wall painted with some sort of glossy, slippery paint, but NOTHING sticks to the walls in that room.<br /><br />Overall I found these to be a really cute and easy way to add some color and fun to the walls (and refrigerator). At two dozen butterflies for the listed price, this is well worth the purchase.<br /><br />I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review; all opinions are my own.
5.0	Excellent product at a great price
5.0	Not much to say, they work!
5.0	The lights are fantastic. Totally exceeded my expectations.
5.0	Good stuff! Unisex tag applies to this artwork.
1.0	Lamp shades came in two different colors.
5.0	This is great product. Monitor has awesome picture. Camera great at night or daylight. Easy setup. I bought more cameras to go with it. I also ordered the battery packs for the cameras to save on the AA batteries they say to use with it. I highly recommend this camera.
5.0	Took these camping with friends hung them between the trees. They where a hit! Just enough light with out attracting bugs
5.0	Item as described and I used it for high-beam splitters for my retrofit.
5.0	Fits my Kenmore refrigerator and arrived in two days (Prime).
5.0	Good product easy to install and good quality
1.0	I would NEVER recommend this brand of flooring to anyone.  We bought this flooring from Sam's Club to put down in our entire house and it has been nothing but a nightmare from the beginning.  This flooring is CHEAPLY MADE and it's so fragile that the surface cracks easily and crumbles like a cookie when laying it down.  We have wasted so many boards just because they cracked or crumbled, and we hired a professional to take over for us and he still has issues with the surface crumbling.  We finally have decided that we are just going to have to live with some of the damage and go get some wood filler to fill in some of the places where the surface crumbled apart.  Is this really what you want to pay for? ...I wish I'd of known first or I would have never bought it, so I am letting everyone else know what I didn't.  There is cheap flooring out there that is of much better quality -- we had found some at a builders outlet center that was not pressboard backing and now I regret not buying that instead... we would have had to buy the foam separate but I would rather do that than have such a cheaply made product on my floors.  I dread finding out how easily this floor scratches, which we have already dealt a little bit with that too but we have yet to move furniture around on it and the mere thought of it scares me for the amount of money we have spent on this flooring plus now paying someone to install it.  Please heed my warning and DO NOT BUY any of Select Surfaces products!  Please!  I would suggest staying away from ALL Select Surfaces products as that is what we plan to do after this nightmare!
5.0	Perfect match, works!!
5.0	be careful of bevelled glass doors.  these are meant for un-bevelled glass.
5.0	These after market filters are still working great with no problems after several months.<br />Yes, I would by them again.
1.0	The instructions for this product are so poor, rendering it impossible to install. No diagrams either. One part is not mentioned and it makes no sense whatever. There is no place that it can fit.
5.0	One of the nicest safes out there for the money. Nice for storing coins, handguns, etc. I recommend it. :)
5.0	Make sure you have the correct door opener remote for the door opener you have.  This one, when paired with the correct door opener, is a good inexpensive choice.  I was at that depot store, you know the one, and they wanted nearly twice as much for this.  Thanks to the amazon app on my phone I walked out of the store after hitting the buy with one click and saved about $13.
5.0	This item fits perfectly under the sink, even with a garbage disposal and under sink soak dispenser.  It was easy to install and works great.  The water tastes delicious and is saving on bottled waters.
1.0	I bought this to replace a dimmer intended for incandescent bulbs so that I could use CFLs. After trying it with many different CFL bulbs, all of them flashed and buzzed loudly. I finally replaced it with a simple on/off switch and I am much happier. Save your money, buy a $4 on/off switch and find the right bulbs for your application.
5.0	When replacing the rollers in your dryer clean the shafts with some cleaner as these need to be dry otherwise they will lock up and make a mess of things like this one did, ordered this kit, scraped all the rubber guts off the drum and put it back together, nearly new performance again!!!!!
5.0	So beautiful.  Works perfectly.  I've had this almost a year and nothing wrong with it.  The sprayer is also metal.  I priced this everywhere online and in the stores and this was the best price I found.  No leaks, easy to install.  It is beautiful.  Took me awhile to get used to two handles again, but like it now.  It is beautiful and dressed my kitchen up like fine jewelry on a lady (or man).
5.0	Steady, easy to fold and does not take much space to store
1.0	While this device is adequate for opening and closing the door, evidently the auto-close feature doesn't work with my six year old Liftmaster garage door opener. That was the whole point of buying this device. Before making the purchase, I carefully researched compatibility and observed no warnings about this problem. The '1 min' LED is illuminated, but the door never closes on its own.<br /><br />The packaged manual vaguely alludes to this compatibility problem, mentioning that some garage door models are not compatible with unattended close functions. However, the internet gateway works adequately, even though the auto-close doesn't work. (The opener emits a piercing shriek for an unendurably long time before starting to close; it sounds just like a smoke detector going off when you burn cookies in the oven.)<br /><br />This opener is also very fussy about when you can press the button. You have to wait about five seconds after the door fully opens or the safety beam is interrupted before you can close the door again. It's annoying waiting around for the button to accept my input.<br /><br />I'll share my thoughts about the paired, near-worthless internet gateway in a separate review. In summary, this whole package spectacularly fails to meet my modest expectations for a garage door opener system, primarily because of the poor design of the controls. Also, unlike every other garage door system I've ever encountered, this vendor doesn't support momentary contact switch operation so it can't be connected to home automation systems. :-(
5.0	These filters are sturdy & well made.  I have purchase 4 - 6 pack boxes of them so far & highly recommend.  I haven't pulled out a used one yet because it is too soon.  However, I cannot imagine them not doing their job.  I will update if displeased.
5.0	Very nice, easy to use, takes a little longer to flow then I thought but was very nice. Much easier to use than flux and solder.
5.0	After 7 years of struggling with a kitchen faucet with dual controls I treated myself to this fantastic, single control, industrial-look Grohe faucet.  I chose the &#34;Super Steel&#34; finish as it matched my Grohe pot filler perfectly.  The ability to switch effortlessly between full-stream and spray is fabulous.  I am now able to clean ever aspect of my over-sized stainless sink easily.  In fact, I am now considering washing my small pets in the sink because of the incredible versatility the spray head offers!  :-).  It is a larger-than-average piece of kitchen equipment and makes a real statement.  If you want your kitchen to look like a professional cook resides there, this is the faucet for you.
5.0	As the CR review rated it best buy, easy to use, priced well, and easy to install.  will buy it again.
5.0	This product is exactly what I hoped for. Very fast delivery. The assembly is pretty straight forward. you can control the force of the water.
1.0	Thank goodness we decided to try them before we gave them to our kids.  Then once they did not work, we took them home to try and tighten them or squeeze them shut, but still could not get them to work.  So, we ended up not handing them out to our students.  I would not order these and would really like my money back.  Thank goodness I ordered other light stuff from Amazon and they worked.
5.0	I purchased this lamp for use at work and it's everything I was looking for and more. I have a large monitor and I've placed the lamp behind the side of it so I can completely tuck it out of sight when I'm not using it and flip it open and on in 2 seconds. I love the color temperature options, brightness control and the ability to stretch, swivel and rotate each part of the lamp to place it just how I want it. Reading mode is my default setting. Aesthetically, I think it coordinates very well with my iMac. It was not a cheap purchase, but I would recommend it if you'd like to have all these features.
1.0	Poor quality and very poor packaging. Some of the bulbs were broken and smashed, and when we put one of the non broken bulbs in a socket it  burned out immediately.
5.0	You can see and feel the quality. Much higher end than Kwikset and worth the extra money imo.
5.0	I like it! This Checkered Duck Tape is exactly what I need for RC Racing. Good price very fast shipping will buy more if needed. Thank you Amazon!
5.0	Great product and best price out there.
5.0	My new place came without cabinet pulls.  I was breaking my fingernails every other day.  These are not only really sharp to look at, but do the job perfectly.  I did need to buy larger screws, but that is no biggie.  I love my cabinets now.
1.0	It worked well for about a week. Then, one LED flickered for a couple of days before dying. The second one followed shortly thereafter. You pay for what you get, I suppose.
1.0	Hello! How does this item get good reviews- it is not as pictured! This product is clear, no frosting whatsoever. The reason I purchased the film was to offer privacy and no privacy is offered. This is a shame- it took time to measure, cut and apply the film and only at the end- applying the film was it apparent the film was clear. PLEASE CHANGE THE PHOTO of this item!! It is deceptive
5.0	I bought this to plug into a loose outlet that also needed mor plug-ins. I didn't realize that you actually take off your other outlet cover plate and this one plugs into the outlets and screws into the hole. I'm totally fine with it, it works great!
5.0	This is exactly the part I needed shipping was very fast I recommend anyone ordering this part to look at the photo very close and compare the part before ordering I viewed many parts similar to the one I needed had I not been careful I could have ordered the wrong part very easily save all parts you view to your wish list for easy comparison .<br />Part arrived in a very large box this method of shipping ensures the part will not get damaged during shipping.
5.0	Work as they should, I hung laminated posters and small restroom signs up with them!
5.0	Easy to install and very low flow.<br />A bit hard to drink out of if you like to pretend your faucet is a drinking fountain.<br />My kid like to play with the faucet and after repeatedly getting him away from it, I decided to just put low flow faucets in so he's just not wasting as much water.
1.0	My set of these lamps burned out in under 10 hours of use per bulb.  The stand is very poorly constructed and one of the handles broke off from a cheap weld.  I would not recommend these.
5.0	Everything  on the plumbing side fit just like the old one which was over 25 years old.  The directions were easy to follow and it came with a life-time warranty.
5.0	These are great little lights. They really put out the light, and have a high and low beam. I am on my second order of them, and have bought both the 3 and 4 light units. We have an older house with limited electric outlets and lights. They work great for areas that need light but have no electrical access. I have one over my kitchen sink for better light there, and under the cabinets on each side. One over the washer and dryer in my small laundry area, and two large ones out in the storage shed, one in my hall closet. Two I have set back for emergency lights where needed. People that have seen them are also ordering them. The products are great and so is the price and service. I may be getting more as I find more places they can be used.     As our electricity suppler in this area is expensive, it is cheaper to burn the wireless lights with batteries than the electric lights. The LED seems to make the batteries last a long time. I have a large one that stays mobile, we move it to wherever we need/want it and use these lights often to save on electricity.
5.0	Great packaging and easy to install. High quality paper and print.
5.0	Great pricing, excellent ladder.  Top notch construction.  Fiberglass was the &#34;over the top&#34; bonus I wanted for non conductivity.  Note: Buy some endcaps to protect your walls. Even max extension of product feels safe.
5.0	right color, right size, right carpet for our stairs. we have blind dogs and slippery steps, this is just the ticket. we havent had any problem with them going up and down the steps. easy to keep clean and look good.
5.0	These rollers was perfect for my house painting job. Just disposed of esch roller dailly, no need to clean up
1.0	I ordered this item with a bulk purchase order over $1k. I later noticed the shipping on this item which made its cost highly over priced. I contacted the seller the day it was to be shipped and cancelled the order. He did not cancel the order and shipped it. He then sent me a notice to ship it back for a refund and I had to pay for the return shipping.<br /><br />DO NOT PURCHASE FROM SOUTHWIRE COMPANY!  HE GETS YOU WITH THE SHIPPING GOING AND COMING.
1.0	One star because the lamp itself is very pretty to look at....UNTIL you turn it on.  The first time I turned it on it took at least 2-3 hours to warm up and for the lava to start moving.  The second day I turned it on....the lava just stayed in a glob at the bottom of the globe.  After 2-3 hours I rotated the globe and tilted it back and forth and finally got the lava to break up and move.  I had to handle it gingerly because it got very hot to the touch.  It has been the same every time since when I turn it on....it heats up and the lava just sits at the bottom of the globe.  Thinking about returning it!!  Sorely disappointed!
5.0	This is the third light I've purchased. I love them.
5.0	I hung it on the inside of a window facing out onto Lanai behind my Tiki Bar. Perfect size & intensity.
5.0	"The lamp caught my attention as the quirky scroll design ties into the embroidered vine pattern on the quilt in the guest room. There's scrolling in the shade as well. I didn't realize it came with a 2-way (3-way?) switch, but I have it hooked up to an easier to reach on/off touch pad, so am not using that feature.  The cord exits the base somewhat in the wrong place for my liking, but so be it.  On a side note, somehow the design makes me think of graphics in \\""Nightmare Before Christmas\\""--maybe it's just me. Well packed in a huge box.  FOLLOW-UP NOTE: Caution with the tag pasted on the base bottom, which I didn't see and is now very stubbornly adhered to the dresser top--ugh."
5.0	This Fuji sprayer is well worth the price!  It combines the versatility of a finishing  sprayer with the utility of a larger area wall type sprayer without the waste and massive over spray  which a high pressure airless sprayer is prone to.  The construction is high end from the spray gun to the turbine unit.  Only two suggestions or minor issues.  Be warned that after using the unit both the metal housing of the turbine unit and the hose to turbine unit connection both get not warm but HOT!  so don't touch it either with your bare hand until you have given the unit sufficient time to cool.  Fuji does not provide such a warning on the unit or the turbine end of the air hose connection..  Other than that,  I have used the unit once, it is easy to use, set up and clean.  I don't know the longevity of the unit but Fuji does back it with a generous guarantee  with a two year warranty
1.0	great for keeping my nosy nephew who has the munchies out of my fridge. but after a few days one of the leves on the front of the fridge just broke, id like a refund or one sent to me! WTH
5.0	I checked both Lowes and Home Depot and stangley enough I couldn't find elongated toilet seat in biscuit linen. Shopping on Amazon was easy, I quickly found what I needed and it was delivered a few days later. Most importantly the price was very reasonable and it was easy to install.
5.0	Installation was helped with the online videos from Apec, but still ran into a few difficulties being that I'm not a plumber. Water is A.Mazing. Great purchase!
5.0	Very nice, bright light.  Full-spectrum and crisp without seeming blueish.<br /><br />This bulb also does a good job of casting omni-directional light, as opposed to the directed light from most candelabra LED bulbs.
1.0	I thought I'd save some money and buy a no name brand version. Bad idea. Water had a bad plasticy after taste that never went away even after gallons of flushing. Ended up going back to buying the Amana name brand and now water taste great. I guess you get what you pay for.
5.0	These cords are exactly what I needed.  Good sturdy material and just the right size for my tarp.  Would recommend them to anyone.  And a price you simply cannot beat!
1.0	This was a chinese ripoff not made by the high quality Swiss company Franke.  Very poor quality work and a fraudulent representation as made by &#34;Franke&#34; with a fake model number that looked similar to the Franke model numbering system.
5.0	I own several of these.
5.0	I ordered a dozen Schlage handles and they are terrific - the look is great and my installer was glad to see that I ordered Schlage!  I also ordered the deadbolt and privacy knobs - all perfect!!
5.0	We have just been finishing a renovation and our apartment was extremely dusty. Lots of family members had nagging coughs, etc. I was hoping I could use the a/c air handler to filter to air, but the typical filters were not making much of a difference and didn't seem to fit well anyway (air getting around them).  The fractional sizes of these filters were the first thing that drew me to them (16.25 was perfect), and the results have been fantastic. I'm using a Dylos particle counter and was able to get it from a steady reading of over 2000 (200,000 particles/ft^3) small particles (>1um) down to 50 (5,000 particles/ft^3). Highly recommended.  fwiw, the filters we were shipped arrived quickly, undamaged, and did not appear to have been re-sized (16.25x21.25x1) in any way.
5.0	I had an opportunity to use this product much sooner than I had anticipated.  My senior kitty had an accident (?) on the toss pillow that I keep on the sofa in the family room.  This product had just come in the mail a few days earlier and was sitting there handy to where the accident had occurred.  Picked it up and quickly scanned the directions and POW! it instantly removed the urine odor (which those of us with cats) know is a strong and distinct odor and removed the stain.  I would happily recommend this product for any other stains or odors.  I would be comfortable telling you that you will be pleased with your purchase.
5.0	We really needed a good showerhead. This unit provided just that. The spray is perfect. It does give a nice back massage with the type of spray it has. The price was right as I could have spent 3 times what this cost. I was a taken aback by the way it was shipped. The showerhead was rolled up with bubble wrap and sent in a bubble padded envelope. No paperwork was included with the unit and there was a scuff on one side of the showerhead. Time will tell on how well this unit holds up.
5.0	Product is what it says it was and cheaper then the box stores. There seemed to be an overkill in shipping the product in two very large boxes. In my opinion, it could of all fit in to one. Overall this was a great deal. I would definitely purchase again. Anytime I can save money and get free shipping is AWESOME.
5.0	These bulbs are very well priced.  It's extremely affordable compared to my local home improvement store.
5.0	My only qualm is having to show the family how the cable comes out of the latch. Otherwise, very easy to use.
5.0	Appears to be good quality
5.0	Perfect.  Fits the sink, stable and strong to protect from a hot pot!
1.0	It was delivered in a tour up box. Most of the finish is peeling off. It has several dents in it, and the the key works when it wants to. It is not even worth my time to return it. I have ordered a replacement but Im sure I will get another piece of junk. I am angry I have to waste my time to try to buy a box and waist my time to return it when it needs to be thrown in the trash. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! JUNK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5.0	Fantastic - Installation was tricky with CenturyLink FTTH - you have to setup both PPPoE and VLAN.  In case someone else is hitting the same issue I did, you need to configure VLAN tag the WAN port, set 201 as the VID and set all the LAN ports to VID 201 as well - but do not select the 'tag' option on the LAN ports, just the WAN port.<br /><br />Once configuration was done, it works just the way it should - fast, simple, no issues.
5.0	[[VIDEOID:mo1SCBMCXFHTUYA]]This beautiful LED candelabra chandelier shaped light bulb is everything that you should be asking for in the latest LED technology. It is a 200 lumen LED bulb that operates at 3 watts of power. It features a 120° light beam angle and produces a soft white light. The lens cover is made of break resistant plastic and its finned base helps to keep the bulb cooler and have a long life. This bulb comes with a life time warranty and if it fails under normal use during the lifetime of the original purchaser it will be replaced at no charge.<br /><br />The energy savings for this bulb will pay for the bulb in about one year. I have put together a video showing a bulb comparison to other designs of bulbs and I hope that it is helpful to you. This bulb does not work with a dimmer.<br /><br />This is a very good LED replacement bulb and it is truly a direct replacement for an incandescent candelabra bulb. I love the fact that these bulbs are now available in designer shapes and this bulb looked just great in dining room light fixture. It also contains no mercury like a CFL bulb and it produces about as much light at 3 watts as a 40 watt chandelier bulb.<br /><br />This is a product with excellent quality, performance and guarantee. It is UL, FCC and RoHS certified. I rated it at 5 stars and I recommend it to you as a good product.<br /><br />I was supplied a sample product for evaluation and I promised to provide a fair and honest review.
1.0	Stay away from this model. This remote is the same as the nutone, litex and Harbor Breeze.<br />They are terrible remotes because you have to aim this thing straight at the fan in order for to work, it has<br />a terrible range. All remotes should work in the room they are in whether they are on a table or in their<br />cradle. The Harbor Breeze fan I have is in a 10x12 bedroom and will not work unless you aim it right<br />at the fan. The case is of cheap quality also you can shake it and hear the circuit board rattle inside.<br />Keep looking.
5.0	Performed as expected.
5.0	Purchased this when we remodeled our bathroom and we are very glad we did. It works exactly as advertised. I always feel much fresher and cleaner now.  Would and have recommended this product to others.
5.0	This works perfectly for our closet!
5.0	Looks great with our black sink and works well too. The tap motion is a bit soft but easy to turn on and off. The only concern is a possible tiny bit of leakage from the tap region - as yet unconfirmed as it may be just splash.
5.0	Been running these cords 24/7 without any issues....I will buy more
5.0	Receive on time,easy to install and worked like a charm!
5.0	They came in as expected thank you:)
5.0	Can't find any Cheaper
5.0	wonderful product! helps clean & keeps moisture in wood. Do not have to dust has much.
5.0	This seat is very well made.  It was easy to install and very comfortable when put to use.  Being solid plastic it will greatly outlast a wooden seat.
1.0	have 3.  1 was reliable, till last firmware update.  now it connects 50% of the time.  the other 2 were pos, always had problems.  This is pretty sad, great concept, but Nest just can't get it to work reliably.
1.0	Great fer growing mold
5.0	Super quiet, Smooth, reliable, decent range, direct replacement for craftsman, liftmaster, and other chamberlain units.  To get the most out of it and to make my garage as quiet as possible I bought Set of 10---2 Inch 13 Ball Nylon Garage Door Roller (4 Inch Stem)  from another Amazon seller for next to nothing.  The only thing left to do for a truely silent garage is to spray some silicone spray on the hinges for each section.  Now I just hear a hum as the door opens and closes.
5.0	Item is perfect for what I needed. Other Lockboxes can cost so much. Just because they allow electronic keys to open them  This little guy does the job.
5.0	This Leviton telephone wall plate, with its recessed indentation for RJ-45 jacks, works very well. Typically, space for connecting wall-mounted phones to wall jacks and phone plugs is very tight. The recessed indentation in this wall plate provides a little extra space for these connections.
5.0	perfect-  received just what was expected!
5.0	Excellent product. Has been working well for the last several months outside our home. So far no complains.
5.0	Very pretty and really holds the hell out of my towels.
5.0	This is the second house where we have upgraded all the door knobs with the Kwikset Tustin line.  These are quality doorknobs.  They install easily, feel solid, and look great.
5.0	Easy to install and works great!
1.0	very difficult to light and use...I don't know if the fuel was dried up...but it took us an hour to get two of them in the air. They ripped really easily and the oil just wouldn't light.
5.0	"I recently bought two of these to replace a more expensive brand we had, and so far it seems to be doing great.   The water is clean tasting and fresh. The item was easy to screw on and \\""install\\"".  And I love that it turns the filtering off when you turn the water off. Very handy!  All in all, a great value for the price! Will continue to purchase these."
5.0	I hate plastic seats.  I replace them in all the apartments or base housing I end up in.  This is the best seat I've gotten over the years.
5.0	Pros: Amazing, powerful, durable, easy to use, better  cleaner than any conventional duster<br /><br />Cons: Loud
5.0	Tha second lamp worked fine
5.0	Sturdy comfortable seat
5.0	All still working perfectly. Thank you.
5.0	I have been putting a CA finish on my pens up until now and it takes a lot of steps and extra time.  With Pens Plus, I can just apply 3 or 4 coats and be done.  It also doesn't stick to bushings either.  I like how you can still feel the wood with this friction polish, as opposed to the plastic coated feel of CA.  I noticed that the pens had a nice satin luster after only two coats and you really could stop there, but the more coats you add, the more glossy it gets.  I settled at around 4 coats for a nice sheen and feel.  This would be great for new pen turners who are already investing in pen turning tools and need a low cost finishing solution that doesn't require lots of extra supplies.
5.0	Took care of the smell and it was easy to install.
5.0	Good size and fit for venting, has a plastic screen on the back, I would have preferred a metal screen like the ones I have used before, but for the price it will work.
5.0	Awesome lights!  Not a ton of light but perfect for a deck!
5.0	Great Looking and works great!
5.0	Use in my home system and it works well.  Catches alot of sediment from well water.
5.0	I just put up this light and am thrilled with it.  I altered the length of the shells to give a tiered effect, with four shells in the center and two shells for the outer ring.  I didn't mind putting the many pieces together, but I like to do detailed hobbies.  I waited until the fixture was mounted and then attached the shell lengths to it.  It is a bit challenging to align the fixture to the long support screws and found it best to measure the distance between the opposing fixture holes (25 cm) and tightening the screws in correct position before trying to align with the fixture plate.  The fixture is as big around as a large pizza.  I did wear gloves to put it up to avoid tarnishing the chrome.  Unlike another reviewer's experience, my light did have a ground wire.  I have dimmable LED light bulbs in it and it is very bright when fully on.  I definitely recommend this light for a cool beachy sophisticated look!<br />I will try to figure out how to post an image.
5.0	Fits perfectly and looks nice. Wish it was less expensive.
5.0	Don't get spray paint all over your hands! Use this spray gun and go inside with clean hands!
5.0	Most amazing knobs!!! I can't wait till they are back in stock!!
5.0	Halo is the best quality you can find in recessed housings.  They are constructed and featured to make installation as easy and quick as possible.  Multiple clip hangers for either joist or drop ceiling installation, quick entry wire holds, and the new quick wire plug that eliminates the need for wire nuts and significantly speeds installation.  This model is perfect for the 4&#34; retrofit LED lights that are becoming more widely available - note that this does not have an edison bulb base, but instead the orange plug adapter that is on high efficiency LED retrofits.  Make sure to read the wiring instructions if you are using the quick entry wire holds as there is a specific way to bend the wire to further reduce wire strain.  Also note that the quick wire plugs will hold 3 additional wires.  The only drawback is with the high efficiency plug end, you cannot screw a standard bulb in to use the cans for lighting during construction.  We have gotten around this by making up an edison base end that plugs in and works great.  I am happy to share the info on that with any who are interested.
5.0	An excellent replacement for my older 250W HID.  The new Hyperikon 54W LED replacement is actually brighter then the original and does a better job lighting the area.  The Hyperikon LED has the same larger base and I was able to simply remove the old bulb, disconnect the old ballast and screw in the new bulb.  The part I love best is how I no longer have to wait for it to turn on. The new Hyperikon LED replacement turns on instantly and has no annoying hum.
5.0	Made my sons room in a Star Wars theme, and this mural is at the center! It is awesome. It was easy to hang.
5.0	I love this watch. The quality and design are fabulous. I gave it as a gift to a friend she adores anything Hello Kitty. i would recommend this to anyone. It's a fun piece and versatile. A great deal for sure!!!
5.0	My Sister loves having a door bell now even though she<br />can't make up her mind which tone she likes best ~ easy<br />to put up and no problem to hear it with a distance of<br />about 25 feet from the outside ringer.
5.0	This combined with the Real Milk Citrus Solvent made my redwood fence look beautiful and it smells fabulous! My neighbor used more than 3 gallons to cover what 2 gallons of these products covered.
5.0	These led lamps are exactly what I was looking for, their nice and bright not bulky.
5.0	Works as described.  Plug is bulky, as photo shows.  Touch pad is flatter than photo seems to indicate, and is about 2&#34; diameter.  Fairly sensitive, and does indeed turn my simple on/off lamp into a 3-way lamp.
5.0	Needed for pellet stove just to be safe
5.0	Add-on to my front door bell.  Sets separate tone for each wireless button.
5.0	This is a great product and has performed perfectly.  The only thing we might want is a soft light mimicking the old bulbs color.
5.0	This item was used to plug in a device that I was having to plug and unplug into the wall. This caused the wires to keep breaking. NO MORE!!!
5.0	I love this faucet. It look and feel very expensive. I had to return it because it was too large for my sink. When I replace my sink I am going to buy the size that can fit this faucet. Believe me, you will not be sorry if you order this faucet. I showed it to diffrent family members and everyone loved it. If you like diffrent & classey, this is it! Oh and by the way the company was very helpful answering my questions and I had no problem returning it.
5.0	Anear provided a LED BBQ grill light for test and review. And my family really like it for a number of reasons.<br /><br />1. Easy to install. Use the provided small screw driver to open the battery housing.Insert 3 AA batteries in the correct + and - configuration.Tap the touch sensor turn the light on.Use the screwdriver to securely close the battery housing. Fit the grill perfectly.<br /><br />2.180° swivel head. The light can be adjusted to an angle of 180° vertically and 270° horizontally. That provides a lot of flexibility when positioning it for illuminating the grilling or serving areas.<br /><br />3.10 super bright LEDs. Provide excellent illumination for wide grilling areas.<br /><br />4.Touch sensor. Just a mere touch turns it on or off.<br /><br />5. Portable. Powered by three AA Batteries, you can take it along as long as you unpack it and insert the batteries.<br /><br />6. Heat-reinsistant. The product is made from durable, heat resistant ABS plastic. It has been designed to withstand intense temperatures for prolonged periods of time.<br /><br />7. Water-reinsistant. The front side of the casing has been certified as IP44 on the Ingress Protection Marking scale. This means that normal splashing will not have any adverse effect on the product. However, if the light is caught in a torrential downpour, please remove the battery and the drive the light out before using it again.<br /><br />Nice item. Thank you!
5.0	Another wonderful lamp! Easy to assemble and warms the room with the glow from its beautiful shade!
5.0	These are perfect.I will buy more as soon as I need them.
5.0	Did exactly what it was for and didn't have to deal with all the stores that are always out of them
5.0	They work great. They are durable, bright and a great price as well. I like that it didn't require too many batteries and that it had multiple functions.
5.0	Excellent product. I bought these because my outside lights don't always shut off using the electric photo sensor.  I got tired of replacing the sensors.  I may have read over the instructions too quickly and missed the part on how to change from manual to automatic mode.  Simply hold the button in for at least 3 seconds. Easy set up, easy to program.  I love 'em.
5.0	Dries better than ever thanks. Fast delivery
5.0	"Before I bought this safe I had my important documents sitting in manila folders waiting for the day for me to spill water on it or a fire to break out. Then one day I sat on my citizenship papers, wrinkled them and I thought \\""I really need a safer place to put these.\\"" That's when I bought this big bad mother shut yo mouth. Seriously, this thing has some heft to it. I weigh about 200 lbs and stood on this thing for 5 minutes and nothing happened to it. (I was using it to reach the top of my closet - which I don't recommend). I give my full recommendation for this product."
5.0	This was exactly what I needed for my 14x23 garden. I have one at each end and one in the middle. The ones at the end have the 1/2 circle pattern nozzle, and the one in the center has a full circle. It is a semi permanent installation and I have it on a timer. My only gripe is they don't provide a convenient way to get extra nozzles. It ships with all 3 heads having round patterns, and includes one 1/2 circle and one 1/4 circle extra. I needed  another 1/2 circle and Home Depot only carries the box, not the accessories.
5.0	It screwed in the socket. It lights up real good when you turn the switch on. It has lasted a month. What else can I say about a light bulb?
5.0	It did what it was suppose to do! it made picking up the large bottle easier
5.0	I purchased a dining room ceiling lamp that used these type of bulbs.  Over the years I have to replace three of them.  I had a problem locating them in the store and so I gave up looking for them.  I no buy them on amazon when they go out.  I get one at a time when one goes out, because I know if I try and stock up on them I will not remember where I put them, so I install them the minute they come are delivered to me.  When I originally installed the overhead ceiling lamp it said the original bulbs would average 5 years, well so far I have replaced 3 after 2.5 years, so  maybe these satco lights will last longer than the originals, as the satco's are still going.  I want to keep getting these because the color of the light emitted matches the same yellowish light of the originals, because I was worried about some bulbs emitting yellow light and some emitting white light. And theses bulbs cost about $7 each, but then I don't have to go to big hardware store and go inside where I get lost and then end up impulse buying other items I see on the shelves, and spending like $50.
5.0	It's bright and warm. Good for evenings, if you're cutting down on the blue light spectrum that blocks melatonin production. Just don't try to write in red pen when close to it--you won't be able to see the red ink at all :) !
5.0	These fire alarms are a product that has been needed for a long time. These are small, of a neutral color, easy to install, and will promote the usage of more fire alarms. Many people install none, or the very minimum required amount of such alarms, often because they are large and obtrusive. These alarms are wonderful in that respect, once installed, they are practically imperceptible. I found them to be easy to install, although I do note that not all reviewers have found that to be the case.<br /><br />I recommend these tiny alarms, they are strong and powerful, and will more than perform their intended role. -that of saving lives.
5.0	Put a good amount of light where you need it when electric is not available.
5.0	Bright, adjustable, quality build. Everything as advertised. Would buy again for other applications, and can be used and mounted just about anywhere, not just under cabinets. Above cabinets would be nice too. Or inside drawers. Or around floorboards/baseboards. Or even in architectural accents on walls etc. Anywhere you can run (or conceal) a power wire.
5.0	Great lamps. What a difference these make in our bedrooms!
5.0	What can I say except they last forever!  The light they give off is beautiful. I will never use any other kind of bulb  Thank you.
1.0	I wouldn't waste my time with this. I have spent 10 minutes in my driveway trying to get my garage door open with this thing, wouldn't be bad if you were just buying it for a backup.
5.0	So far I have bought &#62;15 bulbs. They are very efficient (1100 lumens for 15 watt) and have excellent build quantity. Excellent customer service from seller (G7).  I had one bulb DOA which was promptly replaced by seller with a single email. Will buy more in near future for other rooms.
5.0	Makes a nice portable cart to carry on big jobs when you don't want to bend down to the floor to pick up parts when working on a large project..
1.0	Lasted about 1 week.  Tried to replace the batteries and never worked properly.
5.0	Bought the left-handed tape measure for my daughter and her boyfreind. They said it is just what they need since a right-handed tape measure is awkward for lefties,especiallt when clipping to a pocket.
5.0	Bought this for my garage that stopped working.  My boyfriend installed it and now it works so what more can I say :)
5.0	The vessel faucets arrived in 2 days and were exactly what I was looking for.  They are good quality<br />and more traditional in style than most vessel faucets and not as tall.  They were perfect for my<br />bathroom so I ordered one more for the other bathroom and received in it one more day.  I would recommend<br />them to anyone who is not looking for a very tall vessel faucet.
5.0	Looks and functions great like a normal hairbrush but with a secret. I purchased this for travel, needing someplace inconspicuous to stash small earrings, rings, and necklaces. In the past, I've put jewelry in a jewelry travel pouch , only to worry about where to &#34;hide&#34; it in the hotel room (I don't trust the safes, I've had cash taken from them too). I've also placed items in a pill bottle, only to find the pill bottle gone (guess the maid couldn't pass up a potential vicodin score). Anyway, the brush is big enough to hold quite a few small items. Unscrewing the cover is quick and easy. The compartment is approx 4 inches (10 cm) deep with a 1 inch (almost 3 cm) round opening. The inside of the compartment is a hard plastic, not rubberized or cushioned. Any items being placed inside would need to be cushioned with a tissue, soft foam, or cotton to keep from rattling. An easy fix. Overall a great purchase and I know I'll get a lot of use out of it, even if just to brush my hair! lol
5.0	awesome! i use it everyday and i love it. although im the only person who uses this in our family, its still worth the money
5.0	perfect. worked as expected.
5.0	Cant beat this solid pump.  I purchased another one for my house after 7 years of use - it was still working, I just did not want to take any chances with our finished basement.  I kept the old one just in case of an emergency - like one of our neighbors needing help. - also replace your check valve when you replace your sump pump, they can go bad over time also, I got the Zoeller 30-0181 Check Valve, 1-1/2 Inch
5.0	I'm actually surprised by how nice they look.  I have one on my front door to hold seasonal items (wreath, etc.) and it's perfect.  It holds the weight of the items and looks fine even when I don't have anything on it.  This was the perfect solution to hanging stuff on our new wood front door that my husband would have had a cow if I put a nail in it. lol
1.0	Although product is labled &#34;Premiere&#34; , the one I received was Thin. Flimsy , and Warped. Also seperates top from bottom while seated.
5.0	After reading all the reviews and comparing all brands, it finally came down to insinkerator and WasteKing. we finally decided to go with Insinkerator. It was easy to install and is very powerful and so much quieter than the builder grade that we had. The one at Lowes was a little cheaper than this but I am always worried that the companies make inferior versions for box stores. So we decided to go with this. Would highly recommend to anyone.
1.0	"First thing, the product I received was exactly what I needed. A quality galvanized outlet box for masonry construction. The problem is, however, the description states 10-Pack (\\""10 Standard Package\\"".) I received only 1 item. Granted, at the price a 10 pack would be an excellent deal. But who knew. Suckered into the purchase, including outrageous shipping cost, and expecting to receive 10 items, I took the bait. Stamp me DA of the year.  And how about the list price of $535.88? Is this what the DOD pays? In fairness, I just started the process of making a report with Amazon and the seller, but wanted to help other shoppers save face and their money, so am posting this now. Avoid this seller. Either, they don't know how to sell on Amazon, or there is something else under the first layer."
5.0	We finally remodeled our galley kitchen and were considering what type of sink to get.  My husband really wanted a double bowl sink, but the kitchen designer kept pushing for a single bowl when considering our small kitchen.  I searched for a sink that would fit in a 30 inch cabinet with two bowls, one smaller than the other.  We wanted a sink that had very modern look to match our planned kitchen update.  The Ruvati is a heavy duty deep sink that met all of our requirements.  Our contractor thought it was a commercial sink because it was so heavy and deep!  It fit perfectly with our black quartz countertop and did not require any adjustment to fit into the 30 inch cabinet.<br />As it has been a few months since the sink was installed, we have found that we really like the sink. It comes with grates to put on the bottom of the sink to keep dishes off the bottom.  The drain catchers are great little baskets that have a handle that makes it easy to remove to empty. The only minus we've found is that the sink basin does not tilt toward the drain as much as we would like, so it is harder to push debris into the garbage disposal.<br />We are very pleased with the sink and would purchase again.
5.0	Fawn biege color matches existing bathroom tiles beautifully.  A real find and works great!  Easy to install and arrived promptly.
5.0	I bought this lamp for my dad for Christmas and he just loves it! It's sleek and compact so it doesn't take up too much room on his desk, and the 3 levels of brightness are perfect for when he wants to put it on low to work at night and not disturb his wife in the same room. He thinks the charging port is the coolest thing ever to have on a lamp, too! I'd definitely recommend it to anyone looking into purchasing a good yet affordable desk lamp.
5.0	I had an old 191 that lasted about 11 years so to replace the old with the new 191 took less than 30 minutes. I expect the new 191 to last at least 10 years. Great product and easy to install.
1.0	"Pur makes a new and improved adapter that consists of a plastic adapter and a steel ring for reinforcement - which doesn't work.  I tried the new adapter on 3 different Pur filters and they all leaked and squirted water.  So I changed from Pur to [[ASIN:B004INTGKK Brita On Tap Faucet Water Filter System, Chrome]] which works with no leaks and no squirting.<br /><br />The Brita Filter is ABC easy to install.  Be sure to follow instructions.  Align the little arrow on the filter with the little groove on the body of the filter.  And the \\""metal button\\"" to rest the light is located on the inside of the body of the filter - look down into the body of the filter and you will see a teeny-tiny button - that's the \\""metal button\\""."
5.0	Tiny, brilliant light. Can be dimmed to save the battery.  Will stand on its end for hands-free tasks.
5.0	Great product.  Took some time to install but definitely a DIY and at a fair price.  My product was a genuine Aprilaire and not a knock off.  Good product and would purchase again.
5.0	Leeo provides the comfort we need for our baby's nursery.  The product provides ambient light as well!  We are happy with the product and it gives us tremendous peace of mind.  Thanks for building a great product Leeo!
5.0	Nice fan. Install is your normal ceiling fan install. Came with 3 different length downrods. Only problem I had was that the included wire nuts sucked. I used a better wire nut and it worked just fine.<br /><br />After 3 weeks of continuous use the fan is still quiet. Also it has 4 speeds. High medium low and super low. On high it doesn't spin as fast as older fans but it still moves quite a bit of air.
5.0	The bulbs were shipped quickly and arrived early.  I immediately replaced the old bulbs I had.  It sits little higher in my landscape light fixture than the original.  However, the brightness of the bulbs makes up for whatever difficulty I had putting then in.  Highly recommend the seller and the bulbs.  This is second time I have purchased bulbs from them.  No regrets.
5.0	I wanted a little larger size, but this was as advertised.  The bar is very close and not big enough for fingers.
5.0	Without the gate lock, keeping a gate closed is an iffy proposition. Cows and people take the easiest path, which often means pushing through an obviously closed gate. This lock connects with two wires to the newer Mighty Mule control boards (and through a somewhat more complicated arrangement to the older MM products). The result is a positive lock that can't be easily defeated - at least by a cow.
5.0	Fast shipping, item as described. Thank-you!!
1.0	I used to love this as retention of taste lasted a long time (5-6 months).  The last two filters I got lasted for about 3 months.  Something funny going on here.  Maybe it was old stock?
5.0	works great same as old one
5.0	I thought it would be hard to install but it only took my maintenance mane 10 minutes to get it installed! I love it, I feel so fresh and clean now.  If your older or disabled like I am this is so great, to know your clean is God sent. I may be getting personal but its all the truth.
5.0	Bought for a renovated bathroom, the clean lines work beautifully with my bathroom tiles, and amber colored glass vessel sink.  Very nice.
5.0	I order these for my Kitchen Aid Integrated Trash Compactor and they fit perfectly.  Am on my 5th re-order.  I also own the trash compactor bags sold at Costco but use them for other things.  These are the ones to buy!  Very strong.  Never any leakage.
5.0	Our Home Depot purchased Lithonia Lighting Flood Lights. 2-Light Wall-Mount Outdoor uses two of these.  Only one needed replacing but bought three because of good price and you never know.  Fit perfectly and arrived in perfect condition and shipped quickly thanks to Prime.
5.0	Best lights for my garage nice and brite
5.0	This is a quality faucet, good chrome quality , great appearance and very heavy. My question is mounting. There are no mounting instructions . There is no fitting to screw this unit into the wall framing. It is a wall mount faucet and very heavy. If using with cpvc or pex pipe we can't rely on the pipes for support. I still have not figured a way to install this faucet and there are no directions to deal with this issue. My plans have changed and now I have this faucet that I will not be using. It is for sale .
5.0	I compared prices on the web for this authentic Samsung filter and this was the best deal. Next time that I need filters for my fridge, I will definitely come back.Thank you!
5.0	The part was a perfect replacement at a really good price!  Would do again.
5.0	This particular size is a tough one to find!  Needed a replacement for the really old lights in my basement and it works great!
5.0	This is the best epoxy paint that I could find and used.  Other epoxy paint that I used was not durable as Homax
5.0	This is one of the best products I've used in a very long time.  Easy to use and lives up to what it says it will do.  I've actually made a list of all the projects I want to use this product on.
5.0	These are great. Quality construction. Easy coupling. Water tight.  Replaced the bulb with an LED. looks great.  Bright enough with 2 watt MR11
5.0	Both some of a different web site best thing I have both
5.0	Works great as glue for pure polystyrene (many models) but not abs like legos.  Plan on trying it to clean bike and think it will work great.
5.0	Dryer is working and I'm so happy!  Thanks for your help
5.0	I purchased this aftermarket part in hopes it worked just like the honeywell one.  it works just like it should!
5.0	When the mover brought all our furniture in our new hardwood floored house, he said he had never see such high-quality sliders in his 24 years of moving. They are easy to apply and work great.
5.0	Sometimes simple ideas are the most effective. Make quick work of your next paint job. Covers evenly and easily. Just fill the tube, click to dispense more paint, and roll, roll, roll. No more dipping the roller, no more paint trays, no spills, no drips, no splatter.     You automatically have an extended reach, so going up to the ceiling or down to the floor is easily accomplished with little or no bending.    I've painted all the walls in three homes with the Paint Mate.     The only drawback is cleaning the roller, since it holds a lot of paint. Either plan on spending ten minutes or more cleaning the roller, spend $8 to replace it, or buy a roller cleaning attachment for your sink.
5.0	the cover came damaged but the company took care of a replacement right away! and it's helping our pool warm up!
1.0	Like the other 1 stars here, I've had two of these bulbs fail, with the metal ring and glass falling onto the couch, so I didn't have glass break, but one burned me pretty badly because it was extremely hot when it fell on me.
5.0	Great product, competitive pricing and fast shipping.
5.0	The fiancé is a big fan of knives but didn't have any throwing knives. I have an old set by a different maker which he had been using. My fiancé saw these and loves them! Very nice.
5.0	Great warm light and appears to be of reasonably good quality
1.0	The light does not stay on for more than 2-3 hours, and it is NOT very bright.  Don't waste your money.
5.0	Fast delivery. Fits our refrigerator.  Exactly as advertised.
5.0	Works great. I wanted a taller desk lamp than the one I had. This fits the bill. It also runs cooler. Very satisfied with this lamp.
5.0	I got this after fighting with my Nutiva gallon coconut oil bucket - and the opener works great!! It's a keeper!  Recommended!
5.0	Worked great and fixed the faucet!
1.0	Piece of junk!<br />It worked on my desk with both units together when I put in the batteries in but when mounted in my mail box which is is 20' away &#34;line of sight&#34; through a window it would not work. I was informed by the company that they could issue a RMA#, what ever that is, and that there would be a 15% restocking fee. I am very disappointed that Amazon does business with this kind of company. It will make me think twice before ordering from them again.<br />POUR PRODUCT, BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE. TOTAL RIPOFF!
1.0	Did not come with the bolts to attach it to the motorcycle. The bolts on the motorcycle was too short thus I had to find bolts and finding Chrome bolts is not easy. Looking at sending it back
5.0	Yea, not sure what all to say on this one. It's a sink. It has the dimensions I needed. It was cheap. It installed undermount on my concrete countertop easily. It's very attractive. Came extremely well packaged with no damage. Would buy again.
5.0	Totally Professional, Fast Delivery, 100% in top shape, beautiful. Easy to install.<br />Would recommend to anyone.  Totally met my expectations.<br />My friends that come over love the design, and color.  They want to order as well
5.0	I don't write a review usually... but these totally changed the way my kitchen looked. I am not a person very good at DIY. This was simple to follow. All you need is a very very clan floor, a box cutter, a ruler and you're ready to roll. These planks are straight, sometimes walls aren't so be prepared to cut and tilt and redo some planks which also was super easy. Worth every penny.
5.0	Easy to install.  Great customer service. Pre buy your post for yard it does not come with system.
5.0	These are great work gloves for just about everything.  Have purchased the leather ones before I would rather have those as I am sure for the gardening I do they last longer than these will.  They are comfortable and I like them.
1.0	What you see is NOT what you get. The actual screws have threads halfway up the shanks and are finished bright.
5.0	Love the flush form factor, non obtrusive, lightweight, grounded when needed and do what it needs to do when you travel abroad. Note that it just changes the form factor, but it is passive, it doesn't convert the voltage!
5.0	I had a traditional 50/50 stainless steel double bowl. I was worried that the smaller side of the 70/30 would be too small. Not so! The 70 side lets me wash large items without worry and the 30 side I use for draining items. This item was very well packed. The box it came in was super thick and the sink was encased in a black cloth bag for protection. Inside the box was a couple of drain alternative, a thick black sink towel as well as grates for the bottom of sink. I was apprehensive about the grates at first, but I love them. They keep item off the bottom of the sink floor. Don't hesitate to but this product.
5.0	used this cable lock couple times outside for multiple purposes during rain, cold and sun and held up very well to weather conditions.  No one tried to cut it so far, so can't say how well it holds up when someone is actually trying to cut it.  It is a very heavy duty cable and work well for my usage in locking up gates and equipment in the outdoors.
5.0	need something to keep the water going to my garage and it works
5.0	I liked the color it matched the picture exactly and is working without a problem. Arrived on time and in perfect condition could not find this color in the stores. Be sure that if you have another light switch connected to this circuit that you make sure it is not a singe pole.
5.0	Exactly as described! Does not hurt flooring and lays down nicely!
5.0	This heated bidet toilet seat is the best ever.  It really cleans, it warms and the seat itself is heated for those cold winter mornings.  I moved into a house that had french curve toilets and the seat no longer fits.  I love this seat so much I am switching out the toilet in my bathroom to one that fits so I can continue to use it.
1.0	plug it in turned it on and sparked and died
5.0	The lamp arrived promptly and looks very sleek. It works perfectly and is very bright. I love that the light part swivels as well as the base so there are many configurations to make anyone happy. The dimming function works well and you have one touch dimming as well as long press to move along the scale from dim to bright.
5.0	Yeah!!! Cable tensioners!!!
5.0	i replaced my outdoor lights with these and see a huge difference in coverage area and brightness. great product!
1.0	I ordered this for my daughter's birthday and she was heartbroken to open it and it wouldn't even turn on. I ordered a replacement and the second one, the swirling motion didn't work and the light wasn't glued in the bottom so it was off kilter. Worst quality I have seen and we gave up after having two terrible ones in a row.
5.0	easy to set up & works great. yes it doesnt seem really strong but i use it on my back pack to make sure it isnt tampered with and so far so good
5.0	Filter replacements are necessary, but as a single person I did not want to go with the Aquasana auto-ship every 6 months. I got about 9 months out of the previous filters. Work well and now the water flow is back to like-new.
5.0	Just as advertised, worked great to rebuild the dryer, runs like new again.
5.0	Very nice hotel quality fixture. Diverter is ceramic and seals tightly. Lot better than my old peerless spigot with plastic diverter.
1.0	Timing too slow. Conducts electricity so works in that respect. Also, not too happy about the removable clips. Returning for refund.
5.0	i purchased product just for what its for. i mounted these to the side of the driver's seat in my pickup and stuck my maglite in three months ago. the flashlight has yet to fall out by itself and the brackets are very sturdy and durable. i have kicked the flashligh a few times when crawling in and out of my truck and it still holds the flashlight tight! 5 stars!
5.0	This is a handy light. I have used it many times in which a flashlight would have not been convenient.
5.0	We were a bit skeptical when purchasing this simple seat-mounted bidet. After a month of use we are quite pleased. I thought the cold water would be shocking and uncomfortable. I was wrong; no problem. The installation was easy, too.  We are very happy!
5.0	These fit my Fender HM 412 speaker cabinet without changing the sockets. No scuffing our wood flooring now.
5.0	It was exactly what I paid for. If you're looking to convert 2-prong outlets to 3-prong outlets, you should get this product. Great and cheap.
5.0	Beautiful alabaster shades.  Will work well in my old bathroom in my old home. Somewhat matches my original 1917 fixtures.
5.0	It looks beautiful hanging in my hallway.  I have very high ceilings so it fits well and hangs down just the right amount.  It provides lots of illumination and just looks great.  It did take a long time to attach the crystal balls to the wire and then attach the wires to the base, and my fingers hurt afterwards, but it was worth it!
5.0	I installed in just a few minutes, works great
5.0	Works perfectly, and is just as good quality as one could ask for.......
5.0	This is so useful when you have a dog that always wants to be in and out and don't have the option for a doggie door. I highly recommend it.
5.0	I love this product.  Perfect fit and had dryer working great.  The price was so much cheaper than local venders it was unbelievable.
5.0	GREAT CORD! no issues at all.....:)
5.0	I wanted a small accent lamp for my kitchen and this lamp fit the bill.  It has a nice modern design and the color of the brown shade was an exact match to my existing color scheme. If you're looking for a nightstand lamp, this one is not for you ( it's 11 inches high). But, if you're looking for a nice, attractive accent lamp, at a very reasonable price, this lamp should do nicely.
5.0	These 6 inch replacements have been on my stove for a few weeks now and they work great i would recommend these to anyone looking to revive your GE stove. Make sure your connections and wires are in good shape before installing. Amazon sells the wiring harnesses.
5.0	Using to make screened bottom boards on my beehives. Good price. Thxxxx
5.0	Was very pleased with this product.  I had a huge tear in the soft top of my convertible (the plastic window part) that was about 2ft long.  This tape fixed it up good, and never had any water leak issues.  Its been on for about 2mths now with no problems.  Tape is very sticky!
5.0	Wow, using these bulbs actually cut our electric bill in HALF!  Great light, no heat from the bulbs, and the electric bill is sweet!
5.0	Excellent quality & best price, we are changing to lever handle for ease opening.  Easy to change from L to R and tool included. Delivery just as promised..
5.0	Easy to use and a good size - nice to keep on a key chain in your purse. Better than clipping to a visor.
5.0	Works great and love the dim control.
5.0	I'm using this to hide the cords for my surround sound speakers mounted on the wall behind my couch.  This looks much better than the bar wire hanging down.  I haven't painted it yet but that is on the plans when we get to really re-doing that room.<br /><br />I haven't had any problems with it sticking to my painted drywall walls.  It is Satin Valspar Premium paint.  I wiped the whole area with rubbing alcohol to get any fingerprint residues or anything else washed off before I put this up.  It is just up with double sided tape essentially so use common sense and don't put it anywhere that is oily, wet, or that could get that way and I don't think you'll have any problems with it sticking, unless you get a defective set somehow.
5.0	This is a beautiful light.
5.0	Love doing the dishes now!
5.0	Was $50 from sears. Saved me $200 on new opener and $35 on sensors. Very happy with this purchase. +
5.0	I love this light. I needed light in the pool equipment enclosure so I could see turn on and off the pool lights and waterfalls at night.  This is a really bright light that turns on when I enter the enclosure and turns off after I leave.  It is easy to install with the 2 screws that are provided.
5.0	the little pelican tactical 3320 pm6 is the way to go if you are wanting a compact light,its very bright and so small you dont even know you have it on you untill you need it.
5.0	Simply loves it.. It comes with solid packaging. Good size and great finish. Definitely worth the money!!
5.0	It matched the decor of the room exactly.  We bought it from a completely different place and you would not know it.  It completes the room.
5.0	Love these things. Originally bought them to fire up Christmas decorations inside our house. Now, I'm using them year-round to switch lamps on and off from the comfort of my sofa or bed (since it comes with two remotes).
5.0	Great for Chef's hands
5.0	I use this in my homebrewing setup to switch my pump off/on. It works perfectly for that.
5.0	went in fairly easy. hardest part was cleaning the fridge of food. Simple to replace the old one.<br /><br />the part itself is the same as the original, so I suspect the next time someone jams the door shut, it will break again. I guess I'd rather have this cheap, easy to replace part break instead of the door.
5.0	"Works exactly as advertised.  Seems well built.  It works well for my \\""Catit Design Fresh & Clear Cat Drinking Fountain\\"" I bought from amazon.  The cats trip the sensor and it turns off about 2 minutes after."
5.0	Great product.  I've gone back multiple times to purchase more as I am replacing all the older bulbs in my house with these super bright energy efficient bulbs.
5.0	We had a comic books birthday party at a local comic book store and I used this tape to wrap around water bottles for the kids, the parents wanted to know were I brought these water bottles. I use your duct tape for all the major holidays as well. I just brought the galaxy tape to wrap my outdoor plastic flower pot to make it look like a very high price planter. Love this tape.  I also brought the owl tape for our up coming Harry Potter party. So many uses and so much fun. I would like to see you make a larger roll in the future.
5.0	I loved these decals when I placed them in my kitchen. Even when I had to move from the apartment, they were very easy to remove without any damage. Would recommend this brand.
5.0	Have bought these sets 3 times and plan on doing so in the future. Includes all you need for a full year at a good price
1.0	This filter is touted as being reversible, so that you can extend its use.    I reversed mine after just 3 months, to have it get used gradually on BOTH ends, and not wait till it was actually over filled on just one side.    When I reversed it, the next day, the filter broke through releasing all the carbon pellets and particles.    It was a mess, and the carbon is small and hard AND SHARP jagged edged. You do not want this on your bathroom shower floor, I can promise you that.      It ruined my expensive Speakerman shower head that was attached to the filter!    Buy another brand. You'll thank me later.
1.0	The poor rating is for the mistakes in the delivery; the product is actually very fine...<br /><br />I ordered two of these. One came with brushed nickel hinges, the other with glossy polished chrome hinges. I returned the polished chrome version, as that does not match my bathroom, and a replacement was sent. I was very surprised that again, I received the polished chrome version. I checked (with my wife verifying) that the numbers on the box were actually correct, since the polished chrome version should have different two letters (Kohler K-4643-CP-0 for chrome rather than Kohler K-4643-BN-0 for nickel), but the content was wrong.<br /><br />Not sure if this is Amazon's problem, or Kohler's.<br /><br />I have requested a replacement for the second time, but this time Amazon asked me to re-order myself. I am afraid that again wrong item will be sent, so I am heading to Home Depot tomorrow to see if they have the seat. I'll buy it there if they do...<br /><br />Altogether, I bought three seats with brushed nickel hinges from Amazon (two elongated and one round), so the problem is only with the fourth (round) one...
5.0	My sump is crowded with the back up pump and the main pump in there together. The float switch was constantly getting hung up and failing to activate. The backup was handling the water so zero flooding but the alarm would go off. This switch is working great, the motion is straight up and down so no matter where the pump is positioned in the hole it does it's job. Highly recommended .
1.0	I'm quite surprised at the favorable reviews, which prompted me to purchase these for some mood lighting in the backyard. The lights are MUCH dimmer than pictured, so dim, they don't put out any light to speak of. The plug is substandard, flimsy and falls out of a standard socket unless the flat prongs are bent in. The ratan balls are a bit smaller than a tennis ball. I removed them, and inserted lights from a $1.25 string of lights I bought from a holiday clearance sale on every 5th light. At least I have a bit of light now. I threw the original string of lights out as they are junk and not worth the time and effort to send back since they were shipped from Thailand.
1.0	you must enter you pin slow with 2 sec delay in between digits or you'll get a message saying &#34;wrong number of digits&#34; as you struggle to get in your warm house ,  get the push button instead it works well , also auto lock kept reseting to off and z wave dropped off
5.0	I purchased one set to test these out.  The day I got them home and set them up, I knew I would purchase more.  They create a great mood with flickering or solid light, dim or bright and they work very well with the remote.  The second set works perfectly with the first set and original remote.  These will also make a great housewarming gift!
1.0	Purchased 2 of these and programed them to our 2 garage door openers.  They don't work from inside our vehicle.  If I get out of the vehicle then it will usually work.
1.0	Be very careful when threading the aluminum nipple for the log lighter.  It counter threaded then split when trying to get it back out.  Never got to use it.  Liked the feet idea to support it, ended up getting a blue flame at Ace so I had a log lighter.  Needed to have a better quality nipple to screw into it.  Saw some other reviewers mention this.
5.0	I use this for my server rack. I like the two outlets on the front-comes in handy. I've had several power outages and I am confident with this protection.
5.0	great light for the price. no issues.
5.0	**BEWARE**<br />This product does NOT come with extra red/black wiring as shown in the picture.<br /><br />The wire would be used to splice directly into a power source in the car without using the cigarette lighter button (please, do not use the cigarette lighter. it looks cheap and tacky.)<br /><br />IF YOU WANT TO SPLICE FOR POWER - simply cut the cigarette lighter button off exposing the black/red wires that are inside the black wire. Use those to splice wherever you want.<br /><br />After all was said and done, this product worked really really well and looked great inside my 07 Mustang GT! Lots of colors to choose from, bright but not too bright. One LED wire is longer than the other 3 which is PERFECT when trying to bring it to the back seat on the other side.<br /><br />All around great product with a very competitve price. You get much more than what you pay for with this.
5.0	Newer types of these outdoor covers seem awkward, and do not seem interface well with the wall surface which may be conformed to accept this type of cover. I would have had to rework and patch/paint the stucco if I used one of the newer types, not to mention many of them protrude off the wall much more and would be more susceptible to inadvertent impact damage. I got a few extra in case these get discontinued and any of the other covers break. Although a little more expensive, the original lasted a long time (must be at least 25 yrs old) and is used on a stucco exterior.
5.0	Item arrived as described and worked perfectly to replace our broken bin.
1.0	Worked for about 2 hours. After that remote stopped working, the power supply died, and the reciever wouldn't work. Would not reccomend
5.0	Excellent quality of materials. This lamp reminds me of the joys of spring. The flowers are so pretty and great choice of colors.
5.0	Beautiful lights, bright and colorful.
5.0	Give great light for doing projects.  Excellent, clean looking, easy to use.  Give just the right amount of light.
5.0	Just received this remote. Within 10 minutes of getting it, it was operational. Only ordered it a couple of days ago. Fantastic service, an works as advertised. Thanks.
1.0	I bought five of these last week because they were on sale... once they arrived I put brand new AA batteries (tested batteries also on tv remote) and all five of them did not draw power. The conductivity contact is terrible and I could barely fit the batteries in.... after an hour effort moving the metal contact around I finally got one to turn on... still no luck with the other four.... this device is garbage and I wouldn't trust its functionality even if it turns on after so much efforts... will try to return and buy another brand
5.0	Great stuff when painting.
5.0	Excellent . Works perfectly.
5.0	Appreciated the excellent photos of lightbulbs so that I could be quite sure I was ordering just what I needed.  Couldn't find this item anywhere in town so VERY MUCH appreciate that I could order them .
5.0	Great Product.  Just installed it.  Gives off great light. Awesome purchase.
5.0	these lights were bright and visiably the red white and blue I required.  Lights are close together and the length was perfect.  Very pleased with the quality
5.0	Great price on realistic candles. The timer is 5 hours, and this is reflected in the customer reviews, but not in the specifications for the product. The information doesn't even mention the timer.
5.0	This is great! My wife and I use one each as bedside lamps. The color matched the bed room decor.
5.0	These work great. I use dimmer switches all over the house and the cord is plenty long enough to be able to put the timer switch where I want it.
5.0	Other than my order being erroneously shipped to New York first, insteads of Minnesota, thus being 2 or 3 days late, everything was fine.  I couldn't be happier with my new floor lamp!
5.0	Looks nice.  Longer then standard faucet.
5.0	"Model PC-650  Size: 11'w x 8.25'd x 2.38'  The case appears to be nicely made and finished well. Setting up the battery installation takes a little time and a wrench/socket. Advertised as a \\""portable\\"" Security Case it clearly can fit into a lot of briefcases of normal size or in other various shoulder bags etc. Weight is modest enough to give the impression of security that smashing it on a rock or prying with a screwdriver etc. will not work. The installation diagram has the access hole for the security cable on the wrong side. The cable is fine for preventing or having someone trying to grab the case.  However, anyone with a pair of wire cutters could take care of the cable in a second.   I could see it as a cheap way to store a handgun at home and carry it to the range. It won't prevent determined thieves but is a deterrent from theft of opportunity or kids trying to get access. Or maybe the thieves will see the case and pass on it for easier targets. If someone steals the case, good luck getting it open and if they do well at least you tried to keep your valuable safe for insurance reasons."
5.0	This was very well made and just the right match to the sink I bought.  However, for me it was the wrong size.  I needed a garbage disposal sink stopper
5.0	Like the way it works, not to happy with the installation. Chinese plumbing does not match US. Had to adapt to fit but a nice faucet
5.0	Wonderful product. Great color and fast delivery.
5.0	CHEAPPPPP!!!!!!! and  same quality as other cords. Its hard to find a 100 ft cord for this price.. Cord is great for lawn work
5.0	Very nicely constructed lamp with a soothing glow.  This lamp is very relaxing.  I purchased another similar item from this company and they make a nice addition to the living room.
5.0	love it, perfect distance and lightweight....wish I could attach with holder on end plug is all it is missing...but I wraps with the orginal cord without falling off the hooks.
5.0	I bought these after a brand new picture frame I bought fell over and the turn buttons broke off. These worked perfectly as a replacement.
5.0	Perfect replacement for my Samsung fridge
5.0	GREAT OUTSIDER OPENER-BE SURE TO MATCH TO YOUR GENIE GARAGE DOOR<br />UNIT-EASY TO INSTALL MADE FOR UNITS AFTER 2010-SET YOUR OWN CODE -You will never be locked out again !!!!
5.0	These cable ties are ideal for the really tough jobs.  They are super strong and can hold 175 pounds of weight. I used them outside to help hold conduit to the brick wall of the house for the telephone and cable TV connections.  They are also strong enough to hold items securely to antenna assemblies.  They feature a double lock design that provides 50% greater tensile strength for the lock.<br /><br />I even had a gas tank start leaking on a gas powered sidewalk edger.  I could no longer buy the exact replacement gas tank I needed so I purchased an old one lawnmower gas tank for $5 and used 3 of these to strap it to the handles of the edger.  It is more solid than the original factory gas tank mounting and a lot easier than welding brackets in place to hold the new tank.  This was a real time saver!<br /><br />If you are looking to tie something into place securely and quickly this is the product to have!
5.0	This switch has it all.  I highly recommend it.  It made my life easier at a minimal cost.  I wish i owned it a long time ago
5.0	Am very pleased with the best product we have found out here when it comes to a shower filter that truly does what it is intended to and is as described correctly. Will continue to re-purchase as time dictates.
5.0	Sturdy and still going strong
5.0	Good product, works good. I used it for my stove exhaust fan. I liked the fact that there is a screen and a hinged door. When my fan turns on the door open, once the fan turns off it close. I hear a clunk when it close; also it stops the draft from coming in from the duct.
1.0	I agree poor design this part from amazon broke in less than month
5.0	Instead of buying a new door we decided to paint our old door and dress it up a bit with this knocker/viewer. It installed easily and looks fantastic on our door. Also, the quality of the product is excellent, it has a nice weight to it, not flimsy or light.
5.0	Worked first time.  The correct parts which actually fit my old faucet!
5.0	When power is applied to these little babies, lots of light emanates from them. It's as if they're made to emit light. But seriously... they're replacement bulbs. I ordered the least expensive ones that I could find and these were the ones. They work and that's all I was expecting. I'd buy them again if they're still as inexpensive.
5.0	functions great. just like a circuit breaker should. no problems
1.0	Thought it would be a great idea to connect all my peripherals (2 external HDDs, a printer and scanner) to this power strip using my computer (a laptop) as the Control.  When the laptop charged to 100%, it dropped power to all the peripherals. Then switched back on when the laptop battery fell to 99%.<br /><br />Rinse and repeat.  I didn't realize it for about 15 minutes, but by then the damage was done: it caused a loss of data on one of the two external hard drives and caused a mechanical failure on the scanner when it stopped mid-job.<br /><br />Worth noting, the device makes a clicking sound when it switches devices off.<br /><br />Maybe it'll work better for the kitchen appliances or stereo equipment.  Definitely NOT the device for my sometimes-mobile office!
5.0	Hi, I purchased these over 10 years ago When I saw them  on Amazon I just had to write a review.. I have a set on each of my patio doors. I installed exactly as directed. Both doors have been extreme temperatures, from beating down sun up in the upper 90's to low 100's to  below zero temps of  -10 with wind ,chills of -36.  They work wonderfully well. it. I installed them EXACTLY as directed and they have never fallen off they are as secure as the day I installed them.  It does say in the directions , I still have them, not to use windex or glass cleaner prior to installation but to use warm soapy water and be sure to rinse and remove all soap residue and dry with a clean paper towel before installing...It also says that if you don't  do as instructed they may not adhere properly,After  I see  that some people said there's did to stay on, maybe they cleaned with the wrong thing, or didn't get all the residue off.  I seem to remember another piece of paper that said to wait 24hrs before using. I simply put them in the flat position for 24 hours and didn't put them in the lock position until after that , to be extra sure that they were secure.<br /><br />Today I had a friend who just purchased a house with sliding doors and they asked me if I could find them some of the Burglabars, they will be having me order them in the very near future for them.  .
5.0	This review is specifically the LE 5W LED GU10 bulb. Compared to  the Triangle Bulb 6W LED and the Sunthin 5W LED (I'll try to attach a pic) I believe the LE is the closest to a halogen bulb. They, I believe, were all significantly brighter than the 35W halogen from IKEA. The LE bulb was also the smallest (shallowest) and was flush with the IKEA fixture I put them in (see pic).
5.0	excellent brand, the bulb have excellent lighting, definitely was what I needed.
5.0	Nice thick quality. I wish they gave more of the full sheets, or I wish I could find the sheets for purchase without the dots. I found another that was comparable, but these are definitely thicker and sturdier.
5.0	Cable was well made and ran through are wire pipes with out issue. Would buy more of the same if needed.
5.0	Softly lights a good size area. Great when approaching the front door and the porch lights are off.
1.0	Too small. I used the 8.5mm instead.
1.0	This is the worst $50 I've spent on something! Bad investment! The light that it gives is so weak it won't even decently light up my pathways. It should be very very dark for these lights to work. You need all 46 floodlights to light up a tree! My solar lights outperformed it by ten-fold! Bad decision!
5.0	I added this thermal switch to the output duct off the top of an outdoor wood furnace.  It has done a consistent job of turning on and off the circulating fan that brings  warm air into my house ducted into my forced air furnace.  It alleviates the blowing of cold air into my house before and after my furnace is hot enough to benefit from the wood fire.<br /><br />Easily installed at a  good price
5.0	I bought this prism on a whim and found it came from the same company I had purchased from before. It is huge and gorgeous and pristine and I love the rainbows it throws, from floor to ceiling.  It is brilliant and exquisite! This company has a very high quality of prisms and very good service.  Product was better than described. Very satisfied with the prism and this company. It makes my other prisms seem so tiny.  Highly recommended.
5.0	I had this professionally installed and it looks really nice in the room. The product quality is very good and I would purchase from them again.
5.0	Very happy with this showerhead!
5.0	I had a difficult time finding a battery operated smoke alarm that was just that and this one fit the bill and is working great, hope it lasts as long as my First Alert did.
5.0	Excellent addition to your home. Works perfectly. Highly recommended, and has a very nice smooth finish.
5.0	Great battery although alittle larger than the orignal it doesn't require as much recharge because of its capacity. I don't think it adds much weight to the overall drill motor..
5.0	Best adhesive you can buy.
5.0	This is a warmly bright set up, I put it on a mosaic I built for the outside of my home at the entrance. It is on all night long and adds beauty and a touch of security to the entrance. It is working just fine after two months.
5.0	The dual shower heads are awesome because it's not one head next to another but an all in one so it still looks good. You can have the shower head in hand while still being cleaned by the mounted head.
5.0	Don't Have time for detail, But I very pleased!
5.0	[[VIDEOID:bd1c1e6721017f4df32fa252dc014549]] Okay maybe not but as soon as you plug these up you have to smile at the random blinking of these colorful little balls of fun.<br />According to the specs they are not fully waterproof so care must be taken if used outdoors but I think these look like so much fun I think I'll put them inside where I can enjoy them more often anyway.<br /><br />If you wished to place them outside it wouldn't be hard to create a waterproof seal for the inline controller. Grab some silicone or other bathroom type sealant or liquid electrical tape brush it on and you should be fine.<br /><br />There are 50 total LEDs and it is 16.4' in length using black wire that should be easily hid during night use.<br /><br />Great way to cheaply add a nice effect to any venue.<br /><br />Review sample provided for a fair, unbiased, and honest review.
5.0	Great wire - cut extra length to allow you to wrap over itself and twist to make it secure, without having to worry about tying tight knots (it's thick so tight knots are difficult).
5.0	Very sold. Seems to be well made. Was easy to install.
5.0	I quickly learned that a standard doorbell transformer does not supply enough power to run two doorbells (one upstairs and one down).  This solves that problem.
1.0	This item is terrible! As another reviewer said, this is just a cheap plastic piece with a picture glued to it. The corners do have folds and the holes were very poorly punched out...you can still see the jagged edges when the screws are put in.
1.0	This steamer does nothing but blow tepid water around.  It has no cleaning or disinfecting power whatsoever.  Waste of money.  I couldn't believe that I could put my hand on the vapor coming out and it was barely lukewarm - and this was after waiting 30-45 minutes for it to get hot.  The green light came on but it never got hot.  Don't even think about killing bedbugs with this steamer - it doesn't even clean tile.
5.0	just what I wanted - they are pretty.  Thank you
1.0	Same issue as other reviewers.  I bought three Utilitech 4.8 watt LED bulbs (small base though) at a big box store at the same time for the same indoor light fixture, with plenty of air circulation. At an average use of 1 hour a day, a year later, two of the three bulbs have now died. The non-LED bulbs in the same light fixture prior to my switch lasted about 8-9 years. Twenty five thousand hours?? At $20 per bulb, what a waste of money.
5.0	Easy to install, being adjustable is a plus because many different people use the piano. Looks very nice either on or off.
5.0	In a remodel of a bathroom, it was hard to find a design that was neither too simple or too ornate.  This worked well for me.
5.0	Had a bad high temp switch, local appliance store wanted over $40 for the part.  Got this for less than $15 with next day shipping and my drier is up and running again. Will update if the aftermarket part doesn't last as it should.
5.0	Strung up some outdoor lights recently and this really brought it all together.  Size of the unit wasn't too bulky so it was easy to hide.  Tested the remote from various distances and farthest I got was about 50ft with 4 walls in between.
1.0	Product didn't work after 1 use. It just stopped charging. I wouldn't recommend buying this. I haven't dropped it or did anything to it.
5.0	There were already two reviews for this disposal when I looked, and both mentioned the size, and that it is necessary to make sure it fits.<br /><br />I have lots of room under my sink where the disposal goes, so I didn't think that would be a problem before I ordered it.  It wasn't, but only barely.  The difference is that this disposal is much wider on the top than most disposals, and wider than my old one.  I (or more accurately, hubby, who installed it) didn't have a problem with vertical size but the width at the top is right next to some pipe that I am sure does something important and probably should be left there, and that the narrower top of the old one didn't come close to.  He did manage to get it installed.<br /><br />It is heavy and seems very well made.  Its 1 horsepower is much more powerful than my old 5/8 horsepower one.  It grinds quickly and efficiently.<br /><br />It is quieter than my old one when it is running, before the garbage is put into it.  The bigger difference, though, is when it is actually grinding food scraps.  The old one sounded like a jet was taking off in my livingroom.  This new one is much, much quieter while being more efficient.  No leftover, ungrindable bits of cabbage leaves and core or other fibrous nasties.<br /><br />Of all the garbage disposals I've seen in operation, this is the second quietest one.  The quietest is an old one in my mother's kitchen, and I actually think it is too quiet because it is hard to tell if it is even turned on.  I don't know about the efficiency of that one, or any details.<br /><br />This one even has a nice looking and well-made stopper.  It seems to be quality all the way.  Just pay attention to size.
5.0	unlike the ones from Home Depot, these keep their elasticity in cold weather and don't crack & break from repeated stretching
5.0	It's bright, hangs as shown or like a bat, easy to switch on or off by a touch, and uses both chargeable and alkaline batteries simultaneously.  What's not to like!
5.0	quick shipping,easy set up for each batch of plants.cloning fruit trees,and very old strain of gardenias.great buy good lights.works perfect for our plants
5.0	Operates without error messages - machine like new.<br />For an inexperienced purchaser, information about how to disassemble and transfer parts from old unit to new one might be helpful.<br />I had no problem.
5.0	Perfect for what I wanted. Good quality and looks great.
1.0	So dull! I can't believe this is being sold!
5.0	I splurged and bought this as a temporary backdrop for a birthday party where the theme was &#34;sunset at the beach.&#34;  It fit perfectly width-wise on our 12 foot living room wall.  Our ceiling is 8 feet high so there was an excess of about 4 inches at the bottom.  I used thumb tacks to secure it.  It comes in eight sections in and includes wallpaper paste and directions.<br /><br />Everyone raved about it and we all posed every which way in front of it. The paper seems to be thick and high quality.  I was able to remove scotch tape from the back of several places without tearing it.  The image is perfectly reproduced.<br /><br />This is a real &#34;WOW!!&#34;
5.0	I have never had such a thirst for water as I did when I began to use the Seychelle water filter.  The water has such a pure, clean, refreshing taste now that I am drinking more water than I ever have in my life
5.0	With this wireless motion doorbell, you be alerted when someone is there.<br /><br />There is not much to do, just place the motion detector where you want it not to be seen. Then place the bell unit into a wall outlet where you can hear it. There are fifty different tones to choose from. Also, there is an antenna on the sensor to give you extended reception up to five hundred feet.<br /><br />Once this is done you have a good alert system. This will work great at a store to notify you of customers.<br /><br />I was supplied a sample for the purpose of review.
5.0	I love this, it serves as the night light for my daughter.
5.0	"Where have these been all of my life???  This is absolutely the best shower curtain \\""ring\\"" I've ever used.  They glide effortlessly over the rod.  They make changing out your liner or curtain hassle-free.  I love this product and highly recommend it to everyone!"
5.0	We purchased a floor model from our local dealer, but couldn't be more pleased with this. It is really well made - very solid construction and very heavy (lots of metal, solid joints). Several people who have seen it (including the electrician who installed it) have commented on nice it looks. When we were researching this item, we found that the manufacturer website notes this is made of 70% recycled steel, so we were even more pleased with our purchase.
5.0	Perfect. Works like new again.
5.0	Easy to install and doesn't leak. Gaskets are well made. It's just so much better using a screwdriver or drill to install. Way better than those with the thin nuts that you can never get really tight. If you're doing a sink job buy this take this from a plumbing contractor.
5.0	Totally worth it!!!  Saved us hundreds in utility bills
5.0	"I purchased this outdoor remote, as I became weary of plugging and unplugging the pump in the fountain on my deck anytime I wanted to have it running (the outlet box by the sitting area on the deck was also behind my sofa...another minor inconvenience). This remote works as well as I could hope for, and was a reasonable price. Initially, the pump outlet prongs were a little \\""snug\\"" upon insertion into the switch receptacle, but that insures a tight, waterproof fit. The enclosed instructions recommend that the remote switch is hung vertically on the wall, and at least two feet from the ground. The remote seems to work fine, and is efficient with turning the fountain on and off almost instantaneously. All in all; a good, sound product that suits my needs just fine."
1.0	Well, I'll try to keep this short and sweet.I installed this as per the instructions included within the package. It's pretty tight fit (used in a 36&#34; door frame) but I made it work. It definitely does keep some bugs out, but a pterodactyl managed to get past it which has me most dissatisfied. I think I'll be getting a refund.
5.0	Heavy duty and very solid.
5.0	good value , fits easily and is made of good quality, sturdy plastic
5.0	These worked extremely well for the outside lighting on my house. Color and brightness are excellent
1.0	It failed almost immediately
1.0	I acquired 4 sets of these for my privacy fences, they don't last, they turn yellow and fill up with water, you are always looking to replace them.....so if you haven't found a good one yet, I have...Home Depot $4.95 each and they are good, I have them on my front  rail fence - its been over a year and still they are looking and working great.....
5.0	Just received my new ice maker replacement kit from the Buy-It-Now store thru Amazon. Delivery was outstanding,KUDDOS to FED-EX, three days from ordering to installation!(WHY it takes other so called vendors 2 to 3 days just to ship,I'll never understand NOR will I use them). Buy-It-Now told me exactly what I needed,shipped the same day, and now I'm waiting for my first batch of ice for my HAPPY DRINK,(Parrot Bay on-the-rocks). Don't say it's too early to be drinking either,(2PM) blame the Buy-It-Now store and Amazon for the excellent service!!!!!!!!!!!  Update:That was yesterday, today is Sunday morning (Good morning Lord) and just to let everyone know,the ice maker worked exactly as advertised and the drink was delicious! Thanks again.
5.0	I live in a dorm-style apartment, as I attend a major university in CA and I am often at class or away for the weekend -- not to mention sleeping. It is nice to know that my person and possessions are secured against just about any sort of uninvited intrusion, from locking picking, to bumping and kick-in attack (for all deadbolt owners, I would highly recommend buy an extended, reinforced strike plate for your door frame).    My valuables and person are safe whether I am sleeping, living or leave. This is an excellent product ... I've already staked my life and possessions on it!!
1.0	"Bottom line, this product is HORRIBLE.  The smell of the product as it dries is like acrid vomit.  And the stench from the spray itself lingers literally for days.  I've cleaned up two food stains over the last week and not only can I still smell the chemicals, but it smells like puke now.  They need to label the bottle \\""New throw-up scent\\""!  I had 3/4 of a bottle left and I tossed it.  Next time, I'm cracking the bottle open and smelling before I buy!!!"
5.0	Just what I was looking for! Item received as described! Works Great! Push button is out side mounted to ciderblock wall since FEB 11 2014 with no issues. Good variatey of ring tones and nice and loud. Signal strenth is also very good going through 1 commercial metal door and block wall about 50ft away. Batteries sofar have lasted 11.5 months. Spend a little more $$$$ and you will get your moneys worth from the system.
5.0	Easy to install, perfect operation, great value!
5.0	Handy dandy four pack. Work great!!
5.0	I purchased these for a 4-panel wall near my cubicle.  I add them to the bottom all the way around and it makes the wall pop out and goes great with my cubicle decor - I added fabric to my cubicle panels....Everyone compliments the flowers and the arrangement.  Very beautiful.......will be purchasing another set for home.
1.0	Very hard to peel off and it ended up tearing so I had to thrown it away. I didn't like this product at all
5.0	This lamp is so nice especially for such a low price, there were definitely a couple of nicks around the edges of the lamp inserts with the unicorn on them but they are very small and almost unnoticeable. I have quite the shabby chic thing going on so the nicks are a plus for me even, but if you are looking for something that it mint, this may not be it, as I noticed another review complained about the same thing. I however, love this lamp!
1.0	I first saw this product or concept by someone that had a very small one at the bowling tournament in KY.  He explained how it worked and thought that was a very neat idea when you were in an area where you could not get your cell charged.  I went on the website he gave me and saw a larger version from what he had but the concept the same.  I contacted the customer service number from the site,  concept green solution, do  not sell the product directly.  I was given Amazon as one of the vendors and order the product. When I received the product their was no product manual, the person in customer service at Concept Green said their would be a manual with the product.  I was not sure if I had to charge the battery or just plug it into the cell phone.  However, the USB  cables that came with the product did not fit my Galaxy3.  So I tried it on my computer to see if it would power my computer's battery.  Because their was no manual except for directions on the back of the &#34;cover&#34;  stating that click 1,2, or 3, was not sure way the light on the charger was just &#34;red&#34;. should it turn green at some point. Well, the battery charge just got low and never charged.  When I send a e-mail to the company, I received a response back that it certainly worked with the Galaxy 3 and it must be an error on my part as to not knowing how to insert a USB cable in the unit!!!!! When I tried calling to speak with this person, no one at the company knew where this person was and they could not address my question as to whether or not they had other attachments.  I simple returned the unit. Too bad because I like the concept.
1.0	Wouldn't stay locked into my drill.. Kept falling out😥😥
5.0	This is the cutest little solar light! No batteries!  Bright!  Can't wait to take it camping!  I may buy another..
5.0	Our sensor lights completely stopped working when the winter came along.<br />We bought these and replaced the old ones with these and the door is like brand new.
1.0	This thermostat has never worked correctly. I got it for a heated dog house and its given me more worry that peace of mind for the dogs. It seems to work fine for only a few hours and then the screen characters just go crazy and it stops cycling the heater on and off. Sometimes the heater just got stuck on and at 400w it drove the doghouse well over 100f.<br /><br />I dont trust the product or the manufacturer any more so this unit is going in the trash despite still brand new in appearance.  Obviously safety is the most important thing here so I'm going to have to go with a more reliable thermostat and different manufacturer.
5.0	I bought this just over 2 years ago, and like others, that model had a design flaw that had it leaking - but not badly - under my sink.    People - CALL THE CUSTOMER SERVICE NUMBER as others have said! 1-800-558-5712, then hit option 5. They offered me two options, either a service call to fix the problem at no cost (IF it turned out to be a design flaw), OR a new unit and a gift card! Took me 20 minutes, and I have a new unit coming and a visa gift card. GREAT service and its a wonderful unit. We used ours every day for tea, soups, to get a boiling pot going faster, I thought my folks were crazy/lazy for buying this thing, but in retrospect, I wont have a kitchen without one now!
5.0	This is a really nice faucet, extremely well-made and attractive, with good lines and a smooth, reliable water flow.  Really dresses up our powder room.  Note per the item specs that it is a fairly tall faucet and its stopper pull is located on the rear and pulls out at an angle.  This means that you need to leave a little bit of extra space behind the faucet to permit the stopper pull to work (i.e., give yourself adequate room and carefully plan the dimensions of your backsplash and/or mirror).
5.0	Used this month for cleaning furniture - very good product.  My furniture looks much cleaner.  No bad smell either.
5.0	Probably couldve just straightened the rod but I saw it after i bought this set. Bought my washer from craigslist.........anyways. (I think I bent one of the rods during move.) washer would shake VIOLENTLY on the rinse cycle. Bought this set and boom. No more washer earthquakes from the washer. Super easy install with another set of hands
5.0	This was the perfect replacement for the Synchron motor in my unknown-brand zone valve. My valve is very old and came with the unit I'm in, and the cover has been painted over, so I knew nothing about the original unit or brand. However, the motor looked just like this one with the same specs, so on a guess I went ahead and bought it. It dropped into my existing zone valve no problem. Works great!<br /><br />Very easy to do yourself and saved me tons of money on a plumber.
5.0	It runs more quiet , than the one I had before , also much cooler , and it was a better price !
5.0	I have a 5-6 year old Excel pressure washer rated to 2600 psi.  Jobs would be a hassle because of moving the machine, hose; everything would get tangled so I would get frustrated.  I attached this hose to the 25ft one that came with the pressure washer a now I do not have to move anything make the job lot less hassle.  Added benefit I did not think about is with the engine farther away or around a corner, you do not have to listen to a loud engine for hours.
5.0	Works perfect. Very loud and effective
5.0	I'm not a newcomer to this repair, I had done it a few years ago on a similar machine, so knew just what to expect.<br /><br />You'll know you need a new tranny when your machine sounds like a freight train roaring thru your house when it goes into spin cycle.  And from my previous research, there's no way to replace the worn bearing in this unit, and once it goes bad enough to make the racket, it'll only get worse and probably eventually self-destruct.<br /><br />Your first problem could be pulling the agitator out, it does come out without any fasteners or the like, just some sharp upward yanks.  That wasn't working, so inserted some shims under the base from side to side until it popped free.  Some folks have used a rope to help with that.<br /><br />Next, as many folks discover, you'll find removing the hub nut is, well, a tough nut. You can buy a special wrench, but that doesn't mean the nut will yield. It's an 1 11/16&#34; size, good luck finding a deep socket that'll fit at a reasonable price.  After using various tools and hammers, I gave up and drilled, chiseled the old one out, it is aluminum so will break up, just try not to damage the tub hub itself.  Of course, you'll need a new nut so be sure to order that.<br /><br />The next steps aren't so bad, this unit does come with a new seal (rubber) so you won't need that.<br /><br />As far as the unit I got from Amazon (actually Amazon Warehousedeals), I selected what they called 'used', I thought long and hard about that, after all I wouldn't want a really used unit where the bearing is about to go anyway.  But read what Amazon means by that, and to confirm, the actual unit looked totally unused, the packaging was very secure, so saved a few bucks going that way.  And a whole lot versus an appliance store.<br /><br />Before you go thru the expense and trouble of this job, you should evaluate the overall condition of your machine, if it's worth the investment or buying new.  That's always a risk but if you can do it yourself it's probably worth it.  I cringe to think what a professional repair would cost between list price and labor, that can't be cost effective.<br /><br />Now what to do with the old unit...?...Boat anchor?
5.0	Better design than what I could get at hardware store
5.0	This lamp focuses bright light right where you want it. I have it on my nightstand and I finally can read without strain.  I have the beginning of macular degeneration and regular light isn't enough.  I also used it as a flashlight for our Christmas service and it worked just like a spotlight.  Pretty cool concept.  Sister Jane Omlor
5.0	Wasn't sure I got the right filter but I got the right one and it fit perfectly. I would recommend this product.
5.0	Does everything i would expect. Instaltion was as advertised. Superb product. Not sure about longevity yet but trust SS.
1.0	I purchased many of these and they work for a couple of years and then fail.<br />The newer versions might be more reliable.
1.0	Can't get it to stay on the wall or on the door. We tried to use the tacks, we tried to use the velcro, we tried to use them together, nothing works :(
5.0	Great product.<br />Highly recommended
5.0	I’m excited to share with you my “2 Pack 6 Foot Extension Cables by Solid Cordz Review!” These premium 6 foot extension cords by Solid Cordz are the perfect solution to reaching your electronics and power equipment problems. Personally I think these would be a perfect add on gift for that man in your life. However these do come in handy just to have around for that time your close but not close enough.
5.0	When my previous Badger disposer started leaking from its reset button (apparently a fairly common failure), my handyman recommended that I replace it with the same model.  His experience with Badger is very positive.  The previous Badger was in my home before I moved in.  It lasted for at least 6 years for me, and I'm not sure how long the previous owners had it.  The new Badger is fine, and I've had it for almost a year.
5.0	exactly as advertised.
5.0	Didn't work with carpet and carpet
5.0	I don't usually leave feedback but these candles are are ver good value. They arrived quickly and were very well protected in little individual boxes.
5.0	I bought these for a beach trip where we would be walking at night looking for nesting sea turtles. We rubber-banded red cellophane over it so we wouldn't bother nesting mother turtles. It ended up pouring buckets so I'm glad we had waterproof flashlights.
5.0	Bought this for my son's dorm room. It's a perfect light for his desk. The two color temperature settings are nice and the controls work perfectly. Highly recommend.
1.0	Bought it in December... it's the beginning of may, and the seat part has completely cracked. Got a good pinch on the back of my thigh to go along with it. My previous toilet seat was on the toilet for nearly five years... and was only replaced because of a home hair-dye mishap. The easy clean hinges are nice... I'd buy them on another toilet seat... but this one is cheap. I can't understand where all the good reviews are coming from. Avoid it.
5.0	Easy to install. Easy to program. Exactly what I needed. Tuning on on sunset(depends on your location) and shut down on preset time.
1.0	The nut that holds the main shaft is almost the same dimension of the threads.  If you are very careful you can slide nut down the threaded shaft without turning it.  So, obviously you cannot tighten the nut.  Once there is the slightest amount of pressure, it will just spin.<br /><br />Amazon is so tired of returns that they are putting a stop to it.  My online buying days are nearing their end.  If you are not purchasing something that you have already purchased and are satisfied with, i.e., canned food, clothes of the same brand and size, then it's a 50/50 gamble that your purchase will be satisfying.<br /><br />The overall problem is, neither Amazon, nor it's retailers will feel the feedback of unsatisfied customers.  There are enough people out there shopping for the first time, hoping for the best, and willing to toss their purchase in the trash because it's too much trouble to fight the system, that these businesses will continue to profit.<br /><br />I hope to someday live in a world of accountability.  Where you look the store owner in the eye when he sells you something.  Knowing if the purchase is sub-par, he will see you again soon, and not in a pleasant mood.<br /><br />So, realistically, I know this is the future.  But I choose not to be taken advantage of.  And since returns is not a viable option, I choose not to do business with them.<br /><br /> Dear Amazon, please choke on your own vomit.
5.0	Hung the chandler over my bath tub.  It looks beautiful.  I opted to not put as many crystals as were holes to hang. I truly love looking at it.
5.0	This style lamp is impossible to buy even in stores that sell lamps...not available at Target or Wallmart......not expensive and I need this lamp to draw plans and also to swing to a side desk to work on computer...it is invaluable...I had one years ago and gave it to a grandson when I retired...now I have begun to do a bit of drafting and needed this light...Amazon is great especially Amazon Prime...
5.0	This is a nice rustic, solid metal piece.  It perfectly matches the wrought iron look of the rest of our &#34;castle&#34; style door. Very heavy.
5.0	This product is absolutely amazing but somehow the keys were stolen from me. SENTRYSAFE please HELP! me!!!! Im struggling right now and dont know what to do.
1.0	Not good! Batteries were low quality and I had to spend extra money to buy better ones so the lights would actually work.
5.0	Everything met the high standard I expected.
5.0	This is a must-have for doing projects with fine detail.  The lens is plenty big, the bulb give good light without shadows, and it will hold it's position when set.  The sturdy heavy base makes it easier for me to place than a model with a floor stand or one that clamps to a work surface.  Excellent value!
5.0	Worked very well for the replacement of a Fender bass amp volume knob.
5.0	I got a older model garage door opener on craigslist with no remote. I got this door opener plug-in receiver and it works great
5.0	Very nice product working fine after using many times. I would recommend this to all who are looking for this product.
5.0	We rally haven't had a chance to try it out,but I am sure it is going to do just fine..
5.0	Ooooooo my gosh , love it. You can turn you lights off and just use your shower head.......best thing ever! Bought two
5.0	I have purchased many of the Carpe Diem hardware designs and all are exquisite. I always get complements on the hardware, even from service men. I like the fact that the hardware is made in the United States! Carpe Diem is the only brand I will have installed in my home. It is the most beautiful line of hardware I have found and also well made and durable. Thank you Amazon for your low price!
1.0	Does it light up?  Yes.  That's about the extent.  I use 60 watt halogens in a small hallway light fixture, and since I have switched to LED's for everything else, I figured, give this a shot.<br /><br />The color is about 25% as bright as the halogen.  In other words, completely worthless.  The color of the light is very cold, whitish and almost hints of green.  Put the bulb in, turned it on and waited a minute or two, just looking at the horrendous product.  Took the bulb out and threw it away.<br /><br />If you are considering this bulb, don't bother.  G9 bulbs are simply not there yet with LED technology.  Stick with halogen for now.
1.0	It didnt meet my needs . The heat didn't come up when programed and I will return this product !
1.0	I was so pleased with this when I first hung it on my windows.  Easy to put up and just the right amount of transparency.  However, the next day when the sun hit, off it came.  Just won't stay up.  So disappointed.
5.0	I installed them in my new house myself.  They work great and look fantastic.  I would highly recommend them for anyone.  I had mistakenly order some of dark bronze and some or oil rubbed bronze.  The company contacted me to let me know they were different colors and did I mean to do that.  I though that was really nice of them.
5.0	I bought 2 packs because I was worried that some lights might not work/dimmer than others/etc. but I was very pleased to find out that all are working and brightly too!
5.0	Great customer service. Great quality product
5.0	Home Depot didn't have it, despite their web site suggesting otherwise.  Thanks to Amazon for saving my old torchiere from the landfill.  It is brighter now than with the old bulb, although that could have simply been due to years of dust caked on it.  The dimmer still works.
5.0	I now have 4 of these hooked up to my 12 volt off grid solar power system. I use 2 30 Watt solar panels to charge them and run low wattage LED light and small 12 volt fans and also use to keep my power tools charged. I have not been disappointed.
5.0	It was exactly as described and fit perfectly.
5.0	Nice looking drain cover and mechanism. Works very nicely, Smooth operation. Drains well. Easy installation. Packed well, but was initially difficult to see if all the pieces were sent.<br /><br />Recommended.
5.0	Dude.. It's Kohler. It won't disappoint. :-/ lol
5.0	My second set as I wore out the originals after about 8 years of use.  These are the best tie downs for a ZTR on a trailer.
5.0	love this sink ... great buy and beautiful
5.0	I purchased the trim pad remover to remove a door panel on an Envoy.  I have found a couple of other uses for it.  It works as advertised.
5.0	Working and looking great on my Westinghouse ceiling fans I put on my front porch.  Color matches perfectly!
5.0	Fit perfectly into furnace filter opening.  I think it will save a lot of money over disposable filters.  No need to throw it away.  Just rinse with water, dry and re-install.
5.0	I have been dis tilling my water for many years, and wore out my other distiller.  This one is upgraded from my former distiller, and it works great.
1.0	Sorry to say that these lights give an unnatural white, harsh lighting. Standard candelabra bulbs with a conventional filament create a much warmer atmosphere over a dining room table. Also, these led's have a large lens beneath them that keeps the light aimed at the ceiling, rather than an even, uniform light dispersal. I was very surprised because I own many FEIT bulbs. For instance, the globe LED's used in the bathroom have a much warmer look. The candelabra style, however, have a severe light, not unlike fluorescent bulbs. Too bad, I had hoped for a better product.
5.0	its a great bulb ,at a  great price and i  got them quick i am very happy with my purchase
5.0	These are just perfect for my aromatherapy room and My kids want them for their bedroom.  Perfect lighting and so many options on the remote.  And came with extra set of batteries!
5.0	Used to fix my bed. needed something to hold wood together worked perfectly would purchase again.
5.0	expensive, but you get what you pay for.  Great bulb, great color. Highly recommend.  You can't even tell it's an LED bulb by looking at it across the room.
5.0	I love Rust-Oleum spray paints.  We have a lot of steel objects in our garden and it's so easy to maintain them with a can of spray paint.  We've tried other brands and they don't hold up as long as the Rust-Oleum.  Besides there are so many colors and finishes to choose from.  It makes maintenance easy!
5.0	Gives options to connections, may offer a more secure connection for cables to phones for charging or other applications.
5.0	Great piece of equipment heavy well built and going to be very durable. We use it in the lab and it is working great so far. Only downside as with many things wish it were cheaper.  Otherwise great product.
5.0	We did it ourselves and saved a lot of money. Great product and pricing.
1.0	Okay, so I read all the reviews on this and other fans and decided to buy three of them.  Since I bought them online, I knew it would be a huge pain & expense to send them back, so I thought I did my due diligence when I shopped for it.  Problem #1 - It does NOT take 5 minutes to install.  If you can install it in under an hour, you are lucky.  It took my husband over 3 hours, which included a trip to Home Depot for extra screws.  Problem #2 - It does take a particular type of light bulb...one that gives very DIM light.  I had researched it ahead of time and found that there was a cheap attachment I could buy to use a regular light bulb (a GU24 to E26/27 adapter), so I bought three of them for $2 each.  They are only about an inch wide.  Perfect, I thought.  But guess what?  The light fixture will not fit with regular bulbs and attachment.  Now I am stuck with a dim ceiling light.  That means I have to buy another lamp for the room.  I am not happy about this.  Problem #3 - This is the worst of all the problems.  The fan is VERY WEAK!  It does NOT make a good breeze.  I don't know why this is, as I trusted the Hunter brand, but even on the highest of the 3 settings, it feels like what a &#34;low&#34; setting should be.  There is not good air flow.  So the very reason that I bought the fan is quite disappointing.  We only installed one of the 3 fans we bought.  I will probably sell the other two on Craig's List, as they are not worth installing in our house.  And by the way, we got quotes from two different electricians, both of whom quoted us $150 to install each fan.  So the &#34;5 Minute&#34; easy installation promise gave us incentive to save the money, but it really did not deliver.  I don't see how this fan was any easier to install than any other fan.  I would not recommend it for these reasons.  If anyone who has the fan knows how to get better air flow, please let me know.  UPDATE 8/2015 - We did install the other two ceiling fans, hoping that maybe something was wrong with the first one and these would work better, but that was NOT the case.  ALL THREE STINK!!!  We put them in our kids' rooms, which are smaller (about 12x12 feet), hoping that we'd have a better result.  The main problem is that they circulate VERY LITTLE AIR and only slightly cool you off if you are standing directly underneath them.  If you are 3-5 feet away, forget it...you won't feel anything.  What a complete waste of money and of time.  The second two still took a couple hours each to install (in spite of the learning curve after the first one), and additional trips to Home Depot for added parts.  Ugh!!!!  Do yourself a favor and go to a store to TEST THE AIRFLOW first.  I live in a hot climate and these fans were a complete and total waste of money.  Hunter, you really let me and my family down!!!!
5.0	Love these lights! super cute!
5.0	Really cool decorative item. Takes a whole lot of corks for the D anyway. But came out great!
5.0	The address sign looks as described.  The company provided the extra numbers that I needed at no extra cost and within them with a reasonable time frame. It was easy to installed and I received compliments from the neighbors.
5.0	Works perfect on a single LED bulb light fixture.  Just need to make sure you have a neutral white wire to use.  Dims really low too with no flickering.  Using with Smartthings hub.  Linked up easily.  No performance issues yet.  Been 2 months.
5.0	Works we'll on our outdoor  patio furniture cushions. Keeps the moisture and dust from penetrating the fabric. Just hose off and lay in the sun briefly
5.0	Very fast shipping. Excellent customer service. Heavy duty spike. The item is exactly as described. I needed another hay bale quick attachment to unload and stack hay when moving from fields around the county. I ordered the hay bale spear attachment with the three 27&#34; stabilizers and needed to add this 49&#34; HD spear. Titan Distributing has rapidly become my &#34;go-to&#34; for HD hay moving equipment. They go above and beyond to take care of their customers.
5.0	We have recently began buying the Best Tools: The Dewalt Jig saw  (DW 321) is certainly the best. It is a real pleasure to use, and I want to thank the engineers and workers at Dewalt, for the design and manufacture of this fine tool. We also bought a Dewalt(DW378G) framing saw and the Dewalt(DW621F) 2 hp Electronic router. They are all well designed and function perfectly. They are, no doubt, works of &quot;ART&quot;. We had planned to buy the Dewalt (DW744S) portable saw with the rack and pinion fence. Two carpenters, who were re-modeling an old house at Mooresville, raved about their Dewalt (DW7445)saws. But...we have decided for furniture construction, to buy the Dewalt DW746K table saw, from Amazon.com. Today, we looked at the price of fine furniture, and I believe, we can make these tools payoff rather quickly. It won't be easy, but it will be fun, as one approaches retirement.
5.0	They looked really good
5.0	If you want to lay the rule flat on an object or wall without unfolding the whole thing, then this inside reading rule is the one to buy.  Most folding rules are outside reading.  I find them to be a nuisance to use, and wonder why they exist.  In my remodeling and woodworking the inside reading rule is the right one to use for ease and convenience.
5.0	Exactly what I expected and it was great. Good size and easy instructions.
5.0	Product is sturdy. nice quality for the money.
5.0	I keep my hand gun in it, away from my children. Perfect for dresser draw or closet.  Just remember it portable so it can be Easley taken by anyone.
5.0	this was a great product at a good price
5.0	Finally I can see out my front door! The view is huge which distorts and probably makes the person a little harder to tell who it is but I like that I can see my whole front porch.  It was very easy for my husband to install as he already had the correct drill bit, only took about 3 mins from start to finish! Cant imagine why it took me so long to get a peephole!
5.0	Very good unit.  Eliminates making another hole in the ceiling and provides a clean look.  It runs quietly and effectively evacuates  steam from the shower.
5.0	Loved this lightbulb. I added it to one of my lamps and placed it next to one of my tropical plants in my living room and it enhances every get together I have at home.<br />It was delivered much quicker than I thought and I loved how easy it was to use for the price.<br />I have several of them throughout my apt. and every one who comes over loves the different moods I set with the lights in my remote control.<br />I would love to see a flood light that you can control colors on it as well. I would buy that definitely if it became available.
5.0	Works great.  Love the convenience of 2 plugs plus 2 USB connections.  Plus the fact that the outlets rotate makes it easy to have two items plugged in at once.  Good deal!  I have had this item about 6 weeks and no problems so far.
5.0	I bought the light fixture based on the picture and reputation of Hunter being a good company.<br /><br />The fixture came in well packed ( actually very well.  I was impressed with packing details )<br /><br />The fixture even come with 4 Compact Fluorescent light ( CFL) bulbs, which tells me Hunter is very detailed and thinks about it's customers.<br /><br />The fixture is very well designed, look good and easy to assemble to the fan, which is another excellent design.  The price I paid is very reasonable. Thank you Hunter.
5.0	I saw this light in a high-priced showroom for nearly twice the price and immediately fell in love.  When I found it on here at such a discount, I was ecstatic.  This light is just stunning and the beauty of it cannot be conveyed on a computer screen.  I had an electrician install the light in my formal living room and this fixture alone illuminates the whole room.  No additional light is needed.  The crystals hanging on the inside give it a really sparkly, expensive look and the cutouts in the drum create a beautiful pattern of light and shadows on the ceiling and wall - it almost looks like a sunburst.  It is impossible to walk in the room with the light on and not notice it immediately.  My husband wasn't too excited about the light before it was installed (he thought it was too girly), but now he loves it almost as much as I do.  I expect to receive a lot of compliments on this light!
5.0	Love em.<br />brighter than the last led's I purchased.<br />these use the newer surface mount style led.<br />also initial perception is they look to be better suited for my landscape lights. (Outdoor)<br />Would like to update in 6 mo. or a year to see how they last.
5.0	Our ice machine went out.  This fit great and got us back to the awesome Sonic ice we love.
5.0	Seems to work as advertised.  Noticed a decrease in sinus issues within the first week.<br />Plan on buying another one for use on the other plenum as well.
1.0	May be an excellent product, but I can't find out because the company will not ship to Alaska. Same problem with the replacement filters, of course. Very bad business decision on their part. In reality, it costs no more to ship to Alaska than it does to any other state. Companies charge more simply because they can get away with it. And companies who will not ship to where I happen to live do not deserve my business anyway.
5.0	Worked perfect to pinstripe my project.
5.0	Great book light and was just what I was looking for. The light illuminates brightly for me to see perfectly unlike others I have purchased. The flexible 'head' makes adjusting a breeze.
5.0	easy and cute, just stick on and peal off, can reuse
5.0	Love it. Everything as advertised. easy to put together. I used 40 watt bulbs instead of 60.<br />Well packed.
5.0	Although it took the installer a bit of work to figure out just how to install this, it ended up looking perfect in my stone fireplace. A good price and a very nice product. It also arrived amazingly quickly.
1.0	not happy with this purchase as the fan direction blows downward instead of intake and on top of that received a white blade instead of the black pictured on the product description leading me to think this shouldn't be the product i ordered.
5.0	Love it works awesome in my house and shipping was fast love everything about it
5.0	Took a chance on the cokor and was a great choice. would recommened if it matches color palette good materual
5.0	"The lamp [[ASIN:B004WPZSHO 5 Diopter Clip-on Salon Fluorescent Magnifier Lamp Ul]]seems to be well made and gives a good level of light for close & small work in my otherwise, rather dark work space.  The 5-diopter lens is great for inspecting close up but it may need to be too close to the work to get in behind it with, f/ex, a soldering iron.  (This is by no means a complaint; it's a necessary optical trade-off.)  It easily reaches across my 36\\"" deep desk, and stays put.<br /><br />It arrived in some scruffy looking packaging and in several ways appeared to have been an open-box return, though the lamp itself looked and works fine.  I wrote to the seller (DBM-INC) about it, who  agreed that the presentation was not up to their standards and told me it had been shipped directly from the warehouse, not from them.  They were apologetic and offered several choices to make it right, and they followed up immediately.  I can recommend both the product and the seller."
5.0	We ordered this because I saw one in someone else's house and immediately fell in love. Its quite substantial in size and looks lovely when illuminated. I will be ordering a few more for other rooms in the house. They make great night lights too!
1.0	I just sent back my 2nd defective lamp.  I thought I'd give it another shot after the first lamp didn't work.  The replacement lamp arrived today, the very next day, but unfortunately it doesn't work either.  Not replacing it this time.  Looking for a full on return.
5.0	Easy to put together. Works great.  Nice and stable.
5.0	Once you get it going it gets easier to install. Once installed its bigger than picture shows. Looks great. Missing some crystals and they fed ex wright away no questions asked. I would recommend and thinking about buying another for a different room.
5.0	I ordered two of these for my husband's shop. One for metrics and one for standard. They are heavy duty, roll - unroll nicely, lots of pockets, carry handles. I marked stardards with a piece of red ribbon tied to the handle and now life is much easier! Definitely recommended.
5.0	For those debating about whether to get a Bidet or not, wait no further and get one. It's the best thing ever. And this Luce Neo 180 is a great buy, good construction and easy to install. And it looks perfect on a toilet, not like something out of place.<br />I'm very happy with the purchase, and all my friends that come to my place, are always curious and a 'convert' after trying it out :)<br />I like this model because of the self cleaning function, and the switch for normal wash and for the women also.
5.0	Does what its made for.
5.0	"I have now had this collector install for about 5 months.  It is better then what I expected with the amount of lines and distance the dust must travel.  I would recommend this to anyone that is starting up a wood shop and like myself, on a budget.  Great valua for the price.  I have this outside so the noise is not that great of an issue.  It would be loud if inside the shop, but consider what you get for the money...well worth the buy.  Easy to assembly and with the 6\\"" outlet, then from teh factory, with a provided adaptor, it can be steppend down to three 4\\"" outlets if you wish...I ran a 6\\"" line the length of my shop and branched off with 4\\"" lines at various points with blast gates.  Works great for me...should be considered if you need a good collector."
5.0	Water filter works great..it is original equipment replacement and saves me $10 over the updated new DROP filter.
1.0	Did not fit GE Microwave Oven JNM 1951
5.0	The only way this could be better is if they made it lighted.<br /><br />Hope they come out with an L5-20 version, too!
5.0	Never thought I'd find this type and size bulb.  It's for an ancient portable vanity mirror. What a surprise and delight to be able to finally replace the old bulbs.  Thank you!
5.0	Used this on stained wooden front door that had weathered.  It greatly improved appearance and feel of the front door.
5.0	This lid is very substantial, weighs more than cheap plastic, the slow close rim and lid works great.  Love it, bought 3 total.
5.0	I'm not sure how these could've worked better. They had clear instructions for how to drill pilot holes and bit into the material very well (in this case my home's brick facade).
5.0	It's easy to use and clean. Great!!! Look professional. The design and the material look very neat. We love it.
1.0	Bought at Home Depot for almost $25 to save a few bucks over the similar-looking Kohler product.  That was a mistake.<br /><br />I bought this to replace the plastic sprayer guide that broke on a cheap faucet the previous homeowners had installed.  I couldn't find a brushed nickel guide in the store, so I bought a whole new sprayer to get the guide.<br /><br />The sprayer looks nice, but you can't tell until you take it out of the package that's entirely plastic.  So is the guide.  Big disappointment.<br /><br />The quick connect adapter on the sprayer side is impossible to connect reliably.  There is nowhere flat to hold the adapter as you tighten the nut from the hose.  And Vise-Grips would just break the plastic piece.  On top of that, frankly, that adapter isn't very useful; it's not like I take my sprayer out of my sink twice a month, after all.  So I gave up on the adapter and went on to attach the hose directly to the faucet.<br /><br />Then, to top it off, the brass nut on the hose sheared off from moderate tightening, rendering the whole product unusable.<br /><br />I'll be returning this, and Danco won't be getting any more of my business.  This product is a joke in all regards.
5.0	Super Duper magnets, I have purchased several of their different sized magnets and have found them all super strong for the size, the bigger the get the harder they hold.<br /><br />Not your run of the mill refrigerator magnet for sure a couple of hand fulls of them will pull your fridge over. Some of the larger sizes come with a plastic separator between the magnets take it out and you will find out why it is there, you can't get them apart again without using some effort and tools.  I had to slip a brass putty knife between them to get them apart again and, wow, what work that was I won't let that happen again.  These are NOT A TOY, the larger ones will hurt you if you don't give them a little respect, keep them away from the kids and the klutzes.
5.0	Serves the purpose well.
5.0	I can't believe how high quality these look for the price. We haven't installed or used them yet, but they look absolutely perfect!
5.0	Fit perfectly now washer n dryer open same direction!
5.0	Easy install and love the 4th speed. I use it with a Hunter fan.
5.0	Looks good on my desk and gives it a regal feel even though it is cheap price.  Green glow seems to give the right amount of light.
5.0	The illumination provided by this lamp is absolutely fantastic!  The intensity can be changed from very, very bright, to a moderate level, and the color can be changed from a very white light to a yellowish color as found with incandescent bulbs.  The illumination is constant with no flickering.  The lamp has LED bulbs and does not emit heat while it uses a minimal amount of electricity.  Positioning of the light is very variable and the span of the illumination display is broad.  I would give the functionality of this lamp a maximum score.
5.0	I had a belt driven garage door opener with steel rollers.  These fit perfectly and reduced the noise to almost silent.  Great product!
1.0	Rusted with in days! Screen has to be very poor stainless steel to rust so fast, if it is stainless steel!
5.0	Just got it so don't have much of a review.. it's quiet.. easy to hook up. Hopefully it's a great product.
1.0	I'm paralyzed, so I have to depend on my roommate/caregiver to do everything for me. He cannot get these to work. I don't know what to do, or who to call. They just are not working. So, today I went out and bought a baby monitor, and hopefully that will get the job done at a more primitive level. I just need a way to call into the other room to get people's attention if I need them to come into my room. I used to have a couple of Chamberlain wireless intercoms, but about a week or 2 ago, they stopped working and even Chamberlain technical support could not get them going again. Since I cannot afford another pair of wireless intercoms, I went for these instead. They actually sounded like it would be better, judging by the reviews they received. However, my not terribly mechanically inclined roommate could not get them going. Desperate to find something that would work since the alternative was isolation and being cut off from the rest of the house, I went to Walmart today and bought a baby monitor for $15. We'll see how that works.
1.0	The soft close cabinet door damper is made of plastic and does not work. It was a waste of money. It actually kept some doors from closing completly. I bought 20 of the dampers and did not use any of them.
5.0	Installs with single screw and two slip-on connectors. Exact match of OEM thermofuse. Shipped very quickly via regular mail. Installs in minutes.
5.0	Great lamp for the price.  Love the light settings and the timer...
5.0	Nice and sturdy. Item is true to its description, and will be great for using in a camping situation. :)
5.0	An absoulutely awesome product!  I thought fixing the latch was going to be much more difficult.  I decided to give the Gator Strike plate a try before I went any further. It worked perfectly and needed no further adjustment.
5.0	Now and again you hold something in your hands and just feel the quality.  Just the right balance.  Just the right heft.  This is my new favorite flashlight.  It fits my hand well, with machined grooves allowing my fingers to wrap around the shaft with tactile confidence.  The battery compartment (3 AAAs, arranged in a carousel) is sealed with an o-ring.  The top bezel is too-- except that unscrewing it serves no purpose, since _nothing_ accessible is replaceable underneath (including the front plastic lens.)  It's a great value even at the retail price charged here, though you can find them cheaper elsewhere.  Did I mention that the high setting is blindingly bright?  Pros: Inexpensive, well built, bright, great for confined spaces and close up work.  Cons: Cannot twist bezel to focus beam, cannot replace thin plastic lens if broken, not so good at a distance as it tends to wash out all color.  But really, for its size and its price, who cares?
5.0	The 1-inch PEX tubing was used to extend a water supply line in the house in the basement. The tubing is the latest in technology in this case replacing the copper pipe that has been used in the past. Installation was faster and easier than with copper. The tubing was shipped to my house within a matter of a few days. We used all but 5 feet of the 100 foot roll.We had no problems with the supplier in ordering or the product description.
5.0	I've upgraded all of my mini Mags with this
5.0	Good product, fast shipping.
5.0	As expected I needed this to allow communication between the modules. It does what it should and is easy to install.
5.0	I am a correctional officer and I wanted to secure my bookbag when I went to lunch;  or walked away from it.  This product was just was I needed, I didn't even know  that it was invented--but I can tell you that it sure does work.
5.0	Easy 1/4 turn ball valve turns water on or off with little effort, and provides a solid seal against leakage.
5.0	best price i could find
5.0	Works Great! Bulb is bright, & the colors are great. Great price! Screws into any standard light fixture..
5.0	I bought this pump to drain the water off of my inground pool cover. It works perfectly!  It connects right to your garden hose and is very easy to use.  I am very satisfied with this purchase.
5.0	Bought a pair over 11 years ago for my washing machine and have never had a problem.  They came with a 10 year warranty and are high quality, and now that they are over 10 years old I will replace them with the same just as an extra precaution. Highly recommend.
1.0	The lamp is so very small. I was looking for a bigger night stand lamp. This is more like a just for decor lamp.
1.0	Would not buy!!  Plate would not sit flat.  Sent one back recieved another just as warped.
5.0	After all the hype and wait for this product, I was ready to feel underwhelmed, but I can honestly say its great.  We have a Sonos, 3 Philips hue lights, a belkin wemo wall switch, a Nest and an Insteon light (on our porch).  Revolv got on my wifi in under a minute and found EVERY device in under 3 minutes...on its own!  I was blown away.  Im just now creating some macros (they call them Actions) so i'll post more later once I've got more experience but for now, its two big thumbs up!
5.0	OEM  parts great price. Great seller
5.0	I only  needed a short run of flashing and could not find it at my local big box, so was pleasantly surprised to fine just what I needed at Amazon and cheaper even with delivery. It was delivered two days early and is as advertized. I needed it for my beekeeping equipment, so am a happy camper that I got off so cheaply for a quality product.
5.0	I works and cheap. Thank Amazon
5.0	Worked perfectly. Took about 15 minutes from start to finish to replace.
5.0	This filter does exactly what I expedted. The cap was a big disappointment however. It broke when an ice cube fell from the ice maker and hit it.
5.0	Worked great on my move. I secured the motorcycles and with these could place the straps so there was no damage.
5.0	This tape was purchased for my youngest brother who is a huge OSU fan.  He loved it and it was delivered in a timely fashion and was what I expected.
5.0	The motor was an exact replacement. Easy install with correct wire terminations. Met all of my expectations, would buy again.
1.0	Had to send back ... the label was expired and sealant was so hard it would not come out of the tube. :(
5.0	I initially had a problem with my order, but Lemon Tree quickly resolved it.  That's actually why I am writing this review.  I appreciate doing business with people that makes things right.<br /><br />Now on to the lights.  The lights look really cool.  The colors are bright and have a lot more gradients than shown in the picture.  Each color button represents a distinct shade.  You can also dim or shut off through the remote, and it has some neat display modes.<br /><br />The long narrow neck allowed this light to fit a fixture that another one I bought does not fit.  I bought these lights for accent, and they have a decent white color, but I prefer the warmer light from some single color LEDs I have for main room lighting.
5.0	exactly what I wanted.  I had purchased one many years ago from another source and paid a whole lot more.
5.0	Keeping my blueprint chemicals ready to go in this cold climate.
5.0	great service product as expected
5.0	Purchased four of these for a custom bench I was making. They arrived in a timely manner and worked as well, if not better than I expected. In fact the bench sold the day after I finished it and the buyer said the deciding factor was the size and color of the casters.<br /><br />I'll be buying more for future projects.
5.0	This is a very elegant handle and looks lovely with my black cabinets.  I really wish there was more to say about it and how wonderful it is, but it's just a handle...I totally recommend it though :)
5.0	Buy in multiples (obviously)! Works great! Be sure to set the alarms on the same frequency by putting the same 'code' in the back (it notch-style switch board) I put one of these in a mother-in-law suite that is located about 30-40 feet from our house. I've tested a few different times and it seems to have quick response. The alarms by themselves seem to be of great quality. I would highly recommend these for garages, cottages, or anywhere you want to keep safe from fire on your premises.
5.0	Works as expected, what can I say?  Nice to have a remote for a candle you may not want to automatically turn on every night.  I do find, though, that the built-in auto-on 5 hour timer on the candle is sufficient, and tend not to use this as much as I thought I would.
5.0	Great Lock.  This lock locks it in place.  And if you think someone can pick the lock.  The keys are just as good as the lock.  The keys come with all different groves to make it hard to copy.
5.0	This is fantastic! I ordered this to try out for my wedding decor. Super pleased! The remote works my vizio soundbar which is odd. The lights are bright, long lasting and will make your wedding decor stand out! Will definitely be ordering more!
1.0	"Watch it when ordering this pack of connectors!  Just under 50% are defective. The plastic molding process that is used, left many of the connector holes plugged up.  This is a good example of, \\""you get what you pay for!\\"""
5.0	Built very solid,great size for legal documents.Water proof and fireproof for a limited time,I felt is a good value.
5.0	FAST delivery.  GREAT product for the price.  EASY to install.
1.0	It's actually very nice looking but i gave it one star because it is so hideously dim. How can they advertise it as 75 watt ? No friggin way !
5.0	Very cute small chipping of the paint this is in an outside porch.
5.0	Well made.  Fits mailbox perfectly.
1.0	Awful this package came in bent and after only a day the decals are falling off of the walls :( so dissapointed.
1.0	Used this vacuum less than 10 times and the belt is torn.  Terrible, wish I could return the whole thing.
5.0	Great finish, easy to change out
1.0	I tried to use this but had to tape it up because it does not stick. It also does not install the way it should on the inner side facing out corner of the door, I had to install it on the inner side facing the door which was not great. I went and purchased this instead is is MUCH better!!! Frost King V25W Extreme Rubber Weather-Strip Tape 5/16 Inch-by1/4-Inch by 17-Feet, White  [[ASIN:B000B4N3OA B000B4N3OA]]
1.0	With others giving glowing reviews I thought I would take the plunge. It was a big mistake.    Connection to pipe always leaks no matter what. The problem: the rubber washer inside the connection to the pipe is poorly designed and cannot handle the back pressure this showerhead creates.     Keep in mind the lower the flow rating the head, the more pressure it exerts on the connection/joint to the pipe.     Based on my educated guess, their rubber washer is:    1) too large by 0.5 mm or less. You can see the washer bulging inside the head before the installation which is never a good news.    2) too hard/brittle. The washer is very hard.     Either way, the design makes it useless for me.
5.0	Was shocked at how wet clothes and how noise it was from original purchase of them new tell motor went and replaced with this motor.
5.0	Ordered 8 for my home, needed to upgrade the faucets in the kitchen and bathrooms which was originally covered with grinds. it worked really well with the 1/2 in copper pipes and the only tool I used was a pipe cutter to remove the old valve.<br />The installation was quick and simple, just cut the old pipe (no cutting needed for new installation), clean the pipe, and put the new sharkbite valve on, and BOOM! it is done
5.0	I HAVE USED IT BEFORE AND IT WORKED GREAT TO GET THE HAIR AND JUNK ALMOST INSTANTLY OUT OF MY SINK DRAIN. THAT IS WHY I ORDERED SOME OF IT. THANKS,
5.0	tis pretty and easily clips to your purse. and it works , doesnt look like its gona fall apart any time soon
5.0	Not the best value, but lives up to expectations
5.0	Second one I've owned.  The first lasted just about five years and was never a problem till the end.  The replacement works great with a range of between 70~100 feet.  Set-up is a breeze if you know the current code.  If you don't just pop off the back and look at the configuration.
1.0	The very FIRST night I put this light in it blew! What the ?!?!  Not Happy.  If you do your homework this light is known to blew in a few days to a few months.  Consumer Reports listed as DO NOT BUY!  Very unsafe and it'll blow up fast. Look at Ace Hardware.com website it has a 1 star rating.  All six reviews there list it as poor with the light lasting only a few days to weeks.  I even called the company to ask what the problem is.  The person speaking barely spoke english! He said ohhh nodthing is wong it's ok.  :  URG!<br /><br />DO NOT BUY THIS BULB!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5.0	Ordered these since the others were shipping from China and scheduled to arrive later than our event. These lanterns worked great! They took awhile to fill with hot air (made me a little nervous that they wouldn't fly), but they worked beautifully!
5.0	Great light and quick shipping
5.0	I purchased this Par46 to replace the bulb in my old Unity 740. It fit perfectly, came at a great price and the shipping was very fast. Overall I had an excellent experience.
5.0	This chandelier is so gorgeous. You won't regret buying this. Everyone who came to my home and saw it just fell in love with it. It will definitely add beauty to your home.
5.0	If you are a serious camper, this is a must have item.  You can never know when those bothersome pests will be present.  BE PREPARED!  We got to the Colorado river late one night and got ate up until we put insect repellant on.  We still were getting nailed until we got inside the tent for the night.  I'm thinking that this was going to be early to bed and no night fishing.  The next morning, I loaded the sprayer and sprayed the area down thoroughly.  It smells at first but goes away after about an hour.  The next night there was hardly a mosquito to be heard.  Just a light repellant spray and I fished all night.  AHHHH!
5.0	Have only one GFI outlet in my bathroom and many devices to plug in. Happy this is UL rated and handles all my devices
5.0	The unit came and did not work.  I tried everything.<br />Then I called Delta Faucets and spoke with Rene.<br />We assumed it to be a defective unit and a replacement is on the way.<br />Simple, straightforward and professional.
1.0	I bought this showerhead about three months ago.  At first when I used it - it worked great! lights went on, worked as a luxurious showerhead should.<br /><br />Not even two months later....the lights stop working.  They would come on....and then shut off.  Come back on, shut off again and maybe flicker a little.<br /><br />Now three months later, the lights have completely stopped working and in addition, the showerhead now makes this unbearable squealing noise.  I live in an apartment and have several neighbors who probably can hear this obnoxious noise at 6 a.m.  I've tried to figure out what the issue is, but can't figure it out and now have to get a new showerhead.
5.0	Product was received as expected
5.0	A light bulb that works with a dimmer.  Yeah!
5.0	I bought it, used it, and it does what it's supposed to do: power my cooler from 110v current.
5.0	We were trying to refresh a bathroom without changing everything.  We needed a blend of Brass and Chrome to tie the towel bars and hoops together with the chrome fixtures.  The Laurey pulls were perfect for pulling off our efforts.
5.0	We did a wet room concept in our master bath and although the toilet paper is many feet from the shower, without any shower wall/curtain a certain amount of splash happens.  We wanted a modern toilet roll that would provide some splash protection and blend in with our satin nickel/brushed stainless fixtures.  While it is aluminum and doesn't exactly match, it is close enough and works great.  We just drop in the roll and don't bother putting the paper under the rollers as some have done.  If you  pull the paper straight out at a 90 degree angle from the wall, the paper comes out great and then just pull down and it tears perfectly.  Only improvement I could suggest would be to do it in stainless or brushed nickel too but of course that would also be more expensive!
5.0	This was the correct color match and size match to the original Anderson casement windows,  a good price and quality. I got them for a window we added roll-down shades to, and am considering replacing cranks with these throughout the house.
5.0	Bought it to plug in our 38' 5th wheel trailer, along with another 50', pulling about 15 amps. It has done a great job of handling the load without overheating. Definitely pleased with it.
5.0	These filters last a long time for me.  They remove the horrible chlorine smell and the funny taste our water has.  My ice cubes are clearer, too. If you are concerned about contaminants and want fresh tasting water without the expense and waste of bottled water, these filters are for you.
5.0	Well, it's a can...and a safe.  You can't tell it unscrews so I am happy.  We wanted to put some cash in out 72 hour emergency kit, so just in case some home invaders come thieving and go through our bag, we will have them fooled. HA HA HA(evil laughing ensues)
5.0	Buying another! Nice light, bright and clear, instant on.
1.0	Got wrong filter.  Bait and Switch
5.0	Excellent value, they're very dark though with only slight bronzed edges if matching your lighter bronzes is a concern.  Matched then with the Design House handles and locks throughout thehouse and I'm very happy with the look.
5.0	Works great, looks fantastic as advertised, easy installation enhances the overall look of the our front entry way at a modest price point.
5.0	Very good staff put that thing there and forget about any leak I used to refill my unit 3 times a year after I used this product there's no leak at all
5.0	We have a 35 year old fiberglass shower pan which could not be adequately cleaned.  No matter how hard we scrubbed, it always looked awful.<br /><br />I searched for a very long time for a home kit that would not require the use of dangerous acid preparations.  This was the only option I found.  With two weeks having passed since I used the kit, the result looks great and I highly recommend it.<br /><br />Expect several hours of surface prep involving an array of household cleaners, scrubbers etc. before you can do any painting.  I suppose this is the price you pay to avoid the use of serious acids.  When you do combine the two parts in the kit to create the paint, the resulting odor is seriously nasty like plastic cement.  I did not use any kind of respirator;  I just ran the bathroom fan. Unless you like to get very light headed, I suggest you buy or rent an appropriate respirator.<br /><br />The paint is rather thin so apply in thin coats or else you will get drip build up on vertical surfaces.  I didn't have much success with a roller so I used the bristle brush exclusively.  It is true that once you apply the paint, don't try to rework any given area again if more than a minute or so has passed.  And only brush in one direction.  Follow the instructions for recoating.  The second coat can be applied within the pot life of the paint (6 hours) but if you want a third coat--and it made ALL the difference in my case--you will either need a second kit or you must carefully set aside in sealed containers the proportional amount of each component to be mixed the next day.<br /><br />The final coat must dry 72 hours before you can use any water on it.<br /><br />Naturally, you will want to complement your work with all new caulking so be prepared to be an expert at that too.<br /><br />In summary, I am delighted with the result but be prepared for some major scrubbing, some nasty fumes and a long patient wait while it dries.<br /><br />UPDATE--Six months later, still flawless.  Applied correctly, this produces a very durable finish.<br /><br />LONG TERM UPDATE--After almost two years, the finish is still without defects.  I can only emphasize what others have written--the preparation steps are lengthy but if they are followed to the letter, your result should be excellent.<br /><br />Seven years later--Still not a single defect in the paint though it has gotten pretty dirty in a few areas and cannot be cleaned.lawless.  Applied correctly, this produces a very durable finish.<br /><br />LONG TERM UPDATE--After almost two years, the finish is still without defects.  I can only emphasize what others have written--the preparation steps are lengthy but if they are followed to the letter, your result should be excellent.
1.0	this item did not work at all. When plugged in all it did was beep.  No matter where I put it. I would not buy another one and not from this seller again.
5.0	On the bottom of the camera is a sticker with the login name and the ID number that you will need to enter when setting up the camera. Do not lose the Mini-CD that comes wih the camera.  It has the software and manuals you will need to set up the camera on Windows, Mac, iPhone, and Android.  The software will detect one or more cameras on your network which you may select for viewing.  A data directory will be created for storing videos and snapshots you capture with the camera.  Performance is excellent in both daytime and night time with the infrared lighting option for low light conditions.  Images are bright, clear and very sharp, as if you're looking through a window instead a camera.  I was impressed.  The IP Camera is waterproof for outdoor usage but you still need to have a power outlet nearby which might limit placement of the camera.  The camera will work with a wireless connection to your router or a direct cable connection.  Very nice security camera at a great price.
5.0	This product works great.  A few of the items I ordered didn't light up at first, but that was because the copper lip in the center was depressed too much to make contact with the light bulb.  Pulling it up a little bit fixed the problem.
5.0	Long wood screws are compatible on any furniture with wood frame.  Feet were are good replacement for love seat I had where non standard foot broke off, so I replaced all four feet.  The feet were smaller than previous feet, but good size for smaller furniture like love seat.
5.0	It works well,  and it is a nice add on a room  decoration... Nice and good price !!  Deserve a good advice !!
5.0	This shower head is so cool!!!  I liked it so much I purchased additional ones to give to my sisters and dad.  The shower spray pressure is great and the additional choices for spray types was an added bonus!!  RECOMMEND it a lot.
1.0	I bought these for a European trip and had to throw them away. Luckily, other people had adapters that I was able to use.
5.0	This is a nice quality hook that I use to hang my purse on the wall at work.  It is beautiful to look at and is very functional.
5.0	I'm not one to write many reviews, but I had a positive experience with this product and it met/exceeded all expectations.  The install was simple, the app walked through step by step and the screws from my old thermostat lined up with this new one as well so end to end install time was about 15-20 minutes.  It does what's advertised - providing an easy to adjust thermostat via phone, web, or the device itself.  The scheduling was easy to setup and I feel like I know my schedule well enough to be able to set it versus having a self-learning thermostat or placing sensors around the house.  After reading some of the more critical reviews about the Nest and Ecobee 3 reliability, I felt like this was a good step forward from a standard thermostat while not going overboard with features that don't make a major difference in energy savings.
1.0	The packages came in its box and wrapped in the original. Some of the alarms didn't have buttons on them and batteries were dead even after the paper strip was pulled out.
5.0	great worked like a charm would not but another kind of breaker love it loved them awsome they worked great
5.0	Never thought I would rave about a toilet seat but here I go...It is high quality and goes great with our vintage style remodel with black and white tile. Highly recommend.
5.0	delivered on time was exactly what I expected
5.0	Nice job on getting this to me quickly. This was exactly the way I like to do business. All the best!
1.0	The cans for old lights tapeered upward and had no place to secure replacement light. Straight cans or provision of a place to secure retaining wires would have worked.
5.0	This is an awesome product.  I used it on two different applications to renew old fiberglass shower panel and an old white bathtub.  They looked just like new after the application.<br /><br />Just follow the instructions; sand it well and let it dry between coats.  It was very straight forward.  The only thing is make sure you wear a mask and the room is fairly well ventilated.  This product does emit odor and it may make you sick if you aren't properly prepared.<br /><br />We tried so many cleaning products but the stain/scum were so stubborn.  Part of the fiberglass surface was actually wearing down and this product saves our life.  Highly recommended.
5.0	I was looking at the major home improvement stores and they wanted $40 for just a single filter.  Found this 2 pack at nearly the same price.  They appear to be the same in every way and installed with no issues.
5.0	I've tried so many feet creams and lotions, and this one works!  My heels would get so dry and cracked it felt like I had a microplane on my feet.  But this smoothed them out in just a couple uses.  And I don't even need to use it everyday now.  I also like that it's unscented.
1.0	I got to send this back didn't work
5.0	I was down to only one working Sears 139.53681 remote for three cars. I found the 973LM on Amazon and decided to give it a try. I ordered two remotes on September 18, 2013 and received them on September 21st. They worked perfectly right out of the box. Programming was so easy… only took a couple of minutes. I’m very happy with the fast delivery and the quality of the product.
5.0	Where other toilet seats will side sideways and break their hardware often with a larger person or a patient with balance issues, you'll never have that problem with the BIG JOHN toilet seat. It's built like a rock, the hardware is solid metal not cheap plastic, and although it's as massive as the Starship Enterprise, it sits solidly and safely on any size or shape of toilet. We have an elongated commode and the BIG JOHN fits as if it were custom made. This is a terrific product. I purchased this for a stroke victim and it's perfect, but nobody else in the family has had any problem using it--including a three-year-old who could balance on it with ease. HIGHLY RECOMMENED!!
5.0	Works great with staples connect zwave ..... Shows up as 3 devices but minor issue .... Very happy
5.0	Much better resource for filters online. Great replacement fit for Whirlpool and Kitchen Aid...<br /><br />This item will stay on my wish list and keep them in stock. Fair Price, but as long as they beat the local stores we will keep coming back for more!<br /><br />I think they last longer than the OEM product p/n which is fantastic!<br /><br />BatmanDSM
1.0	The color of the pulls we ordered looked different on the computer.  They didn't match the others we needed them to match for our kitchen.  We had to pay the shipping plus a $15 re-stocking fee to return them!
5.0	How easy it was to set these up.  At the click of the button my outside lights went on or off and our Christmas tree inside. Love, Love, Love it.
5.0	So far so good  three previous brands died before two years
1.0	Did not fit, came with two identical pairs for one side only.
5.0	I bought this fixture (with the nickel light bulb holder) for my dining room.  It looks beautiful over the dining room table.  In daylight, you can't really see the subtle flower details.  But when you put the light on, the flowers stand out.  It's very stylish and sophisticated.  I like it because it's not a fixture that you'd see all the time in the stores.  I have it on a dimmer switch too.
1.0	I purchased this item and easily installed it on clean front door frame January 29, 2014, it stuck and I was happy UNTIL.....<br />March 2, 2014, The weather stripping started to fall off around the door.  I thought duck brand and the flexibility  I was sure this would last.<br /><br />NOPE - it is worthless, it fails after a little over one month when a door is constantly being opened and closed..
1.0	This product does not fit on x box 360 controller and the buttons are very hard to get on and they pop right off when in use. The silicone skins fit is way off and I tried it on the different controllers and not even close. Don't buy, save your money..
5.0	sleek, with lots of light!
5.0	Makes very strong, durable bonds. My favorite cyanoacrylate glue. Works where other CA glues fail--the rubber additive makes the difference.
5.0	I should've bought this a long time ago.  Works well mechanically and small enough to be inconspicuous.
5.0	I am the purchaser of all items, but not always the user. I am only aware if there is a problem, if someone complains. There was no complaint on this item.
5.0	This gate is great by itself or with an additional set for little ones just starting to crawl or even just starting to walk.  This gate locks together to keep you little ones contained to a small area.  The gate makes a great small play area for little ones that want to be outdoors!
5.0	Purchased this part after old switch went out. I had an 2001 modoel and replaced it with this part (2012) I must say the complete accessories were a match and I had no issues mounting this in the preexcistin spot.  I like that the product remains the same with the same conectors.. Just better parts.
5.0	Perfect for our boat and truck and RV!  We love this little flashlight because it is waterproof, it floats and it is bright!  I would recommend!
5.0	Very nice!  Sturdy!  Looks way better than I expected!!
5.0	"Let me start off by saying these are good bulbs, but I hate CFL bulbs and will never use them inside my home. Outside my home is a different story.<br /><br />Inside, I've had two different types of CFLs fail and the plastic base melted when they failed, filling the house with the smell of fire. After the second time, I've banned them from inside the home. Both times, they were in table lamps and both in the preferred upright position. There is no excuse to put something like that back in my home.<br /><br />Outside, I have front post lamps attached to a brick wall, so I'm not worried if they scorch when they fail outside because it will not catch my house on fire or set off the smoke detectors.<br /><br />These are the only CFLs I've seen that truly do have a lovely warm incandescent glow, like a \\""real\\"" lightbulb. My post lamps have frosted glass and you would never know there were CFLs inside them. The only unfortunate part is these CFLs still give off that \\""hazy\\"" light. Maybe just my eyes notice it, but CFLs give off a haze, almost like a fog to the surroundings they illuminate and I guess that's just part of CFLs. While not absolutely perfect, these bulbs have thus far exceeded my expectations.<br /><br />Just so you know, there is a guarantee on the packaging and I have saved that along with the receipt, just in case these fail in less than two years. I know they say they can last up to 6 years, but that's only four hours of use per day. At the cost of these bulbs, they'd better last at least two years. The biggest reason I bought these is we're sick of changing the bulbs on those post lamps and ours are very difficult to change the bulb. If these don't make it the full two years with about 8 hours use per day, I'll be back to update.<br /><br />So far, very pleased with my purchase and would buy these again.<br /><br />***UPDATE: Sept 16, 2012***<br />Still going strong! To be honest, I leave these on about 12 hours a day (most days) and 24 hours a day when I'm not home or when I forget to turn them off which is frequent. They spend way more time \\""on\\"" than \\""off\\"". I cannot say how many hours they've been on over the last year, but it's a lot of hours and thus far these have far outlasted any regular bulb and give off a good amount of light that doesn't look like CFL from afar.<br />One more thing I forgot to mention in the original review: These do have to \\""warm up\\"" when you turn the light on. It takes a couple of minutes to fully illuminate. These are not bulbs for people who quickly want to turn on/off a porch light. These bulbs are meant to be left on for long periods of time. Like I said, I turn mine on at dusk and off at dawn most of the time, but in the winter they were left on nearly all night/day. Our front door outside is like a cave without light and I prefer to keep my doorstep illuminated at all times when it's dark outside. If nothing else, people never know if I'm at home or not because I often forget and leave mine on all day. It gives me added security if I don't make it home before dark (particularly in the winter when it gets dark so early) to have these lights give off a warm, inviting glow from my doorstep to greet me when I get home.m not home or when I forget to turn them off which is frequent.

5.0	I mounted this next to the entrance to my garage, and it's always overfull of coats and hats.  It's sturdy and nothing has ever come loose or fallen off.  It's a good size and will span a couple of studs when you mount it.
5.0	awesome lights for an awesome price.
5.0	I bought this faucet about 2 1/2 years ago. Looks great, works great. Installed it myself without any problems. I liked it so much that when I recently bought a new house I went out of my way to buy another one. Best faucet I've ever owned. I'd highly recommend it!
5.0	You just never know when you'll need a light and this little guy fills that need.    Most everyone will keep one handy; just for those small or large emergencies.      I've bought a few for Xmas gifts.
5.0	It really goes well with any kind of modern decor and so far seems to be built really well.  Too early to know that for sure yet.
5.0	Exactly as described fast shipping. Thanks
5.0	"I read an article the other day that said CFLs (compact fluorescent bulbs) were \\""transitional\\"" lighting, making way for the more efficient and full featured LED bulbs. We don't have any of the old fashioned incandescent bulbs in our home and haven't for years, but we do have some CFL bulbs. They don't always last as long they should, especially in rooms where the lights are turned off and on a lot. (This doesn't affect LEDs.) We're slowly replacing them with the G7 Power LEDs and some of the reasons are that the bulbs are instant-on, they last longer, they come in a lot of color hues such as cool and warm and they don't contain mercury which is better for the environment when they have to be discarded. So I'm happy to see LEDs come into their own with brightness comparable to the old bulbs and lower prices than the first ones out on the market several years back.<br /><br />This 14 watt bulb is equivalent in brightness to a 75 watt incandescent bulb. It's flicker free and is 3000 K which means the color of light is warm. It's certified to last 35,000 hours which is close to 32 years if you use it 3 hours per day. (Even if you used it 8 hours a day it would last almost 12 years.)<br /><br />G7 Power is a smallish company located in Reno, NV so the are accessible to answer questions and take requests. I like that about the company. They provided this bulb in or for me to try it out and write a review."
5.0	This was a replacement for a InksinkErator CTR 333 1/2 HP that I put in my house when I built it 23 years ago. It finally gave it up, and I figured if my old one lasted that long, why change a sure thing. It is stronger, quieter, and made better than the old one. My wife really likes it - and that is what really counts.
5.0	"I replaced my 30 year old noisy bathroom fan with this unit.  The installation went without a hitch (I have access to the attic), although the instructions were a little confusing.  It's relatively quiet and does a very good job of removing the moisture.<br /><br />One minor issue: Instructions indicate that the fan housing goes inside the square cutout at the ceiling.  If you do that, 3\\"" plastic exhaust rests right on top of the ceiling drywall leaving no room to to add an adapter from 3\\"" to 4\\"" duct.  You really don't want to use a 3\\"" duct unless the length is less than a few feet.  If you decide to let the housing sit on top of the drywall as I did, you need to adjust the dimensions on the cutout ceiling accordingly."
5.0	Arrived in 2 days!  Easy install with new lock-down mechanism (mostly screwdriver and less basin wrench).  Hoses included and valve to main outlet hose long enough to install 12 inches away.  Works well, no dripping, would do again.
5.0	Fast shipping.  Good price,  Easy installation.  Thanks.
5.0	Smoke alarm was a quick and nearly identical replacement part.
5.0	Good product. Prompt delivery. Good price. Very satisfied.
5.0	These are easy to replace, A whiter almost bluish light, only time will tell as to the electrical usage savings
5.0	What else can I say except, it works just like it should. Very happy with this purchase.<br />Was looking for a long heavy duty cable, and the blue color makes it easy to see but not as ugly as orange.
5.0	"I bought and installed a Cadet 3 in my home a couple of years ago and have had absolutely no issues since then.  I would love to be able to afford to replace all of the toilets in my home with Cadet 3's but simply don't have the money to do it at this time. I have had NONE of the issues that those who are disappointed in this toilet say they have and quite frankly wonder if they have attempted to contact American Standard with their concerns since not only is the toilet warrantied but American Standard is a well established company that has a reputation to protect.  I'm guessing that if one were to call American Standard and sound like a rational human being American Standard would do what ever they could to ensure that their product is performing as intended.<br /><br />Finally, one of the negative reviews for this product scoffs at American Standard's claim of being able to flush a bucket of golf balls down this toilet.  I'd like to point out that American Standard's claims about flushing buckets of golf balls applies to their Champion toilet and not the Cadet 3, so you have to wonder if that particular reviewer  even knows what product they have in their home (I say this because it's possible they don't have the Cadet 3 or the Champion and are giving this toilet a negative rating unnecessarily).  For the record I installed a Champion toilet in my in-laws home a month ago and although I haven't flushed a bucket of golf balls down it, it does appear to be capable of doing all that it says it can. Their only complaint is that they don't like the ADA compliant height model because they are short and they can't comfortably rest their feet on the floor (so if you're short get the toilet that's not listed as \\""Right Height\\"" by American Standard)."
1.0	"I wanted to put this outside - instructions say no  no \\""daylight off\\"" feature"
5.0	Great.  Plug in works.  Loud and clear
5.0	Este &eacute; o filtro original para a sua Syde-by-Syde da Samsung.<br />Pode comprar que &eacute; de boa qualidade e funciona perfeitamente. Apenas confira se &eacute; o modelo adequado para o seu refrigerador.
5.0	Seems to be good for the price.  The steel is much hardier than the average readily available fire safe.  Most fire safes are not designed as theft safes.  While they have great looking locks and locking pins, the metal sides will not stand up to a small hatchet or hammer.  The sides of this safe are steel and much better than the average, but they are not &#34;drill resistant&#34; steel.  However, a safe with drill resistant steel will cost considerably more.  The only complaint is the safe was not made to mount to the floor, and drilling holes to mount it through will result in a loss of fire or water protection.  Still, a good solution if you do not want to step up to a commercial grade safe.
5.0	It looks just like the style of my grohe faucets. spent so much already. was looking for cheaper accessory for the bathrooms but still look good. I found just the thing i was looking for. bought other accessories related to this one and they are all so perfect! love the fact that we can now hang both bath towels in a smaller space and now have to wash towels every 3 days.
5.0	My daughter loves this!!
5.0	Moved into a new house and did not want to constantly walk into the laundry room to turn the three outside lights on at night and off in the  morning. Wanted a cost effective solution and something that required little or no modification to the current outside light set up. Ordered the Phillips lights and simply replaced the current bulbs with the Phillips product. Have had them installed for a month and they work as proposed; come on at dusk and turn off at dawn. Very cost effective solution.
5.0	Great products. We bought Moen everything in our house from towel racks to robe hangers and I love them all. The brushed nickel gives off a nice sheen, but not as thumb-print prone than say just standard silver. They are sturdy and are a great size for holding large towels or even 2 smaller ones side by side. They are also relatively easy to install and my fianc&eacute; installed all of them within a day (we're talking about about 10 different pieces here).
5.0	Ordered this for a holiday gift for my best friend who is an artist and she LOVES it.  I bought myself the 'tree of life' lamp. They appear to be well built and seem sturdy.  The art depicted is quirky and bold.  The scene wraps around and reveals even more freakiness as you turn it.  This lamp is an eye-catching conversation piece from any angle.
1.0	I bought this remote to use in place of a remote that died.  The Wayne Daulton door opening system is 16 years old and Daulton on longer manufacutures the devices.  I went through all possible set up options several times and none would work.  Anyone need a garage door opener?  I will sell it cheap!
5.0	What do you  do when your wife's favorite lamp's switch burns out?  After visiting the local electrical shops and not one had the switch for  the lamp you order it from Amazon.com.
5.0	It came with everything I needed it was kind of hard to put the clamps on you need super strong fingers had it installed in about 5 min.
5.0	Got one of these for Whirlpool fridge based on recommendation in user manual. Super easy in / out. Just push release valve on old one and it pops out, push this one in place until it clicks and voila, a stream of gushing sacred waters (I think this is a beer ad).
5.0	I needed a cord to plug in a string of lights in my daughter's bedroom. This did the job perfectly. Zero complaints. Great price.
5.0	Amazingly well documented in several languages, where you can tell that it was their native language. As a DIY kit that was my primary concern.<br /><br />There is a Quick Start, which will get you up and going, and a nice detailed manual that will help when you want to add sensors, change the Master code, add secondary codes, or change zones for sensors.<br /><br />Operation is pretty simple.  You can probably do this even if you can't program a VCR.<br /><br />Installation is even simpler.  You can even use the included double sided sticky pads like I did if you like.  That's a really nice touch for folks who live in apartments and don't want to mar the walls.<br /><br />Overall a fantastic product for even a moderate DIYer like me.  Supplement it with some Foscam video surveillance and you have a pretty robust home security system for cheap.<br /><br />Interestingly, ADT came by to sell me a security service, and when I showed him all the sensors I already had in place, and told him he was on camera, he left quietly. :)
5.0	Fixed my low water pressure problem.
5.0	Very very cool! Perfect size! I put it in my guest bedroom.
5.0	great product  , super price, works as good as what you would get at an Auto store, a lot less
5.0	I've order this board before, and it's still a great deal.  I can't find any place (and I have lots of contact) that sells these for less.  Great for prototyping!  I'm sure I'll be buying more!    Shipping is prompt as well, even faster than other amazon orders!    The only complaint I have, is the size of the shipping box.  The box that contained the 5 boards that I ordered was about 2 feet by 1.5 feet by 1 foot.  I know that the boards are 12 inches by 12 inches so it can be difficult to find a box to fit this size, but they are only 1/8 of a inch thick.  They don't weight much either.  So if you do order this board, order a bunch because there's more than enough room in the box.
5.0	Thanks it's working well worked up to its name
5.0	Just as described. Perfect for intended purpose.
5.0	I thought this product was very clever. Good gift for any age. I'm going to give them away with gift cards inside.
5.0	I already reviewed this once, however it was fine, works fine and it is very quiet, much better than the one I had before.
5.0	Now days people are buying used homes and you don't know what shape the furnace is in. These can save your life and for smoke to.
5.0	Both locks use the same combination. I know a lot of other people had problems with their locks, but both locks worked for me.
5.0	It fits my vacuum pump perfectly.
5.0	This lights are just as described. I love them.
5.0	Smaller for over kitchen sink, but still bright like I wanted.
5.0	its resistance wire and it works!
5.0	BRIGHT! Very bright! LOVE EM!<br /><br />Replacing all my lights with LEDs & omg these are bright! Will definitely buy more of this brand. Also, they seem more warm than most day light LEDs.
5.0	Filters work great....helps with allergy issues.
1.0	JUNK.  Seller did not respond to inquiry for replacement or return - seller contacted me prior to arrival asking I refer all correspondence to them directly.  DO NOT BUY - My lock was broken and does not secure the door.  Does not serve the purpose.
5.0	I had been using another manufacturers pumps of similar function but they do not work as well as these pumps. I already had a few of these pumps and purchased extra ones to replace the other manufacturers pumps. The only drawback is the capacity of the storage bottle but that is an issue for all of them. I would purchase them again if I have additional need.
5.0	Fit perfect. Works perfect. People complained of the belt breakage switch not included but it was on mine. Wiring and instillation was identical to the original.
5.0	easy install, well made. never an issue
5.0	Was delivered fast and looks wonderful!!!
5.0	These burner covers were less expensive than any I've seen anywhere else--I couldn't even find them in the stores.  They are high quality and low cost.  I'm very pleased with them. <br /> <br />Grace
5.0	I highly recommend getting this whenever you replace the mixer valve. I installed the mixer first but the problem was the pressure balancing unit. Works great
5.0	The supplied Halient surface burner was identical to the original in quality & fit.Very easy to replace & connect to the ranges wiring connections & was shipped quickly from the supplier.
5.0	I want to get more of these sensors...They work great..I have it in my bed room and the thing can tell when i move while sleeping...This is the best in my opinion...Update.I bought another one of these sensors and had to send it back...Something changed weather it was the controller update or they changed the software in the sensor...I am running a vera lite and the first sensor worked great but the second one i bought maby 8 months later did  not work...I was bummed...I really like the one i have running now...
5.0	It has a low profile, and a nice display. It's easy to override for manual operation. It's also plug-and-play with preset settings. I've been using it for months and it works great. BTW, when I first wired it, I got the neutral wires mixed up. Powered it down again and switched them and it works fine.
5.0	great quality finish and product is just super. simple modern and good in operation, quality all the way around. Buy it.
5.0	Made in the USA with a brushed satin nickel finish that matches my Delta faucet. Expensive...yes, but the quality is excellent and if you've just spent a bunch of money on a granite counter top, you'll probably want to spend the extra money on the matching accessory. By the way, on a technical note, this soap dispenser is also made for thick counter top applications (e.g., granite). I don't believe all soap dispensers can accomodate the thickness of certain counter tops, so this may be another reason to consider this dispenser.
1.0	Remote works, but timer functions do not work.
5.0	I was very please with this purchase.  It arrived in a timely manner and met  my expectations in regard to it's size (pretty big!) Just a beautiful shell. I buy the large sage sticks and can use the shell while performing my sage cleansings. I burn the sage stick and lay the stick inside the shell while it burns and I smudge. the shell does not get hot so you don't have to worry about getting burned while holding it. Feels very safe using the large shell, I no longer have to worry as much about starting a fire with flying ambers!!
1.0	This is very poor quality, certainly not professional strength. It is very thin, tends to splinter  when tearing it and has a very toxic smell.
5.0	I always think the prices for Water Filters are too high, but looking at the specifications I find the GE filter to be my choice for performance.  Specifically the flow rate is much better than the non OEMs that I looked at.
5.0	very sturdy product and works really well for our window. they do not look cheap and don't sag in the middle like some thinner models. the middle support bracket helps with that too. our blackout curtains still close just fine despite that middle bracket being there.
5.0	Good price, works well.
5.0	I have a large entertainment center with 3 touch-switch, 3-way lights with intermediate base. Regular bulbs would only last a month or two before they would burn out. These LED bulbs from ChinChin work great and have lasted much longer than regular bulbs so far!
5.0	We just swtiched to these tablets a couple of months ago.  Our 10-year old glasses are now crystal clear.  We saw results after the first use.  So glad we tried these.  Subscribe and save is a great deal too - one less thing to worry about picking up at the grocery store!
5.0	As mentioned in some other reviews it does some time to assemble it, but we were not able to install right away, however after we did put it in Foyer area, It looked &#34;fantastic&#34;
5.0	This was the perfect knife for the hard to reach spots in my new half bath, edges are square and it has a nice flex to it. Strangely this costs a few more dollars at brick and mortars, Amazon to the rescue as usual.
1.0	The bowl for this toilet is way too low.  It is installed in a dental office and all of the women complain about the height. This toilet bowl is a little less than 15 inches, when most toilet bowls are about 16 1/2 inches. If you don't want to listen to women complain look elsewhere or verify the toilet height before buying.
5.0	This kit has all you need to repair or add a snap. I am grateful for kits like this to repair a jacket that I really like wearing.
5.0	Bought one bulb from an overseas site just to test it. It is much brighter than the regular bulb it replaced. The light is white instead the standard yellowish-brown color of a regular bulb. I have used it very regularly for 6 months and no problems. It is still going strong. I am ordering three more today because I see it is now available on Amazon.
5.0	Perfect little light for my needs!
5.0	Finally I can get a stream of water that hits my body rather than spraying wide.  The wide spray head I had was terrible to try to wash and rinse your hair because it was low flow plus I have well water with not good water pressure, thus this Anystream is great.  I get a blast of water right where I want it.
5.0	I use a lot of Bungie Cords and have found out that I can make my own by saving the hooks on the end and then just cut off the desired length, and I'm in business again.  I've been buy the 100 rolls from the local hardware store, but found that I can order and get the roll cheaper on Amazon.Com.  Thanks for being there.
5.0	Works perfect and great price!
5.0	I used this to clean the ice maker, then I used the sanitizer and the ice machine was good to go.
5.0	I bought these to help me with my constant battle to manage the cables behind my desk & entertainment center.<br /><br />These work very well.  As described, they are small.  They won't handle the average computer power cord, or a quality HDMI cable.  They do work awesome for ethernet or mouse/keyboard sized cables (assuming you're not wireless).<br /><br />These do open and close easily, so I am able to add/remove cables when I need.<br /><br />The clips are clear plastic & hard to see.  They are not invisible & the tape on the bottom is white, so from the top-down, you'll see a white square of tape.<br /><br />These worked really well for me to put on the back of the legs of desks and such, so I could run cables hidden from view, yet relatively easy to manage.
5.0	We bought this light to go over our vanity when remodeling our bathroom.  It is absolutely beautiful and matches our other bronze fixtures perfectly.  We looked all around for this light and Amazon had the best price.<br /><br />My husband installed it himself with no problems.  It is very heavy though.<br /><br />One thing to note is that the 100w lightbulbs were VERY bright and hot (melted part of our mirror) so I'd recommend a lower watt (I think we have 60w now).<br /><br />LOVE THESE lights though!
5.0	Very fast shipping.  Good price. No Problems.
1.0	it does not work the way it says. Iput it in my closet and any movement does not turn the lights on
5.0	They are nice and quite compared to the steel wheeled type that are common in old stile steel roll up doors.
1.0	JUNK.  Buy the Delta version of this it's so much better.  I purchase and install the delta version on a regular basis (on Moen Grabbars).  I love Moen products but DON'T buy this one!
5.0	Great sturdy box.  I painted mine to match my personality.  Check Postal Regulations for flag colors. (Some colors cannot be used on flags.)
5.0	Worked great on any surface
5.0	Bought these for my http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001OST6XY/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i00.<br /><br />The lamp takes three bulbs, so I had to order more than I needed, but they worked out perfectly. Very happy.
5.0	Good lamp. No problems with shipping or the lamp itself! I forgot to buy an extra bulb for it. Found some next to the lamps in a big discount store though. Just a heads up.
5.0	These are much cheaper than what the drugstore peddles and they are fairly long lasting, too. I do recommend them to keep on hand.
5.0	these worked exceptionally well when I had a lot of glue ups --- good product.  I use these often and have no regrets at all.
5.0	If you've gota Kohler sink that is leaking around the base, replacing both of these O-rings will likely save you the expense and trouble of having the whole thing replaced. A good indicator that these rings need replacing is if there is even a tiny bit of &#34;wobble&#34; in the sink spout, or if the spout has very little resistance to rotating around the base. With a properly sealing set of rings, the spout should feel very firmly set, and have a bit of resistance to swinging around side to side.
5.0	Being from European decent I have used bidets all my life. The Luxe Bidet M110 is an excellent product with a very small price tag. Excellence in its product design simplicity, ease of installation, efficiency of the device and quality of the Support Team at 2Go Products LLC. I will be using one on every bathroom in my home.<br />Follow the simple and well explained directions and your do-it yourself install will be completed in a few minutes. When installing the bidet, I recommend that you do not use a screw drivers to tighten plastic bolts of your toilet seat, just use large coins (quarters will do). The connections were so tight and well constructed that I did not have to use Teflon tape for water tight fittings. The flow of water is gently controlled by the valve on its 3 positions. Remember, over tight connectors will not be water proof.<br />I expect to enjoy this product for years to come.<br />Thanks, 2Go Products LLC and thanks Amazon for always offering quality merchandise.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B001KKRCFA Luxe Bidet MB110 Fresh Water Spray Non-Electric Mechanical Bidet Toilet Seat Attachment]]
5.0	Fit perfectly and I loved getting 8 for the price I would have paid for 2 at Sears.
5.0	Perfect replacement for a couple of bucks. I do recomend it.
5.0	This is all we buy for cleaning and protecting our Flexsteal leather couch. This couch was expensive and we want it to last a long time. This is the right stuff to get to prolong the couch life. Coupled with the cleaner from the same company, this is great stuff.
1.0	THIS PRODUCT IS AWFUL!!!  I can't believe it got high stars.  I looked back on the reviews and I noticed one thing.  I see many reviews taking place within weeks of ownership and not within 6 months to a year.  Keep this in mind as I continue to explain my problems.<br /><br />The seller was great at getting it to me.  I signed up for Amazon Prime and got free two day shipping.  As soon as I got it I wasn't that impress with the plastic molded design.  The girlfriend thought it was cute and I was cool at giving it a shot.  Now I am no stranger to plumbing.  I've worked around pros and my installs are always solid and clean.  As soon as I hooked it up and kicked the master valves on, the sprayers seem to work well, but, I noticed one drip coming out of a vent hole at the bottom (Obviously to vent any condensation on the valves).  And that's what I thought at first, condensation!  But the drips started as the pressure built up and then it became streams.  I checked my connections just in case any leaking was back flowing along the fittings into the valve assembly.  Nope!  Everything I did was dry and looking great.  Obviously; defective valve assembly!  So I sent it back immediately.<br /><br />Defective things do happen, but, this I think this unit will be trouble for anyone.  I can predict that easily.  The manufacturer may brag about their unique high quality valves, but, the parts inside that link to the valves, I suspect, to be cheap.  I am thankful it leaked on me right away.  With most people I give it six months to a year before real trouble.  I was not impress with the hot and cold hook ups on the back.  They are made of plastic and can easily be cracked or stripped during tightening.  The neck extends the valve assembly out rather far from the bowl and its a bit skinny.  Its all made of a somewhat thick plastic, but, it could crack if you bump it a little too hard. And if the inside hookups to the valves are cheap as I suspect, then a good enough bump couldcause leaking on the inside.<br /><br />It would have been better if the neck that supports the valve assembly wasn't so skinny and the Valve assembly didn't stick out too far from the bowl.  You can see that in the photo.  If the valve system needed to be out that far from the bowl, then the neck should have been design with stronger materials or make the neck wider.  The valves seems to operate smooth but the handle seems cheap.  The fittings should have been brass instead of plastic.  Plastic is fine many cases, but, everything on the luxe is made of plastic.  The whole assembly tends to flex when you operate it and all those different types of plastic parts flexing in my opinion is asking for leaking.  The fittings and some of the links should have been brass or some other sturdy material.  There are plenty of sturdy alternatives that do not bump up costs much.<br /><br />$86.00 - 113.00?  Really?  More like $20-$40 value.  If they made some changes, then the unit might be worth it. For the price I could buy a Danco Gobidet.  Its not as pretty, but, I checked one out a demo at Lowes and it seemed way more reliable and practical!<br /><br />The only thing good about this whole experience was signing up for Amazon Prime.  I got quick shipping and got to stream a couple movies over the weekend.
5.0	Remember all those crappy, wimpy lamps that made you think &#34;There has to be a better quality, heavy-duty one out there?&#34;  This is it.  Quality steel construction.  Stays put where you want it.  Could not ask for better.  Just bought another one.
5.0	The install took maybe 10 minutes with most of that time spent trying to drain the tank.  Easy setup and all of the needed hardware was included for my needs.
5.0	My preteen daughter loves it!!:)
5.0	Great fit. I had to replace my old atomizer valve after using several gallons of Lucite primer & paint. My Wagner Sprayer loves it.
1.0	Very messy to use.  Paint goes on in gobbs.  Cleanup was painful and the gun is going to have paint that will never come off.  Way too much paint comes out when being used.  Container empties quickly, but at different speeds along the way.  I am very dissatisfied with my purchase and I would never recommend this unit.  I wish I could easily return it, but I tossed the box and it is full of paint.  Don't make the mistake I did.
5.0	I can't stand LED's which cast a brilliant white (blue).  This light has a warmer feel to it.  They are plenty bright. I bought two of these to replaced for two 13w CFL's.  This LED bulb is brighter.
1.0	Bought one of these and it arrived broken despite the package from the post office showing to signs of mistreatment. Its not really worth my time to repackage and bother with making a trip to the post office to return. Last time I purchase light-bulbs online.
5.0	This water filter is currently sitting in the kitchen cabinet over the fridge waiting its turn.  I purchased the current one at Lowes for a bit more when the &#34;replace filter&#34; indicator lit up on the GE fridge.  This saves me a trip to the store and a bit of money to boot.  The filter works very well.  Our water, compliments of IRWD, is not pleasant to drink from the tap due to a fairly high mineral content and this filter pretty much takes care of that and more.
5.0	Such a cool tool! Saved me hours and alleviated the need for tape!!
5.0	This opener is fantastic in every way. It's built like a tank. It's nearly silent. It's easy to install, considering all the safety provisions (cable tension monitor, door lock mechanism, etc.). Installation ook about 3 hours total (my first install, unpacking and lots of reading and re-reading included!). My only beef is with programming the up and down points after installation. The directions are 99% clear, but one spot in the instructions was a little unclear. On the third try, it worked, and voila! It's a pleasure to use, and I'm in awe every time it raises and lowers my 8' X 16' Haas door with high-lift track setup. I also added a keyless entry for ultimate convenience and coolness. I would strongly recommend this controller to anyone and everyone!!! Pure quality by Chamberlain.
1.0	We just bought all new Kitchen Aid appliances. This cleaner was recommended in the owner's manual. It left streaks on everything we applied it to. We ended up buying a can of Weiman SS spray cleaner, which works much better, with no streaking.
5.0	Bought 4 to store my wife;s and my kayak . Worked perfect.The product is exactly as advertised and strong.. saved quite a bit of money than going to sporting goods store.
5.0	Amazing.  This thing took all the mineral deposits off my toilet bowls in minutes without damaging the porcelain.  Great product.
5.0	Just what I was looking for
5.0	Very easy to sync to the garage opener and works great. Just as intended. Don't know why I waited so long to replace my lost clicker.
5.0	This is perfect if you have pets that constantly want to go in and out. I can leave the door open and not worry about the bugs.
1.0	I bought these from Lowes about a year or so ago. I first bought a set of five and, one-by-one, they all burnt out in just a few weeks or less of brief use (in a panel of 5 bulbs in a bathroom).  I exchanged a set of five several times, for a total of 15 bulbs tried in total, but had the same problem again and again and again. Yes, they were the correct fit (G25) and within the specified wattage restriction (60W). Finally I just gave up and have used a different style successfully for about a year since, proving it's not my light panel at fault. Seeing the same complaints from multiple customers here, the fault seems to be with GE. I'd have thought they had better quality control than that.
5.0	This is one of my favorite items! I think it does help a bit with &#34;purifying the air&#34;. I seem to breathe a little bit, if not completely better. I even got one of these for a gift. Very natural and it has a warm glow. You can pick how bright you want it; there's a dial to make it dimmer or brighter.<br />No problems yet, and I've had it almost a year!<br />I read online that the WBM brand was better than some of the other copiers, so that's something you may want to look into, depending on your preference.
1.0	Horrible. I followed the directions to the letter, and yet they still fell down a few days later. When I went to remove them, the tab on the adhesive broke off. I've used Command products in the past with good results, but I don't recommend using them on drywall, and they aren't always so easy to remove.
5.0	Top Notch Service... Was delivered quickly and exactly what they said they were! I used 3 watt flicker bulbs in mine and have them hanging in my porch all year... They look awesome for a nice little glow at night.
5.0	Tried it in my dishwasher and it works just great.  Going to have to wash my cloudy glasses a few more times to get it all off.......but this is finally the solution to my glassware problems!!
5.0	THIS WAS FOR A FRIENDS, SO I DON'T KNOW HOW IT IS WORKING
5.0	The wire is perfect for my paper flowers!
1.0	Light worked for 2 months then quit.
1.0	dented, packaged very poorly, parts were loose, tape was all over the aluminum which requires a lot of elbow grease and goo-gone to remove, shelves fit very poorly, in fact after I installed it and had so many issues with it I actually removed it. I'm glad others had better luck with it.
5.0	This looks to be just like the shelves in my freezer. Unfortunately, I ordered the wrong part. I didn't try to return it, just ordered the right one.
5.0	"This faucet is awesome.  Looks very expensive in our kitchen and is functional.  No leaks and we've had it for nearly 6 months.  My only \\""negative\\"" comment is regarding the part of the sprayer under your sink.  There is a weight that attaches to the outside of the hose for the sprayer (the sprayer pulls out from the faucet), and since our sink has a lot of pipes and whatnot underneath, it's sometimes a bit cumbersome to get the faucet to swivel to one side and stay there.  The weight gets caught and pulls it back.  You also have to push the sprayer back in to the faucet in order for the magnet to activate.  All that said, I still love this faucet and think it really adds a nice touch to the kitchen, plus it's extremely functional.  I really love the soap/lotion pump and how easy it makes washing large pots/dishes.  Go for it!"
5.0	easily replaced the broken one
5.0	These flex lines make changing a water heater a snap.
5.0	Fits my Lennox PureAir system and does what it is supposed to do.
1.0	This product works but, as many other posters have mentioned, the low and medium speeds are not usable. Low puts my ceiling fans at 15RPM which doesn't even create a breeze directly underneath it.
5.0	Worked exactly as intended!
1.0	I purchased this lamp from TJ Maxx.  One of the spider connections broke loose from the shade.  No way to mend.  Went back to store and two other lamps with identical issue.  Purchased new shade from Lowes, so now I can use however, added to the expense of the lamp.
5.0	It was very easy to install. I like it alot, I had a carriage light before but wanted something simpler that lit up the door area, not the sides or above the door, this fir the bill and is very nice and bright
5.0	Hands down the best security system out there!  Easy to set up and install.  Customer service is great and the system is very reliable.  Would recommend to anyone looking to secure their home.
5.0	Perfect replacement of original filter at a much better price. Water taste great and even increased my water flow.
1.0	The stainer is chrome plated. It got darkens in less than 7 months. ForThe stainless steel sink considering the price of drain strainer, it is a poor choice by The manufacturers .
5.0	It's battery, what's to say. It works as expected. The old one was a pain to remove because the previous owners put it in backwards...sigh...pay attention people.
5.0	Work well, about half the price of the Home Depot & Lowes products, fit the universal sized filter cannister, take out sediment & reduce hard water odor.
1.0	Would of given this negative stars if allowed. Amazon should be more careful of what they sell directly from their site. This cable is the right length but it will not work with the Ipad. I bought another cable from Verizon that worked fine for my Ipad.Ipod and Iphone but after a month or so it too shorted out as I have read in the reviews for this product. I say DO NOT buy a long cable until someone gets their head out of their butt and makes a reliable one.
5.0	I thought I had ordered a case of O'Keefe's Ale, but this hand cream showed up instead. It works very well, I highly recommend it to anyone who has to deal with cracked skin on his/her hands. I haven't seen anything work better for this problem. Stop reading and buy it!<br /><br />I'm not sure why I ordered O'Keefe's Ale. I don't drink, I'm sure glad Amazon screwed up and sent me this hand cream. I would call it a godsend, but I'm not religious.
5.0	I used these on my off white nursery walls, and they look great. They can easily be repositioned after applying. I actually just purchased a second set to apply to additional walls in the room. The 19 in the package nicely cover the tops of 2 of the walls in the nursery and my husband wanted more for a full border look. We have purchased other wall decals for the nursery and these are a nice compliment to them, since the other decals leave most of the tops of the walls bare and we can’t paint because we are in a rental. They arrived in the mail quickly and were folded, so we placed them under a heavy object for several hours before applying them to the wall.
1.0	Bulbs with this GU24 socket are extremely annoying to install into the light fixture, and the bulbs burn out very quickly. Totally unacceptable for an expensive bulb. I just ordered some GU24 to E26 (standard US light bulb socket) adapters (see link below), so I never again have to waste my time and money on these cra**y bulbs.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0080KZADE B0080KZADE]]
5.0	Beautiful pieces. Easy to install. Quickly shipped and packaged well.
5.0	I have tried other products, but this one is the best to remove old finishes on furniture.<br />I little difficult to use but if used correctly it is very good.
5.0	I love this kit. works great for my living room which i have two lamps in. I bought the USB controller for my PC so I could control it from my phone from within my wireless network or via 3G. Incontrol is a great little app for android and iphone that controls all the zwave products. I plan on buying a couple more lamp modules as well.
1.0	This filter does fit, but that's about all it does.  I honestly can't tell any difference between our 'filtered' water and water straight from the tap when using this one.  I'm referring to the taste of the water, I'm sure this thing might be filtering some stuff that I can't recognize but the water still tastes the same as tap water.<br /><br />Our water previously tasted great coming from the GE brand filter.  Don't scrimp like I did and try to save money in this case, please just get an original GE filter.
1.0	The idea may be a good one, but this as only worked once for me on my tab 2, and once only, the connection does not keep stable between this and the tab so I cant access anything from the memory cards, so i have to revert  back to my laptop.<br />I must have got the Friday afternoon one.
5.0	I was able to rekey every lock in my house to the same key.  Not only does it make it easy to get in the house quickly, but I was able to throw away three other keys on my key chain.
1.0	I bought this for my 9-year-old granddaughter.  She only had it a few days and it stopped working.  It was not very sturdy either.
5.0	As a bedside table lamp, these are just great. Not necessarily a reading light, but a very soft light (three-way...so variations of soft light, really). The &#34;tap&#34; feature...genius. If you hear a bump in the night, tap, and you can investigate. Also, they're quite cute. The black is a nice dull metal, which goes great with our iron bed frame. Plus, considering our bed is under the eaves, as are the bedside tables, the smaller size is absolutely ideal...anything larger wouldn't even fit right. So, after just a few weeks, we love these lamps and intend to get a few more for our nephew's bedroom as well.
5.0	Very bright , pure white
1.0	THIS WORKS GREAT I REPLACED LAST ONE HEATS LIKE NEW SAVED me a lot of money and it was so easy to replace.<br /><br />UPDATE!!!<br />So just went out great contacted seller they want me to send them a check and pay shipping to replace Yea sounds like scam to me if you sell parts on line and it goes out, you should be responsible for the part, not put it on the buyer. I was expecting send use the part we will send you a working one but NO they want part and more money OR buy one from them why would you buy a second part from the same buyer if the first one was junk.<br /><br /> Insanity doing the same thing expecting different results.
1.0	didn't work! I ran 3 in a row, and we still had that mildew smell from ONE forgotten load. Ended up using the tide powder HE washer cleaner with success.
5.0	in perfect conditions.
5.0	I love this stuff. It's not ultra easy to work with because it does dry quickly but that's also part of what makes it great. It's particularly great in winter when temps are low and I have to work in a low ventilated space. I used to use lots of waxes but this is my go to now. A little goes along way.
5.0	I like it. Very quite click when turning on/off light. Programming takes a little patience.
1.0	It beeps 5000 times when goes it off and picks up neighbors dog and only picks up every other car.
5.0	DAP Kwik Seal was just what I needed to filling small gaps in the tile grout around my sinks and tub.  They recommend a 72 hour (three day) dry time before exposing it to water- something I was not aware of when I bought it.  On the plus side, it dries rock hard, just like real grout (completely different from silicone caulking).  Would buy again.
1.0	Installed this fan last fall in my bedroom. Switched the fan direction switch for summer. Main reason for the ceiling fan is for summer.  it is so noisy on the summer mode that I can't sleep with it on. Complete waste of money.  I switched it back to winter mode & it is fine, but that just blows the hot ceiling air down making it hotter.  Don't buy it!
5.0	This is such a pretty night light, great quality and much prettier than it shows in the picture! Great night light!
5.0	I love the Hunger Games books and was pretty happy with the movie! I was always Peeta fan too so I was happy to find this decal for my laptop and MAYYYbe my car. The seller Bookigraphics, even included an extra &#34;practice decal&#34; that was the mockingjay! They gave instructions and youtube videos to help with the application process. Needless to say, I love the decal! Easy to apply and looks good!
5.0	Direct replacement for my old one and much smaller/better design
5.0	Excellent replacement for the filter in my Frigidaire refrigerator.
5.0	This flashlight is essentially one of the new HID white car headlights in a portable form. When pointed towards the ceiling, it will light up a whole room as if the lights were on. Great during a blackout. When used outside, the broad beam will light up an object as far away as a city block.<br />  The flashlight will stay lit for about an hour and a half before it needs to be recharged. it has a nice set of LEDs to show the charge.<br /><br />This is one terrific flashlight!
5.0	love this toilet,elegant
5.0	good price and quality!
5.0	High quality at a very reasonable price. Produces a good beam of light. The clamp works well and doesn't slip.
5.0	WHEN WE GUTTED AND REMODELED OUR HOME ABOUT 17-19 YEARS AGO WE  PUT IN A HUNTER FAN,I HAVE A THING ABOUT AIR MOVEMENT AND SO THIS THING HAS RUN NONE STOP FOR ALL THESE YEARS ONLY TURNED OFF THE FEW TIMES EACH YEAR WHEN I CLEAN AND REVERSE BLADES FOR SEASON. I WONT BUY ANYTHING ELSE. FOR THE PRICE THESE ARE THE MULES OF FANS.
5.0	This product did exactly what I was hoping for.  Notified me when I was in the other office.
5.0	Replacement for 15w CFL's. What a difference. Much brighter light, but are 3000K same as the CFL's were,and they come on instantly.. I am actually installing a dimmer. They are great for working in the kitchen but when I get up at 4AM they are almost to bright. Will be buying more.
5.0	I am quite familiar with the Hamilton Beach Grill ever since my George Foreman grill took a turn for the worse. I have to admit it was a blessing in disguise. Although they both do a great job grilling different varieties of food,I found cleaning the Hamilton Beach Grill to be quick and simple. Even if you're in a hurry and don't have time to clean it after a meal, a paper towel is really all you need for a quick wipe down. I would recommend it to all my friends.            Editor's note: I am in no way affiliated with Hamilton Beach products so this review comes straight from the heart......and from my fingertips too. If you have any questions just dial 1-800-just ask. Operators are standing by......only becuse their chairs haven't arrived yet...ha ha ha  !!!
1.0	When we received this part, it was not the correct part. If you call Moen, they will replace this part for free if your sink is still under warranty (or perhaps if it is not).
5.0	We put our window insulation up just today, and I'm amazed at how much of a difference it makes already! I knew I was feeling a draft before, even though we have double-pained windows, but I don't feel it at all anymore. It was quite simple. The tape went up easily, The plastic sheeting stuck to it well, and using the blow dryer got the wrinkles out quickly.  I have to say, however, the corner of the first window we covered started coming undone a little later in the evening ... but it was a quick, easy fix so I'm really happy.  We have a larger home and I don't like running my heater so much - it's hardly run that much this evening, and its really cold and raining outside.  I'm happy with this purchase!
5.0	Fast shipping Great service.Would recommend all the way.Thank you
5.0	If you buy packs of batteries at Costco like I do these are an absolute must
5.0	One of the earlier reviews stated that these did not look the same as the originals and were not made by Kohler.  These are - and they come with a spline adaptor so don't bother buying them (You can also likely remove them from the old cartridges.  If you have difficulty in removing the old part - put some vinegar on it and let it set for a few minutes - a suggestion I received from Kohler's customer service department (Who did an outstanding job helping me).  You probably won't need vinegar unless you have hard water - the water here is so hard you have wear a hardhat when it rains.  Once the corrosion is dissolved, it is easily removed and the new one is installed.  (I recommend using pipe dope or teflon tape so that if you have to remove it in the future it will be easier to do so.
5.0	Great mood lighting.  I'm satisfied.
5.0	I have a issue with hard water and I was looking for a simple solution as it made the skin dry after a shower. This is a inexpensive and simple solution to that problem. Installs easy and works well, the fresh feeling of the water an lack of smell makes this well worth while. I recommend and if I ever need to get another shower head for any reason this will be high on the list.
5.0	Very smooth operation
5.0	Nice looking step stool, not just some white metal frame junk.  Heavy duty, too heavy for the kids to carry it, but not too much for an adult - would not recommend for the elderly.  Snaps in place when you want it open, so it will not close when you don't want it to.  I like it, my wife likes it.  It matches our table and chairs.
5.0	Does the job!  Excellent light for a tight space.
5.0	My husband and I have been struggling for control of the tv for years!!! Kids were getting up in the middle of the night and watching tv or playing a game down in the family room where we couldn't hear them.  These same kids were half awake and grumpy during the day and falling asleep on their desk at school.  No more.  Thanks for making something that can help us all get better sleep.  Now I can leave the house and if someone is grounded from tv I know that it is not getting turned on while I am away.  Brilliant.  These should be sold in local stores.  More people need to know they exist. My kids did figure out that when the tv was unlocked they could unplug the tv and put in the volt bolt a different plug from say an alarm clock or something else.  I check at night that the right cord is plugged into the volt bolt.
5.0	This has proven to be a big help in assisting an elderly mother rise from a seated position. The angle allows her to pull herself forward or push herself up. Installation was no more difficult than expected (a couple of tiny screws were lost, but there were a few extras provided by the manufacturer). Excellent purchase for us.Thank you.
5.0	Worked  that's all I could ask for
5.0	I've used a Sprite filter for my blonde hair for many years.  It keeps me from turning green.  I highly recommend it.
5.0	The moaning noise and running toilet finally stopped!
5.0	This is a very bright light and doesn't get hot at all.  Worked great for my usage (for a paper hanging lamp)
5.0	My main concern was whether this newer version alarm would seamlessly connect with USI-1204 and USI-7795 alarms. It did. Very pleased.
5.0	I had a smaller one in my kitchen sink that stopped working so I got this replacement, it was very easy to swap out, i just followed the instructions on the package.  It looks very nice.  it does take a little more effort to make it dispense soap than my old one.
5.0	Wonderful! And the light displays a star-like pattern on the ground. Very nice for the money.
5.0	This cart is perfect for moving lighter objects around (up to 150 lbs) and is very simple to collapse or expand as needed. Takes up very little space when collapsed so it's very portable.
5.0	We love this lamp! It looks great in our kitchen. However, it was quite difficult to install. The screws that came with it were too short, making it impossible to install without longer screws. (We ended up purchasing the longer screws at our local hardware store.) Otherwise, this is a great lamp and definitely worth the cost.
5.0	easy to install and sturdy sink faucet for a non-vessel sink. the faucet is taller than the typical faucet so if you have a shallow sink, it may splash a bit.
5.0	very solid and brightest light i have ever used
5.0	Love it.  Its much better than the old one it replaced
1.0	I do not like this thermostat at all. At my other home, we had a Honeywell which was much easier to use. I wish I had gone with a Honeywell this time.
5.0	No more cold toilet seat! The seat cover fits snugly without slipping. Be sure you attach it properly. Shipping was fast.
5.0	Great lughting power low low consumption ok price
1.0	Hated it<br />I ordered two<br />In the display pic it looks like three for that price but its only one<br />The two that i did order came they both worked but the battery life isnt for a lomg time one didnt want to turn on after on day of use
5.0	does its job perfectly fine.  i currently only use it for my lawnmower, but it's perfectly lengthy for the outdoors
1.0	As far as I could tell it had to be drilled and mounted. I just want a shower rod. How hard is it???
5.0	Hey, you never know when you will come home one day and find your dog took a liking to the water filter cap. New cap and a few shots of &#34;Bitter Apple&#34; anti-pet-bad-taste-stuff and we are now good to go. Life is good.
5.0	This is sturdy, yet elegant.  I put creamy white linen shades on it,  but it is beautiful without them too.
5.0	It's perfect for my small computer desk. It lights the keyboard up really well and the flexibility is just what i need!
5.0	I love this little heater. It quickly wams my daughter's bedroom and I like the temperature control. I replaced it after nearly three years of daily use with the same model.
5.0	Not only is it fun, it provides a nice stream (I actually prefer this to the shower head we were using).  I would definitely purchase another if anything were to happen to ours, especially at the price listed.
5.0	I purchased two of these locks for indoor use about six months ago.  I got them to replace some fingerprint locks that didn't work very well for my wife ([[ASIN:B001TZ3ZYI BIOLOCK 333 SN-BK Biometric Fingerprint Entry Lever Door Lock with Remote Control, Satin Nickel with Black Accent]]).  These locks, on the other hand, are sturdy, well built and work flawlessly (when the correct code is entered).  The batteries have held up just fine and aren't showing any signs of needing replacing yet.  However, to be fair to the other reviewers who have had trouble with battery life, we don't access these locks every day.  There is a button on the top that will light up the keys.  This can be handy in semi-dark conditions.  What more can I say?  Security without keys.  My wife and I love these locks.  They look great, too.
5.0	this product works great.  Easy to install.  We installed it in our mudroom where our washing machine and dryer are.  Lays flat on the wall when not in use, so it's pretty inconspicuous.  You do need to wrap the cord back around the hook to ensure the line remains tight, and I won't say it is pulled mega-tight, but it's tight enough to hang a dozen shirts on, which is pretty good.
1.0	Not worth the money or effort. Purchased two sets of two. Opened one, found it worthless. Shelved the other & have never bothered to open.
5.0	Knowing nothing about any type of mailbox, I did some online research.  So far I am very satisfied with the mailbox which is sturdy and roomy enough to accommodate several days' mail which includes magazines.  The lock is also strong.
5.0	LOVE THIS LOVELY AND TRUE QUOTE ON MY WALL. ANYONE WHO ENTERS KNOWS THAT ME AND MY HOUSEHOLD SERVE THE LORD.
5.0	looks good, versatile, works great. freed up tons of room<br />in the cabinet. i bought 2 of them and they got installed at the fire house.<br />the guys love being able to just see their mug and grab it instead of<br />reaching inside the cabinet and searching around for their favorite one.<br />hope this helps
5.0	They work as they should. Can't say much more.
5.0	Very clear output display even in bright sun light I could still read the numbers very well<br />Been accurate as well
1.0	I saw the reviews had a 50/50 shot of working, so I decided to try my luck, unfortunately,  mine did not work. I had to put the old screen back on until I can order a different one, which was not a fun process. Very disappointed.
1.0	Poor design.....you can't drive the head of the nail all the way down without using a nail punch....
5.0	No surprises... just a spring, but exactly what I needed !!
5.0	Works great but the hose is a bit short and very stiff.
5.0	I use this stuff to attach things to walls and such in my apartment.  On most surfaces, you can peel it off in a year and it doesn't leave the sticky residue.  Between this product and 3m commander stuff, I can hang and decorate my apartment how I want and not worry about paying for damages later.<br /><br />I use these to attach LED lighting to bottom of kitchen cabinets, metal microwave oven (because I want LED white light instead of yellow built-in), and my desk.  I've also attached cable holders to back of my entertainment center.  This stuff is amazing, not only in its ability to &#34;hold&#34; but also in the fact that you can remove it a year or two later without leaving damage behind (depending on the surface).  Using a plastic putty knife and a little patience you can remove it from most anything, though on good wood and metal it will just peel right off.
5.0	I purchased this item not expecting to much from it due to the cheap cost. I am shocked at how good the item is. I have had it for months now and I cant stand to use the restroom away from home. The savings on not having to buy toilet paper alone is great. Wireless remote control works great. I cant think of anything negative to say about this product. I dont usually write reviews unless i am pissed off about an item but this item is so good that i have to let you know It is well worth the cost.
5.0	This is the best shower head we have ever had.  The pressure is great, and it does not use too much water.  No notice of increase in monthly water bill with dual heads and great showers!
5.0	Its a great little box to store your documents in.  It was a good little box and just as described.
1.0	Broke in half after only a month of use.  Apparently, it's made from very cheap materials.
1.0	These replacement knobs are horrible quality. They fit but look terrible. Using the name Whirlpool in the description should not be allowed as it insinuates they are OEM. Not acceptable.
5.0	Product installation appears easy. I had it installed by a professional electrician who had already run the wiring for it, so hooking it up took him about 5 minutes. It is not the sleekest product to look at on your ceiling, but really....what Smoke/CO alarm is? I work in high end residential construction and this alarm is specified on a lot of jobs by various GC's and architects so I trust it to be good enough for my home and of good working value. No issues or complaints with it thus far.
5.0	I seen Simplisafe advertised on The Blaze TV and thought it would be great for me. I ordered it and installed it in about two and a half hours. Installed about fifteen sensors  on windows and doors. Just follow the instructions and you will be fine. Works fine and at fifteen dollars a month can't beat it. Only thing I will say is be careful opening or closing mini blinds so they don't knock off the sensor. It really is not a problem, just hold the blind so it don't hit. If it does come off it's simple to put back on. No wires to worry about or contracts.
5.0	Great fit shades busted in move surprised to find fit great very pleased to be able to still use lamp
5.0	The felt inner lining was separating on the original lint screen that came with my dryer.  This is a much sturdier and better lint screen that works as a replacement!  The felt is securely attached as is working great so far.
5.0	very classy look; used as a border top and bottom on a  kitchen backsplash
5.0	Great thing ever all I can say is thank you. My butt love it lol
5.0	Extremely fast shipping,  no issues with unusable canisters.  Great price. These are old, dated from mid to late 1970s. Best price I've seen in a while for these particular filters.
5.0	i hope i never have to hear this, but it is easy, light weight,and would scare most people off. they were here the day after i ordered them!
5.0	I love this thing! Its in my bathroom, where I put my toothbrush and comb and whatever else. the clock is awesome and the entire design just looks cool. I have currently two tetras in there and they love it! The fake plant and the water fountain are really cool, along with the changing LED lights. FAIR WARNING, the amount of gravel they give you is not alot, and if you have really small fish in there they can get stuck in gaps of the side and die(R.I.P. StarBurst). However this is an awesome tank/desk/counter thing and I love it.
5.0	I was stunned at the results. I first used a sister product to get the scratches hidden and used this as a polish over the repairsl  I love the shine and how beautiful this looks.  The furniture had a very thin veneer that I had to handle carefully and this product does the trick!
5.0	We use this to put 2 night lights in both areas of large staircase.  It works beautifully and lights up the dark (wood) passage way.  Perfect!!  One end is secured over balcony area and the other near the floor at the top of stairs....lights up beautifully with the clear bulb night lights we use.  And we didn't have to re-wire!
5.0	These washers seem to be recommended across many forums for securing plaster. They worked as expected and I would order again.
5.0	These are great in that they adjust themselves for when daylight changes.  You never have to touch it.  Lights on at dusk and off at dawn is the setting I prefer.
5.0	Super bright and energy efficient.
5.0	"It was a simple replacement, using nothing but a screwdriver!  Even a \\""rookie\\"" like me was able to complete the job in one day .... not bad for a rookie!<br /><br />Once installed, you had to \\""tweak\\"" the latch mechanism to make a tight fit, but it was all quite easy and it even had my wife's approval."
5.0	This is an excellent product I highly recommended
5.0	If you compare this to a chain drive model, there really is no comparison. This is an order of decibels quieter.<br /><br />I actually replaced a 5 year old whisper drive Chamberlain belt drive model which I had installed to replace a Craftsmen chain drive model.  The reason why I went ahead and took the trouble to replace the older whisper drive is that this one claimed to have a start that was smooth when first opening or closing. The older whisper drive was quite, but it kind of bounced the door on the tensioner spring just a bit, which was a bit annoying.  Well, this one doesn't seem to bounce the door anymore, so it sounds even better!<br /><br />So in addition to the slight bit of added &#34;quiet&#34; this one also is My Q enabled.  This is a worthless feature if you don't go ahead and buy the Chamberlain wireless gateway (which I have).  With the wireless gateway, you go through a pretty painless registration process.  After that, you can use the MyQ app to see if your door is open or closed.  You can also open and close the door from your app.  This is nice if you ever have a &#34;did we close the garage door&#34; moment.  It also apparently has some sort of notification feature that I couldn't really figure out what it did for me even though I activated it.<br /><br />My only complaint is that the black and white sketches that accompany the install guide don't always directly look like the parts in the box.  They are close, but sometimes just enough off to have you scratching your head a little.<br /><br />Otherwise, great purchase.  I hope it lasts a long time!
5.0	Lights have a nice warm even glow.  Very nice for indirect lighting applications.
5.0	perfect, just what I need. Best price I've found, thanks
5.0	I spent a lot of time researching the perfect kitchen sink and found it on Amazon at about 35% cheaper than the high end kitchen showrooms I have visited over the past several months. I read several articles stating that this grade of sink was a bit of overkill and I can't disagree enough. I could see how easily lower grade sinks could scratch or dent fairly easily. We knew it was amazing quality when we opened the box, it comes in it's own bag (like designer purses) and not one blemish on it. The stainless steel has a beautiful finish and definitely not your mother's kitchen sink. Once this was installed I was even more impressed at the solidness of this piece. Tapping on the side reveals its strength and quietness. This is definitely commercial grade. You will never regret this purchase. The accessories are just as fabulous down to the special polishing cloth.
1.0	the filter does not fit all the way, the arrows don't line up causing the water to come out extremely slow, 2 minutes to fill up an 8oz cup is ridiculous.  I tried to install several times and still wouldn't line up.
5.0	DOES THE JOB AND WAS A BARGAIN
5.0	Good lights and cheaper than in Home Depot. Buy
5.0	We have a bird bath that's been leaking for the past few years, and I saw something like this advertised on TV. And I don't believe half of what I see on TV commercials. I cleaned and dried the bird bath and sprayed Leak Seal on the bird bath. I been watching it for about a week and this stuff really works.
5.0	These are the best wood floor protectors on the market. You do have to hammer then in, but they stay put and seem to never wear out. I have used them for many years. GREAT PRODUCT.
5.0	Feels solid when using. Finish is good. Supplied crews could be longer, but ok.<br /><br />Be careful when installing this unit. You don't want to drill too big a hole for the part that pivots into the door. If you do, and you chisel out the opening for the flush component, you can see the hole from the side of the flush part (grrr.).
1.0	I use the 377 batteries in a Laserlyte LT-9 training cartridge.  With 3 good batteries, the cartridge delivers about 3,000 good laser pulses.  Three Renata batteries deliver only about 20 or 30 weak puses, then fizzle completely.  I have to wonder whether the product I bought (from another vendor) were knock-offs.  The packaging appears identical, however.
5.0	It is so much easier for kids to shower with this!  We already had the attachment on the shower head for our shower cleaning hose. It is great that both products use the same attachment.
5.0	fast and excellent product
5.0	After paying a plumber over $100 to come out and use one of these, I bought my own.  EVERYONE should have one...
5.0	We have vacation rental properties and use these to remotely control tenant access. Have held up well over the two years we have had them installed.
5.0	Very pretty and the perfect size.<br />Good light. Put them in my living room.<br />Would love them even more if they came in left and right models.
5.0	Very easy to install, the hard job in my case, was removing the existing faucet. Had to resort to a side grinder, to remove it from the top side.       The quality of this unit is very good for the price paid, it works as well or better than any unit I'm familiar with. No problems at all, highly recommended.   It's tall which is very good. The spray centers in both drains. The spray hose has a quick connect in the off center, and a brass weight, this is a quality fixture all the way. You will not be disappointed.
5.0	This was a gamble and it has paid off. Though Portland, OR doesn't have high levels of chloramine, the effects on skin and hair are slightly noticable. I'm getting about 6 weeks of cartridge use from a single shower daily of about 10-15 minutes.
5.0	I got this mainly for my husband's shoes. It great to use this on low heat and dry his shoes. I can also use it for other items that shouldn't be tumbled, like hats in a hat frame. Great
1.0	I bought this fan for my three year-old son's room, for his birthday.  I received it in August, and as life with a three year old (and a new born can be) I didn't get the fan up until last weekend (Feb 26,2011).  The fan installed as per the instructions.  One MAJOR issue, the first time I hit the reverse (rotation) button, the fan made a loud hummmm and slowly reversed it's direction... never to pick up speed again.  Now, no matter which way it rotates and no matter which speed I hit (low, medium or fast), it rotates at a speed less than low.  Obviously, I'm past my 30 day return window and I don't know what to do or where to turn.  I HIGHLY don't recommend this fan.
5.0	Bought 1 to test out. Ended up going back to buy a 2nd one. These even work great & adheres very well onto the brick above door frame. The light produced is sufficient & turns on within about a 10-15ft distance. I'm happy with it.
5.0	These little dimmers are great in hotel rooms that get really dark and you care enough about your partner not to turn on a light or crash and stumble around in the dark
5.0	Just what we needed my husband had back surgery and this fit our shower perfectly.  Thanks again for this great product
5.0	Covered my side door opening, so I can keep the door open and let the air and breeze into the house.  Better than a flimsy product I bought ready made for the door last year, that didn't quite reach and so cheap it was useless. Make your own, I say. Wish this product came in white, is that possible?
5.0	Easy to install and dresses up a generic door very quickly and inexpensively.<br /><br />One note, my garage door has &#34;mullions&#34; that are too narrow to use the handles side by side - the edges hang over and create a gap. You could use just one handle, but it looked a little funny to us ... we decided not to use the handles.<br /><br />We also added the faux windows, which looks nice.
5.0	Item was a direct replacement. Works as expected.
5.0	Works as advertised, Very easy to operate. Those that give it a neg review must have trouble tying their shoes.
1.0	I just got it today and it is leaking at the bottom of the handle. I will be returning it asap.
1.0	These work great. And are only $8.88 at Lowes. So Amazon, what gives? This is not like you...
1.0	Didn't move a drop of water. The unit's impeller spun (and was intact) but pump had no effect. I will order another and hope the first one I got was a rare defect.<br /><br />UPDATE<br />Received replacement. Same as original. Since pump does not move water, the internal thermostat never reaches temperature so the pump never stops running. There are no check valves in the system as has been suggested might be the problem. The pump being on or off had no affect on the arrival time of warm water.
1.0	Buyer beware.<br />I've always thought that &#34;Universal&#34; actually meant &#34;Universal&#34;!<br />Apparently, I was wrong.<br />&#34;Universal&#34; means 'United States Universal'. Oh, sooo not cool!<br />Do your research.<br />Take your measurements.<br />Make sure that your measurements are metric or you'll receive a set of casters that are stupid and won't fit your office chair!<br />Arrrrgggghhhhhh!!!  How frustrating!
1.0	The item came and what a mess! There was a large crack down the middle of the seat. I had to package the mess up and ship it back. How annoying! I asked for a replacement. I hope bad luck doesn't strike twice!!! Buyer beware!!!! It is very tricky to buy items like these online. Be smart- go to a store like Bed Bath and Beyond and save yourself a big headache!!!
5.0	Love this faucet. Works great in my master bath and really adds pizzazz to an otherwise bland room without looking out of place.
5.0	I actually have had this exact fan for 20 years and finally replaced it when it died with the same one. It is big, quiet, and works great. Perfect for my porch with a low ceiling and a large area.
5.0	looks good great price
5.0	I put a 60w appliance bulb in it so that the lava would be hot enough to rise and fall.  The original 40w that came with it didn't work.  I had the same problem with my first lava lamp (which was smaller than the Century), as it came with a 15w bulb and I had to use a 40w for that one.  With the 60w in the lamp now, the Century is percolating beautifully!
5.0	Great brightness and exactly what I was hoping for. Gives great light in bathroom with no windows.
5.0	Nice quality for a fantastic price. One would probably pay twice the price for this item at a retail shop or catalog. I didn't have a door bell or door knocker, so this has proven to be an excellent buy for me. It's a good fit for my  antique western / country / horse-themed decor. Works well, and was fairly easy for a disabled adult like me to install, as well!  Thanks, Genuine Texas Brand!
5.0	I needed something to prevent dirt from getting into my house. I had tried outdoor carpet, but it seemed to trap hair from the nearby dryer vent. Yuck. I couldn't picture rubber mats on wooden deck-type steps but couldn't find a better material. I'm glad I took a chance with these mats. I'm really happy with them. They dress up my side entrance, they trap lots of dirty, and I can clean them off with the hose.
5.0	So far no problems as others have reported, ie. short life of led.
5.0	best little flashlight I have owned. the 3v 123 really makes it shine.  very bright LED, yes 160 L, nice zoom.  not as bright as the larger version with 2 cr 123 batts.  but i use this one almost every night.  i use Tenergy 123 rechargables.  work fine.  fits in my pocket easily. hold in my mouth when I need my hands. did i mention VERY bright?  Toss all your old incandescent.  Just have some of these around. never need another flashlight unless you need the larger version for a BIG bright light.
5.0	So why doesn't the manufacturer get this excellent product into Home Depot or Lowes?  Shipping was fast, but not as fast as running to the store.  Be aware that you need a 5/8&#34; shelf while most shelves sold in stores are 3/4&#34;.  Perhaps the manufacturer could make a larger shelf anchor???
5.0	Great cheap bday presents from age 4-10 and a hit
5.0	Very functional device and serves multiple protection options. High quality item and inexpensive for what it does.
5.0	I had a worned out flapper from Toto and leaks constantly.<br /><br />Once I replace it with the Korky 2022BP Flapper, it stops the leak.<br /><br />Now the toilet are working again!
5.0	Excellent-as avertised
5.0	I used these in five light fixtures converting from T12 to T8.  Followed the wiring diagram on the unit and they all worked fine with no buzzing sound like the original T12.  Have been in service for about 5 months now.
1.0	BROKE WITHIN ONE WEEK JUNK DONT BUY.  STICK WITH THE ONES FROM THE APPLE STORE THEY ALSO GIVE YOU YEAR WARRANTEE
5.0	Have had this a few months now and it seems to work great. We've had no issues at all. We tried getting this size tank at our local HD and Lowes but they didn't carry this size. As usual, we found it on Amazon, priced right & free delivery. You can't go wrong with Amazon!
5.0	Love it. Looks good. easy to use and setup. comes with the hanging bracket things.
5.0	For those of you looking for a quick review, this is not it. Just take my star rating for what I think about this light.<br /><br />I'm writing this review today, because I just came across my old flashlight buried under several packing boxes with layers of dust from way back when. I served in the Army over 20 years ago under SOCOM, so this flashlight has a minimum of that many years under its belt and all the action marks that comes with it. The casing is some sort of plastic (I think). Mine has all the wear marks to be expected from the field, so don't expect this flashlight to be one of those new tactical-aircraft-aluminum &#34;looks like new after 20 years of use&#34; type of lights.<br /><br />When I returned from service, I packed all my issued equipment, and placed my efforts into reincorporating into civilian life. I basically forgot about this light... for the next 20+ years. Finding it today with my assistant as we were going through these boxes, (and I can't explain why - it is just natural human tendency) I clicked on the power button - not expecting anything special, and... IT TURNED ON.<br /><br />My assistant who was next to me tried to call &#34;BS&#34; on the whole situation, saying something about how the batteries &#34;would have already leaked etc. if it were really that old...&#34; but he couldn't deny that the flashlight was working (and the batteries did NOT leak!) as I just kept quiet and flashed the light in his eyes. He tried to date the batteries (2 D-cell energizers), and there are graphics on these batteries... well, they are not on the newer batteries. If anyone knows how to 'date' battery models, I would love to further confirm the date on these batteries! That would be funny.<br /><br />Mine says &#34;FULTON - Made in U.S.A.&#34; on one side. On the other, horizontally, &#34;MX-991/U.&#34; The paint has worn off from the switch and clip (looks like brass underneath). They are not as light (weight-wise) as some of these newer models when they have the batteries inside, nor do they give off a tremendously high &#34;lumen&#34; count. However, I'm not sure this could be considered a &#34;con&#34; for the type of use that these lights were originally designed for. I can't tell you how long the batteries would take before they burned out, but I'm sure you could find it somewhere on the internet. Are these energy efficient? Probably not. But when the lights go out, I'll be glad to have something like this around - because I know it will work for as long as it can.<br /><br />Anyway, maybe I'm just old-school, but when I hit that switch, and the light flashed on, I was simply amazed. So, I guess this should be considered an &#34;amazing product&#34; for me. I don't know. You tell me if you think this qualifies. My assistant says, &#34;impressed&#34; instead of &#34;amazed.&#34; Fine.
5.0	Installed these on my outdoor lighting transformers. They do NOT have a memory of the setting if power is lost but this is a compact and well designed unit so it gets 5 stars.
5.0	I keep a box of these in my desk, in case I, or one of my coworkers has an emergency. I can't count the number of times these have come in handy.
5.0	My daughter-in-law wanted this for her birthday.  She loves it.  She says it works great and the oils we put with it are wonderful.
5.0	I've bought 5 of these product to use in all of our toilets. It is extremely easy to install and extremely easy to use. the quality of product is high and we've been using it for months now. for me, this is a must in any toilet.
5.0	Words are just so much easier to remember than numbers, I ordered four of these and my family knows the magic word, less likely to forget the code in the months between trips.
5.0	Was looking for narrow beam, low energy, daylight bulb and this has worked out great.  Appears to be good quality also.
5.0	Not exactly what I had expected; however, they fit quite nicely and stay in place when cleaned.  I would buy them again.
5.0	I was trying to find a way to move heat from my pellet stove in the basement to the upper floor in my house. I installed two ducts one for cold air return and one for heat with inline pusher fans. I found that it push air all the time because I could not control the fans. I purchased and installed this unit and set the air temp that I wanted the fans to operate at. Wow it works great now, nice and warm and I now use half the pellets that I used before.
5.0	Great! as described!!!
5.0	This fits well in Sears Garage door opener. Less expensive and faster delivery than Sears. All needed parts were included and clear instructions. Highly recommended supplier and product.
5.0	These have now been in use on a tile kitchen floor for 4 manths and are great.  They stay on unlike the stick on type and slide better than the nail on ones.  Had tried felt and as soon as they got dirty It was hard to move chairs unless you lifted them.  Thes are heavy wood chairs
5.0	My hot water heater is on the other side of my home. I watch 4 to 5 gallons of water go down the drain until it gets hot. I remodeled my kitchen with this unit installed in the sink base cabinet and it's great. Hot water right now!
5.0	Perfect for my needs.
5.0	I can turn my Christmas lights on from the inside of the house. No more going out into the Cleveland winter. Woohoo.
5.0	HARD TO FIND BUT NICE TO HAVE FOR A COLONIAL SETTING.  USED IN THE WINDOWS. GOOD QUALITY AND GLAD TO HAVE SOURCE FOR PURCHASE.
1.0	Hello well I'm not sure how to contact this company directly since there is no &#34;contact seller&#34; option and I would love to change this to 5 stars if they can help. My mother and I bought two sets of these lights one for her room, one for mine. My lights work perfectly and look beautiful, I can't say the same for my mother. I helped her install the lights and when we went to turn them on the lights flickered once and did not work anymore. I went and got the little white box that connects the lights with the sensor and plugged it into my mom's lights and it works again is there any way you can send us another little white box to replace the one in my room?
5.0	This is a great light. I have found many uses for it on many occasions. Plus D cell batteries are very common.
1.0	Would not buy again.. Feels like your going to fall in...
5.0	The Luxe Bidet Vi-110 is very helpful for people with disabilities, people like myself.  Having physical limitations from an industrial accident that left me with weakness in my arms and legs.  This Bidet is one of the best products I have purchased on Amazon.com.  It is extremely easy to install with all parts included.  15 minutes tops and working without issues.  I have had this now for several months and have not had any issues or failures.<br /><br />Helps with personal hygiene for both males and females while saving excessive use of toilet paper.  I highly recommend this product to all ages, whether disabled or not.  It just makes everything easier, cleaner and saves money by reducing toilet paper usage.  You will always feel clean and fresh!  Thanks for an excellent product.<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005IT4C6G
5.0	This item was as requested shipped fast from PR an worked great, Easy to install, anyone is capable of this!
5.0	Beautiful!  I bought these to put in an alcove where real candles would not be safe.  The alcove is up high and the remote makes &#34;lighting&#34; them so easy!  They look real and add the perfect amount of light and glimmer to my décor.
5.0	My hubby put this on each of our chair legs. He said they were easy to put on, just needed a little hammer to hit them on. They slide nicely on our new vinyl floor in the kitchen.
5.0	I like these lights.  Easy to put together.  Not a super bright light, but enough to light the area nicely.<br />Very happy with my purchase.
5.0	"I am very satisfied with this RoomMates Pooh Growth Chart sticker.  Amazon also offers the best price.  The sticker is see through, so it goes very well with my light-yellow wall color.  The Pooh sticker is also a very good size. You can also remove and rearrange the sticker easily.  The sticker is not a thin, cheap material. I like this sticker much better than the other RoomMates \\""large\\"" Pooh sticker."
5.0	I have tried different PAR 20 LEDs over the last few years and was always disappointed.  These are....nearly perfect. The warm 2700K is a really close match to the halogens, they actually seem slightly brighter, have a good angle, and smooth dimming.  The only difference vs. the halogens I have found is that on very low dim they move to the white side of spectrum whereas the halogens go more to yellow. I am replacing all 21 of my 50W halogens with these 8W wonders.
5.0	It is very bright and useful.<br />I use them as night lights, table decorations, arts and crafts, chandeliers for camping, etc. I love it.<br />i will order more soon.
5.0	Nice lights  Just make sure you get the covers for the lights too.  I had to contact the company and get the shipped to me.  The are good lights though...
5.0	This product was a fraction of the cost of similiar product offered by Hans Grohe. Great quality and works perfectly. Shipping was on time and packaged well. I'd order fro this vendor again.
1.0	Junk.  I looked at the picture, saw the price and said, sure I'll try it out (temporary solution while our door is being repaired).  Not worth the packaging it was shipped in.  In no way operates like a door, does not look anything like what is pictured.  It's basically sheet of cheap gauze with a thin wire around the edge. No handles, no hinges, no regidity, in no way possible to operate as a door. and too flimsy to operate as even a put-in-place sheild to prevent bugs from entering.
1.0	I used a new sprayer once then cleaned up. The following day it wouldn't start-up. I called BIC WAREHOUSE and they said to call manufacturer.The manufacturer said that BIC WAREHOUSE has to give you your money back.I called back to BIC WAREHOUSE and the women said to remove my negative feedback from the BIC WAREHOUSE website,and once you do that we will reimburse you your cost of sprayer. So I called AMAZON and told them what was going on,they indicated that was against the policies of AMAZON. AMAZON DIDN&#34;T and doesn't  have any power to make a merchant comply with there rules, what a joke. After weeks of agrivation I decided to remove my feedback from BIC WAREHOUSE web site. When and only then did BIC WAREHOUSE refund my money back. So today is the first time I have been able to share my big problem with BIC WAREHOUSE. DONT BUY ANYTHING FROM BIC WAREHOUSE, buyer beware.There rude and vindictive.
5.0	Just what I needed, some felt stick ons to keep some fot he chairs in my living room from scratching our hardwood floors. Work perfectly and they seem really durable. A pack with various sizes was great to have because they fit all the different furniture without mehaving to cut them smaller. Definitely recommend these!
5.0	When I moved in with my mom to help her out I brought my cat with me. My cat barfs a lot. On the carpet. This stuff works. Sometimes it takes a couple applications. Hint: apply generously for best results.
5.0	it is great, I was replacing the old one, I knew what I was getting, I will not have an attic without one. it saves money removing the heat out of the attic.
5.0	Easy to find in dim light and figure is identical to my cat. Even cat likes it. I would recommend.
5.0	I needed a set of forks to carry a generator, work box and supplies around my farm, these appear to be just what I ordered. I would recommend the adjustable stabilizer as it seems to prevent movement of the forks. Shipping was amazingly fast!
5.0	Needed a second receiver and found this at a real good price, loves this unit. I am using 2 receivers for 2 separate driveways.
5.0	Worked great for us.<br />Looks a bit scary when the motorcycle was loaded into the bed of our truck...but wide enough to give footing on each side to stabilize the ride up... and down.<br />Made well, strong and sturdy metal.<br />Quality at good price over the retail comparable.<br />Shipped quick and carefully packed.<br />Assembly took less than 30 minutes to place parts right,..(others might do this faster) but take do your time to lay it all out flat and get it right the first time,
5.0	I love this! I wanted something to decorate my large bathroom so I split this design into three separate decals. Thanks to the instructions on the back of the package this was very simple! It has only been a week but so far nothing is peeling or starting to fall. I have moved and replaced one at least three times with no damage to my paint nor loss of adhesive. I will update if I do have any issues but considering it has lasted in the high humidity of my bathroom this may be a winner!    Update: Three months later and they are still holding well in my bathroom even with the humidity. Great product!
5.0	If you can buy an &#34;elegant&#34; step stool, this is it. Beautifully crafted. One we will hang onto for life .
5.0	I started out buying one to see how I liked it and ended up buying two more for my other bathroom showers
5.0	Installation wasn't bad. Came with everything but the outside keypad, so make sure you order that as well. Also, if you have a stand alone garage with only one way in or out, get that lock you have to drill through the door in case your power goes out.<br /><br />Installed it about 3 weeks ago and it runs like a champ. If it lasts 20 years+ I'll give it 6 stars.
5.0	I have a refrigerator from costco that is about 8 years old that I keep in the garage. The freezer was working great but air wasn't getting to the bottom refrigerator. Found this part to be bad, the spade connectors are oriented a little differently than the original but worked great.
1.0	I have used 3M tabs and hooks for almost a decade and they have never disappointed me (in fact, they've often exceeded my expectations), until I bought these mini-hooks with the clear tabs. I followed the instructions, used rubbing alcohol, and applied for 30 seconds, and the HOOK wouldn't even stay on the wall, let alone allowing me to hang anything on it (I would estimate that what I was trying to hang weighs about two ounces). It wasn't an odd surface or anything--just a semi-gloss painted wall. I don't know if the clear tabs are too thin for the hook or just not sticky or what, but I will definitely be returning these to the store (I didn't buy them on Amazon, I am just writing a review to warn customers) in hopes of getting my money back. If you want to buy 3M mini-hooks, make sure you buy them with the regular white tabs (which work perfectly fine), not the clear tabs. I would give these zero stars if I could.
5.0	Perfect for my legal size documents.
5.0	Works great. No problems.
5.0	Not sure why it's so expensive for so little.<br />But alas it is a wonder putty. And i used it to strengthen the Apple Lightening Cords ends.
5.0	Awesome price and great consistency in color temp and brightness. I will buy them again if needed i highly doubt it
5.0	very happy with this mailbox, easy to install and the mailman puts mail in it, color should be stated more clearly and more color choices would be nice.
5.0	Good fit... Great Quality Generic Replacement... Great Price...
5.0	you must have this part with the linear drain.
5.0	These were the correct parts. The job is simple enough, but time consuming (about 3.5 hours). Works perfectly!
5.0	It is very easy to use. And I  like that I can always change the password.
5.0	I had previously purchased three of the self contained units from this company and they were great. I purchased this one as a gift for a friend. It's a great light that does what it's supposed to. It works very well and puts out a good amount of light for a solar/battery powered unit.
5.0	I am able to get this to activate from the end of my driveway and even from inside the house through brick and stone walls.  This was also fairly easy to program in that it took more time to drag out the ladder and set it up in the garage than it did to take off the cover and program the opener.  I would definitely recommend this to someone wanting a smaller opener, especially those who ride motorcycles or mopeds.
5.0	Love it. Best home improvement decision of the year.
5.0	Both my wife and I love the bidet. Like many others have said, after living in Italy, and having travelled to Tunisia and other predominantly Muslim countries, we developed an appreciation for bidets. I would encourage guys looking at these products to also consider the dual-nozzle version. The nozzles, besides having a slightly different angle, also have a different spray, and it can be nice to have the variety for thorough cleaning. Highly recommended. Our toilet paper usage has dropped significantly, and we'll never again have a toilet without one.
5.0	This drum belt is so affordable compared to other stores. if you are a DIY-er the installation is a quick and easy. Saved my self 65.00 dollars. Great Product.
5.0	This shower head is unlike any other shower experience that I have ever had. It makes many small streams of water which feel great on your skin. It makes my skins so soft after I shower that I don't need lotion anymore. It does create almost a wind turbine though, and my curtain liner keeps flying in so I'll have to get a more heavy duty one to prevent that. Overall, I love this.
5.0	Lots of chimes, including seasonal. Easy installation and more than loud enough. In fact, the highest volume setting is too loud. Can't speak to the longevity of this product but hope that it will provide many years of service. My only beef is that it cost considerably more for the color options. By this I mean 35% higher than the white model. What's with that?
5.0	Using for ceiling. Made well. Uniform from roll to roll. No problem matching pieces together to look as if it is one piece.
5.0	I have had these up on my bathroom walls for 10 months now and still love them!  I have even rearranged a few and they stick great.  There are plenty to go around without feeling overwhelmed with decals and are really nice quality.  They are big and colorful and look adorable. My son loves his duck themed bathroom, especially the bubble stickers.
5.0	This happened to be the exact size I needed for my new sink. Helps to protect it from scratches. Very pleased with this product.
1.0	This product wasn't high quality at all. The &#34;case&#34; that came with it was a flimsy little cloth that you put over it to &#34;protect&#34; it.<br />This product broke a couple of months after I got it. I should have bought a case for it thinking it being in my bookbag would be good enough to keep it from damage but I found out real quick I was wrong.<br /><br />The usb to usb wire is a joke. For some reason it comes with 3 usb plugs. 1 on either end but a third one on the side of one like a side attachment. (Guess the side one is so you can plug 2 objects into the computer but that's a waste) Never used that side one, however, I was confused as to which usb plug to put in the drive and which to put in my computer because it actually matters for some reason. If you plug it in the wrong way, your computer won't even detect it.<br /><br />It is best to have a different kind of connection to go into the hard drive. Not a usb to usb.<br /><br />If you want a portable hard drive get a 1tb Seagate Backup Plus I bought a case with it and it works beautifully every time I plug it in. It has 3 different kinds of connections.
5.0	When baking bread in a dutch oven at 450 to 500 this is the only way to go.
5.0	After trying a few models we went straight to this one.  The color was dead on with our 65W regular flood bulbs but with much more output.  We were able to get a bright warm light if that makes any sense.  We put 6 of these on dimmers with great results.  They do not make a sound and dim way down.  Can I give them 6 stars?
5.0	Top shelf switch. I purchase 3 more after my initial purchase of one.
5.0	These are great. I love the timer feature. Come on and go off at the same time each day.  Are bright and safe since there is no actual flame.
5.0	Works great for thin wires,You can fit one electric and one speaker wire together , or one network cable and one speaker but you will not be able to slide them. Bit hard to close, but it looks great on the wall, if you run it along the base board you can barely see it.
5.0	For its price, its likely the best bang for buck. The install was a breeze. The parts all seems to be high quality. I have no complaints at all. And I'm a picky buyer. I recommend it.
5.0	Easy to install and works good.  I mistakenly purchased 40 watt bulbs which when installed did not allow room for the cord to be pulled, but once I installed the correct 32 watt bulbs it has worked great.
5.0	Best for night lights. No loss of night vision when you get up in the middle of the night. Almost zero watts to run these beauties!
5.0	All I ask is for quiet and these deliver.  They look nice too.  It's nice that there were so may mounting options available to me.  Since I use my in the office/guest room, I chose flush mount.
5.0	Fast shipping.  These were top quality and did the job.
5.0	Easy to program.  No problems.
5.0	The item purchased worked as intended. Easy installation and sturdy design. I'm so happy to have my dishwasher working again.
5.0	This is a very important tool to have if you have a garbage disposal. Comes in handy!!!!!!!! When the disposal is stuck you just put this underneath it and give it a quick jerk and it dislodges the problem.
5.0	Good quality thank you
5.0	Should add the little extra bit of insulation. Arrived quick and wasn't to hard to install.
5.0	This product is awesome and works exactly the way they show in their You Tube how to videos. I broke a bathroom tile and you can not tell where the repair is. Worth every penny!
5.0	Holds some shirts and if weighted evenly, I had two pairs of jeans hanging from either end.  Items have to be hung a certain way or it will colapse onto itself, but after i realized what I was doing, it worked properly...I would recommend...cheap plastic, but with proper use, it should last a while
1.0	Junk.  Instructions very poor and could not install!!! Tried for an hour to install. There is no way to install on any of my doors!
5.0	less expensive and each tab is individually wrapped.  Some say this is a problem but I like it because I can open the packs without getting the chlorine on my hands and I feel a bit safer with the kids around even though the top is child proofed.
5.0	I hesitated before buying; but I figured why not try it and if it didn't work out, I would send it back.  My 3 year old oven started to cook and bake food unevenly, so I did some research and it came out to be the element was going bad.  So I called the repair shop to get a quote on how much....they said $150.00 (labor/part/tax).  Thought that was a little too much for a 15 minute job, so I bought the part and tried to do it myself.....Also, found a video on how to install it on tube....piece of cake.  The item fit perfect and I saved $100.00.
5.0	I am a huge Marilyn fan and so this is in my bedroom wall under another decal of her face with red lips it looks great.
5.0	Great fan and great quality. Love the color choice options and warm light it gives because of the frosted glass bowl.
5.0	I love this lamp!  its lightweight but sturdy and provides perfect lighting in my study at night - not hard on the eyes, and everything works the way they said if would.
5.0	easy to wire and fast delivery
5.0	Everything was perfect
5.0	I received this lamp on time. I love that I can choose one light, two light, ot all three light. The prefect lamp for me.
5.0	Easy to set up.  Works well.  Solved my problem and eliminated my worry (about the downspout and rain gutter issue).
5.0	These lights work just as advertised. I have them on an outside tree and they sparkle away. They don't last all night, maybe because there hasn't been much sun here. Even on cloudy days they light up as soon as it gets dark.
5.0	Nice, metal.  They look great
5.0	The LST100 solved my problems with outdoor cfls controlled by an indoor timer switch.  The thing works great, wasn't hard for me to install, and has exactly the right feature set.  Swylite's delivery was prompt as well.  Now I wish Swylite would make a motion sensing switch that turns the lights on when someone comes in range so I can put cfls in my garage as well.  Don't know why the major chains in my area don't stock cfl capable devices since most of their standard bulb stock is now cfl.  Hope they catch on soon!
1.0	I had a plumber install this showerhead and when he went to hand-tighten the hose connection, the housing (made of plastic) cracked.  When water was turned on, it spewed everywhere.  this product is cheaply made and should not be used until Delta stops making fittings out of plastic.  Something that handles water pressure and is threaded SHOULD NOT BE MADE OF PLASTIC!!
5.0	I have cinderblock walls and these hooks had no trouble installing with the nails provided and my hammer. I feel my mirror is secure until I decide to move it.
5.0	I typically need to watch a how to video on how to hammer a nail but programming this remote was a piece of cake.  It connected to my door after only 1 try and could not have been easier.  Great price as well!  Again, easy, easy, easy!
5.0	am buying the 3rd filter for my shower head and my skin really feels good and i strongly recommend...This is a great filter
5.0	Looks great in my renovated bath area. I really like that different styles and colors of globes can be purchased to suit your taste.
5.0	I  heard about this from another  knitter in my  group. Its fairly light, doesn't move around & has decent lighting too.
5.0	Great fan.  I bought two of these to replace stock Broan fans.  Super pleased with both.  This one is even better cause it doesn't have the lighting problems of the other Panasonic models.  It is super quiet.  I had to put a timer in to have it shut itself off cause it is so quiet you can't hear it running and will let it run forever.  This is a high class problem.  I had a contractor install for me but it appeared easy but I didn't want to open up the dryway for the larger whole and left it to my drywall guy.<br /><br />If you are considering this fan and don't need a light do not hesitate.  Buy.
5.0	A heavy duty, expensive extension cord with a high wattage rating.  Ends light up so they're easy to see during a power outage once the generator is running.  Stores away easy.  Would buy one again if the need arises.
5.0	I've had this faucet for a month now and cannot find anything to complain about.  It is beautiful and functions very well.  I love it and am very happy with my purchase.  For the price, it's a very good value.
5.0	Works well.  Good price.  Easy installation of filters although no directions were included and I couldn't find the originals. iSpring has the manual easily accessible online and provided clear direction.  Overall this is a great product.
5.0	I hesitated in purchasing this because I didn't think it would actually fit in my old fixtures but it did. Not only did it fit but gives a nice warm bright light instant on and saves me over 250 watts in my kitchen. I replaced my old bulbs with these and lower my electrical bill considerably.
5.0	I have two of these products and have been highly recommending them to all my family and friends. I wish I would have discovered these products earlier in my life. I am a motorcycle rider and bicyclist and I have always had trouble with hemorrhoids and &#34;monkey butt&#34; This product has done wonders for me! I no longer suffer with rashes or hemorrhoids. These products should be in every American home, school and public restroom. I would also like to point out there is an advantage of savings by using less paper products and easier on both sewers and septic systems...would highly recommend!!
5.0	I bought this for my elderly mother and it works great for her getting in and out of the tub.  It's sturdy and grips tightly to the tub.  Would definately recommend this to anyone needing a little help getting out of the bathtub.
5.0	This duct tape is more expensive than many competitors, but well worth the price. Despite the thickness of the tape, it's relatively easy to tear, and tearing yields straight edges that don't fray. It will leave residue on some surfaces (drywall and most wood, at the very least), so plan accordingly. There are very few instances that I've encountered where this tape was not appropriate for the job (taping off for painting comes to mind; definitely use blue tape for that), and I always make sure I have a spare roll or two just in case.
5.0	Loved the knobs. Matched the bathroom decor perfectly.  Easy to install and the size of the knob was great for the cabinets.
5.0	It works great! Installation and programing was easy. Nice to have for added secuity for my wife and kids.
5.0	i received this dryer belt as promised  on time at a great price. The belt has been installed  and was well satisfied.
5.0	this ladder works great and was delivered on the day that it was suppose to
5.0	Absolutely brilliant and better than the listed photo if that's possible! This is exactly what I was after and they arrived well-packaged, on time and I still got them even though I am in New Zealand! Many thanks! Carol
5.0	We love the outdoor lamps.  I've had fabric shades before on outdoor lamps.  They did not hold up at all.  The shades look like rattan and I believe they will last a long time.  The bases are heavy which helps keep them upright in windy weather.
5.0	Just the right size for my double kitchen sink.  It holds items that I do not wish to be constantly under the flow of the water faucet.
5.0	this fits the Kenmore elite French door refrigerators! cheaper than at sears!
5.0	Awesome for the door that don't stay completely open.
5.0	Great replacement roller covers. Good price too!
5.0	great hair brush and a good place to hide some cash.
5.0	My daughter absolutely loves her chandelier. It's perfect! I will definitely be buying for our other girl!
5.0	I have not installed this yet, but love the looks, which mimic the large rectangular shower head I purchased.
5.0	Excellent quality, great for the environment....
5.0	Excellant service. Beautiful product. Nice to see good quality and service is still available today. Surpassed my expectations. Thank you.
1.0	Had one that lasted several years (and several battery changes) and it finally died.<br />Bought this as a replacement, didn't even last a month.
5.0	Fit much more easily into the light than the old bulky regular bulbs
5.0	Used mine for ceramic pendant lights, my husband had to adapt but they worked.  You have to use low voltage bulbs.
1.0	Not very sturdy.Weld came loose about the third time I sat on it.
1.0	Returned it and went to a big box for a lot less. Not always needed. Check your local code source.
5.0	I bought one of these to place in the bedroom where my gunsafe is as I figured if it ever got tripped I would have time to catch whoever was there before they could get in a 1000 lb safe. It works flawlessly so I bought another for in our large 40X60 garage which is about 200 feet from the house to call me at night if someone was attempting a break in. It's really easy to set up and a few times I forgot to disarm it it has called me and my wife's cell number. Very inexpensive and I love the silent trip so I can get a jump on anyone if needed. I'm thinking of getting another one for our shed if I decide to run an electric line to it with a phone line. So far the batteries are still going and it's been over 6 months. For what alarm companies wnat a month and what I have heard regarding their response time I'll trust my shotgun/AR-15, German Shepherd, and a good aim to do the job on my own and save some money in the process  : ).
5.0	When I received a review sample of this light I thought it was defective. The reason was it was so easy to assemble that I thought the instructions were unnecessary. I was wrong. I am not going to repeat the other two hundred reviews (at the time of mine), so here is what you need to know if you purchase one.<br /><br />First, as soon as you plug it in the light will come on and then shut down. Believe it or not, that is normal according to the instructions because the light initializes itself. My second issue was the charging indicator was not illuminating and I was ready to contact customer service to get an RMA number and swap it for a working unit. But, right there in the instructions is a note that informed me that the black model does not have an illuminated charging indicator. That out of the way, I took a deep breath and tried again and it came on.<br /><br />The light intensity is not much. It's a good reading light for someone younger than my sixty-six year old carcass, but for me it isn't strong enough. It is more than sufficient to light up a fairly large room for navigating or performing tasks or activities that do not require a strong light. At the dimmest setting it is a great mood or night light.<br /><br />Despite my auspicious start I am still giving this five stars because as long as you know the limitations it's still invaluable. How many other lamps do you own that you can grab the head and take it with you outside? That alone is the reason that I would replace it if something were to happen to it. Plus, it is truly economical to operate.<br /><br />One note: the USB port is good for running or charging USB speakers and headphones, but the not tablets and larger smartphones. It outputs a half Amp, which would take forever to charge my Note 3 phone. If you attempt to charge a high capacity device like that one the light will actually dim. Again, as long as you know that going in and can live with it, this is still a great lamp.
5.0	Works well with the address light.  Easy to program.
5.0	great color temperature and brightness for living room or bedroom
5.0	Works great! Only used for 1 week but so far so good! Easy to set up and install in frame of garage.
5.0	Works exactly as it should and this might be the only one you can find that ships in 2 days since it's on Amazon Prime.  The wiring colors are not normal for a DC circuit, and it does not ship with a wiring diagram.  If you think of it like an AC circuit it's quite easy to wire.  Black is hot, hook to +12VDC source.  Red is the switched leg, hook to your light's +12VDC.  White is a shared ground, so you need to hook all 3 of your grounds together (light, photocell, and battery).
5.0	On time, no problem, no nonsense.<br />Strongly recommend it.
5.0	Quick shipping, very easy instal. It was an easy fix for my attic. The irregular shapes from the roof trusses were easily made air tight with this product. My air conditioner reaches the desired temp and cycles on and off. Before it was difficult to get the house below 80 and the ac ran constantly.... Thanks Foam IT Green!
5.0	Finding a 3 1/2&#34; handle pull was proving very difficult.  I came upon this one....and it is perfect....well made....added just the right touch to my kitchen re-do.
5.0	very nice well made piece for my new granite counter top
5.0	I bought this to replace the one that came with my faucet set and had broken off under the sink.  This one looks very similar to the one it replaced and works great so far.  I hope the plastic bottle lasts longer than the one it replaced that broke off at the neck.
5.0	I already have somewhat of a Z-Wave system in the house through Verizon. My front porch light stopped working (and no, not just the bulb) a few months ago so I troubleshooted a few things. I figured since I had to replace the porch light, I might as well replace the switch inside. I didn't have to, but I figured it would be nice to have the light programmed to turn on at certain times...can't do that with a flip switch. Installation was easy, no problems whatsoever. I will say that it's a lot bigger than an actual switch so make sure you have room in your junction box. Now comes the tricky part for Z-Wave...wait, no tricky part, my system picked it up automatically. The blue indicator light is great to have to make sure it's on when it's supposed to be.
5.0	Worked exactly as expected.
5.0	I bought this after reading an article on a site called [...]. In that review the person who installed it said that it took around five minutes but for me it was closer to fifteen. Still, that's pretty good for something that saves this much water. It's working great, has a super easy to use button that looks clean and modern. Can't wait to get my water bill to see if there is any change. You can definitely see the difference in the tank level when you flush it using the small button on top. I would recommend this product to anyone.
5.0	It works great. I have it installing for about a month. Everyone loves it. Perfect gilf for my 75 old mom. My daughter also love it.
5.0	I, too, am a field tester. We received notification that Quirky is shutting down this project. I happen to really like it! Is anyone aware of any community talk regarding its (officially unsupported) future?
5.0	Great Product,  very prompt delivery,
1.0	Okay, I read the other reviews about the o-ring coming off (the stopper is metal with an o-ring on the outside to make the seal) but decided that wasn't a big deal. As predicted, the o-ring came loose rather quickly, but my husband is handy, and replacing it with a smaller o-ring easily solved that problem. The problem we haven't been able to solve as easily is that the vertical metal piece in the center has separated. Epoxy doesn't work because there is little surface area in common.
5.0	Product came as promised, great job
5.0	Good price, delivered quickly.
5.0	This thing is really amazing! Let me say a few things, if you like industrially made items, this is not for you. If you dislike hand made, authentic iteames this is not for you! But if you like REAL, handcrafted perfection, this is your knife.<br /><br />This iteam is beautiful, authentic, weapon, hand crafted in Nepal. A friend of mine is really into swords and knifes, he made fun of my purchase. As soon as I got it, I took it right to him for inspection. Did he find things he didn't like? Yes. Was he impressed? Very much so! He kept saying over and over, &#34;this was only $50 with shipping? What a great deal.&#34;<br /><br />I highly recommend this iteam! If you like warrior culture, if you want a great knife, if you have appreciation for centuries of tradition and craftsmanship, this is the best $50 you will spend.
5.0	Great lock. Set up is not difficult. I love the part that lets your previous keys work on the lock. In the set up, there is a red light that shows when it is locked. With that on, the batteries lasted only about 3 months. I changed the set up and turned off the light and the batteries have been working for over a year and are still working. It is great not to have to fumble with a key, or take keys to go on a walk. Again, it is a great lock.
5.0	these lights are so easy to install and look and work great! can use the same housing...
1.0	$4.69 at hardwaresource.com product number 286142<br /><br />this is a very onerous price, gouging really.
1.0	Didn't last 6 weeks early lst all my  chicks when the temp droped last night.  When they first came out they ra like a champ now they are just trash.
1.0	Arrived rolled up in a round shipping tube.  Was never able to get pieces to flatten out or stick.  I now understand why it was so cheap.
5.0	This crisper pan was an exact replacement part for the one I accidentally broke.  Just removed the old one and installed the new one. Perfect.
5.0	These worked perfectly in our older solar lights that use NiCads. No issues. Came partially charged, and the first bright day after installation our lights burned late into the darkness.
5.0	It was perfect I replaced it myself works well the timing alarm is even better that the original will go on until you stop it
5.0	Beautiful, and it was perfect for my room!
5.0	I  bought this light for my dining room  and was very satisfied.  It's very stylish, looks great, and  the installation was  easy.
5.0	Loved it...Great product at an amazing price
5.0	Exactly what I was looking for. I searched several stores around my city looking for these and no one is carrying them anymore. I was very happy to find them here.
5.0	yes, it was the correct part and worked great!
1.0	Motion detection was not working after 5 days. I have to use the on off switch.
5.0	A pretty addition to our home.  Took longer to assemble than manufacture's literature estimated.  Decorative, also well made and not flimsy.
5.0	I now no longer go to the store to purchase my glue for my business.  It is wonderful and very good stuff, as I am a manicurist it has save me both money and time.  Thank you KDS and Amazon.<br /><br />Carma, Orlando, FL
5.0	Nice high quality faucet.
1.0	Worked great for 6 months or so and now the bulb has turned into a high-speed strobe light over my front porch.  I've taken it out and put it back in a couple times and nothing stops the strobe effect now.
5.0	Simple and easy to replace on my dryer. Saved a ton of dough. Has been in use for approximately 7 months.
5.0	Good! Repeating order.
1.0	Lasted 1 year. I presume that the inner hose ruptured as it now leaks like a sieve.
5.0	Is the second one and I am very satisfied the first one is gone my friend came in visit and please me to give to him and now is happy like me......😃
5.0	My dryer drys like new :)
5.0	I bought this for vacation to have in the car chained under the seat so it's hidden and stuck. Won't hold a lot (wallet, keys, few papers, ext. No guns unless it's very compact) and it works great. Happy I bought it!
5.0	My friend recommended I get this for someone who always falls asleep with tv on. He doesn't understand that flat screens will eventually burn out. I'll come home from work late and he'll be sleeping with TV on. So instead of me going in his room and possibly waking him up to turn everything off. It's just a simple push of a button. It's been a good teaching aid for a little kid. He's gotten better about turning it off. Great product for just about anything. Plus it works all the way from my bedroom which is on one end of the house and his bedroom is at the other end of the house. Have had no problems with the product not working.
5.0	My son said this type of book light was better because of this narrower focus,it did not disturb his wife's sleep.
5.0	Came rapidly with no problem
5.0	I cut my hair into the sink and it immediately clogged up.<br /><br />I took about the equivalent of a tablespoon of this and poured in onto the hair that was evidently in the drain and, as advertised, it worked in 60 seconds.<br /><br />This was not like Drano, where you come back after a couple of hours and the clog is broken. This worked within one minute.<br /><br />I'd estimate that this can be used for about 25 clogs. At that rate, it's less than 50cents per clog.<br /><br />Verdict: Worth the price.
1.0	We ordered a bundle and when the package arrived it contained 1 dowel rod! We sent it back for a full refund!
5.0	I soaked it as required but didn't work.
5.0	So easy to set your own number. Love the color. I am a 12 year survivour...To any who is going through their treatments my thoughts and prayers are with you. There can be so much hope, I was stage III. Still going strong!! Find a cure so my girls never have to go thru it
5.0	Looks beautiful in my new remodel bathroom
5.0	This cream got rid of my mother's and my own sandpaper hands in only TWO DAYS!!!! Now we only have to apply it every few days or so to keep that dry roughness away. If you have cracks and splits on your finger tips, you'll have to apply it to those areas several times a day and before bed until they heal. So for us, we apply to our entire hands every few days and several times a day and before bed only to the split/cracked areas. And you only need to apply it sparingly. The jar lasts and lasts. This is the BEST cream we've ever used!!!!
5.0	As advertised and functions just like I would have expected.  Allowed me to add an extra circuit without adding another sub panel....
5.0	Perfectly fine for our applications
5.0	Great function and i use all the time. People always ask me where I got this tape from. However it's a bit expensive to sue on everything
5.0	What a deal and the reason for my high marks is that none have burned out yet which seems to be the case with so many of these halogens in general especially when switched on daily.  They burn hot so look out and don't forget to not contact them directly while installing as the oils from your skin will cause premature failure.  Always use the foam pad or a tissue while inserting them to keep them ultraclean.
1.0	Do not buy this product if you intend to leave writing on the board for more than a day. It is ridiculously hard to wipe off, and it gets more impossible as each day goes by. Even with hard scrubbing and dry erase board cleaner, I have words from a week ago that I can't erase completely and there's also a shadow residue from the pen color (I am using the correct pens!). This white board is going in the trash bin.
1.0	This is a high price to pay for an item that doesn't really work that well.  If I had spent a couple of bucks on plastic &#34;feet&#34; (the kind you put under furniture to protect hardwoods), I would have gotten the same effect.  Save your money.
5.0	Well constructed and easy to install the new LED replacement bulbs. Metal construction waterproof simple installation. Great value for the money.
5.0	I have two carbon monoxide detectors on each floor. For a small investment I feel the added protection for my family is well worth the money. This was a much better price than what was offered by the big box stores for the same product.
5.0	Fits great for specified appliance.
5.0	Ordered Maxell CR2025 on Amazon from National Deals.  Came fresh Dated 06-2016. DVD Remote Control and Electrc Heater's Remote Control have new Life!  Excellent Batteries!
5.0	We have had this mailbox for a year now and it looks as good as the day we put it in. It is secure and we love having a locking mail box. My husband did the install and it was not a hard DIY job.
5.0	Did exactly what it was supposed to do.  A perfect fit with prompt delivery.  This is used is an underwater treadmill for dogs, it keeps things like patient socks or booties from being sucked into the drain.
5.0	The hardware is sturdy and nicely put together, it has a nice finish with some kind of clear, glossy coat that will hopefully protect it from moisture exposure since it is in the bathroom. We got the Moen 'Lounge' collection for a small guest bathroom and it looks great, definitely a step up from the usual big-box hardware store middle-range stuff.
5.0	just what i need.  its for my greenhouse,  ffa project.  my parents encourage me so much. i want to do landscaping but really hoping for forrestry..considering the cost efficientcy i would recommend this to my freinds who wish for a simple roof fast and little framing. its almost here.
5.0	works very well easy to install
5.0	Very good quality and easy to install. Just what we wanted for our bathroom. It has a very high quality finish.
5.0	works great in the kitchen
5.0	Solid construction.  Read some reviews where people had leaks - you have to insert the included rubber washer and screw down tightly until the shower head contacts the washer; if you can't screw on that far, use some teflon plumber's tape.  I used it with my Speakman wand and had no leaks at all; I love Speakman, but this was one of their cheaper models with a plastic base - still no issues using it with this hose; hand tightened - have been using it for weeks to wash the dogs.
5.0	These I got for my work boots, snow boots for the kids, and snow gloves.  Everyone uses it to my surprise, is good and heavy and looks better than the picture too.
5.0	My wife uses this stuff to keep our washing machine running like new.
5.0	I looked all over for bulbs for my Allure Exhaust Fan. These bulbs matched perfectly. Thanks!
5.0	FOR THOSE OF US WHO ARE NEW TO THE WOOD WORKING FIELD, I FOUND THIS BOOK TO BE VERY HELPFUL.  IT ANSWERED MANY QUESTIONS THAT I WOULD NEVER EVEN HAVE THOUGHT TO ASK. (I.E. HOW MANY TOOLS CAN BE HOOKED UP AT ONE TIME, AND THE PROPER LENTH OF HOSE TO USE.)  IT HELPED ME IMMENSELY IN SETING UP MY SHOP.  THANKS TOOL CRIB!
5.0	I am so happy that I received this part very quickly and it solved the overflowing problem with my washer, so glad I didn't have to go out and spend $369 on a new one.
5.0	Works great and very happy it plugs in, as the last one we had only took batteries and they never lasted! Received it quickly!
5.0	bigger than expected but actuallly worked out great!  VERY nice having water and fire proof features
5.0	without a problem from either of them  I had a bulb burn out in the 2 years (but I use mine almost non stop) and he is still using the original bulb it came with.  I am at the age where it's getting harder to see print, and differentiate between navy and black and this lamp has been more than a big help to me!  I seriously would be lost without it!
5.0	These stools are really nice, very well made, solid and sturdy.  Very impressed.  Arrived very quickly and in perfect condition.
5.0	This is the perfect ceiling light to finish off a Tinkerbell room. It tends to look and work better with the white coated light bulbs. It helps see the Tinkerbell suspended on the light. I wish the room were big enough for two of them. My Granddaughter just loves this light. The price on Amazon was real good and the delivery was real fast. Easy to install!!
5.0	I really love this shower head. It is very sturdy, has a sleek, modern design, and provides fabulous water pressure.
5.0	I have these light and will post a video about them. They are excellent lights, but you have to tweak them as they are designed to fail after a while. Essentially these lights have a small electrical board inside that is placed almost touching  a lightly painted metal surface;  As you plug and unplug the dmx cables or flip the dip switches regularly, the soldered tips of the board wear out the paint on the metal surface eventually causing the electrical board to short circuit. To prevent this from happening you need to apply a layer of electrical tape to the metal plate and trim the soldered tips. This will guarantee that your light last a long time.  To get to the relevant electrical board, you need to open the lights. Unscrew the dmxin and dmxout ports, and then apply electrical tape to the face of the  painted metal surface that is a few milometers away from the bottom of the electrical board. After that you need to trim the solder tips on the bottom of the electrical board  with a small wire cutter; a large nail clipper will do, but it will likely be left dull. Make sure you leave no clipped soldering bits on the board, or inside the light housing, or it will likely short circuit the unit when you turn it on.  Again, wonderful lights, but they will  fail soon unless you take the steps discussed above. One of my lights failed after 5 days of use; that caused me to go through the engineering  and execution aspects of the lights with a fine tooth comb; then I discovered the flaw. So yes, this lights have a high failure rate without the electrical tape tweak.  March 2015:  I bought some more of these lights and to my surprise, the new lights didn't have the issue with the PCB and the metal plate.  So there was not need to weak them. So I changed the title of my review.
5.0	Very good product, NO issues!!! Love it
5.0	Just got my newly delivered  lamp plugged in on a gray dreary day and it makes the room seem super warm and cozy.  Product sent very fast.  These are going to make great gifts.  And unlike some mine has a dimmer.
5.0	this Ladder is exactly what I wanted and needed for our new house. I have seen the commercial and love this ladder.
5.0	I have most of the lights from this series and I love 'em!  They look great, have photosensors...and what else could you ask for in a light?
5.0	good one easy assembly very light<br />only thing i dont like is i purchased as 38.95 and after few months the price drop to 29.95 sad<br />anyways this one is good for living room.
5.0	Fast delivery! As advertized.
5.0	extremely happy with sensors,they were exactly like originals and came with installation hardware that made it very easy to replace also couldn't believe the quick shipping would highly recommend product to anyone who needs replace sensors they were very easy to replace.
5.0	Seller was easy to work with.  They made the extra effort to give me what I wanted.  Also happy with product.
5.0	Does what it is meant to be used for, easy to cut. Will be using more of this in the future.
5.0	Trying to teach my son to hit the mark!
5.0	The actual base is fairly lightweight, but considering similar lamps cost two or three times as much I think this is a great buy! It looks great in my hallway. The finish is even and the globe lets a good amount of light through. All in all a great purchase.
5.0	Works great, keep it in the trunk, for what ever whenever needed.
5.0	Bought this to fix a neighbors washer it was the exact part neede and did the trick
5.0	Next to having installed a brand new A/C Furnace this year - this has been the 'best home improvement product' for the money. I replaced three 'contractor grade' swirling toilets on a house built in 1985. The original toilets were so bad they could not clear &#34;their own shadow&#34; using 3.5 gallons per flush. (Or 7, or 10.5 gallons) Clogs/ overflows were routine. After verifying plumbing pipes/ venting was not the issue I installed the new units - Toto's Drake (CST744SL).<br />I found a video from an independent plumbing supplier testing this model. They showed 24 golf balls being cleared on a single 1.6 gallon flush - it is unbelievable but true. The technology has come a long way. They are quiet. Not as quiet as the old style but the re-fill cycle is so much shorter. They arrived in perfect condition packaged using only cardboard and paper - easily recycled. I selected Toto because they have the lowest product reject rate.  I would recommend this brand over any competitor - seriously a great product. But best of all, no more bleeping clogs/ overflows.
5.0	Nice and heavy duty, they have been on my kennels for about 6 months or so.  Seem to be holding up great, we've had lots of rain storms and so far, so good!
5.0	I'm using this for our porch & driveway LED accent wall sconce lights.<br />It's nice not having to go in the house just to turn on the lights when they are needed.
1.0	Not universal. Tried on three older toilets each with different equipment and this did not fit any.
5.0	Very Heavy Duty, I have moved everything from crates, boxes, and Large Rocks and slate.  Well balance over grass and roots.  More expense then HomeDepot's 800 Pound, but better quality, and fenders help a lot for not hitting the tires with your loads.
5.0	Nice but the logo is very small. These are NOT plastic they are metal so they are good quality.
5.0	"I saw in Loews a showerhead similar to this one with two showerheads in one. I had never saw that before and thought it was such a great idea. I didn't end up buying it that day only because I knew I'd find one cheaper on amazon. I found this one which seemed like a descent brand, had great reviews, I liked the design, it was a chrome finish and the price was right, so I bought it. And I am soooooo happy that I did!! I just love it and can't say enough good things about it. First and foremost, I love the way it looks and the design of it. It is so different (unique) looking. I also bought a three way arm diverter and connected a handheld showerhead to it as well, so I have 3 in total, which is how I originally saw it displayed at Loews.<br /><br />It's really well made and is VERY heavy. It's such a great quality item, it really is. The different streams that flow from the jets are so nice and soothing and it almost feels like you're in the rainforest or something with the way it sprays and sounds. It's very soothing and relaxing. Morseo than any other showerhead I've ever owned. With the arm diverter, if I don't feel like using the twin heads, I push the button and it switches to just the handheld shower. It's awesome!!<br /><br />The only complaint I have received and it could be just my shower arm hanging abnormally low or something, I'm not sure, is since this showerhead is bulky and pretty big, it hangs lower than your normal showerhead. So someone who is tall can't stand directly underneath it. You can adjust the showerheads and point them upward, but you still couldn't stand directly under the shower to get wet. It would be more like the water would shoot upward and then down onto you if that makes any sense. It works fine for me, but I am not that tall. My son on the other hand is tall and doesn't use it because he likes to stand directly under the shower. He uses the handheld showerhead because that hangs much higher.<br /><br />So if you are tall and like to stand directly under the showerhead when the water hits you, rather than it just spraying you while you stand in front of the showerhead, then I definately recommend getting the shower arm diverter (Speakman VS-111 Shower Arm Diverter) with this and connect a handheld showerhead (Speakman VS-1120 combination fixed and handheld shower systems / Speakman VS-123 30\\"" Slide Bar) as an option as well. But like I said, it could be just that my shower arm hangs low. It looks like a normal height to me, but who knows. All I know is I love mine and I highly recommend it!!r the showerhead when the water hits you, rather than it just spraying you while you stand in front of the showerhead, then I definately recommend getting the shower arm diverter (Speakman VS-111 Shower Arm Diverter) with this and connect a handheld showerhead (Speakman VS-1120 combination fixed and handheld shower systems / Speakman VS-123 30\\"" Slide Bar) as an option as well. But like I said, it could be just that my shower arm hangs low. It looks like a normal height to me, but who knows. All I know is I love mine and I highly recommend it!!"
5.0	very well made and they work GREAT!!  I ordered a second set.  The first set will be used for under the cabinet lighting in our new Kitchen
5.0	These handles were exactly what I was looking for at a third of the price I could find anywhere else. Great value and very prompt shipping (standard shipping, by the way). Would recommend to anyone looking for this style of handle.
5.0	Easy to use and clean up I used them to make gummy legos
5.0	Easily set up, the timer was ready to go and working in less than 5 minutes.  Setting the timer was extremely simple and it has worked perfectly since the day it was installed on our outdoor lighting displays.
5.0	Just had our bathrooms remodeled & one of them has bronze fixtures. This toilet seat is perfect! Brought the bathroom up to another level of class. We have received sooo many compliments. The soft close resolved the seat slamming problem we used to experience with our guest (drove my husband crazy). It was very easy to install (my husband never complained).  This is a very quality seat with very good craftsmanship. It was a little pricey but after all the remodeling didn't want to put anything cheap in there and this turned out to be well worth the price.
5.0	I keep buying these because they are beefy and stylish, but also well-priced.  As with most such items, I use my own drywall anchors and screws.  I think we have about ten of these around the house now, and will probably add more soon!
5.0	We had a hard time finding this in our local stores.  We are using 5 of them to regulate baseboards in the house and garage.  They are easy to install and set.  They keep the temperature right at the set temperature.
5.0	OttLite's are simple the best available for true lighting. I use them all the time with my art work, not only to see what I am working on but for matching colors for projects.
1.0	I have purchased other products like this with the exact same specifications (LED, 10 watt, 12volt, 3000k color temp) and if set next to this product would appear to be from the same manufacturer. The light output is approximately 140 lumens (when measured using our Labsphere's Light Measurement Integrating Sphere). Other products of similar price and advertised specifications test out at  &#62;600 lumens using the same equipment. To put this all in perspective the typical household 60 watt light bulb produces around &#62;600 lumens. The typical LED fixture of this type operating at 10 watts should produce light equivalent to a &#62;50 watt halogen light source. 140 lumens is approximately the amount of light produced by a 10 watt incandescent or halogen bulb. My hope is the the vender will replay saying this is simply a defect and handle a quick exchange of the product. Defects happen
5.0	I have a Miele dishwasher that has a built in water-softening system and utilizes a salt reservoir to reactivate the water softener.<br /><br />I operated it for years and years without any salt thinking that my water was soft already and didn't need softening.  Eventually (like after 7 years) I had an issue with the dishwasher building up deposits on the interior and the dishes didn't seem as clean as they once were.<br /><br />I ran this descaler through the dishwasher, added some miele salt to the reservoir, adjusted the dishwasher to the actual water hardness in my area (see your manual) and it's like night and day.  The interior of the dishwasher sparkles like brand new.  I couldn't be more happy with this product.
5.0	My son Loves this shower head it works great!!
5.0	I've had problems with cracked dry hands for as long as I can remember, especially during the winter months.  After only several days of use I could see and feel a noticeable difference.  My fingers would crack and bleed around the cuticles and it was sometimes painful.  My hands are softener and look younger.  My nails even look better.  I like this so much, I just ordered the foot cream and ordered more hand cream for myself and a couple of family members that have the same problems.
5.0	We moved into a new house and the shower head needed to be replaced badly.  We are on well.  This shower head is made of solid material.  The water pressure is good.  It has a lot of different choices.  The hose hang down straight nicely.  We have used it for 7 months now and I love it.
5.0	I replaced another brand with this one.  It took about 45minutes and it was done. Easy swap out and much quieter!
5.0	After seeing the reviews about plastic taste from the fridge water dispenser and icemaker, I decided on this ten foot Watts water line and kept my fingers crossed. I attached it finger tight plus one quarter turn extra to be sure I didn't overstress the connectors (another concern a reviewer posted). Before drinking the water, I flushed the lines by drawing out about five gallons from the dispenser. I also discarded the first batch of ice. I'm pleased to report that the water ad ice taste terrific with no plastic smell or taste. I like and trust the braided steel hose wrapping, since many plastic lines that work well at first start leaking in about thirteen years...causing slow hidden damage. Ten feet is long, but I want easy access to the rear of the pulled-out fridge for cleaning condenser coils. The bulky coil is no problem because the loop is actually hanging under the supply hole in the floor...the shutoff valve is in the basement underthe kitchen sink.
5.0	I ordered this screen after viewing the installation guide online.  I was able to install it by myself, exactly as the video demonstrated.  I didn't even have to adjust the doors!  I'm impressed with the inside screen to prevent sparks...our old screen had become totally inoperable from old age as it had twisted and jammed from use.  The design compliments the Arts and Crafts furniture in the room and I've received several compliments on how clean and attractive the fireplace is now.  Being the middle of summer, we haven't used the fireplace yet but are looking forward to using it come winter.
5.0	I used this with some strip LED's to make some excellent under cabinet lighting in my kitchen. transformer is approximately 1 in x 1 in x 5 in. provides a lot of light with only a little work and so much cheaper than LED cabinet lights from a home store. definitely worth it.
5.0	Excellent alternative to the old outdated little peep hole that was standard for generations. Welcome to the 21st century. View outside your door in color and with 3.5 inch digital screen. Takes photos, easy to operate, and easy to install. Highly recommended. Only con is that I wish it had motion detection so that it can take photos as soon as someone approaches front door.
5.0	We had jack screw which was loud as all can be and replaced with SUPER QUIET belt openers.  It was easy (a bit time consuming) install but nothing impossible.
5.0	I agonized over how many stars to give this product. In the end, it gets the highest rating from me because it totally exceeded my expectations.<br /><br />This is a cheap fan. For twenty bucks, I was expecting it to be hamster-powered, but it actually has an electric motor and plugs into an AC outlet and everything. I was expecting a kluge, but assembly was a breeze with parts fitting together surprisingly well.<br /><br />Yes, it's cheaply made, but it's just sturdy enough to get the job done and avoid being a hazard. Dare I say it -- plastic is not always a bad thing, and this thing is quite possibly brilliantly engineered if the assignment was, in large part, to keep down cost. The fact that the assembled fan is so light is actually a bonus -- it makes it very easy to move around as needed.<br /><br />I think the thing is plenty steady on its feet. Could it be toppled by badly behaved children? I suppose. But badly behaved children don't deserve fans.<br /><br />It moves a good amount of air. I don't use anything but the lowest setting 95 percent of the time... ergo, it's quiet.<br /><br />Do I wish the thing extended a tad taller? Yes. Do I wish the head angle adjustments worked a tad smoother? Yes. Do I wish the thing came with a lifetime warranty? Yes.<br /><br />But here's the thing: I really can't seriously fault this fan. It goes about its job competently without (sorry) fanfare. Here, I have to boil things down to one set of stars that expresses my overall satisfaction... so it gets five.
5.0	Hard to find copper switch plate matched the copper ones in the rest of my house.
5.0	I found to equipment easy to set-up. The customer service and help has been great! However, I did have trouble synchronizing the system and had to call SimpliSafe to clear an error signal. The computer instructions were hard for me to follow.
5.0	Roosters are beautiful - decorated to reflect the details in the workmanship to the fullest.  Each rooster is individually hand painted giving each rooster a bit of uniqueness all to itself.  Anyone who is a &#34;Rooster Connisoure&#34; will want at least one of these for their collection.  The item description does not do it justice calling it a &#34;brown rooster&#34;...  This is the cutest, colorful Rooster Ceiling Fan Chain Pull and fully functional.
5.0	Excellent. Item delivered early and as described. Thanks
5.0	Dear Lauren, I've performed work on very small things for most of my working life.  Camera repair, electronics, and from the time I was 6 years old, I have built small balsa and tissue, rubber powered airplanes.  Now, at 70 years old, I am back to my lifelong hobby.  Now they are electric powered, with much smaller parts and a much greater need  for micro level work.  Lighting has always been a problem for me.  When I saw your LightView PRO Super- Bright 56 listed on the internet, I thought my dream had come true after all the years.  I ordered it, now have it in my possession, and I have to say, &#34;This product is unbelievable.&#34;  I have never had it so good.  Very high quality, not another ugly thing hanging on my work, but very stylish, can be folded in different ways when not in use.  I just worry that my wife will decide to make it part of the living area of our house because it looks so good.  And to top everything off, I get an email from a company co-owner.  It's great, you're great and now I able to work better, faster and happier with my final products.  THANK YOU<br /><br />Johnny Stout
5.0	This was exactly what I was looking for and it shipped quickly.
5.0	I installed three of these with three new toilets.  They've done the job and it wasn't a mess, like wax.  After several months in action, they're holding up just fine.  I'd definitely use these again.
5.0	Very simple, but classy! Does NOT come with the wiring, or bulb. Great price though, I then just went to the hardware store and got a black electrical wire!, looks super!
5.0	Every winter, my knuckles crack and bleed, and my bf would complain that when he touched my hands, he felt like he might be touching an alligator.  I live in Maryland, and it gets very cold and dry here.  I used to LOATHE using creams on my hands since they would burn.  This cream is amazing because not only does it not burn one single bit, it is creamy, soothing, it comes at a very reasonable price, and the company (O'Keefe's) does not test on animals (as far as I could tell through my cursory research).  I love these so much that I buy all of my girlfriends the hand and matching foot cream for their birthdays.  It is long-lasting, and you only need a small amount.  I like the hand cream a little better than the foot cream, so I just use the hand cream for both.  My skin is super soft!!
5.0	I like this combo USB outlet and am going to buy some more for other places in the house. The convenience factor is high and the 4A current available is good enough to charge two iPads at the same time (though they seem to charge more slowly than one at a time, or one iPad and one iPhone at the same time).<br /><br />I couldn't find any technical specifications on the energy consumption when idle and I don't like the idea of wasting energy on &#34;wall warts&#34;. But in the absence of a published spec or measurement equipment (that I don't have), I am assuming that this outlet consumes possibly a lot less than 1W with no USB devices plugged in, based on specifications I could find on other similar outlets. That's okay with me. Its not zero, but close enough.<br /><br />I had no problem installing this to replace one side of a double-gang &#34;remodel&#34; outlet box that had plenty of wiring behind it, but your mileage may vary.<br /><br />I will be putting a few more of these around the house in due course.
5.0	Super cute on my Paris themed wall.
5.0	Great for multi-leveled homes. Easy to adjust volume and choose a ring. VERY easy installation. Great purchase.
5.0	Better than expected.  Good brightness and color.  Also dimmable and enclosed in silicone rubber with no glass to break.  Excellent value.
5.0	I love the look of this light. Just be carefull to install the glass shade screws snugly, they are small and in a tight spot and you must wiggle them and keep turnig untill they bind on the glass shade. Double and triple check the screw tightness. I currently have the 2 light and the 4 light fixtures installed in our bathrooms. I found that the 50 watt halogen bulbs to be very bright and producing much heat. I replaced the bulbs with 30 watts and still plenty of light and they run cooler but still hot. I also would love to replace the bulbs with a LED replacement. Kichler, listen to your customer base, halogen is dead and LED bulbs rule. I think you may lose business because of the bulbs
5.0	It's a water filter, all it does is filter water.  It does not even change itself, I had to install it myself.
5.0	This is the best I have ever ordered on line.And I will be doing alot more bussiness with Amazon in the near future.Sandy from Kansas
5.0	great filters at a great price, we are well pleased with their quality and pricing.  Nordic pure is a great brand
5.0	This is a gorgeous faucet. It looks beautiful and the handles have very smooth movement. No squeaks, no leaks.
1.0	Not a fan of this product, the light sensor is on the side which results in the light being on throughout the day. I was unable to find a place in my house where it would go on and off.
5.0	Pretty and a fun challenge to put together.  Be sure to reserve some time for this adventure before you begin.  The end result is worth the effort.
5.0	I love this lamp. It goes with my living room just like I expected to be, I love the color. I love it, I love it. Thank you so much.
5.0	This is a really nice little box for hiding keys.<br /><br />The magnet is very strong and the foam keeps rattles from occurring.<br /><br />Recommended !!
5.0	I applied window film about 1 month ago to a door sidelights and so far, its worked great. I cleaned the window with regular windex followed by a one sided razor and then again with windex. I used a 12 inch wide film for 2 sidelights. You really need to measure accurately and cut accurately as its easy to get jagged edges. I also think this film stretches a bit once applied. I followed directions and sprayed water on window with some dish detergent in it.  It worked like a charm.  If you know you will have extra film, cut some of that off first and experiment. Overall, I did not expect this to work as well as it did and I do recommend it. Again, although purchased months ago, I only applied this to the window a month ago and its holding up perfectly.
5.0	Interlocking edge pieces just topped off the superb looking tiles!
5.0	Bought this for my niece as a Christmas gift, and she loved it.  When You get it the colors are much more vivid than in the pictures. I would recommend them to other people that I know.
5.0	We have purchased several chandeliers for our new home (including ones costing thousands of dollars from such sources as Restoration Hardware).  But we really liked the looks of this one and could hardly believe the reasonable price.  So we took a chance.  It paid off big time!  These are beautifully made and appear to be of supreme quality as well.  We could not be more delighted, and nobody needs to know they did not cost $2K to $4K each!  Wonderfully happy and highly recommended.
5.0	Most brands of shower head feature the same plastic construction as this one. Only time will tell, but my hunch is this one will last as long as our fancy $300 handle w/custom wall fixture that recently had a part snap off inside the spray wand. Installation is easy and straightforward, without even looking at the instructions. This spray wand incorporates a flow restrictor which limits flow to 2.5 gallons per minute, but it's easily defeated to provide a much stronger and fuller spray. Before attaching the hose to the wand, look in the end of the wand, and you'll see the green restrictor, which has a small O ring in the center. Simply remove the small, black rubber O ring, then attach the hose. End of story. Unless you want to spend a whole lot more for something made of metal with a satin finish, I don't think you can find a better deal than this Delta shower head.
5.0	just perfect for my dryer---Thanks
5.0	Cutest night light ever!  Every person who has seen it comments on how cute it is.
5.0	These are perfect for my Scentsy. They create a lot of heat, that's pretty much all that can be said about these bulbs. They do what they are supposed to do.
5.0	Product works extremely well for all applications that I have used it on.  The best I have ever used over the past 30 years.
5.0	These lights are beautiful.  I wove them through a pergola and it looks magical at night.  Be sure to buy one set that includes the AC plug and transformer as these are strings of lights only with no way to plug in.
1.0	The off/on switch broke. Good thing I knew how to replace it.
1.0	Not good product less only for three months.
1.0	I ordered this light to replace one like it that lasted about 1 to 2 years : This one last 33 days & the return policy was 30 DAYS ! Poor quality , useless warranty, do not buy this product if you expect it to last.
5.0	The water tastes good unlike other filters I have purchased in the past. It is easy to install and I will purchase this one again.
5.0	Worked great with DriTac. If you have large spots to repair with DriTac, look for a larger volume syringe. The needles are ok but 12mL is quite small.
5.0	Perfect in every way! Absolutely a steal for the price. Makes a beautiful center piece in any bathroom.
5.0	I loved this so much that I just bought another one!!! Crystals and quality are very nice. Sturdy and solid especially for the reasonable price. People always ask me where I bought it. I mixed it in with my gray, contemporary leather couch to accent my living room with softness instead of too sterile looking. It looks amazing!!!
5.0	Thanks for the product
5.0	love this!  works just like I wanted it to....the door now stays open instead of slowly closing on me...great product!  I recommend it highly!  If you need a door to stay open when you want it to...this is your product!
5.0	Bought this to replace an old and aging Hunter thermostat.  Having used Honeywell thermostats in the past and feeling positive about them, I went with this based on reviews and the price.  I made the right call picking this because so far it has proven to be a excellent programmable thermostat.<br /><br />Installation was a breeze and programming it was so easy.  In fact I inserted the batteries and programmed it prior to installing the base unit so once that was done, all I had to do was snap on the front end and voila...I was in business.  It is very accurate in terms of temperature control and comes on like it should when it should based on program.<br /><br />For people who complain about the smart response/recovery aspect of this thermostat......... it is really easy to override that or rather disable it.  All you have to do is read the instruction manual and change the settings by toggling the up/down button and it is disabled.  I disabled that feature since I am on a time use electric plan and I do not need the thermostat to kick in the air or heat during peak energy use hours.  It took me a minute to read how to do it and another minute to actually program it in the settings.  But I suppose if you are not the kind who read instructions or how to operate a device, everything can be a daunting uphill task for you.  Trust me, it is easy peasy Japanese !  All you have to do is read the instructions on how to do it.<br /><br />Overall very satisfied with this thermostat and I've had it for over a month now.  I also highly recommend it based on price  to performance value
5.0	It works great, only takes a little bit to do the job. Makes your hands and feet feel smooth, takes all the roughness out of your skin. I recommend it to anyone who has dry or chapped skin.
1.0	I purchased a skybox for my husband's birthday including the stand.  It worked for a short period of time and now it will not dispense or cool.  I spoke to a friend of ours that purchased 3 of them and two out of the three are not working.  We were told by a repair tech that it cost more to repair than it is worth.  I later found out that Home Depot sold the last of theirs for $99 to get rid of them.  And Sears will no longer carry them as well.  I am very disgusted with the product.
5.0	"This is a miracle product.  Never before has there ever been a more white, lustrous piece of wire management product.  The quality of manufacture was miles above what deep sea sponges could ever hope to achieve.  The split was seamless and the loom was extraordinarily loomy.  I was a little disappointed in the overall length; advertised to be 5' and it was only 4' 11 31/32.\\""  Oh, wait!  It's stretchy, too! My bad.  It has gave my life purpose.  For five minutes."
5.0	might even make more power then the computer usb plug<br />i'm using it to power the hp mini speakers<br />perfect
5.0	Purchased this to hang over the barn cat's bed and water bowl during the winter months in Michigan. Keeps him warm and his water doesn't freeze.  Not really using the thermostat.  Have it set to run full heat in a non-heated pole barn.  Well constructed and does what it's intended to do.
5.0	We're using this outside in full sun to protect a pontoon boat. After 3 months, it's still pliable, intact, sturdy.
5.0	Perfect. Love my decal and will return for more when needed
5.0	Very reliable supplier with very competitive pricing.  Provides a warm, bright light for any pool or spa and last a long time.
5.0	Bought this as a gift. I'm a little nervous about people saying that if it gets too hot the salt will be everywhere, but it looks decent enough.
5.0	I love this product. I read a lot of reviews when looking for a water softener and I landed on this one...for good reason. It works. My skin is so much softer and smoother than it has EVER been in my life. If you have problem skin, TRY THIS!
5.0	This looks great in the boys playroom. When we want a change we can just peel it off it is so easy.
5.0	Works. Works. Works. Price is right. Delivery is pronto. if you're watching the life cycle of your filter, you order well in advance.
5.0	It was a perfect replacement and hopefully it will last longer than the original bottle. You can't beat the price.
5.0	Arrived in short order. Easy to install and solid build quality. Switch preforms perfectly.
5.0	We were skeptical when we bough them but they work well and we are completely satisfied!<br />But to clarify things a bit, they wont stop your washing machine from shaking.... what they do is to stop the vibration from being transmitted to the floor of your house.<br />So the machine shakes, but the house doesn't (as long as the body of the machine doesnt touch a wall).<br /><br />Worth every dime! We wish we bought them 5 years ago when we got the washing machine.
5.0	These lights are beautiful.  They provide a full 6-8 hours of light and recharge with about 6 hours of sunight.  Also they fit the 4x4 posts perfectly.
5.0	We were very satisfied with this product. It was easy to install and it makes better ice than the original.
5.0	Used Frost King for many years, but this product was far easier to handle and after installation was free and clear of any defects.
5.0	Great product, and great to have at the house for when the fuses blow.
5.0	Everyone comments on this light fixture. I bought a 1940s home that had some pretty awful brass fixtures. This was a great improvement. It does not have a switch on the fixture itself (which I failed to notice) so it is meant to work with a fixture connected directly to a wall switch. The place in which I was putting this fixture requires a switch to be on the fixture itself. Easy enough fix! Went to the hardware store, bought a push button switch for less than $10, very easily wired it to the fixture and voila! It delivered several weeks before it was scheduled to. You must put an oversize edison or vintage inspired light bulb in there.
5.0	This is an excellent box and the seller is excellent.  I winded up returning it because I made an error on the size of the box that I needed (I needed a smaller one) but the seller was wonderful and refunded me.
5.0	My bed use to slide throughout my room during the night, and now it is finally stuck. These work great and dont mess up your hardwood floors.
1.0	lasted for about 3 months instead of stated 50,000 hours service life
5.0	Modular homes are sometimes a little unpredictable when it comes to its inner workings - manufacturer quality varies. This item was installed in an older modular home and was plug-and-play exactly as advertised. I do recommend it to other prospective buyers.
5.0	Keeps my wife's hands from cracking in the winter dry air.
5.0	This onyx pencil bullnose is perfect......exactly what we wanted for our bathroom, we will be ordering more
1.0	These light bulbs are expensive. I expected much better performance. They do not dim properly.  I ordered four for our floodlights and they only really work when on high. If you try to dim, lower them, they flicker. Even when you dim to lowest setting, the lights only dim so much. Still too bright. Not happy with these at all. I would not recommend nor would I purchase again.
5.0	I have used 4 of these batteries and they seem fine. I<br />When I looked at my local hardware store (in a small town) I could buy a pack of 2 for this price. I'm happy and for now will award 5 stars.  If some batteries underperform, I'll update. I use these for my dog's collar lights.
5.0	I like it works great specially for the protector that brings this tool
1.0	What a waste even though it was fairly cheap it's not worth a dollar it was a pain to get it up and it's like two feet in length! And so cheap! It fell apart two seconds after finally getting it put together I wasn't expecting a whole lot from this product but this one just sucks!
5.0	These things let out an &#34;industrial&#34; hell scream that will get your attention. They are very well calibrated and are not triggered by cooking but some heat + smoke and they will alert properly. Had all tested by a safety inspector at our home.<br /><br />Mounting was very quick and appropriate for most home DIY types.
5.0	I was very happy with this product.It is a well constructed,and easy to install.I could not believe the quality of this item for the price. Thank You.
5.0	I was very happy with the quality of the cords when I received them. I plan on ordering more of them.
5.0	Fantastic though it took three of us to hang it. Very solid and worth the money, great looking!
5.0	This remote was a little cheaper than the other universals I have seen, but worked just as well.  I think the range could be longer, but it opens the door, and that's all I needed.<br /><br />The instructions are a little off on the programming for my opener ( a True Value), but I just started running through the codes for the closest years, and found it without much of a problem.  Worth the money spent, and the money saved.
5.0	Awesome lights for off roading.
5.0	I bought a five gallon Arctic water cooler at a rummage sale to help a local amimal rescue group. I was kinda bummed when I get home and the valve leaked. I found this spigot on Amazon and decided to give it a try. It was super easy to install and the price was very reasonable. The best part is no leaks.
5.0	I use it as an antenna topper for a black Sentra.<br />Now I can find my car quickly in the biggest parking lots.
5.0	I wish I didn't have to write a review, not much to say really. It worked just like it was supposed to work. Thanks.
5.0	exactly what I expected
5.0	Perfect for my son's music room number three on his list of things he loves to do.
5.0	I love this faucet, it makes my bath look like a luxurious spa, and I can wash my hair in the sink now.
5.0	My washer wouldn't dispense the fabric softener. This was the part to fix it, and it worked great. Very easy install.
1.0	What am I supposed to do with ONE SIDE of a door knob?? I thought this was a complete knob that I could use on my interior doors and bought 5 of them. What a waste of money. Very mad right now.
5.0	Good value. Even coloring. Good construction.
5.0	I put this on the wall behind out bathroom door to keep the knob from denting the wall.  worked perfectly, quick and easy!
5.0	Replaced an old disposal when I put in a new sink. This one is so quiet you can barely hear it running. Wonderful!
5.0	I like this candle. It worked for more than 24 hours.  Nice, pleasant, light.  Not too bright.  Just right.  I recommend it.
5.0	I really love this lamp.  It looks great in my home, it's easy to use (just a touch to turn it on, a touch to turn it off and a touch-hold to change the brightness), and it uses about as much power as a night light.  It's easy to clean and move.  I also love the fact that it's bright enough to provide reading light next to my bed.<br /><br />I can't recommend it highly enough!
5.0	My second order for this product. Worked as advertised so I bought the second one to have on hand for any future problem
5.0	I have no complaints. This is everything I want in a thermostat. It works seemlesly with the app. I won't get into the details, because you can just read the other reviews. We have the Nest at work, and it doesn't compare to the features this has. Do you homework and compare the two. You'll choose this , and won't be disappointed.
5.0	I got this within 3 days of placing the order and that too without the two day shipping !<br />Works great and easy to work with the code.<br />Going to order another one ! Thanks:)
5.0	Perfect lamp for my desk.  Love it
1.0	The doorbell last for 6 months after I installed it and in this 6 months I have noticed a very poor sound quality
1.0	Like others have said, this thing starts to crack at the seams and leak after only a few months or so of use. Very cheaply made. Fortunately we bought it at a store that has a great return policy so we will be returning it and getting our money back.
5.0	Great, works better than expected
5.0	Perfect replacement for my broken one. I am glad a purchased a second one as a spare.  The price was reasonable.
5.0	This really adds an interesting look to my kitchen. It was a quick and easy way to add a decorative touch. I also bought the double switch plate, so it really changes the look in my kitchen.<br /><br />The work seems to be very well done, so only time will tell if it holds up, but it should. I would think only water will be necessary for any cleaning because of the way in which it is constructed and coated.  Another point in its favor is that it fit without any problems.<br /><br />Overall, it was a great way to add a new touch.
5.0	I read some of the complains about this box. I went ahead and bought 3 of them. I have nothing but good thing to say about it.<br />It works well and priced very nice.<br />No problem even taking it apart to replace a drive with a larger capacity.
5.0	Excellent price, will be using on stamped concrete
5.0	I bought this for my friend who lives in Texas and loved the one I got! Hoping hers isn't as tiny as mine was! But she said she loved it and would send me pics as soon as she got it hung onto her wall.
5.0	I needed a secure place for a small handgun next to my bed. The safe provides adequate space for the weapon and does not take up too much space.
5.0	What a steal! Fits perfectly above my laundry room door and just brings everything together. So happy with the product.
5.0	Tried many products to repair a crack in a golf cart battery and nothing worked.  Saw this product at Walmart and the problem is solved.  I used a strip of fiberglass wallboard mesh tape to allow build up of glue to make the repair a little thicker.
5.0	Light is bright and fan is quite.
5.0	Nice contemporary design.  Arrived quickly and being LED is very efficient.  Easy to install and is quite bright.
5.0	Beautiful and festive
5.0	It is made out of solid brass and not cheap plastic. I read all the reviews before purchasing and this sounded like the most well made. It works great and the water flows out at a descent rate and the water droplets have a soothing feel. Before installing it I did as some people mentioned in there reviews and that is unscrew the nut by hand on the angle adjuster on the back and I took a small screw driver and pushed the screen and water flow restrictor out so the water would flow better. Before you do this you have to unscrew the clear plastic screen in the other end so you can push the screen and restrictor out. I left the clear plastic screen out to because I figured it would collect junk and clog up and slow down the water pressure. It does come with a black plastic piece that removes the screw on the front of the shower head so you can remove the face and clean it with out taking the whole unit off of the wall. So make sure not to throw it away. Remove the cardboard that holds the shower head inside the box because the instructions and other parts are under it. I also purchase the Danze D481116BN  13 inch S- Shape Shower Arm to go with the shower head. It is solid like this shower head with no plastic and a must have with this shower head. U can angle the shower head to fit everyones needs.
5.0	These are the best drain stoppers we've bought.
5.0	This is just what the doctor ordered for my rotting window sills. For a couple years I was wondering what I was going to do about them. Replacement would have been time consuming and costly. First you remove as much of the rotted wood as possible. Then you apply Minwax wood hardener and wait about 1 hour for it to cure. This makes any soft wood hard so you have a good base to work with. Then you mix the wood filler and hardener (about the size of a large golf ball's worth). Then you just apply the filler to the rotted area and shape it as it cures. It will fully cure in a little over an hour. You can now sand it to shape or if you took the time to shape it while it cured you can just apply paint. Yes there are fumes but since I used it outdoors It was not a problem as I was not in the area of the window while it was curing. If you use it indoors the fumes could be a problem. When you are done the window sill looks brand new and you cant tell it was repaired. I repaired and painted 4 window sills in one day. Thank heavens this stuff exists.
5.0	Apartment residents love this deadbolt.  I am replacing the old configuration of a deadbolt and lockable door nob set<br />with the BE365 and a non-locking door knob.  No more calls from residents locking themselves out; no more replacing locks when residents move out.  The battery on the unit I use with my house has lasted two years and is going strong.
5.0	Very reliable, safe, strong, and cloned magnificently to the original USPS specifications.  Very easy to remove the old lock and replace the new lock.
5.0	Nice fit for my porch chandelier....
5.0	Everyone loves these outdoor lamp. I actually have 2. They are decorative but also add much needed light.
5.0	Love It...so different with the orchid on the beach
5.0	You cannot beat this price for the quality.  I am glad I found it on here and not went to one the of the home improvement stores and spent a lot more for less quality!!!
5.0	New rack is better than the original which had no lower support and did not draw the air through the bottom of the rack. Superior design and less likely to break.
5.0	A really nice set of &#34;O&#34; rings
5.0	I am, and will be, a return customer.  This product works and I love it! During my most recent purchase the seller noted that I didn't order enough hooks for the amount of discs I ordered and most generously sent them to me without charge.  I highly recommend this product and its seller!!!
5.0	The faucet has seven different levels of water types.  It is really a wonderful product.
5.0	Very nice unit. Strong but quiet. A bit larger than expected so make sure you have room under your sink. Easy to install. Chews up pretty much everything we throw at it and we throw everything at it. For the pice compared to other brands' 1/3 hp or 1/2 hp units, you can't beat this deal.
5.0	I am very happy with my purchase of this fan. It was exactly what I was looking for (stylish, quiet, and not too pricey).
5.0	Bought the product as replacement bulb for our computer light.  Works great to light up the computer area and is efficient with energy as well.
5.0	Bought 5 for all my lil and big kids! Adults '
5.0	As expected. Good deal.
5.0	This is a first rate product and a company that stands by it. We have replaced nearly 2 dozen halogens in our condo and not only is the quality of the light (including the color) excellent, but the dispersion is even and somewhat wider than the bulbs they replaced. We were able to replace 50W bulbs with 7W LEDs with no loss of illumination (quite the opposite actually) and significant energy savings.<br /><br />We have had zero failures or other issues in the 5 or so months we've had them. No problems with dimming (which are usually due to a non-LED friendly transformer). Finally, the company is very responsive to questions or other inquiries. When we recently thought we had a problem with one bulb (which actually turned out to be the socket), the company responded quickly and there was never an issue with whether the bulb would be replaced.<br /><br />Highly recommended with no caveats.
5.0	Very Very good product will recommend to others
5.0	I've been using the Tormek T7 for a full year now, and I can honestly affirm that the Tormek T7 is an absolute Godsend of a sharpening machine. Over the years I have literally spent thousands of dollars on other sharpening systems, and the Tormek T7 is a shining star above all other products I've purchased. This little sharpening machine is darn near foolproof once you've used it a few times & get a rhythm going in your head. The booklet & DVD that comes with the unit are pretty straight forward with giving you the mechanics of how to sharpen your tools & knives, but Tormek needs to refine those two items for people who are looking for an advanced method of obtaining superior results that will result in tools & knives obtaining a finer edge & how to maintain that fine edge, specifically by using a double edge sharpening method. The Tormek T7 is more capable than even Tormek advertises, but I had to learn the methods by trial & error because the booklet & DVD are so basic in their sharpening instruction methodology. If you decide to purchase a T7 I would highly recommend that you also purchase a superfine grit Japanese waterstone, especially if you sharpen thin blade tools such as scrapers and knives. Having to constantly regrade the single 200 grit stone that comes with the T7, using the Tormek Stone Grader, is a total pain in the youknowhat. You can change out the grinding wheel in the same amount of time as it takes to regrade the Tormek 200 grit stone, and your results will be far superior compared to using the Tormek stone. When it's time for me to sharpen tools I put the Japanese waterstone in a bucket of water so that it's ready to use when I change out the Tormek 200 grit sharpening wheel to the Japanese waterstone.
5.0	Water tastes a bit cleaner, and the salad and fruit seems to be keeping fresh for longer.<br />I love the little &#34;progress bar&#34; style reminder.
5.0	(Note: I think I have a 1.25 GPM model)...For the price, this shower-head is almost perfect, the massage setting leaves a tad to be desired, but it's still a nice feature. The spray, however, is awesome, nice and powerful and not too thin like some other low-flow shower-heads. The water stays nice and warm, unlike aerated types.  This is probably the best shower-head I have ever used, not including some of the fancy hotel ones I've used. I like it so much that I have already recommended this product to all of my friends and family.  If you're looking for an economic solution to reduce your water usage/costs, this is the one for you...GET IT!
5.0	Great night light for my grandson who love superheroes.
1.0	Gee, let me list the things that are wrong with this product.  First, the font for the word 'LIFE' is entirely different from the picture and definitely not the look I was going for - or what I ordered.  Second, it came folded and I have no idea what to do to get the folds ironed out.  There were no instructions to help with this little ordeal - or for installing the decal, for that matter.<br /><br />I'm very disappointed with this product and have given up on putting it up.
5.0	If you have any of the old classic floor lamps that take the mogul screw base three way lamps, you need a large shade to cover the reflector. This will do the job. It does have to match your decor.
1.0	I thought this was a good product. ITs caused me to loose hundreds of dollars and endless frustration. You see, you ge t them and they work fine. After  a little while (few months at most), they start to flicker.. constantly. it stops after a while.. starts back up. I thought i had electrical problems and had to pay for a electrician to come out to tell me that the problem is that this brand of bulb is supposedly dimmable but after a short time its ability on a dimmed light does not function problem causing the continual flickering.<br /><br />So now im out money for an electrician, the light bulbs i bought, and I have multiple bad bulbs in my house sitting around that are no good and lights without light bulbs now. Poor product.
5.0	They work as they should.
1.0	I agree, in part, with the other reviewer.  The knobs on our original KA oven starting giving out after 3-4 years, so we did a full replacement with these.  Two have succumbed after 8-9 months of use - so obviously worse than the OEM.  We hypothesize that heat from the oven actually accelerated the degradation process, so we are thinking of keeping them off (also good for the kids) while not in use, but that is a royal hassle.  If i had any business sense I would open up a custom knob website and make aluminum knobs.
5.0	Great price. Great product
5.0	Ordered 2 of these to put in our newly remodeled bathroom.  Very well made and they look great!
5.0	I had an old desktop sunlight, the base had broken during a move but was able to continue to use it, still had the original bulb, say 8 years or so, put the new one together, went with the old bulb and lo and behold plugged right in, the new bulb sits in it's box in the cabinet awaiting it time, worth every penny and then some!
1.0	Does Amazon really expect someone to buy this without knowing the quantity? Sure they tell you it weighs 9 pounds, but how much 10/3 does it take to make 9 pounds?
5.0	"As an electrical engineer, I had some trepidation about installing these lamps in recessed ceiling \\""can\\"" fixtures.  The electronics that make the LED work are in the base where the heat will collect, and those components are susceptible to heat.  I expected that the reliability of the power supplies and other electronic devices would be compromised and the failure rate would be fairly high and that would negate the intrinsic cost effectiveness of the LEDs.  You can see by looking at the picture that there are many fins integrated into the design of the lamp which shows that heat mitigation is a concern.  G7 has addressed the issue elegantly with both mechanical and electrical considerations.  After talking with Chris, who is G7's customer service rep, I was reassured that, absent any manufacturing defects that typically manifest within the first few weeks or months (\\""infant mortality\\"" in reliability parlance) these LED lamps will most likely achieve their 10+ year design life.  If that happens, I will be more than ecstatic.  I can't think of what that word is, but I will be it, since I will have saved lots of money in electricity, I won't have contributed to the overall mercury pollution equation with CFLs, and I'll have experienced the ultimate in dimmable lighting - going from just a glow all the way to glorious operating room-like lighting in my kitchen; perfectly customizable to the task at hand.  If you are considering buying these lamps you must determine which \\""color temperature\\""  lighting you want for the area to be lit.  These are 4000°K lamps, meaning they are shifted toward the blue end of the spectrum.  That's more like daylight on a clear, bright day.  The other option is in the 2000° to 2700°K, which would be suited toward bathroom or living room lighting.  They would be warmer, as in yellowish-pink, which is more flattering.  So there you have it - I'm going into this full of optimism.  I promise to update this review with any issues or other considerations that may arise, but I really like what I see so far."
5.0	fully adjustable.  works as advertised.  batteries last for a loooooooongggg time!  i feel like bruce wayne whenever i open my safe.  Thank you stack on!
5.0	customer really liked it
5.0	This showerhead is just what I needed. Because of my disability, it is nescessary to shower using a transfer bench and I was wasting a lot of precious water! This is only a SHOWERHEAD and does not include a hose, but it hooked right up to my existing hose. It has a fixed spray pattern, but feels just right. On pause, it allows only a small trickle of water to flow. It is of very good quality (Delta brand) and construction and I've already dropped it onto the tub floor quite a few times with no damage to it! If you need a good showerhead with a pause control, I highly suggest this one. So buy it and save that precious (and costly) water!!
5.0	The first reason to purchase this opener is that it is so easy to program.  Took less than two minutes.  Works great. A quality product!
1.0	ADVICE - Buy a single higher end filter either on Amazon or at your local box store and run it for 1-2 months and then run one of these for the same amount of time and compare the two filters. If everyone that has left a 4-5 star review for this product did so i guarantee you that there would be a LOT of revised reviews.<br /><br />If i could give this product zero stars i would. I moved into a new construction home two years ago so my heater and duct work are all new. I would replace my filters every two months instead of the recommended one month and was always surprised by how much crud they would accumulate. I decided i would change them every month and looked for a lower cost replacement for the &#34;Filtrete Clean Living Filters&#34; i was using and decided to purchase these after reading the reviews. After on month the filter still looked brand new. Gave it another month and still looked new. Thought it was a fluke but after 3 months there is barely a perceptible difference between the used filter and the new ones. In some case the adage you get what you pay for is very true and this is absolutely one of those cases. I will be going back to these filters:<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002CJN0H2/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1<br /><br />I will be paying almost twice the amount for half the filters but considering the vast difference in performance i will do it happily.
1.0	Like everyone else, I read the rave reviews in hopes that these were going to be fully dimmable CFL bulbs.    In my experience (possibly my fixture's fault?), they were not.    They get very bright, light up instantly, and can dim well, but the last 10%, they flicker and hum loudly.  Severely disappointed.    I was even more disappointed that I contacted the seller and tried to get a refund, but absolutely no response.  I can't believe I wasted so much money on these and they do not even give me the common courtesy of replying to me.    Buy at your own risk, but I cannot recommend.
5.0	Love them! Highly recommend them
5.0	Works like it says and is of great build quality, love it so far.
5.0	Easy to program and looks great
5.0	What a beautiful tealight holder that's made out of Himalayan salt HA! You should see how cute they are. The tealight inside the nice sized holder offers a beautiful orange glow that to me is very warm and romantic,and also it's suppose to purify the air. Well now that I got this cute salt lamp all I need now is a date.
5.0	Great filters packaged safely and at a reasonable price.
5.0	Works great for my purpose.
5.0	Gorgeous black metal cupboard pulls that have given my oak cabinets a whole new look! Easy to install.I thought for the price they were going to be cheap looking and I'd have sent them back, but I won the gamble, they are very classy.
5.0	Great Seat, kids would wake each other up with old seat slamming down. Very comfortable.
5.0	I like the movement. You can rinse the whole shower out. Makes a huge difference on the dirty shower.  Has not leaked in 2+ years so far  Cleans easy.  Easy cure for the wild sprayer- just run fingers over the rubber outlets back and forth a couple times. Breaks up the build up and sprays in a nice stream again.
5.0	My water was just dripping out when I turned the water on.  I figured it was time for a new reverse osmosis machine.  I decided to first take a chance on the RO, Pre and Post filter.  It works like a charm.  It was about 2 ½ years since last replacement.  I know that’s too long and now that I know where to get it, I’m thinking to just get another to have one on hand. Thanks a heap yall.
5.0	Both my son and I love it. It's huge and looks good on the wall. Everyone who sees my sons wall loves it.
5.0	This is beautiful, sturdy, rich looking,  and just what I wanted!  You can remove a section to make it shorter or leave for a taller effect.  My small vessel bowl is great with one section easily removed.
1.0	I ordered this for my grandson and for a total of 2 hrs of burning the bulb burned out.  There is no way to replace the bulbs....My grandson and I are very disappointed.....Sent an e-mail to the company and they stated that they are going to send me another one out asap.......
5.0	After looking at several other non electric motion sensors I liked the look of this one. My daughter got one for Christmas and I was amazed at the distance the light beamed.  Easy to put up and works just great on my cabin where there is not outside wiring.  Love it.
5.0	worked exactly for wat i wanted it for and some im going to even get 1 more the only bad thing is the light gets a little hot and it should have like a glass cover or something over the bulb
5.0	This was a Christmas gift for my husband, and while I initially thought it was a waste of money, this thing is incredible. There is a little trial and error in the beginning, but once he got the hang of it, our painting looked AMAZING.<br /><br />Painting popcorn ceilings: SO easy.<br />Painting cabinet doors: SO. EASY. And the result: Oh. Em. Gee.<br /><br />We renovated our kitchen and our kitchen cabinets look absolutely perfect and so professional. This thing is totally worth the money just for that alone. They're smooth and glossy (we used Glidden semi gloss) and just perfect.
5.0	Fast shipping, item as described.
5.0	This was bought as a gift for my grandaughter as a night light.  She absolutely loves it.  It arrived on time and intact without any problems or flaws.  Completely happy with purchase.  Wwould buy from this seller again.
5.0	Works great, no complaints. My electricity bill was higher then usual, but thats because I upgraded from a lower watt up to these.
1.0	Would love to give zero stars. This whole system is poorly designed and made. The parts easily break as all the stress is placed on a small welded piece.
5.0	Works very well and is a powerful light. Has a quiet fan. Screws in regular socket with fairly good clearance.
5.0	Has a good range, works well out doors
5.0	Yellow jacket are my favorite, and this splitter works great. Love the lighted power block. I bought this to use on my masterbuilt electric smoker, & masterbuilt electric cold smoker, & my weber rotisserie. it's nice to be able to run all three at the same time using one Extension Cord and this 3 outlet power block. I will definitely be buying another one.
5.0	The lamp has a heavy base which is great in windy weather. The color is a close match to our porch furniture and the light has two settings of brightness. I am very happy with the looks and the functionality of the lamp. Highly recommended.
5.0	"I bought 4 of these 4 watt bulbs, and frankly, didn't expect too much for $4.99..I was totally wrong. The bulbs are incredibly bright and robustly built. I also bought 2 of the \\""other brand\\"" bulbs for $14.99 to compare the two bulbs and see if an additional $10 got you anything more. ...The bulbs are identical. Totally no discernable difference in brightness. FYI, the $4.99 bulbs draw about .45 amps.. The higher priced bulbs draw a little less current, about .38 amps."
5.0	Purchased this for my 2 yr old son. its nothing to special but it works as advertised and has a mobile app to keep track of what money is in the bank as well as setting goals. its also compatiable with Wink. sort of cool if you have a wink relay because you can then view the balance from any of your relay touchscreens as well as your mobie app.
5.0	Took some time to study up on the problems with the Whirlpool Cabrio HE Topload Washers and found the bearings fail pretty regularly.  After some troubleshooting, I looked to just replace the bearings, but found this kit here and went to work.<br /><br />Plan about 4 hours to do this installation.  You definitely will want to make some space and take the time to clean the basket out while you're in there.  We have a family of 6 and the washer runs most of the time!<br /><br />Also, don't be afraid to use the adhesive liberally!  After looking at our failed bearings, they had a significant amount of rust due to water damage.  The adhesive degrades with hot water and detergent over time causing the leak into the upper bearing.  Also, I used a little white grease to help repel any water that gets past the adhesive barrier.<br /><br />Again...sure beats replacing the entire washer.  My parents had the same problem and it cost them &#62;$300 for a repair service.  Much cheaper and self satisfying to make the repair yourself.
5.0	I think that this honestly helped.  I do have a newer top load washer and it doesn't actually smell bad, but it doesn't smell like it did when I first purchased it.  I used Smelly Washer Cleaner faithfully and I do think freshened it up.  I will use it periodically to get that &#34;better&#34; smell to the washer smell.  I do recommend this product.<br /> I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review
5.0	Just what we where looking for. It is giving us lite 2 read and also gives the room lite. Very well built.
1.0	This fan was a complete pain in the you-know-what.  It took us forever to get it mounted and then, once that part was done, we realized that some of the hardware was missing.  Not worth the good price...look elsewhere.
5.0	We redid our bathroom and opted for a handle lever vs. the old crystal ball handle.  This is a must have piece to close off where the shower diverter push-rod used to be.  No plumbing store/warehouse in town had this piece.<br /><br />Bought two because we're going to redo the other bath next.
5.0	I'm using this in my 2014 CR-V, in fits perfectly in the compartment to the lower left of the steering wheel.  Other remotes are too big for there, and I don't like remoted on my visor.  This works perfect!
5.0	Best invention since sliced bread!  I was gobsmacked by this item!  I needed a doorbell as I moved to a large home that needed a lot of renovation.  I could NOT hear anyone knock or pound on the front door.  I thought...”Now I need to drill a hole in my home to wire up a door bell and string wire into the back of the house!”  So I went on amazon.com to get an idea of what to do.  And there was a SadoTech wireless Doorbell For $20 I could attach a transmitter (doorbell button) to anywhere near my door or on my door (with a double adhesive back strip OR screws--which ARE included) then plug the doorbell into ANY AC outlet and Voila!  A door bell!  And if you DON’T have an AC outlet--shed, carport, garage, building a new place or re-wiring you can put batteries in the receiver.  30 seconds to install a great doorbell!  The receiver has 52 different ring tones.  One button to get to the tone you like. (All of the ring tones are on an audio on amazon.  From Christmas songs to Happy Birthday to my favorite “Big Ben.”) and one button to adjust the volume.  It’s IDIOT PROOF!<br />A wireless doorbell.  What an AWESOME idea that actually works!
1.0	Did not leave spaces cut right through the fleece like I was using a normal rotary blade. Do not recommend at all
5.0	I bought 3 of these, and found them to be great lamps for both my sailboat and home emergency lighting system.
5.0	Great replacement product for the cheap ones normally on door bottoms.
5.0	We replaced our showerhead about 10 years ago with a low flow model.  The performance was not great but at least we were saving water.  Technology has improved in the time since, so I replaced it with this model from Delta.  It's amazing how great this showerhead is.  It is possible to adjust the pressure.  We keep ours set at about 50% because full pressure is actually too much.  We are very happy with this model.
5.0	Easy installation and works great.
5.0	Love, love love.  Great quality at a great price.  I am impressed with these, paid a lot more for another faucet and these are prettier and of equal quality.
5.0	Worked great in patching up a tear in one of my patio umbrellas.
5.0	I've been searching for something like this for years. Hooked this up to a basement sewage system. Glued 3&#34; of pipe to each side and used 2 rubber connectors, one top and one bottom. Worked perfectly, no leaks, no noise - perfect. Screw connectors worked fine but if I had to do it again I'd buy the version that doesn't have them. These connectors allow easy replacement but the rubber connectors I used do they same thing and are a bit more substantial...preference I suppose. I noticed that, since the valve closes quicker, less fluid flows back down to the pump when it stops. My pump doesn't come on as often. This indicates to me that the valve could be mounted further away from the pump than a normal check valve. I've tried multiple set ups with other check valves trying to stop the thunkkkk! This product is fantastic.
5.0	"One of those \\""can't do without\\"" woodworking notions. This package is a good value. Spaceballs are simple, don't fail, center a panel and compress just enough to be useful. I've used them for about 8-10 years now on every panel project that I've done."
5.0	Perfect fit and sturdy.
1.0	Future Glue is usually very close to the consistency of water.  This stuff is almost a paste it is so thick.  Very old product.
5.0	Hooked up this thermostat and had it programmed over WIFI within minutes. We have an IPAD and used that setup method as was recommended by the manufacturer. Initial setup was somewhat tedious having to find the device over wifi, doing a setup to connect the device to the home network, and then logging back into the network to program the device. Hopefully it was worth it.
5.0	Work just fine. Look nice.
5.0	excellent finish, easy to install, curved bar (away from wall) allowing easy placement of towels on bar.  if you're installing in a tight spot, this might be a consideration.
5.0	Nice product at a very reasonable price-very pleased!
5.0	Perfect for our our craftsman style porch
5.0	Very easy installation (just minutes). The satin finish blends well with my sink and faucet. The pump mechnaism seems to work well (I've only had it in service for a week) and delivers soap immediately on the first pump. At this point, I would say this is a very good value.
5.0	These don't have a &#34;bowtie&#34; cotter pin as oem...But...Bolts are as &#34;good&#34; as oem...Just put some in ur pocket when blowing snow...Much more affordable than oem!!! Get extras!!! +++
5.0	Works very well, simple to use.
5.0	Needed a system that was not to expensive and would alert me when someone was coming to my house. Had<br />another system just like this before.
5.0	Work great (I guess) they have not ever gone off which makes me happy. I suppose if they don't work I may not ever know...
5.0	Very sturdy knob. I put one of these for the garage entrance and another on the master bedroom.  Both I set to use the same key.  The color of the bronze is great.<br /><br />I've recommended to many friends.
5.0	Works great on glass cooktop surfaces. Delivery time was long due to shipment originating from England. Be patient, it is worth the wait!
1.0	I bought this safe 2 weeks ago and got it in a timely manner.  However, when I opened the packaged and tried to use the key to open the safe it wouldn't open at all.  Had several different people try to open it and followed instructions and nothing would work.  I decided to get a replacement and received it yesterday.  The key opened the safe this time but yet again another problem.  The electronic lock would only work every 2-3 times and when it did the handle to open the safe had to be jiggled a lot.  I will never buy another Stack-On safe and neither should any of you.
5.0	These aren't sold in stores.  I have installed 7 of these over the long weekend and am in the process of installing another 8.  They illuminate the staircase perfectly.  I am going to put them in all four of the bathrooms and a couple in the hallway.  Most of them will be controlled by switch with the exception of 4 that will run 24/7.  7 watts doesn't take much energy to operate.  They work better than the more expensive LED version ($15-$25 each) and give off much more light.  I wouldn't waste my time with the LED version.  They are also much nicer looking and easier to install than the traditional larger recessed staircase light that takes a 25-40 watt standard lightbulb and costs $28 each at Home Depot.
5.0	I really cant add any more to the reviews for this Receiver, because this Receiver works like all the other Reviewers said it does and my Liftmaster 355LM Garage Door Receiver 315Mhz Conversion Kit works perfect with my 30 year old sears garage door opener, which still works great and I use it with the old original 2 wire receiver that's still on the wall by the door that takes you inside the home.<br />I have my new Liftmaster 355LM--315Mhz Receiver Conversion Kit also hooked up to the same 2 wires that goes to the older model garage door opener, now I can use either receiver that I have attached to the wall.<br />I installed this new unit so I could program it with the Homelink that is built  into the rear view mirror on my 2013 Hyundai Sonata and I will say it all works perfect. This new Liftmaster brand receiver has three screws on it for hooking up to the garage door opener motor on the ceiling. The new unit comes with a plug in power transformer that is needed if you have the 2 wire system. The 3 wire door openers don't need the power transformer. This all seems very complicated until you purchase the receiver but it is very simple and it all works great. I guess I reviewed this new Receiver after all.
1.0	I love these bags, but the company threw a shipping label on the box you see in the description, the actual purchased item, and sent it that way to get the worst of dirt and rain and manhandling. It was in horrible shape upon arrival. I want the item I'm purchasing to be packaged, even if its garbage bags.
5.0	Fit perfectly and perform like the ones that cost twice as much in my local store.
5.0	*4 year update. No issues in 4 years. We chose to update the hand held shower head to have more spray options. Otherwise everything works great we pop the bottom cap off to clean and it fits easily back on. The shelf isnt the best design but it holds what we've needed (two soaps, razors, and a 8 oz eucalyptus spray bottle). Still best bathroom remodel purchase to date. We've had friends try it out and they've purchased the same or similar model. Water pressure is still strong. Never have had issues of calcium build up with spray options.  -------------- This is the best investment! Great look, great product, pressure is fantastic. Easy Install.  Things to check when you get it: 1)The hoses- run water through them so they arent leaking (saw this in other reviews) we got good hoses 2)Knobs and pegs- make sure all your knobs have the direction screw to show on and off. *we were missing one 3)Shelf- is level and isnt bent *our metal was bent 4)Defects in the frame- we had no issues 5) Main shower head- make sure when you turn it on the 1st time that its tight and stays *the o ring needed replaced it wasnt as thick as it needed to be.  VIGO was very good at helping with defects and send new parts or trouble shoot (Mon-Fri), just register on their site before contacting them.  All in all even with getting the replacement pieces it is well worth it! We have friends who have the high end systems and this is just as great, if not better.  We will purchase VIGO again and recommend the shower systems.
5.0	My only gripe was that it was hard to mount inside the tank, but it was not meant to be used in a reptile tank, soooo<br />Much cheaper than the standard stuff you buy in the pet store and does the job.  I have it mounted and I'm using it with the Reptisun 10.0 in my beardie tank.  Tossed the bulb it came with and also threw out the frosted plastic cover.  Reptisum popped right it.  I have it on my timer and it goes on each morning and off each evening without fail.<br />Very happy with it after I got it mounted.  I run this 12 hours straight each day.
5.0	This light is bright what i expected,I really love its cool daylight after the installation in the ceiling fan light ,the fast delivery and excellent service……i must recommend it to my friends,I will come back…
5.0	Excellent choice. Works perfectly.
1.0	"The canvas print was nice, although, I wish it was truer to the actual colors of the painting.  Be aware that this did not come stretched on the frame, like stated above, and the \\""easy to hang\\"" frame included was about half the size of the print.  I ended up having to take it to get professionally framed.  I found the whole experience very disappointing and will not be ordering from this company again."
5.0	It actually works! I was able to unclogged my bathroom sink.
5.0	I really like this mailbox.  It was easy to mount on a pre-existing post and works very well. It stores a lot of mail, is secure, and has a clip on the inner drawer for outgoing mail.  The service was great too.  It came very shortly after I ordered it.  My only comment is I saw the same mailbox at other locations for a little less money.  But I love the mailbox.
5.0	Perfect, we've beed holding the old one tod=gether with marine glue and zip ties. Finally. Arrived in perfect timing for guests
5.0	Faucet installed easily, and was the perfect size & type for our open kitchen with breakfast counter behind the sink. Controls take some getting used to given the force produced when fully opened, but having the power is frequently helpful.
5.0	These are just fine! :)
5.0	Great cord reel!!! I bought it to store a 100', 12/3 extension cord. When it arrived I thought there's no way all of this cord will fit on that reel. I wound the cord on the reel from the center as described in other posts and to my surprise, it fit with room to spare. The reel is small (11&#34; w x 14&#34; h x 9&#34; d) and takes up very little space. Great Product!!!
1.0	This item spontaneously shattered all over my 16-year-old son while he was showering. We found him bleeding, standing in a pile of glass shards. We had to take him to urgent care to remove the glass slivers in his arms, legs and feet.
5.0	These are BEAUTIES, much nicer than shown in the pic- futuristic, high-tech, like something on the Enterprise (TNG, not TOS). They're polished stainless steel- compact, sleek, yet solid.  I admit to idiot thinking that, since they're solar, they need to be outside in the sun.  Duh, like a solar calculator, any light source will charge the internal rechargeable AAA battery.  I live in an area with frequent power outages, which freak out pets and necessitate having to drag out flashlights and candles every couple of days.  Not with these!<br /><br />No-frills, eco-friendly packaging, and fast shipping.  These have a power switch- ON or OFF- but charge either way (found that out because I charged them all day, before switching them ON, didn't read the instructions).  When switched ON they're off as long as there's light in the area (which also charges them), come on when it gets dark.  For bathrooms, stairways, hallways, key areas, not only is it great to have lighting backup for outages (especially for the peace of mind afforded when you're not home but your pets and others not prepared to deal with them are), but we find it's no longer necessary to turn on overhead lights in these areas after dark when passing through or making a pit stop.  They make great auto-on night-lights that don't require electrical outlets- perfect for RVs, too.<br /><br />The key of course is having enough light from either the sun or indoor lighting to keep them charged.  This might require a bit of experimentation before drilling holes and mounting them- but they slip off the mounting screws easily, if you want to charge them elsewhere.  We have one bathroom without windows, and the overhead light keeps the step-light charged, pretty much, but every once in a while I put it out on the pprch.<br /><br />The light is cool/blue in tone, just bright enough to read by (in a pinch, up close to it), bright enough to illuminate an entire bathroom (dimly).  This will translate to big savings on the electric bill.  We were forever forgetting to turn lights off and they tended to stay on all the time, until I installed these.  To say I'm delighted with them would be an understatement.<br /><br />The owner's manual says the rechargeable battery will begin to diminish after a year or so and need replacing. They currently cost about $7-$10 for four high quality ones, like Tenergy.  What a bargain these lights are- they COME with a year's supply of batteries.  I'm going to buy more for other key spots in the house, outside and for the RV.  Highly recommended!  Should they not prove durable I'll update this review.<br /><br />NOTE: I fully charged one of these, then put it in a dark closet to see how long it would last without recharging.  So far it's still lit after 48 hours!forever forgetting to turn lights off and they tended to stay on all the time, until I installed these.

5.0	I personally think that this is a great product. The installation was simple, just turn the water off and install the T connector that comes with the bidet in order to give the bidet a water supply. You just need to unscrew the toilet seat and put it underneath. I have no problems with the product at all.<br /><br />The product itself is strong, but the good kind of strong, its not painful or anything. It's an efficient cleaning device. I wanted to note though that in my toilet, there's not really much strength difference from levels 2-5. Even though it seems like it has varying degrees of power based on the knob, it seems to work more like an on/off switch. So its either off or relatively powerful. Levels 3, 4, and 5 are the same as far as i'm concerned.<br /><br />The great thing about this product is that it reduces your toilet paper consumption by a lot. I still use toilet paper, but only to dry out the water, other than that this machine is far superior to using toilet paper and by using it you avoid many of the frustrations that come with using toilet paper.
5.0	Works great! It has worked the best of any product I have ever used to clean rust stains in the tub. I have used it 4 times now on 3 different tubs.
1.0	These connections may work good if there were instructions explaining to cut the rubber away from the end of the strip of lights.Although it has no instructions so I wasted 3 extensions due to the thickness of the lite strip the tab breaks off.
5.0	The light is wonderful. Nothing but great complements from our guests. The contemporary design is unusual. I would highly recommend it and am thinking about buying 2 more for our master bath.
5.0	I use these bulbs in my Kopycake projector and they last forever.  Now, I tend to leave the machine on continuously if I am working on a project, and I believe turn it on and off repeatedly shortens the bulb life considerably.  I get many more than 40 hours out of each bulb and the prices here are cheaper than my local photography shop.
5.0	Perfect for my handyman job, ventilating a room that's always cold due to air flow restrictions. Perfectly fits the 3&#34; hole I cut using a saw cut drill bit.
5.0	Inexpensive, delivered the next day, and the fire marshall was fine with them on the last inspection.  The are easy to test, easy to install and it includes enough hardware, faces and blanks to meet the code for any exit configuration.  In my mind there is no need to look anywhere else
1.0	hinge was broken right out of the package
1.0	The base was so unstable that the lamp fell over--very dangerous
5.0	Easy to install.  Great price!
5.0	This polish had been recommended to me by a &#34;cleaning shop&#34; and I have used it for some time- I love it and much better for my furniture finishes
5.0	This is exactly what we expected - a high quality Moen faucet with a look we like with a substantial finish.
5.0	Perfect replacement 😊
5.0	Beautifully finished. Easy to install.
5.0	Small and sharp just what I needed, shipped fast and work very well for cutting things like paper cloth and cannab collecting for a godd product I tell you what now
5.0	CRL Fletcher PushMate Point Setting Tool - Works just as described.  Really helped me and saved time when changing pictures in frames.
5.0	The greatest problem I have is their light bulbs work so well it may take months if not years for a bulb to wear out. The only reason I bought new ones is I  misplaced the replacements I bought several years ago.
5.0	Nice product! Works great on our mailbox
5.0	I put two of these in a new build, and will be replacing the Nu-Tones I have in three bathrooms - All things being relative, these are virtually SILENT compared to the NuTones (which you can hear and feel vibration from three floors away), and they move three or four times the air!<br /><br />Not sure why some folks review them as noisy - i turn 'em on for visitors and they are amazed.
5.0	Nice bright lights now.
5.0	Works good doors my needs perfect.
5.0	I purchased two of these.  They work and they look good (a little smaller than you might expect).  Thank you.
5.0	Great price, fits perfect.
5.0	Arrived as promised and works for our needs.
5.0	I ordered these for my mother's home and she really likes them and they look really nice in her bathrooms.
1.0	"Bummer, we wanted to be green friendly but this made our water taste worse. It tasted like water from a hose...very \\""plastic\\"" and dirty. Our tap water from the sink tastes better unfortunately. I hope they figure out what went wrong so we can try again. I applaud a company trying to save our environment."
5.0	Like a few customers, I just put the valve in and it dramatically improved hot water time to master bath.  Didn't even need the pump. Used to take 2 minutes to get hot water, now about 20 seconds. I think I'm going to use the pump on my rain barrel...
5.0	This is a great gun. I was able to spray Behr Premium Plus Ultra right out of the can using the 2.0 tip. Set the pressure around 30-35 psi and sprayed great.
1.0	IT is probably good paint based on the reviews, but I will never get to find out this time. I read the reviews and most of the negative reviews were for bad packaging. I decided to take a chance and order thinking it would not happen to me. Lo and behold, the paint arrived today. I should have guessed from the strong odor! When I opened the package there was spilled paint everywhere. You would think that shipper would have learnt from past mistakes, but they didn't, and really need to take a good note of this, as it could have ruined my expensive oriental rug, and who would be responsible for the clean up and replacement????  AMAZON please take note.
1.0	did not work was returned
5.0	My former desk lamp was medium size,but after ten years there was a short circuit somewhere in it.<br />I couldn't turn it on or off, my attendants would reach under the lampshade and do it for me.<br />It was time to get a new  lamp,so I looked on Amazon for an affordable little desk lamp.<br />I had not noticed the word &#34;touch&#34; in the description. I had noticed that Amaazon offered light bulbs,<br />so I bought those also. It's a good thing I did, because the lamp comes WITHOUT BULBS.<br />BUT it's better than I had expected because after you plug it in, you can just touch the base of the lamp,<br />and it comes on! It is perfect, for small cozy get togethers where not much light is required,<br />For example, a small apartment,or basement, or the cliche&#34; small booth in the the back&#34; to be romantic.<br />The light causes not glare on the television,that might interfere with watching sports,and because it's activaticted by<br />touching the base, you don't have to remove the lapmshade unless you choose to do it.<br />That's my favorite part. I can turn the lamp on and off without asking my attendants! It's sounds silly,<br />but to me,with my physically of not being able to stand or walk, I thank Jesus for anything and everything<br />my body can do, without asking for the help of other people,gives me a sense of accomplishment.<br />So, if you're looking for a small table lamp,for small get togethers, or intimate situations,<br />with 3 settings adjustable by touching the base. At an affordable price, that comes WITHOUT BULBS<br />(The bulbs are also sold by Amazon and  NOT expensive,) This may be the lamp for you as it for me.
5.0	Filter was a genuine Whirlpool product and was $15 less than my local Sears store. Great Product.
5.0	I love these lamps.  This is a replacement for one that I had for many years that finally died.  The light is just perfect for reading or typing.
5.0	As a teacher, I have the constant need to hang stuff. The custodians hate it when you use most types of hangers. Drilling holes in the cinderblock and such is frowned upon for some reason. Using heavy duty tape threatens the paint. So what's a guy to do?<br /><br />Use these things.<br /><br />Easy to deploy. Removes without damaging the wall surface. Sticks to a lot of stuff. And is ridiculously strong.<br /><br />I use their hooks, their poster hangers, and pretty much every type of 'commander' adhesive product. I use these to keep my hanging file organizer on the wall.
5.0	I bought this for my Dad, and I am sure that he is going to love it! Sturdy and a real space-saver! I like the way it folds, and you can store it easily! I am thinking of getting one for myself! It is quite on the heavy-side, but it has to be--to be able to carry more stuff!
5.0	I like these, but if you buy them make sure to get 2 packages. Most the smaller and larger raps don't go as fast leaving you short on the more popular sizes.
5.0	This Waterproofing spray is the best thing ever! it works so well! I would spend twice as much to get this than other waterproofing sprays, It is super easy to apply too, all you have to do is spray it on and then put your item in the dryer for 30-40 minutes. I just did this to my winter jacket and I feel like I could get in the shower with it on and all the water would bead off me. I highly recommend this product! A++++
5.0	This sink is beautifully hand-made.  The finish is lovely and it just gives such an eye-catching look to any bathroom with other suitable décor being used. We over-mounted ours because we wanted it to catch the eye rather than have it be less noticeable as an under-mount. One part of the rim of ours was slightly out of plane with the rest of the rim.  Placing it upside down on a sturdy table and giving a few taps with a rubber mallet straightened it right out.  It is a heavy, solid piece; gorgeous and understated.  It's easy to install but keep in mind a standard stock drain will not work because there's no &#34;neck&#34; under the drain hole such as you find with porcelain sinks.  You will have to rig your own &#34;neck&#34;, but it's easy to do.  I would buy this again....and again....and again.
5.0	its the best thing i have ever tried
5.0	perfect for use intended
1.0	We bought this, along with the branch decal for our baby's nursery. We got it specifically because the description said it was removable and reusable. We put it up in our apartment and when we bought a house we took it down and it ruined the paint!! We had to pay for a painter and new paint when we moved out. We also could not reuse it as the paint was on the decal and it was no longer sticky. We called and asked if they would replace it because it was false advertising to state that this was reusable and the company said they wouldn't! We had only used it for 6 months and it's our baby girl's room theme. Not impressed with the customer service and how it ruined our walls...
5.0	I have had the messy test kits where you have to add the drips of chemical.  This is like technology from the stone ages.<br />This product is nothing like those old kits.  It is very easy just dip it in and read your results with the key on the side of the bottle.  Very accurate.  My pool has been crystal clear all year because of these perfect test strips. Shipping was right on time!!
5.0	I feel like this is the best deal I've gotten on Amazon. This shower head is amazing and takes 5 minutes to set up without any tools. I love the settings and the water pressure feels great.
5.0	3M - stands for top quality.
5.0	I can not tell you how much I love my glass bottles! I have been using my Aquasana glass bottles for about 2 years now. They are amazing and super high quality. I've dropped them w/o breaking. Water tastes so much better in glass than metal or plastic. However I noticed that lots of my family won't switch to them b/c they are afraid of the glass. I also noticed that people think I'm drinking straight vodka all day long, With these plastic covers, my family are willing to use the glass & my co-workers no longer think I'm an alcoholic but a health nut who just went to the gym.
5.0	bought this disposer on other persons reviews,  not disappointed, easy to install, quiet operation, this one was given as gift to family member. they are very  pleased with product,  so pleased, i have purchased and installed one for ourselves. totally satisfied.i recommend the insinkerator  pro to anyone .  don
5.0	This is perfect if you want to prevent your children from accessing your firearm. Easy to use and steardy. I would recommend it if it's for this purpose.
5.0	We used these to 're-purpose' 2 Kitchen Cabinet doors - love them!!  Easy to install.
1.0	I received the product a MONTH LATE and I got brand new batteries to put in the power pack.  The product did not work at all.  I tried with new batteries and I made sure they were put in the correct way and it still did not work.  I got out my multimeter and I found that the power pack was only putting out about 20 volts AC, when at least 100 volts AC is required to make the wire glow.  I hooked the EL wire up to the wall outlet and it worked fine.  I would like it if the company can send me a replacement power pack so the product would work.
5.0	Works as described and looks great. No dimmer switch.
5.0	Very satisfied with order
5.0	Just what I expected. Arrived earlier than I expected.
5.0	I had one of the old Kwikset keyless entry locks on my front door, but decided to put this on my garage door.  Itlocks automatically and  don't have to worry about getting locked in the garage without my key.
5.0	just what I wanted it perfect for a loundry sink love it
5.0	Have not yet installed, but love the look. Seems to be very well built. Can't wait to have installed in my new kitchen.
5.0	Commodity product sold anywhere  just make sure it's always GE brand.
5.0	Works great for my son's garage door. Great price & quality.
5.0	love these bulb. They re on for days now and no problem .. . will  get more before they ran out
1.0	I had high hopes for these timers and figured &#34;hey, if one doesn't work I can just use the second one&#34;<br /><br />I didn't even consider that they both wouldn't work...<br /><br />They are very quiet, too quiet. I found out they were not working when my devices complained they were out of charge and/or turned themselves off.<br />To be fair, I have them cycling power every hour. They turned the power off just fine all the time but only turned the power on some of the time... mostly when I pushed the timer around to the correct time again.<br />I replaced these with the GE 15075.<br />I am happy with the replacement
5.0	This is an extremely useful tool and I recommend that all homeowners have one. I also like that the handle is plastic and very durable
5.0	Never installed a faucet before and this one is fairly easy to install.  Flushing the faucet after installation is a little tricky due to the tight space under the sink. Turning water on/off and cold/hot selection is friction less and effortless compare to the previous faucet. A little bump on the handle is enough to shut off the water.  Hope this one last for a long time.
5.0	Great lamps, bright white and reasonably priced. Fast shipping from Triangle Bulbs
5.0	This mounting bracket is for a standard spray arm kit for a dishwasher, such as whirlpool. This design does not require an extra bracket to stay put. There is an integrated clip that attaches to the rack to keep it in place. A very convenient design.
5.0	looks great, works great, great buy!
5.0	Works great with the Morris UC LED fixtures installed under all of the cabinets.
5.0	This is a handsome, functional kitchen faucet.  I love it.  The spray head works well and has a nice range.
5.0	The diffuser was sent very quickly and great for on or off camera flash's. Portrait photography is fun and this diffuser makes it 10 times funner
5.0	I needed a floor lamp for our cabin and couldn't seem to find the right one until I searched amazon. It was packaged very securely and was simple to put together.  It looks great in our cabin. The figures are very charming .  I've had many compliments on it, it looks more expensive than what I paid.
5.0	this is good  for a driver that can not leave he's antenna on the truck it works great
5.0	I very much enjoy the ease of having filtered water without hurting the environment with disposable plastic bottles. This filter is easy to install and easier to use. I highly recommend this product.
1.0	Worst piece of garbage. The battery cover does clip in when batteries are in. Batteries don't stay in. The arm detaches from the clip easily and makes the magnifying glass flop and hang down. The LED pops off very easily. The magnifying glass is even cheap and you have to get it at this absolutely perfect angle and distance to focus on what you're trying to magnify, making it completely impractical for anything but torching ants.

5.0	Fantastic, better than anticipated. I love this lamp.
1.0	sent it back...arrived mangled and bent
5.0	This is a fantastic chandelier.  I struggled with deciding on a chandelier over my dining table and am so happy that I went for this one.  We get compliments from every person that sees it.  Definitely a statement piece!
5.0	We got this stuff from a plumber four years ago and just recently ran out despite using it on a regular basis in our bathtubs. We bought some again and it works like a charm. I have long, thick hair and even though I clean the shower drain, stuff gets caught and my husband uses this after we take a shower and loosens up everything and clears the drain.
5.0	We needed a simple lock for our refrigerator. The first thing we had was a bike lock, but that had to wrap around the fridge handles too many times and was a pain.  This is exactly what we needed!  So glad I found it.
5.0	Waterproof for the rainy season, and one for the glove box.
5.0	Wow, It's like my washer is brand new.  I did this on my own without the special tool, I just used a hammer other parts to put in the bearings in.  The last step to seat the rubber seal worked fine with 1 1/2 inch PCV pipe and the good old hammer.  In hind-sight I wish I would  have bought the special tool and then put it on ebay or craigs list after I was done.  This fix looks quick, clean, and easy on the youtube videos, but it took me about 6 hours.  The first hour was lost because I have the cabrio platinum and the top releases differently from what every instruction or video shows.  The platinum opens by removing the 1/4 inch sheet metal screws at the top of the rear 'hinge' and then the top slides forward, then can be lifted up (no putty knife for the platinum).  I also removed the small plate that holds a tube and wires next a rear hinge just because it looked like it would help.
5.0	Worked well for a project repairing a metal fountain we have. I ended up using a popsicle stick to mix and apply. All went well and the application went on cleanly. So far, all is working.
5.0	Candles work beautifully! Did just what I wanted them to do.
5.0	Packed well and arrived in great shape, can't wait to use the item on my next trip.  Not sure when that will be, but wanted to be ready just in case.
1.0	The glass shade arrived broken.  It was shipped UPS in it's original American Standard box wrapped in one piece of thin bubble wrap.  The sconce, packed along side the shade, is a heavy piece. Which could have helped break glass. I immediately contacted Amazon about a return and was contacted by Absolute Bargain.  Who claimed they &#34;verified&#34; it was not broken before they sent it.  They opened up an investigation with UPS since I didn't want a replacement.  I didn't trust this would happen again because in my opinion Absolute Bargain should have shipped the box wrapped in more bubble wrap in another box to avoid this.  Especially if they &#34;verified&#34; the piece was not broken.  The bubble wrap supplied was not adequate.  UPS picked up the piece and  after several days and phone calls they decided I was at fault because they &#34;x-rayed&#34; the box at pickup and the box didn't show signs of damage.  So I either dropped it or opened the box wrong.  Not that box could have been dropped while shipped.  They don't X-Ray the box at delivery. So now I've paid $240 dollars for a broken product to a company who couldn't be bothered paying for some more bubble wrap to secure it.  Because UPS says I dropped it.  Which is funny since they state that since there was no damage to the box they couldn't have dropped it.  So I'm the moron who can't open a box.  And it gets better, I still not received my broken product back from UPS.  For all I know they returned to Absolute Bargain.
5.0	need this to replace a burnt out bulb for the lighting over my kiithen island.  Worked perfectly and the bulb came on time.  Couldn't find it in a store anywhere near my home.
5.0	I read about this item in my Family Handyman magazine as a recommended product. It does exactly what it claims -- using a mechanical release mechanism, it clamps your bits into itself until released by depressing the collar. It also speeds-up bit changes, as the Snappy stays chucked, and the bits can be changed in a matter of seconds. Recommended.
5.0	It was obvious why my oven quit working so I ordered this igniter, replaced it myself and saved a bunch of money over calling in the repair guy. Good instructions, fairly easy to install, been working perfectly ever since.
5.0	These brackets are a great replacement for top brackets.
5.0	It arrived as advertized in a timely manner.<br />it's a white granite under-mount sink, just like it was advertized to be.<br />It holds water and looks good.
5.0	These handles were just what I was looking for.  Classic lines that look good with Cherry Cabinets.  The nickel finish matches the stainless steel Appliances that I bought for the kitchen.
1.0	I thought it was a good deal at first.  It has a nice pattern and the selectable &#34;waterfall&#34; is great.  But after less than two months of light use, this thing split around the edges and shoots water out all over the place.  It's a total waste of money.  Unfortunately, you only get 30 days to return these things.
5.0	Best product you'll find for healing of hands & feet!
5.0	I REALLY LIKE THIS<br />THE COLOR OF THE LAMP<br />I REALLY LOVE IT<br />:)<br />IT'S PERFECT FOR MY ROOM :)
5.0	this charger really is useful because it fits just right in my laptop bag and when ever my phone dies I have a back up charger in my laptop bag...I travel a lot so I find it useful to have something like this.
5.0	Excellent quality and easy installation
1.0	Cheap, cheap, cheap! They wouldn't fly and were as thin as tissue paper! Several of them had holes.
1.0	I just got a new stainless steel Whirlpool Model GB9FHDXWS Bottom freezer fridge last week. I tried their soap and water suggestion in the manual but it just made a mess. I called Whirlpool and they told me about Affresh stainless steel cleaner. I came to my favorite place to confirm it worked Amazon and read the reviews. Then I went off to Best Buy and purchased a bottle and 2 micro cloths @ Kroger.<br /><br />I followed the instructions. One squirt on 1 cloth pass it over the fridge doors, let dry for 1 minute, than clean/buff with the 2nd cloth. Looked great but...(Play Jaws theme song here now).<br /><br />Today..I was looking at the fridge and it looked rusted! Grrr I inspected it closer and there are brown rust looking streaks/stains in the stainless steel..which I noticed is not really flat but has a lot of very small groves in the steel enhanced because of these brown rusty looking streaks.<br /><br />I freaked! I have been buffing my brains out going in the direction of the stainless and I'm exhausted. There is a yellow color coming off and it's on the cloth but it's impossible to get it all of the rusty stains out of those tiny grooves.<br /><br />I will have to call Whirlpool to ask them, what is going on..my new fridge because it looks rusted and is this a piece of defected stainless steel or did this product oxidize and leave behind this rust colored stuff in the grooves?<br /><br />So, I'm disappointed by this product and it looked at first to be the answer to keeping the door really clean but something has caused it to turn rusty looking and become impossible to get it out.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br />Whirlpool sent a repairman to check the fridge rust or whatever that substance is. He looked at it..tried to get it off and couldn't so, then he called the Whirlpool Technical Dept. What was their advice? They said I had to call CS and tell them to send me a bottle of Whirlpool Stainless Steel Brightener to fix the problem. When I get the product..and try to restore the stainless steel, I'll report back if it worked. The CS Rep sounded like she didn't believe this is the way Tech is choosing to solve this problem. I'm dubious as well.<br /><br />Well..received the bottle of Whirlpool Stainless Steel Brightener. Followed the directions...it made no improvement. I called Whirlpool and NOW they say it takes 3 weeks of apply product to fridge, wiping it off and buffing fridge to make an improvement.<br /><br />This is getting ridiculous. I have a warranty! I'll be back in 3 weeks to update.restore the stainless steel, I'll report back if it worked. The CS Rep sounded like she didn't believe this is the way Tech is choosing to solve this problem.

5.0	I am using these everywhere in the house.  They are so light you don't even see them on the mantle.  I have wrapped around a wreath and they look great.  I just bought a 3rd pair for a silk tree I have.
5.0	Great product and great price!
5.0	In fairness, the two florescent fixtures I placed these in were over 20 years old.  The lights in one worked fine, except for the constant HUM!  The other one only worked if you turned it on, and then got on a step ladder and twisted one of the bulbs off and back on.<br /><br />The instructions from Sylvania are a little sparse, but this isn't rocket science.  The single task that took the longest was finding the hex wrench size to unscrew the old ballasts.  (Actually, you could leave them in the fixture physically, after disconnecting electrically.)<br /><br />Otherwise, fast and easy.  The product includes new end clips, recommended for the no connection end (being LEDs, they only need power at one end, not both, as there isn't an arc of harmful UV-B rays coursing down the center of the tube.), but they are mechanically and electrically compatible with the existing clips (provided they are wired correctly).<br /><br />I had them both (two fixtures, with two bulbs) working within an hour of FexEx delivering them.  Electrically, they are 10 watt tubes replacing a 20 watt tube, so the electrical savings might not look that great; however, they are much quieter &#60;G&#62; and turn on much faster.<br /><br />One caveat, the bulbs only glow out of one side of the bulb.  The other half contains wiring.  This isn't an issue for fixtures that the clips hang straight down, but one of my fixtures has the clips on a 45° angle.  I don't consider this a problem in my situation, as the fixture is above a kitchen counter with a wall on the other side, and the wall doesn't need to be as bright as what I'm cooking.  Your situation may vary somewhat, if so, you should check the fixture prior to opening your wallet.
5.0	I have the Skylink security system installed in my house which works well but I purchased the additional wireless sensor for another door in my house which I had to secure. Worked as advertised out of the packaging.
5.0	Great...took less than 5 minutes to install over old BRK Fire Alarm.  The price was right.  What's not to like?
5.0	I was looking for a stool that had enough support for a heaver person. This stool fit my needs perfectly
5.0	I had purchased a starter light set about a year ago from Lowes.  The power pack fell apart, so I needed to find a basic replacement.  Unfortunately, any of the power packs for sale in the local big box stores were as expensive as buying a brand new starter kit (the starter kit has a very minimal wattage, but works fine for my needs).  Anyway, this was the cheapest one I could get my hands on.  Installed in minutes, works as expected.  The only interesting thing is that the box does not say Malibu on it anywhere. It's got Intermatic on the box - I'm assuming they are the same company, but still was a surprise.
5.0	I have a dark area of the shop the ceiling is 25 feet hi. After installing this LED light it looks great and bright.
5.0	First set was not packaged well and came broken.  Second set was packaged well and all came in fine shape.
5.0	My wife loved it!!!!  She won't use paper again.
5.0	Worked great on the old grout.
5.0	By far the best flashlight ever!  It has a very sturdy case and it is the brightest flashlight I have ever owned.  The zoom feature allows you to see clearly for what seems like a mile.  It is a nice size and easy to grip.  I was so impressed I bought some for Christmas gifts.
1.0	The lights one by one made a pop sound and when we looked at the battery they seemed to have ruptured. The lights still didn't work after replacing new batteries.
1.0	Looks cheap, dented on one side and very small.
1.0	Mine doesnt work. :( I must return it now.
5.0	This flashlight is awesome. It really lights up the room, but the BEST part is watching our cats try to catch the laser light. We had one and my husband gave it to our son hesitantly. I rewarded his generosity by finding him a new one.
5.0	Works as it should perfect set for a few small jobs
5.0	This works fine in my Hydrotech 12401 Reverse Osmosis system. A complete Replacement Parts and installation manual was available online.
5.0	Love the flexibility of this product. The original was a faux metal (plastic) and was had to manipulate. Do yourself a favor and spend the extra bucks on this product, you're worth it!
5.0	Took this from the local Chucky Cheeses, i left the flush valve there because it wouldn't come out of the wall. Fortunately the toilet did and now i have the coolest lawn chair on the block. If only you guys could see the looks of envy my neighbors give me when they see me sitting on this throne in the middle of my yard, they are so jealous.
5.0	THIS ITEM WAS THE REAL DEAL, NOT A CHEAP SUBSTITUTE/REPLACEMENT.  THEY COST A BIT MORE THAN WHAT YOU WOULD EXPECT BUT THE LAMP THEY ARE USED IN IS ALSO AN EXPENSIVE, BUT VERY EFFECTIVE AND BEAUTIFUL LIGHTING DEVICE!  FOR SOME THINGS IT JUST ISN'T WORTH THE TROUBLE TO FIND A 'CHEAP' REPLACEMENT!  I'LL BE ORDERING MORE OF THESE BECAUSE THEY ARE DIFFICULT TO FIND AND I LIKE TO HAVE AN EXTRA ON HAND FOR WHEN IT MAY BE NEEDED.
5.0	Thin (fits in the space under a typical upper cabinet). Solid (the product feels good, good weight, aluminum body, and a nice thick power chord). Easy (mounted with a couple of machine screws directly under my cabinets).<br /><br />I cut the head of the chord off, and shortened it considerably. I hard-wired this fixture into a j-box which I had provided specifically for my LED circuit, then mounted this driver under the cabinets, and took the LEDs straight from this power supply. They burn consistently, and the driver never gets hot.<br /><br />Very clean, and professional looking installation. Great transformer.<br /><br />Note, the A/C wires of this transformer are color coded per EU, so you will have to look up the brown/blue/green conversion to red/black/bare. That is, if you cut the head of the power chord off...
5.0	After looking at the GE website and seeing they were charging $55 for this screen, I looked on the internet.  I got it for $5.87.  Quite a difference!  Very fast shipping.  Great site!  Will look there for any replacement parts I need for appliances!
5.0	Great seller, great product.
5.0	Great fast shipping .... works awesome...... was a super present ..... my spouse loves it ...... the colors look more amazing like the . Pic I would buy it again
5.0	This is a pretty cool little gadget.  I use it for measuring the current wattage that a device is using, plus it will total up the KwH used, so you can use this number to directly compute how much the device you are measuring will cost you.  You can get the $/KwH from your electric bill.
5.0	These look great on our daughters new desk we painted. the screws were to long but its no big deal to get smaller ones. i really like the round look to them and will hold up well! Even better is the cost!
5.0	My husband was convinced he could fix our non-working expensive front loader without calling a service repair man.<br />He ordered the part, and we had it within a couple of days - YAY for Prime membership.<br />He pulled it out of the box and within 1/2 hour, my washer was back to work.<br />It is the genuine part and a great price.<br />Simply perfect.
5.0	Installed 2 of these fans, one in each smaller bedroom.  They blend into the white ceiling and are barely noticeable, if you want that sort of thing.  So quiet compared to my old fans.
5.0	You must purchase the valve and drain assembly with the handles to install it. It went together in a very short time.  The problem was with removing the old valves and handles which required cutting them off with a Dremel grinding wheel.  I hope that when it comes time to remove these, they can be removed easily.  I put anti-sieze compound on the threads (available at an auto parts store) which might help. Probably ought to keep it off the finished surfaces to prevent their corrosion (which I did). Only time will tell however.
5.0	These Lightvita LED 6w Light Bulbs were perfect for my track lighting.  I'll save on my electric bill which I am so excited about!!  They are eco friendly!!  They are bright and give better lighting.  They have a very long life span.  They are great to illuminate art work you want to display.  You get 10 in a pack.  They contain no mercury or lead.  I did receive these at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion.  This review is a 100% my own opinion and I was not compensated in any way.  I do recommend these lights.
5.0	I ordered 2 of these mail boxes 1 for me & 1 for the neighbors. We've had it now for about 1 1/2yrs. It is still in great shape. Nice when we go on trips, we just lift up the bottom & when the mail gets delivered it drops to the bottom & we don't have to worry about any one taking our mail. Even got my mom to get one just a couple of months ago. I would recommend this to everyone.
5.0	I would recommend this article to my friendships very good product
5.0	I'm so glad I bought this light. It lights up my desk perfectly and the light is bright so I can see. I've had one like this before and they last a while and are good lights.
5.0	Gave this as a gift and my husband loved it.
5.0	"Bought a Kenmore counter top based on Consumer Reports (approx 3 yrs ago).  This filter does even more!  If anyone wants to know how to convert the original plastic and expensive ($45 plus) facet converter, that keeps breaking, to a metal one that doesn't break and lasts years and years check out multipure replacement parts (less than $10 and they're compatible for the filter/casing that I own, anyway).  I digress...   I think this filter is great, does far more than the original, lasts longer and it's made in (you get it). Oh, yea, I forgot to mention that we haven't \\""vinegar'd\\"" our coffee maker for at least two years and the coffee tastes great, no bitter at all.  Before had to clean it every three months or so.  Tells you the filters working"
5.0	Came  quickly.  Light weight and I was able to easily pack it for my AVON 39 Breast Cancer Walk in San Francisco.  I used two strings to decorate my tent at our basecamp.  Everyone thanked us for the stars that led them back to their tent in a sea of pink tents.
1.0	BEWARE...if you order what you see pictured above identified as DPK00000, it is not what Amazon will be sending you. The item pictured above is a different and more expensive post kit (#DPKX0000).  The item I received is pictured in the small thumbnail image below on the right.  False advertising on the part of Amazon's product source and a pain in the ___ to rectify.
5.0	This kit is fantastic. Plumber installed without issue.  Water flow is a bit strong coming out of the tub spout, but we just adjusted our water pressure to fix that issue.
5.0	Great grip surface.  These are important additions for any bath area.  Looks good too.
5.0	Very Happy with this product.
5.0	It's awesome. Installation was 30 minutes. It's been absolutely worth the money.
5.0	This was installed in minutes and works exactly how I hoped.  It really couldn't have been easier, get to the existing doorbell, connect 3 wires, put batteries in the chime part and hang that up.  It's also really loud, so I'm not sure if people who were complaining about that need to hear it from further away or something, but it's plenty loud for what I need.  Very happy with this purchase.
5.0	These were very nice faucets. I replaced 2 old units in my bathrooms. They were over 20 years old. It was time. I am glad I chose these. I did the pluming myself and everything was a breeze. I have better than novice plumber skills. The old units were moderately hard to take off but after removing old faucets and old drains and water hoses. Units went on very easy. Nickel finish is a nice touch. Price was fair too. Shipment arrived before I expected.
5.0	Our GE Refrigerator model GSS23WGTA WW came with our house.  The water dispenser has always been super, super slow and it would take several minutes to fill.  I changed the filter several times and checked the water pressure and everything was fine.  The water pressure was strong from the waterline valve to the refrigerator .  I went online and did some troubleshooting steps and it pointed to the water valve.  IT WAS NOT THE WATER VALVE!!  Over time the water filter assembly wears out and doesn't allow water to flow.  After replacing the water filter assembly and connecting it all back up the water flows like Niagara Falls.<br />Now I am the manly hero of the house, at least for the day!!
5.0	We  previously had to run the kitchen sink water for a long time to get the water hot.  Very wasteful and time consuming.  I installed the Ariston 2 1/2 gallon Point of Use Indoor Electric Mini Tank Water Heater very easily.  Now, the water comes on very warm and is hot almost instantaneously.  A big improvement plus saving a lot of water.
5.0	When I finally tested the flashlight and the performance was less than I had expected, they bent over backwards to make me happy, without my asking for it!  These are good people to do business with.
1.0	Didn't work for me, I bought this one to add my wife presence sensor, tried to re sync / un pair to my hub but still it is not detecting my wife sensor. Moreover this is made out of cheap plastic so opening is very difficult and if you try it, it will break the lock that make it to close tight.
5.0	My son loves this product. Very simple to use and very fun. Makes going to bed using a night light much cooler and easier.
5.0	dark entry and hallway for our apt, and no light switch.  fixed remote control to the wall and set these up with multiple lamps, made life so much easier.  up and running (after really quick set up) for a few weeks.  no trouble whatsoever, just happy somebody created these little gadgets.
5.0	For the money, these were pretty easy, have lasted for at least a month now, and are great for the floors.
5.0	Love it!! It puts the light where I need it..  Even tho the bulb is cool I don't keep it close because the housing does put off heat. It has a  nice long cord.
5.0	Love it. Best $4 I ever spent I can't believe they can sell them so cheap
5.0	This is such an awesome, and affordable product.  I use it to let me know when people come into the place I work.
1.0	These came damaged and chipped. You could clearly see they were painted black over silver. Do not waste your cash!
5.0	Worked as described. A good safety device against sewer water backing up into fresh water. The flapper inside keeps any sewer water from going any futher, causing a seal. Has a threaded cap for inspecting, and making sure it's working properly. It's good insurance for keeping your fresh water fresh, keeping it from any contamination.
5.0	Works well just as anticipated
5.0	Works like a champ!  Simple replacement to make all my lights LED at a fraction of the LED fixture price at the big box stores.
5.0	I use the tensor modelFS125 on top of the elevated back of my computer desk. The quality is excellent with relatively low wattage. I would purchase another if they were available.
5.0	love the stuff! great price,quality and quantity. My favorite gauge and a great seller with good customer service.
5.0	I have a rental that I didn't have time to purchase shades for before the tenant arrived. They are easy to install, and they do block the light. I am hoping they will last for the summer... so far so good.
5.0	I use these for my kids night lights, after reading dim red light is the best for not disturbing sleep by interfering with melatonin production, as bright lights which include the blue spectrum do.  They are pretty dim, but that's how a nightlight should be. Once your eyes adjust, you can see well enough to get around the room.
5.0	I install this panel all the time and love everything about it. I have the software to program it locally or from my desk. I'm available for a small fee to program your system remotely. You can contact me initially by email at totaltechnologies(at)live.com
5.0	I cannot paint my wall and this design was perfect.  I placed the design on the wall above my bed.  Now I can be under a cherry blossom tree all year round.
5.0	The filters fit into my fridge. They are OEM parts and work perfect. Before changing, my fridge's water dispenser was slow. Now its fast. Filters work great!
5.0	Works great - easy to install and use.  I have a small apartment with a small washer/dryer, plus I'm at the beach and have a wet suit.  I can hang any clothes I need, then retract the cord when it's not needed.  It's EXACTLY what I wanted.
5.0	Just put in hardwood floors and used these on all our furniture.  Ordered different sizes and shapes.  Great product!
5.0	This system is the best priced RO System money can buy hands down! I use it for my coral reef tank and my family and I use it for everyday use and drinking. It took our tds from 390 to 12. Took less than one hour to install and faucet was nice too. I looked at other ro systems triple the price with same results as this one but with no extra filters included. Buy this system for whatever your needs are with ro water and you can't beat it!!! I would buy it 100 times over...
1.0	"Gatco's website states that their offices & distribution centre is in the San Francisco California area. The product is made in TAIWAN with a \\""Lifetime functional guarantee against material defects and a 5 - year limited finish guarantee.\\""<br />THIS IS WHAT YOU PAY FOR!!!!!!.......YOU BE THE JUDGE."
5.0	I don't know why there are so many negative reviews about this product. To me, it's a champ. Easy installation and operation, what more can you ask for? I was able to get it set up runnning in less than an hours. Plus the iphone app works great. Thanks to the tips provided by other reviewers, I don't need to type in my password each time I open my garage door with my phone.
5.0	Works well no wires hook up to my controller
5.0	love these better than I expected!
5.0	This shure makes life easy . Sturdy desine. Not to much modifcation. Little tricky to program but best bang for the buck. Nice to have if you forget the house key. They get past this theyll run into something they wished theyd ast on anyway,
5.0	I purchased a replacement flurorescent light from a hardware store.  It had the proper specifications, but surprisingly did not work in my table lamp, so I returned it.  This one ordered on line works perfectly!
5.0	Question for seller<br />If the other switch connected with this one is a switch with on/off, will the sensor work to auto shutoff after vacancy (example 3 min) no matter what the other switch is set to? Off or on?<br /><br />Thanks for clarifying
5.0	I use my desk light for a verity of functions including painting and drawing. This lamp makes it easy to switching from a bright light that is great for painting to a dimmer light perfect for bedtime reading. This lamp was very easy to move around as need, which with larger canvases was often. I will never own a bulky heavy lamp again.<br /><br />I often found myself brushing against the touch screen and changing the settings; it is that sensitive. I moved it to the other side of my desk and the problem was solved. I often over extend the arm to reach off the desk and over my couch when I read, it gets a little wobbly in this position, but not bad. I love the warm yellow glow of the reading lamp after a day of harsh cool light from a computer monitor the warm color is nice.<br /><br />The brightness is a life saver if you wake up in the middle of the night; or afternoon if you have a hangover! It is also useful in the early evening when you need a little light but don't want to waste electric yet.<br /><br />I have two of these, one in my bed room another in the living room. The touch screen is amazing even after heavy use and one trip to the floor (I own cats!) it still works beautifully.
5.0	Perfect design with no visible screws. Looks very sleek and fits perfectly. Very durable. A+
5.0	This is a nice metal cabinet, that fits between the studs of a wall.  its all metal, and has a 3 point lock. But Its not a safe, but will keep kids out, and slow down someone trying to get at your stuff.<br /><br />I had to screw a 2x4 to the stud on one side to secure it, (screwed through the sides).  but no biggie.<br /><br />-mine arrived without damage.  1/2 stryofoam  and cardboard all around.
5.0	This is one of the top rated smoke detector by Consumer Report - has both ionization and photoelectric sensors.  What makes it THE best is it is easy to disarm once it goes off, unlike the other brand.  Surprisingly easy to install.
5.0	I have absolutely no idea whether there are any health benefits to this lamp. All I know is that it's beautiful and I love just looking at it. I just ordered three more as gifts.
5.0	This is a fantastic product. It's very compact so it works well in my tiny apartment sink - it fits right on the sink top at the back. As for the people who complained that the knob broke off, or the filter not lasting, I don't understand that. As with anything if you treat with care, it works perfectly. It is very sturdy and high quality. The instructions specifically warns NOT TO RUN HOT WATER THROUGH IT, or it will ruin the filter if you do it regularly. It is super easy to install (I only finger tightened it on the faucet) and use. Water tastes great. Much less effort than opening the refrigerator for the filter pitcher, and exponential more protection against harmful stuff in tap water. I am exceedingly pleased with this purchase.
1.0	While the design and finish of this are very beautiful, the construction makes it a waste of time and money.  Attached to the flusher handle is a plastic screw with a nut to secure it to the tank.  Then, the flusher arm is a contraption that is very adjustable, allowing you to accommodate any size tank with the turn of a screw, and that is held in place with another nut.  There are &#34;gears&#34; (for lack of a better word) that are supposed to move the flusher arm when the handle turns.  The trouble is, this entire apparatus (except for the handle itself) is made of plastic.  I tried this on my toilet and the first flush was fine; the second or third were iffy, and by the fourth or fifth flush, the plastic &#34;gears&#34; had stripped out to the point that pushing the handle had no effect at all on the flusher arm.  I will be returning this and will have to go to an actual plumbing supply store to get what I really need.
5.0	Have owned and used an older model of this flashlight for a number of years.  This has been one of the most dependable lights I've ever owned.  It has been dropped on concrete floors and generally abused many times and has never failed to function.  I've used it as an emergency light for power failures for at least 5 years.  I would highly recommend this product, it's inexpensive, completely dependable, and it is one tough light!
5.0	Love, love, love!!! Our kid loves these so much!  They are very life like and stick on the walls without any problems.  Bought cherry creek decals too along with these and have been having trouble keeping them stuck to the wall...Very happy with product though and would definitely buy more in the future.
5.0	It's a simple fuse for a simple purpose. The Thermal Fuses work. What more could we ask? You can find the instructions on YouTube, step by step. My local appliance guy wanted $20 for the same fuse.
5.0	We recently bought an old home with large floor register openings. Had to replace one in the hallway and considered wrought iron but they were really expensive and since everything in the house has been updated we weren't as concerned that the vent had the more tradiditional ornate look. We were mostly concerned with it being sturdy enough that our kids could walk on it and not fall through, which it is.<br />Overall this has been a great value for us. The price was great, the size was exactly what we needed (which was really hard to find) and the construction seems really sturdy so we aren't worried about people walking on it.
5.0	When I ordered this decal, I was kind of worried. I didn't think it was going to be big enough for where I wanted to put it and what not. When I got my order, I was very satisfied! Its big enough for where I am putting it (above my king sized bed), AND you also get a smaller version in the package. I love this two toned wall decal and I know others will too!!
5.0	I love incense, I've tried many kinds, including Bosen's, and this one is by far my favorite. It lifts my mood like no other. Great for meditation.
1.0	The charger was defective: it did not charge the battery and it got very hot. This could have been a fire hazard.
5.0	Whirlpool. 4396841<br />Just what I needed-- shipped quickly and well packed!the water filter was much more reasonably priced here than other places.
5.0	Perfect fit and not that hard to change even by myself. Good price and it does what it is supposed to do
5.0	Moved into our house and had to manually open the garage door since we didn't have the openers. Saw this product and ordered it. A note is that you should have the exact model and serial number of the lift unit to make sure you order a transmitter with the correct frequency. This unit took about 3 minutes to program to the lift unit and has worked as promised to date.
1.0	Despite the thicker gauge and promises of being made in the USA, this wire is not durable or well made at all. After only a couple months of use, the neutral connection at the receiving end is weak, and it started arcing and fried up. Meanwhile, the super cheap $8 home depot (albeit thinner gauge) extension soldiers on for years.<br /><br />EDIT: Sent back to manufacturer in NJ for replacement. Almost two months later, still waiting for replacement.<br /><br />EDIT 2: 2013-12-09 I called them twice within the last couple months to inquire about my warranty. They finally called me back several weeks ago (possibly a month) saying they would send me two replacements. (I bought 3, 2 went bad). Still haven't received the replacements. Warranty process is a joke.
5.0	I like it because looks beautiful. It matches with my shower and doesn't splash everywhere. I bought it because I know it is Delta.
5.0	Amazon comes through again. Instead of needing to buy the whole bath fan/light/heater unit, they have this part to fix just the problem heater.<br /><br />There was always a question about what the unit looks like and does it have a plug. So I am posting a picture of the heater to show that yes it does have the plug. Also, this unit has now a breaker type fuse which will reset itself rather than blowing and completely disabling the heater forever (like mine did)
5.0	Great price, fast delivery, exactly as described.
5.0	Finger print reader is very accurate, can fit two small pistols tightly. Mechanism does make some noise when it opens but opens quickly. Very heavy and well built, appears tamper proof. I would buy again if I needed another.
5.0	super white bright light.  well worth the money
5.0	This little nightlight is awesome.  Here are the things I love about it:<br /><br />1) It doesn't actually attach to the base.  It charges just by sitting over the base, which makes it easy even for toddlers to remove and replace.<br />2) It gives off a very powerful glow, but not enough to keep anyone awake.<br />3) It can be removed from the base and carried around, so if your little guy wants to take it to bed or on a late-night potty trip, it's ready for the journey.<br />4) It's very durable.<br />5) It doesn't heat up.<br />6) It just looks cool!<br /><br />My sister bought this as a gift for one of my sons, and my only complaint is that she didn't buy more, because now my other son and daughter each want one, too!  It may seem a little pricey for a nightlight, but I would still definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a durable, stylish, and practical nightlight for a little guy (or gal) who's not yet ready to brave a full night in the dark.  It also makes a very cool and unique gift.
5.0	Very good product for the price. We also ordered a remote for it, which fit inside fine and works perfectly. The fan is quiet and does not wobble as some cheaper ones do.<br /><br />I would recommend this product highly.
5.0	I've been using this type of filter for almost 2 years. They work great and it makes my pipe water drinkable! without a funky taste or smell.
1.0	Bought two. One blew out in the first week and took two months to replace. The second lasted an amazing two months. The mfg. won't replace. I'm going to purchase my own ballast and replace itself. Don't think of buying these if you have ANY other choices or you have no plans to hook it up and use it.
5.0	Bulbs are individually packaged in carton shown.  I have bought many of these bulbs at Home Depot, Lowes and Orchard Supply.  I have paid from $3.99 to $5.99 for one - two bulbs.  You do the math.  Retail stores make lots of money on this type commodity.  Bulbs are just as bright as the higher priced retail versions.  So far, none have burned out.  If you are having trouble with short life, check transformer and make sure you are wired to proper voltage.  Many of the 120-12 volt transformers have multiple voltage taps on secondary for short an long wire runs.  Connect to 11 volts and life of bulb increases dramatically if you only have short wire runs with proper gauge wire.
1.0	"These eat batteries, despite the fact that they are hard-wired!<br /><br />If you buy this brand, plan to be experiencing \\""replace battery\\"" alarms every six weeks or so. Needless to say, there is no clock in the detector so if yours are like mine, you will usually awoken at 3am by a loud alarm, followed by a voice saying \\""replace battery\\"". Btw... I'm using 9v Energizers. The cheapo batterie that came with the detectors (I bought six of them) lasted about two weeks"
5.0	Nice bright light. I would not hesitate buying again.
5.0	Found the price for this item very attractive compared to that of the OEM and decided to purchase. I am very satisfied with this decision. Will recommend this item to anyone.
5.0	Great stuff .... it has always worked for us
5.0	This system is perfect for protecting your family and valuables. Installation and setup was fast and simple. The monitoring service is very responsive, secure and the call center personal have been courteous and professional. Alert via email and text are instant providing exact detail about arming, disarming, sensor errors and triggers. I highly recommend this system and monitoring service for any one looking to get into their first system or replacing their existing system. You can customize the system to fit the needs based on your homes.
5.0	Really useful. Love having the two outlets. Quite a lot of light.
1.0	One string worked great one did not.  Both strings actualy worked but one of the plugs was faulty! Bad QC gets one star. Sorry
5.0	Did not regret that I bought this kind of mattresses, very good and I would recommend it for those who wish.
5.0	Nice flat piece of project plywood. Would recommend.
5.0	I got this as a replacement of a Moen handheld shower head.  It is longer than the one that came with the unit and since we have a larger than normal shower, this is perfect. It is very lightweight and is very flexible.
1.0	The seat is fine but the design of the bolts to fasten it to the stool is incomprehensible.  I suppose they thought it was a better design than the usual standard nut & bolt but it isn't.  It is a terrible and confusing design.  I still haven't figured it out and will probably just throw the damn thing out!
5.0	I love antique light fixtues and some of mine are porcelain where the light bulb is exposed as part of the fixture.  These bulbs add a crystal finished look that is gorgeous.  I love them!
5.0	"I received my faucets in good time.  They are not installed yet.  We get a handyman to come over to the house for a whole day which is a discounted fee and we save money.  I have not inspected the faucets or even opened the box.  As soon as I have enough work for my \\""plummer-electrician\\"" I will let you know how they work."
1.0	Product arrived with badly defective attachment between hose and threaded part that hand sprayer connects to.  Should never have passed quality inspection.
1.0	The color is not changing!!!!!!
5.0	Great for my green (DC) bathroom exhaust fans.  The non-neutral version of the timer didn't work with those, which cycles the DC fans on and off.
5.0	"At first I was skeptical about the product, thinking \\""You get what you pay for\\"", but after purchasing the product, Installing myself and later running it, I gotta say that this is an amazing product for the price I paid. Installation was a breeze. It's been a month now and the product works great. No problems with shipping. I will recommend / buy this product again if need be."
5.0	This LED solar-powered light is now positioned where it can receive full sun during the day, yet be unobtrusive in our yard while it lights the front walk at night.  We’ve moved it several time to find the perfect spot and find it now perfect for our needs.  So far, the light lasts only a couple of hours, but after a few days in full sun, I expect it to last much longer.<br /><br />It is constructed of hard plastic.  How long will it last in harsh Texas conditions?  Only time will tell, and I will update this review when and if it fails. The LED lights are expected to last 50,000 hours, much longer than the case, I imagine.<br /><br />Overall, this is a good way to add light at night without adding power cords that can be hazardous at night.  I am quite pleased with this addition to our landscape.<br /><br />FOUR STARS!<br /><br />Sample provided for review
5.0	"We used these to replace another type of secondary window lock. I like these much better, as they feel much more secure and I have less concerns about leaving my windows open in a \\""vent\\"" position overnight. Good buy."
1.0	When I first hooked it up, the timer would randomly lose track of time.  During an average 24 hour period, the clock would skew 3 hours in one direction or the other.<br /><br />Finally, after a month or so, the product straight up failed.  Display shows nothing, plugging devices into it has no effect, and none of the buttons are functional.  Total loss.
5.0	Hubby finds it very useful.
5.0	No surprises here, this is a standard orange extension cord.  Have used for a couple months with no problems.
5.0	good quality, good price
5.0	To my non-expert eyes, this is more like a 60W incandescent bulb.<br />Overall, I like it. But it may not be perfect if you are looking for about 40W equivalent.
5.0	Super easy to use and works well.  Tested out all my family members home and after I installed a water filter from amazon.
1.0	The previous reviewer is right.  I bought the bright effects equivalent of a 60 watt halogen bulb - a two pack.  Both bulbs died within 6 months.  I thought it was a fluke. I bought another pack (shame on me) and the same thing happened.  These bulbs are junk.  If you search for a Bright Effects website to complain, you won't find one.  I'm going to return them to Lowes, but I don't expect they will give me a refund - no receipt.  Who keeps a receipt for lightbulbs???  Total rip-off!
5.0	Burns 24/7 in a bath exhaust unit.  Provides enough light for a midnight date with the facility. 3 more words required
5.0	The seat arrived on time, was exactly what was promised and what I expected.  Ten minutes later I had installed it and voila, another home project is finished.
5.0	I read every review before purchasing this lamp. I have dogs and use an ionizer which is big and ugly so I thought this may be a good solution and its pretty.<br />Well, no matter what they say it does. I have one in my bedroom and leave it on low at least 15 hours a day. It does not overheat, it does not drip water as some have stated, it has stayed exactly the same as the day I bought it. I placed it on a ceramic coaster as recommended but no issues. We do not have high humidity so that may be a reason it stays dry.<br />I purchased another for my family room and am super pleased. I don't smell anything as I do with the huge ionizer (produces a fresh rain smell) but I don't smell the dogs either. I am sleeping so much better. At one point I was to go for a sleep apnea test but since having the lamp on all night I wake up more refreshed. I know they say there is no proof the lamps freshen the air but I truly believe they do.<br />OK on the con side. I turned the lamp up high and after a few hours found it got pretty hot. So I turned it down again and it cooled right down and stayed cool.<br />I ordered a second one that would not come on but once I jiggled the bulb it has been fine. Not one is the same as the other , shape and colour is different so each lamp is unique. I ordered one for a Christmas present for a friend of mine as she has 4 dogs. She loves it. The ambiance of the orange glow, the natural product is made from, and the way it freshens the air you cant lose.<br />Buy it.
5.0	The real question is: what is the best feature of this.  It has a rocker switch to turn off power, 4 outlets so I can plug in multiple tools, and it rolls up super easy.  Really just a great product at a great price.
1.0	Had it for about 5 years and used it only a few times over the years mainly to clean floors. Nothing heavy duty... Started to overheat to the point the handle was too hot to hold. Called customer service and they said it's probably the thermostat - would cost more to repair than to purchase a new one. I'll purchase a new one... from another manufacturer...
1.0	Stopped working after a week
5.0	Easily installed, good choice for a bedside lockbox. It will keep kids and other casual unauthorized users from handling the firearm, but still allows for easy quick access.
5.0	worked perfectly, cost effective, adds new life to old dryer for a few more years
5.0	Loved this lamp so much , bought 3 more .... GREAT PRICE  !!!  Told family and friends also they bought from this outfit
5.0	Seriously, I had to tell everyone about this toilet.  The owner of my company then bought 5 of them to replace all the toilets in her house after trying one on my recommendation.  She said this is the only toilet that could handle the &#34;boys room&#34; which is shared by 3 teenage boys.  We like this toilet because the flush is quick and efficient, and because the dimensions are very compact while still providing an elongated bowl.  We have a very tight legroom space in front of the toilet, and this one was a great fit to replace a round bowl two piece.  It looks good, and works great.
5.0	Works very well in combination with the Venstar T5800.  Very easy to set up and the Skyport software has been reliable. Well worth the money and is an essential accessory.  My only recommendation would be for Venstar to add the wifi chip to the motherboard leaving the usb port open.
5.0	Love the soft water feel.
5.0	Works great. Plenty of light. Reasonable price.
5.0	Gotta remove the flow regulator and this thing is amazing. very good weight to it an quality!<br /><br />Plus in the packaging they included a decent amount of plumbers tape!
5.0	Makes it easy to remove scotch tape from a painted trim, even old tape.  I just wipe off with paper towel, let dry then prime/paint.
1.0	As soon as the plastic came off the product, the bottom fell off. Im going to reglue it back on, but it just pisses a person off to buy something new and recieve it broke!
5.0	I bought the Leviton plug first. (It looks very similar to the Cooper) and found that the design was very poor. First the screws to attach the wires almost touched when tightened. I was afraid at 240 volts that there would be some arcing of the current. Second the ground screw stripped. Third the main cable clamp where the cord enters the plug at the base was not well designed and either was too loose or when you flipped the plastic insert, was too tight and crushed the cable.<br />OK - then I purchased the Cooper brand plug (What a Difference!) The wire contacts are more of a Phoenix connector type with no protruding screw end which leaves ample space between conductors, and they can be tightened securely and exert even pressure on the wire. The main cable clamp is fully adjustable and allows you to clamp the cable securely without crushing the cable. The Cooper design is excellent.<br />Also - Thanks to Amazon for how easy it was to return the inferior Leviton plug.
5.0	It really is simple; good video. Helpful staff when we called with a question.
5.0	I just bought a pack of three. The quality looks good from the outside, it fit perfectly into my Samsung refrigerator, and the purified water tastes every bit as good as with the original Samsung filter. It seems to be a fine substitute.
5.0	It's exactly what was needed.  Didn't want plastic, but one with some weight.
5.0	I replaced an old mechanical thermostat that quit working. This new digital t-stat works great, especially the preset day and night settings which makes it really easy to use, since we don't need auto setback or timer settings, though we also purchased the programmable model for another room and it also works great.
5.0	I love this piece. I ended up cutting it down the middle to separate the top and bottom to place it how I wanted it and it was easy to apply.
5.0	"this is a good quality shower arm. i am 6\\"" tall and was sick and tired of bending over to wash my hair. now with this shower arm the shower head is raised up by over a foot. very nice!"
5.0	We have ordered these before and they work great!
5.0	Direct replacement half the price!
5.0	Nite Ize makes a great product and this product falls right in line with what I have come to expect from Nite Ize.
5.0	Fast delivery and worked great.
5.0	This literally took less than 5 minutes to program. Great product. Easy to use and well designed.
1.0	"Purchased because in description details, it is called a 3\\"" size.  When my 2004BP arrived, I was very disappointed to see it is actually for 2\\"" size hole.  So, Amazon is sending a 3\\"" version, although I am skeptical it will be any different.  I asked them for the link to the 3\\"" version, and they sent me to this exact page (for the 2004BP 2\\"" flapper.)<br /><br />The item looks like it would be fine, but,<br />I will rate with one star (required) until the right item arrives and is actually installed and tested."
5.0	Much better than I expected.  Really moves the air.  Works very well in our Great Room!
5.0	I'm super impressed with this bulb.  To begin, the light it produces is really nice.  Seemingly better than incandescent.<br /><br />I've replaced a 3 way 60 watt incandescent bulb with this 10w TCP LED bulb.  It definitely does dim just fine and again, it throws off a very nice light.  And even though it only uses 10 watts of electricity, it is as bright as the 60 watt bulb that it replaced.<br /><br />Amazingly, this thing is supposed to last something like 23 years and has a 3 year warranty.  It's a great way to save on electricity, likely save on replacement bulbs, and improve the look of your lighting at the same time.<br /><br />Terrific bulb!  5 stars!
5.0	I really like these lamps. I really think my dust has cut down alot.  I have had no sneezing since I've had these. I don't  know if this is what they do.
5.0	A very good product at a price i was willing to pay... who could expect more?
5.0	they look great, good price.  Out of 42 of them, only one had surface blemishes.<br />The screws were all the same length.<br />They fit perfectly into the space left by my old brass ones.
5.0	I think these are great - got black and white to do a checkerboard theme on the bathroom floor.  It's only been a few weeks so I'm not sure how they wear and tear.  For the low cost of this product I am impressed with the quality.
5.0	Very good quality and delivery was very prompt.
1.0	Really? Can't American Standard produce a product that works?  The mechanism in the tank was flawed and didn't work, the product came soiled, and on the inside of the tank there was a chip out of the top edge.  Where is the quality control?  This is the last Am.St. product I buy.
5.0	This is what I needed for my glass solar lights. It was perfect. They look new again.
1.0	The magnets are in 2 piece plastic boxes which are snapped together around the screen. They fall off ! Half a dozen have fallen off so far, plus there are 2 more on the ground right now. I tried to snap them back in place, but even with the addition of glue, they don't stay on. Magna Mesh is the cheapest screen for a good reason!
5.0	I bought this for my son's room.  Its been up for 5 months and has not peeled yet, looks great.  Comes with a lot of stickers in addition to the big green lantern decal.  Definitely worth the money.
5.0	Cheaper then if we got it from GE and works just as great!  Very happy with it.  Would recommend you saving your $$$ and going generic!
5.0	This fits perfectly above a door in our bedroom. I love the size and two different fonts. It was very easy to apply.
5.0	Just like what it says it is, except it is a lot cheaper to get it in at Amazon!
5.0	Add versatility to the fan.  Nice to be able to select fan speed and time.
5.0	I have a single deadbolt lock on my front door, and after replacing most of the screws on both side of the jamb with three-inchers, I still had no answer for bump keys.  If you want to make one, all you have to do is go on YouTube.  Scary.  Lock Jaw is a simple and cost-effective answer to bump keys.  I bought one for every door but one, because it occurred to me that no power to the garage door means even I am locked out!<br />I was reluctant to purchase because all of the videos and pictures show deadbolts that lock with knobs that are straight vertical, and mine lock at 45 degrees (a marketing error in my estimation).  Never fear!  The jaws only have to block turning when lowered and are still installed vertically.  The instructions do have illustrations.<br />I installed with a new 3M product: heavy-duty double-sided tape.  There's no way those babies are coming off the door.  Quick and easy!  No reason to hesitate purchasing this solid unit.
5.0	This is absolutely adorable and goes perfect in my sons Winnie the pooh themed room. I live in an apartment where we cant paint the walls, so this was a perfect fit for me. It brings color and life to the room but comes of super easy. I would recommend to all.
5.0	I think that this is a very dainty and classy ceiling medallion. It's not too busy but definitely has detail.  I purchased mine for a chandelier in the master bath and it looks fabulous.
5.0	perfect for outlets behind furniture, if you are trying to use it on a GFI outlet, you have to remove the dummy prongs or it won't fit, but they were easy to break off with a hammer
5.0	The item was exactly what I needed the same size everything was perfect now I know where to find it again
1.0	Please understand that the reviews on the QEP sponges are not from Tile Contractors. Just save your money. It's another QEP cheap knock off that doen't hold up when grouting with sanded grout.
1.0	Beware, this smoke detector does not meet NFPA 72 2010 requirements for use in bedrooms, which require a 520HZ square wave horn.  A 3000 hz signal is ineffective at waking sleeping people, children or elderly adults in particular.  Search NFPA 72 2010 and 2013.<br /><br />The requirement became effective the first of 2014 for commercial buildings, and its a extremely good idea for homes.
5.0	Fast shipping. Exactly what I was looking for. Works great to hold keyboard drawer on my desk closed when not in use.
5.0	Ordered this to replace one of the bath vent fan that had stopped working. The prime reason for getting this was ease of installation. Got this in the evening and have installed it. Very easy replacement - couldn't have been more easier. Can't comment on reliability but the fan sure is less noisy than the original fan. Will be buying 1 more to replace noisy vent fan of the powder room.
5.0	These are perfect for keeping doors from flying open and hitting whatever is near it. The front door is a perfect example. This little gizmo will allow the door to open as wide as you need it to by setting the screw. It stops all the damage from the door accidentally swinging open either by someone or a gust of wind. In other doorways, if you don't want to install those spring doorstop into your pretty molding, this is a great alternative. And if you have nickel or bronze hardware, those finishes are available. Just a great little item and super easy to install.
5.0	Lightning fast shipment. Great Value. Exactly as advertised.
1.0	I've bought 2 of these from the seller.  The first one broke after about 40 days.  The second one broke after about 10 days.  The switch mechanism falls apart so the light is completely useless.<br /><br />My son loves Star Wars, so I am perplexed about what to do for a night light now.<br /><br />For a $20 night light the quality needs to be perfect.  Instead this is garbage.
5.0	Seemed loud to me (but I'm not hearing impaired).The chime unit doesn't have to be mounted. If you are a little hard of hearing, I suggest you just place it on your coffee table or nightstand next to you. I think you should be able to hear it just fine that way. Plus, since it is portable you can move it from room to room, even outside if you remain in operating distance to the sender unit. What that actual distance is I do not know, but you could experiment to determine that for your house.
5.0	What can I say -- it just works as advertised. We replaced a 1500 watt 110V heater in our basement workshop with this, and this one does a much better & faster job of heating the work area. Definitely recommended as long as you have a 220V outlet available.
5.0	PERFECT, BOUGHT 2 MORE FOR A TOTAL OF 4... THE VERY BEST IS OUTSIDE SOLAR LIGHTING,  I WILL RETURN FOR MORE... SOON!
1.0	We purchased 4 of these units for space heating after reviewing Takagi's online information. We had installed TK2's 4 years ago and they continue to give us great service. These new TD2 units are 40 lbs vs 70 lbs for the older units. AOsmith bought Takagi about 2 years ago and completely redesigned all of the Takagi line. After installing the new units, we couldn't keep them running for more than 2 days without a code of some kind. One of them would only work with the door off. Throughout the time they were installed, our techs were in constant contact with takagi's hotline. The hotline people constantly contradict the install manuals and the online information. They were more interested in finding something we did that doesn't conform to the ever expanding list of requirements for proper operation. We were finally told that the TD2s couldn't be used for space heating. They couldn't be used in areas that get below 5 degrees. They must be drained every night. They can't be run at 180 degrees. We shouldn't rely on them for primary heat. We can't use more than 15 % Glycol in them. We finally yanked them and installed new forced air furnaces and tank type water heaters. After all of this, We were denied warranty because they will only agree to replace faulty parts that we pay them to diagnose and install. We had the units installed less than a month. They don't work as intended. We are stuck with these units.<br />Our opinion is that they only work for domestic hot water and only with limited usage.<br />I'd like to note that we didn't purchase these from Amazon, but we wish we had as Amazon's warranty process is much better.
5.0	This tarp is extra heavy duty.  This is what  I needed in California to survive the hot summers.  The tie downs are heavy duty as well.  Very satisfied!
1.0	"I can't understand how anyone could give this thing a good review, it's total junk.  After 2 days of charging in bright sunlight, the light is so dim that it's useless.  Plus, the weak beam only lasts a few minutes, then fades out.  Don't waste your money on this thing, it's worthless.  I'm sorry I bought it.  If you want a good solar flashlight, look at the \\""Hybrid light\\"".  I bought one of those at the same time and have been very happy with it."
5.0	product is as advertised
5.0	Unbelievable technology for a very reasonable price.  Eliminated marital discord over whether to turn outside lights on when leaving house before dark and returning after.
1.0	"I would give this a ZERO if I could, and would caution anyone against buying this kit.  Buying the version WITHOUT the flapper might be okay, but the flapper included in this kit is so flimsy that the water motion within the tank from the \\""cleaning mechanism\\"" (which by the way doesn't actually serve any useful purpose) pushed the flapper so it cannot sit flush.  Water is constantly leaking.  My daily water usage actually increased by 36 gallons a day because of this product.  We had to buy new flappers that actually sit in the correct position."
5.0	has most things needed.  wire is good for about two large pictures, or 4 smaller ones
5.0	Saves room on your kitchen counter for a coffee maker.  This is great for hot drinks or meals where hot water is required.  Ex.: Tea, Coffee, Oatmeal, Rice, etc.  If you're THINKING about getting it, stop.  Go for it!
5.0	having an older garage door.... and teenagers now driving... I was going crazy keeping track of the two remotes we had... Genius!!! Problem solved... I get to keep my remote in my car and bought two of these for the new drivers!!!   Anyway it was literally two minutes to synchronize with the existing garage door equipment... I would strongly recommend as a replacement when you remote meets it's demise...or if you have teenagers in the house like I do... Amazon made it all so easy!
5.0	High quality replacement for the really poor Chinese switches. Ruggedly built and safe. Easy to install
5.0	these security locks are very good and I love the comfort and the space left in the suitcase, are excellent
1.0	Key is very flimsy, plastic, I think.  The key broke off in the keyhole, could not open safe because apparently one of the batteries<br />came loose in the battery holder so electronic combination won't work.  Although I do think I was a bit culpable in breaking off the key (I may have turned it with too much force), I still have no choice but to take it back to Home Depot for a refund.  I worked on it for about 2 hours trying to get the key shaft out of the keyhole with no luck at all.  I don't want to drill it because I do intend to take it back to the vendor.<br />Saw a reference in another review about tapping it on top just above the combination pad, but I already have it back in the box and don't want to open it up again.  If you have a similar problem you might want to watch the utube videos.  The particular one about tapping it I could not find on youtube.
5.0	Easy to mount just add a dusk to dawn sensor and add power.....easy as it gets and it's crazy bright, added two to my office/shop parking lot and a set of these where perfect I love them....area lit with these is about 150'x150' and two of these do it nicely, mounted them on the second story boxing about 25-30' up and not only does the parking lot get well lit the serounding areas are nicely lit to....also works great for all my outdoor surveillance cameras in that area they stay in day mode do to the brightness of the lights so that's a major plus all images are nice and clear and easy to make out!!!!
5.0	Exactly what I needed. Delivered within a few business days with free shipping.
5.0	So far, these are awesome.  I am SO sick of bath mats that get grimy and gross, and gradually slide down toward the drain.  The last few bath mats I've had were terrible about staying in place, and it got to be a daily frustration once they were a couple weeks old and lost their suction.  I finally gave in and searched for an alternative and found these.  They definitely help with making the tub less slippery, and so far I've had no problem with them moving or sliding at all.  I had a hard time getting them to look like they were completely stuck, so I was afraid they might start coming up right away, but so far so good.  I've had them in the tub for about a week, so of course that could change.  I will update my review if I end up having a problem, but so far I don't think it will be an issue.  They are also great for keeping the bathtub clean, as soap scum doesn't seem to build up on them at all.<br /><br />UPDATE: I've now had these in my tub for 3 years, and they are still going strong (knock on wood)! There are one or two spots where something dark stained them a little, so they aren't pristine, but they still don't look gross. They are enough to make me feel comfortable that I won't slip in the shower (and I recently had hip surgery, so that's a priority for me!). They have also been fine with baths and being totally submerged. I will definitely purchase these again if/when they finally wear out. I can't believe it's been over 3 years since I've owned a stupid bath mat!
5.0	This stuff works well, is reasonably priced, and can come in handy in quite a few situations. Very effective at insuring there's no exposed points anywhere on a circuit or plug. Wish I got this stuff years ago.
5.0	Sticky as all hell, used it to stick some cheap LED lights to the tow hooks on my '96 suburban, after about 6mo and driving in the rain, heat, bouncing around it is still stuck fast
5.0	Why go to a box store for hardware? This 25 pack took care of every cabinet I had in my kitchen. A box store would've cost me $100 to get that many pieces.  These are substantial knobs not lightweight tin. Glad I checked amazon for this product.
1.0	Bought 6. Pre-drilled a hole and started to hand tighten the first screw. Head fell off.<br />Got the second screw, drilled a second hole next to the first and went to tighten it. Head fell off.<br /><br />Maybe this set of screws were bad?<br /><br />I opened the second hook I bought and drilled a third hole next to the other bits of metal that were now stuck in my wall. Started to hand tighten the screw, got 80% in and the head fell off.<br /><br />I'm VERY frustrated with this purchase. To make sure the screws were the issue, I grabbed some similar screws I had left over from a different project and was able to hand tighten them fine. They don't match the hook I bought, but at least THEY'RE NOT GOING TO SHEAR OFF like the ones that come with this hook.
5.0	These work great but they are much smaller than I anticipated (I know, I know, but despite reading the dimensions, they just appeared larger in the photo to me)...and that's a GOOD thing!  I bought them to light up my pups potty area on the side of our new home.  Once we landscape, the lights are small enough to blend in and won't stand out while still giving off a nice bright light as you approach.  My only wish is that they stayed lit a little longer but they suit our purposes fine.  May even order a couple more :)
1.0	Light is very dim, very blue, and flashlight-style directional-- i.e. it projects a beam rather than illuminating an area. While I've bought other perfectly satisfactory LED bulbs, these specific ones are not yet ready for prime time. I purchased two. One is currently in a fixture where it won't show much and I really don't need the light anyway, so as to use it up and get some value out of the thing. The other is gathering dust in the back of my bulb-shelf waiting to die of old age because I can't find another use for a bulb that pathetic. In short, this was not the wisest money I've ever spent.<br /><br />I've had good luck so far with Philips-brand, also Amazon available.
5.0	This is one bright flashlight at a great price. I bought 3 of these - I bought them so I could hook the flashlight to a ribbon/string and hang it around my neck during a power outage. Nothing worse than trying to do things while holding a flashlight.
5.0	Excellent!<br />Fast shipping too!
5.0	Awesome product, Awesome savings
5.0	Easy to install, works fine! we have not had an earthquake since it was installed.
1.0	As the title says, the light itself works. I was pretty happy with the white headlight's brightness. However, my problem with this product (and the reason that I gave it one star) is that the mounting was absolutely useless. The very cheap quality of materials meant that both attachments broke as I was trying to install the lights. I wasn't even using a lot of force--usually I have a lot of trouble getting screws tight, but in this case, as I was tightening the screw for the headlamp attachment, the attachment snapped. The same thing happened with the taillight. All in all, I highly recommend avoiding this product, unless all you want are lights that cannot be attached to the bike.
5.0	Love this lamp.  It has it's own rechargeable battery and will last a coupe of hours unplugged.  It's better than a flashlight.  I want another one.
5.0	No false alarms, like which I was experiencing with the PI2010. Only one sensor type, but no false alarms!
1.0	Not really universal as it didn't fit the brand new ceiling fan (hunter brand) that was in my kitchen. Had to return it =(
5.0	I put this on my daughters' bathroom mirror. Look great and super easy to apply. It shipped in a study tube and arrived safely.
5.0	This bulb was purchased as a replacement for 1 of 3 bulbs in a bathroom fixture. It is not the brand that was in the fixture but this bulb works just as good and you can't tell any difference and it was less expensive. I would purchase this again if it is available when I need it.
5.0	Had an old faithful Honeywell Programmable for 15 years but wanted to be able to control the unit via Wifi.  Was about to install it but during my unit check out my AC guy told me he would install it for $25.  I purchased a transformer and new wire for adding the Cwire, turns out that my 15 year old system had plenty of current to power the thermostat.  He had it installed and running in less than 15 min and that included the time in the attic.  Easy to program, works just like my old Honeywell, only via a touch screen.  Connected right to my WiFi right off the bat.  After a quick trip to the Honeywell website to register and set up my account and it was ready to go.  You can control it via a website, IPhone App, and on the IPAD.    My AC man was really impressed, asked where I purchased it, he loved the humidity reading and the size of the unit.    Checked the temp vs a digital thermometer and it is dead on.    And my wife can stop in the hall and find out what the temp is before she asks me to look it up on my phone.    Very Happy with this.    Four months in,  had some pretty high humidity readings and I was about to bring out my AC guy when I read another comment that solved it.    PLUG THAT HOLE with painters putty or RTV behind the unit  Filled the hole and what do you know the humidity is at 50% right where it should be here on the Gulf Coast.    STILL LOVE THIS THING!
5.0	This was a warehouse clearance item that had Ben shipped somewhere before and returned, however it was perfectly packed and is really beautiful.
5.0	I still can't believe my eyes - those 2 tiny crooks (we probably could even use only one, but opted for two for more security) hold a heave wooden framed mirror. The handymen in our building told as it would be a big job to have it fixed and we would need to arrange for extra service for that. Luckily, our friend recommended this system - the job was done by my husband alone in 15 minutes!
5.0	Comfortable and quiet. It is a marriage saver. No more will there be a slam of the seat when it has to be put down.
5.0	Perfect replacement, works great.
5.0	Light works well. I got it for my side yard and it works great there, the motion sensor sets off the brighter light which is amazingly bright.
5.0	I love this owl lap. I wanted something to use as a night light that was big enough to be a decoration in the room, but that was still nice looking and not cartoon-y. This is absolutely gorgeous, and can be used as a regular lamp or night light depending on how bright of a bulb you put in it.
5.0	As expected, low cost arrived quickly. Be aware it is low cost which does = thinner than a normal tarp but works for the cover we expected. If you want a heavy one buy a more expensive one
5.0	Quick delivery.  Sturdy.  Works for us
5.0	Excellent product.  Price is right too.
5.0	I purchased this so that I could make sure my grandbabies cannot get their hands on a new medication that I am required to take.  I really like the product but I wish it was a tad bit bigger.  It fits the small prescription bottles but not the larger ones.  I also love that there is a built in cord so that I can attach it to something in a motel room when I travel.  What a great idea!
5.0	Great product..fits well..convenient
5.0	Wish I hadn't waited so long to buy these. The light output is far superior to other LED fixtures I have tried at 6 watts I didn't expect the amount of light I am getting. It is easy on the eyes and sufficient as an under cabinet work light. A bonus for me is the way the light brings out the color in the slate in my back splash.   Before these lights it looked dark gray now all the beautiful color in the slate have come alive. They are pricey as other reviewers have said but worth every penny.
5.0	It worked great and was easy to install-less than 5 minutes and I was up and running with my echo weed eater. Would recommend.
1.0	Worked great for about 20 seconds, then no light at all and that is the way it is now, just a plain shower head. No lighting at all.
5.0	Received Genuine Whirlpool Factory Certified 3392519 Thermal Fuse. Received 2 days after ordering as with all my Prime orders. Since thermal fuses fail due to excessive heat load (versus an electrical fuse which senses excessive current), this was time to investigate the cause of the thermal fuse failure. This specific thermal fuse only gets too hot for one reason, and that is restricted air flow.  Restricted air flow is either a blockage in the ducting, or debris accumulation in the actual exhaust fan (or both).  Consequently, please don't just replace your thermal fuse without a complete system cleaning. Aside from constant fuse failures, these are major life and property saving safety devices.<br /><br />My particular dryer exhaust system is under the slab, and runs about 20 feet. Using my handy-dandy duct cleaning system and shop-vac, I proceeded to clean the in-home exhaust ventilation system. Between myself, the wife and three daughters, there is a significant amount of washing and drying taking place. Most folks do not realize the sheer volume of moisture being pumped during the drying process. Naturally, this moisture condenses along the interior surface of the exhaust ducting; then, that same wet surface area slowly but surely accumulates dryer lint, along with general dust and debris being pulled through what is basically an expensive air pump (your dryer exhaust fan). Over time, this constant coating process effectively reduces the inside diameter of the system, reducing air flow and placing a greater load on the dryer fan. In addition, extended dryer run time means higher energy bills.<br /><br />20 minutes of clean time resulted in approximately a cubic foot of debris from the exhaust system alone.  Next proceed to the dryer cleaning process (after all, you already have the back cover off). This baby was full of dust, hair, spiders (I hate spiders...), etc.  Another 6 screws and the fan cover is removed (Whirlpool LER8648LW0). There I discovered toothpicks, hair pins, safety pins, small pebbles, sand, pieces of pens and pencils, along with a variety of other items that left me scratching my head. Anyway, the fuse failure forced the issue, and a couple of well spent hours resulted in a completely cleaned dryer, and exhaust duct system.<br /><br />Installed my genuine Whirlpool thermal fuse, and the dryer is back up and running even more efficiently than before.<br /><br />I hope this helps.cks, hair pins, safety pins, small pebbles, sand, pieces of pens and pencils, along with a variety of other items that left me scratching my head.

5.0	excellent product. I purchased 2 and both work perfectly.
1.0	This faucet looks great however there is a major flaw in the design and materials. The airiator screen on these faucets is not replaceable and is made of plain steel. The screen rusted and clogged within 3 months and the faucets began to spray water in many directions. Had to take the screens out to make the faucet usable until they can be replaced and now the water can only run at a trickle otherwise water flows over the side and off the back of the glass. I do not recommend this product. Buyer Beware.
5.0	UPDATE 11/7/2015! - Wow, with Echo integration it is now possible to dim and brighten your lights via voice! This is an awesome update to both excellent products. By the way, Wink is getting better and better. Can anybody say 5+ Stars? My only regret is that I don't have more people coming over to my house so I can blow them away with my Home Automation setup.<br /><br />I've been using Wink and Wink compatible devices for almost a year. In that time I've seen great strides in Wink's quest to add compatible devices and to get their home automation products at the top of the list for ease of use and reliability. I now have over 50 connected devices in my home from Locks, to lights, to thermostats. It all works wonderfully together and allows me to really impress my guests with my &#34;connected home&#34;.<br /><br />Recently though Wink released software that allows it to link directly with Amazon's Echo. Now not only do I have one of the most advanced home automation systems with Wink, but I can easily control it with the Amazon Echo. After linking my Wink system to Amazon Echo turning on lights is as easy as saying &#34;Alexa, turn on Kitchen Ceiling&#34;.<br /><br />Frankly, I have invested heavily in home automation products. What is the game changer with Wink is the fact that they support not just Wink devices but other home automation systems and protocols. Plus they constantly add new ones almost monthly. So I don't have to commit to one protocol or brand but can connect to multiple brands such as Nest, GE Link, GE Z-Wave, Lutron, Hue, EcoSmart, Schlage, Chamberlain, plus many many more.<br /><br />The bottom line is if your want to invest in home automation or the internet of things, don't corral your self into one brand or protocol, but get on board with the only home automation product that supports multiple systems, Wink.
5.0	NOT THICK ENOUGH AND THEY JUST SLIDE UNDER MY DOOR
1.0	Item dead on arrival, no power passed through either plug.
5.0	Installed and my 2 year old was anxious to test immediately. I was worried that she'd complain about not having the Dora potty lid anymore, but she hopped right on and broke it in!  Finally I don't have parts to move around every time I need to use the guest bathroom. Truth be told, I accidentally bought two so I'm giving one to my sister rather than returning it. Awesome product.
1.0	I adhered to the directions of the fellow who gave a good review and still, my planters never did shine in the dark.  Wasted money I'm afraid.  Bummer!
5.0	Helps dehumidify the room and looks great
1.0	Had union painter apply stain as directed on new clean wood.  In one year the color faded and wood cracked.  Called the company as the website says that they will offer refunds or product replacement, however, the person answering phone made me send pictures, send receipts, answer multiple grilled questions-all this took several hours-and then refused to let me talk to supervisor and did not offer refund or replacement.  Deck was subject only to normal weather during that time.  Really disgusted as we spent over $300 on product.  Will be contacting consumer affairs regarding false advertising.
5.0	Worked great, couldn't find in any stores and I did not want to manually rekey every lock after purchasing a new house.
5.0	Product works as advertised.  High quality workmanship.
5.0	I bought this with the intent of controlling lights. I started off with two switches. I didn't have any trouble getting the Vera connected to the internet. I had a little trouble pairing with the switches, but got it done. It took about 15 minutes to pair the first two switches. The documentation it comes with is not clear, but I read whatever I could find while waiting for delivery. I am building out the system with more switches a little at a time. I can control the lights I have installed Z wave enabled switches on from the switch itself or a computer, or cell phone. I will be able to set scenes (like a macro) where a certain set of lights will go on or off with one command. I may purchase a lock set down the road. I don't see much purpose in a web cam. In my opinion the switches are much more of a problem than the Vera. The switches are expensive compared to dumb ones. They usually require a neutral wire. Most existing switches won't have the neutral installed, requiring more wiring. The switches barely fit in the switch boxes. I am pleased with the system and would recommend it to anyone who feels comfortable doing light wiring around the home.<br />Update 9/11/2013<br />I have not had to do anything to the Vera. The system just works. My outdoor lights come on automatically at sunset and shut off at the time I have set. I have a widget on my phone so when I come home I press it and the back door unlocks and the lights come on inside. I feel like George Jettson.<br />Update 1/21/2014<br />I have been using the system for about a year. Occasionally I have trouble getting the switches to work from my phone if I am away from my house. I suspect it is a data problem with the phone. My router died and when the new router was installed the Vera worked without doing anything. My Nest thermostat had to be reset. I am still very pleased.
1.0	Missing parts (sensor lens)  not adjustable like it's supposed to be. Not working at all always blinking on and off
5.0	I've tried a couple of replacement hoses before finally purchasing this product. It's long, durable, easily installed and doesn't coil in use. I'd highly recommend this hose.
5.0	Some comments mentioned the clock ran slow over a few days.  We've had our clock for 6 weeks and it keeps perfect time.  It's perfect for the location in our living room.  We've had several compliments on it. I like the nice clean lines. I'm not a fan of ornate carvings. (More nooks for dust to accumulate.)  Can't beat the price either.
5.0	Better than I expected. Seems to be very good quality.  I am very happy with it.
5.0	Arrived promptly and well packaged.  Well designed and doesn't take up much space which is great for a small office and small desk.
5.0	This item does everything that I need it to do. It works for me.
5.0	A very good product, it does what it is supposed to do and served the purpose of what I wanted to accomplish.  Be advised that the receiver is much larger than a standard light switch. Although the receiver will fit into a standard wall box, it will occupy practically all of the available space leaving little room behind to fold back the wiring.  There was some confusion during installation, of course I am not an electrician. A normal 3-way circuit has 3 wires coming out of the wall that will connect to the 3 wires/connections in a standard 3-way switch.  This SL6023 receiver unit has only 2 wires (plus ground)that will require you to join the two black wires (out of the wall box) and then connect to one of the leads of the receiver.  I had to call Heath Zenith twice to assure that this was what is supposed to be done.  The technical help desk at Heath Zenith can be difficult to reach, I waited 10 minutes on one call.  While I found their technical people helpful, their phone manners were curt (hey, if I was an electrician I wouldn't be bothering you folks).
1.0	We had been using another brand/style keyless lock but we wanted to have multiple entry codes so we ordered this one.  Unfortunately it is really hard to turn the handle after you've engaged the keypad.  Not sure if that's due to my somewhat older pre-arthritic hands (though the young lasses in my building say they have a hard time, too) of if it is the design.<br />Regardless, I'd recommend that if you can use the other side with the long push down handle, its a better option.
5.0	I received the part quickly and I soon had the dryer running like a new one! What a good deal!
5.0	Great hardware at the right price!  Thanks!
5.0	install when really smooth and easy, works like a charm. We have a double garage with a single door and it handles it like a champ.
5.0	The fan works so good there never is any steam buildup in the bathroom at all. Quiet too! In fact you almost can't hear it! Love it!
5.0	Worked as advertised!
5.0	works great easy to install fast shipping took care of my running away washer
5.0	Exactly what we needed to fix my mom's light.
5.0	"I bought this sprayer at Lowes and then read these reviews here, and said, \\""Uh Oh\\"".  I was expecting all kinds of problems.    I bought this mainly to paint the doors and drawers of my kitchen cabinets.  I actually used a brush to do the boxes/rails but I wanted a finish with no brush strokes on the doors, plus I wanted to save time.  My first coat was a primer and it took me just about 45 minutes to spray the front and backs of 26 doors.  I used a brush to paint the edges.  One of the tricks is to not tilt the sprayer forward/backward too much as the intake screen inside the container may suck air and throw blobs of paint.  The other trick is to begin the spray BEFORE coming across the material to be painted and extend slightly BEYOND it before ending the spray.  I used speed 2 and the lesser setting on the handle which enables you to come in closer to your work.  Another important tip is to not spray too far or too close to your subject.  I found too far away and you may experience a few blobs, too close and you risk runs.  After finishing all the doors and drawers, I experienced neither, but I did practice a bit on a piece of cardboard before actually beginning.  It only makes sense.  I also kept the sprayer fairly even and not tilted, but I did use the attached container.  I did not test the hose attached to a remote paint can source.  The spray distribution was even throughout, and I didn't experience the spray heavier in the middle than on the edge.  Clean-up was fairly easy - I did not clean with a hose and the quick clean lid as recommended for latex - I actually cleaned everything in a sink - easy to disassemble, clean and put back together - 15 minutes.   I'll now use this for my outdoor fence.  I'm extremely happy with this sprayer's performance.  After reading some of the negative reviews here, I believe at least some of their problems were caused by not practicing good spray techniques, or by not having all the parts of the sprayer tightened correctly."
5.0	Great little detector - one of the smallest I've seen, which I quite like!  Very smart hideaway look makes an otherwise unsightly item look much better.  Comes with a battery too, so good to go as soon as received -
5.0	I am a lavender nut, but am picky about the scent... Needs to be close to real lavender... This product is just that.. I recommend!
5.0	Exactly what I wanted at a reasonable price for these hard-to-find bulbs. Next-day delivery was a bonus.
5.0	This product works great when you are blending two wall joints together.  It is easy to use and offers little too no shrinkage.
5.0	Installed in a double utility sink. Really too pretty for the application, but I wanted a pull-out type faucet. Looks great and works great.
1.0	It refuses to lay flat, causing more of a trip hazard than the cords it's designed to cover.  Avoid this product
5.0	I am really impressed with the Mr. Beams products I have. These lights are surprisingly bright. The beam is fairly modulated. At the moment we have installed a couple of them. One inside a large pantry about 14 feet deep. The light actually feels a little too bright so I pointed it up at the ceiling and we use the reflected light. It is also important to note that these lights, the spotlights and the light lights are extremely sensitive. The usual detection range for my use is up to 20 feet. After a friend saw the light she asked where she could get one. I gave one to her to put up outside a door. She has an elderly mother and the light is a lifesaver.
5.0	This is a well built light, and is less likely to leak moisture into the bulb area. A good value.
5.0	No luck finding a replacement part in town after searching off and on for a few years. Was nervous about ordering without more details but this was a perfect match for 10 yr old Whirlpool 365.  So happy can finally use 4th burner again. Fast shipping too.
5.0	Works well with soap build up and odors
1.0	the one in the color picture is not what you get ! the one you get is in the hand drawn looking picture diagram and the lights are very cheap looking ! i don't advise this 2 anyone you get what you pay for i guess and i payed for crap i guess ! when i asked them why i got the wrong item the e mailed me back and told me i got what was in the picture lol mine has a mercadies symbol in the canter ! the trim isn't anything like the color picture that i was thinking i was buying and its been months since Ive ordered mine and they haven't even changed the picture after i kindly took the time 2 send a picture of the one i received i wish i could upload a photo of mine on here so you may see what i received but i don't know how https://www.amazon.com/gp/communication-manager/attachment/DSC00052.JPG?ie=UTF8&arrivalDate=1337880582&attachmentIndex=0&isInbox=0&marketplaceId=ATVPDKIKX0DER&messageId=A39E7X0TVOVM09
5.0	I love this heel cream; I wish I didn't run out of it so quickly.
5.0	Two years ago I would have given these devices a three star rating.  Here in Frisco, TX the water is really hard.  The units required constant cleaning because the hard water would cause sand and other debris to build up in the tank.  I paid the vent guys extra money to come out, clean and repair the humidifiers (we have 3, one for each zoned unit).  It got to the point where I installed cameras in the attic to watch the units so I would know when there is an issue, the units I have don't have the warning signal that gets sent to the thermostat.<br /><br />I have learned a few valuable lessons since then.<br /><br />The first lesson is that the filters that come with the unit are absolutely horrible and don't work here.  About two years ago I purchased the reverse osmosis filter from honeywell.  That has made a huge difference, the A/C people told me that the units didn't need to be cleaned after six months (previously they had to be cleaned every two months).  Although the filters are expensive at $117, they seem to last for the entire winter here in the Dallas area and we run them hard.<br /><br />The second lesson is that you can use the manual to see what the error codes mean.  If your manual doesn't have this information then look for it on the internet.  The error codes tell you the exact problem.  If you are even slightly mechanically inclined you can service the units yourself.  I think the only thing I haven't needed to replace yet are the control boards.  These units generate a lot of heat and the summer heat in Dallas adds to the wear.  To replace the sensor, having not done it before, I was able to complete the task in about 30 minutes.  The A/C guys would have charged me for the part and probably $80 at a minimum for their time.  If you do work on the unit I strongly advise that you take pictures as you uninstall the old part.<br /><br />For most users, this unit is probably installed in a heated area.  We are not so fortunate here.  If you install thisunit in your attic (the instructions say you shouldn't) I'd encourage you to run Pex.  The best versions of this product (not what you find and your local home depot dealer) can go down to -95 before having problems.  I also installed a manifold for the pex lines in a heated part of the house so that I could cut off water to the units and drain them.  This proves very helpful when the temperature here drops below 10 degrees (I know, balmy for the northern folks).<br /><br />The steam units do consume a lot of electricity but I'm ok with that.  The comfort level in the house is worth it.<br /><br />Carrier has a different unit that doesn't use a water tub.  I'm not sure of how well that unit works but you would not have to drain the water or clean the tubs like you do on these.  Given what I've read it's still a good investment with the carrier products to use the pex piping and the water filters.
5.0	Seems to be a great bonder primer will see in a few months how well  it does
5.0	Exactly the part I needed. Easy to install. Fast shipping.
5.0	Update post: I did an exchange and our new dragon light is awesome!!!! Once tilted to turn on it will stay on and does not have to remain on the charger so now my LO can bring it closer to his bed. Really glad we gave this another chance.  Old post: This light is so cute looking but I must have gotten a defective one. Even being fully charged it just keeps turning off by itself and takes a lot of time to get it to turn back on again. My toddler is always coming to me in tears that it has shut off.
5.0	I bought 7 of these for closets in my home. I had my home rewired and the electricians did my a solid by installing these when the ran the new romex. They were amazed by the light output of these little lights. Not to bad for $30 beans.
5.0	The knobs are just the right size and color and they were very easy to install.  Thanks for sending so quicky.
5.0	Fantastic.i bought the product online here in New Zealand and got it delivered to Florida in USA. Product reached within the specified days and kids are loving it.
5.0	love this it is a usb. it has to be plugged into the computer to operate. I have birds in my computer room so when its lights out for them to sleep... this light comes in handy for my keyboard and doesn't bother the birds<br />I really love this lamp
5.0	So delicate.. and very special.....my step mom told me  she never had one of these before... and will keep forever.
1.0	It looks like it has a green/blue tint.  It is basically silver.  I know the description said pewter, but I went by the picture.  I have ordered many items from Amazon.  This was the first time the picture was misleading.  I kept it.  The quality was fine.  I will find some place to install it at another time.
5.0	Compact little switch.
5.0	She's just as sweet as she can be and a delightful addition to my garden.  The glowing jar of fireflies is really nice at night and an added bonus.  I love her.
5.0	I have wanted to buy a thread checker for a long time.  I ordered this one on Amazon.  It came double boxed, strap taped, and packed with pride.  My unit is made in the USA, and is of the highest quality possible while still maintaining a reasonable selling price.  Checker also has a built in measuring scale and holes for drill bit sizing.  Very nice product I will be able to pass down to my son!
5.0	Nice quiet yellow light.  Covers the whole bush.  Use it out in the desert boon docking and they stay on.
5.0	I had two layers of wallpaer to remove.  The first layer as vinyl.  I did score the paper but with the vinyl it was two steps.  First the steamer was onh strong enough to removed the vinyl part of the wallpaper.  Then I had to go back and remove the paper back with the steamer.  It works great.  It does get messy but I don't see how you can avoid messiness when removing wallpaper.
1.0	I woundnt even call this a bungee cord. It barely stretches. The clips on each end are cheap plastic. It's not made to do anything. Highly disappointed. Huge waste of money.
5.0	I swapped out my old rusted and crusty door hinges and installed these. They fit and they work great. They hold the door up and the door swings smoothly.
5.0	Works great and cheaper than Lowe's or Home Depot. Been using Subscribe & Save for a while now and very happy.
5.0	Love. Teas lights fit well. May have to push tea light down a bit to get flame below rim. But cute and effective.
5.0	These bulbs just exude vintage charm and they a less expensive than any you will find in the big box stores!
5.0	When I got this on a black friday deal, I was so excited to finally be getting an Ottlite. I'm a big crafter. I sew, paint, and do or have done just about every other craft that there is. So, I've seen OttLites in all the stores, but had never seen one in action. When I saw such a great deal on them, I decided to get one. I was extremely impressed with how bright and white the light was and the swivel base and magnifier were just added bonuses, but then I couldn't figure out how to turn it off and on. I figured that I had to just unplug it to turn it off, which I didn't like. So, I bought another Ottlite lamp The [[ASIN:B00408MXA8 OttLite 915083 Craft Caddy in White]], because I knew it had an on and off switch. Then tonight I came on here to write a negative review on this and found that another reviewer mentioned that to turn this lamp off and on, all you do is close the lamp part down. I got this one back out of the box and it worked! Needless to say, I'm so happy to have found out that it does in fact have an on and off switch. I hope this review helps. I highly recommend this to anyone that needs a bright white lamp for projects. You should believe all the hype, OttLites REALLY are as nice as everyone says.
5.0	Time to replace it, kept out most bugs, somepeople. It lasted a year, think that's great😀 will be buying a new one in a few minutes!
5.0	Purchased this for one of our Water Trucks in a construction application and is working great, seller is the manufacturer and available for installation queries (our first install so we reached out to make sure we did it correctly)<br />Fraction of the price of more expensive Berkeley pumps and way superior than the knock offs you will find from overseas (stay away from those).<br />Will be purchasing 2 more for our other Trucks... highly recommended
5.0	priced nice and received quickly.
5.0	Great Product!  Even better price
5.0	Could not ask for a better value ! I would recommend 100 percent . Arrived 2 days. Perfect Condition . Far better than anything I have seen at local stores and much less expensive
1.0	I ordered this product to replace the original remote that came with the opener. I programmed the remote according to the manufacturer instruction and I could only get the garage door to actuate once, from a very close range. Then the remote stop opening the door despite several attempts to reprogram it.<br />I sent back the remote to the seller for a refund. The seller informed me of a $5 restocking fee. I asked for the restocking fees to be waived, as the opener and remote were compatible. The seller didn’t even reply back.<br />I end up paying $15 of shipping and restocking fee for a $20 item that didn’t work properly. Very disappointed.<br />Bottom line:<br />- The item didn’t perform his intended function.<br />- The seller offer very poor customer service.<br />- Beware for hidden fee and policy when you buy from a third party seller on Amazon.
1.0	No help from Kohler on this one.  We complained from day one.  We wanted to &#34;BUY AMERICAN&#34; but wish we would have gone with a Toto.
1.0	I thought i was getting 4 lights it only came with one ..4 led motion lights i recieved one
1.0	This opener has an effective range of ten feet, which means I have to get out of the car to open the overhead door. New battery has had no positive effect.
1.0	This is a piece of garbage.  Just try to get past step one where they tell you to prod a whole with a toothpick to get the thing open.  I tossed it in the garbage.
5.0	We only have it for less than a month and don't use it very much.  Can't comment on the performance yet, but it does sound quieter than my old one.  I guess the smaller hole feature is for safety, so people won't put their hand in to loosen food stuff, even though people must be smart enough not to when it is on anyway.  I am a little worried about what to do when the food stuck in there.  It says to use a long handle wood spoon.  But since it hasn't happen yet, I don't know if it would work.  Will see.  Do like it for the time being.
5.0	Looks beautiful and is much nicer than the picture.  Many of my neighbors are going to order the same - what a nice compliment!
5.0	Product is as expected.
5.0	Very inexpensive for the complex control - heating as well as periodic clean fan operation throughout the day (programmable for how long). Both cycles can be set independently  for different days of the week and for night, morning, day and evening.  Having mechanical contacts helps keep the costs down, I believer;  however, display and programming are all electronic.
5.0	I've seen similar lights for sewing machines selling for 4-5 times as much.  This little light (I went crazy and purchased two) is perfect. Very lightweight and the clip lets me attach it to the edge of my extension table.  I can also clip one to a thread stand and create additional lighting.  It is bright, super flexible and I'm thrilled.  Each light uses 3 AAA batteries.  With the LED the batteries should last about a year or more.  Seriously good.
5.0	Looks great, was easy to apply. I love it!
5.0	This speed control worked for controlling my Canarm Fan (Canarm Wall Exhaust Fan -- 16in., Variable Speed, 1/3 HP, Model# S16-EVD).  It has a nice smooth rotation. It comes with all the hardware needed to mount it to an electrical box.  It is very easy to hook up with one (1) hot wire, one (1) switched wire and one (1) ground.
5.0	Very durable and perfect for outdoor use
5.0	Take long time to prepare for painting job but it is very good, now we have a new update kitchen. Loving it.
5.0	Love this light...Had the LED version but this one is a little bigger and a little more light.
5.0	Great scent and they only require two AA batteries.
1.0	This filter was constantly in the way and took up way too much space in my smaller kitchen sink. The switch that you use to turn on the filter breaks off easily, leaving you with a useless device. Also, it seemed like the red light came on too soon, regardless of how frequently I turned the filter on. Too expensive for a crappy product.
5.0	a good light. better than the 50w bulbs that they replaced.
5.0	Great little scope no bells and whistles nice color screen does what I need it for at a good price.
1.0	It is not  worthy.Totally wrong size .
5.0	What can you say about these great designed - good quality product?<br />They don't cost very much when you compare them to just buying two or four of them at a time.<br />You'd be crazy to pass these guys up.  Great case to help keep them organized.<br /><br />Fast Shipping<br />Super Plastic Case<br />Great Quality<br />Highly Recommend
5.0	this is a very nice looking and affordable box for mail. it was easy to hang as well. i would recommend this product.
5.0	Product arrived on time as promised and is an excellent choice.
5.0	I liked this lamp so much I ordered several more.  This makes a nice nightlight on a bedside table, it has a glow like candlelight.  If you have to wake up before the sun comes up, this light is a perfect transition light.  It provides a soft early sunrise light that is much more gentle than switching on a bright light.
5.0	i actually gave this as a gift, but haven't had ay complaints about it so far. i was super hesitant about buying if after reading all of the negative reviews for lava lite items. i think that if you want a real, good quality lava lamp then you shouldn't buy lava lite. although, it was pretty hard for me to find an alternative. all in all, had no problems with it.
5.0	Arrived well packaged and fits perfectly
5.0	These lights look very retro and I love how they helped to make our hallway look more updated. They were very easy to install.  They arrived in great packaging and were exactly as described.
5.0	very ample supply for the price.  great product.
1.0	unit says there is CO and to evacuate room when there is no gas appliance on or anywhere in the room. I did a test i blew up a clear plastic bag and put the unit inside pressed the button and it said there is CO over 400 PPM and to evacuate. clearly this unit confuses CO2 with CO.<br /><br />i would not trust this unit. i will see if i can return it.
5.0	*¨¨*:•.FIVE.•:*¨¨*:•.STARS.•:*¨¨*.•:*¨¨*:•.THANK.•:*¨¨*:•.YOU.•:*¨¨*:•
5.0	I own a number of the Comfort Seat toilet seats in both round and elongated versions.  They are the absolutely the best toilet seat I've ever encountered.  Very comfortable and extremely solid with a durable finish.
1.0	it worked once then stopped working
5.0	I bought it for my mother.she was very happy.this product is very good repair, solved my mother's foot trouble.I am also very happy, I will buy it again.
5.0	I bought the light for the hallway.  There around about 6 light bulbs are they do a wonderful just lighting my hallway.  The light color is great.  The only like issues i have with the bulbs is that they produce a little heat which i wasn't expecting. None of my other LED light bulbs product hear,  but the heat produce by the bulbs isn't that much.
5.0	ordered these to use on the plane when i travel. they are study i ordered 2 of them.. thanks
5.0	Perfect fit.  Good price.  Nice finish
5.0	I had these growing up and for some reason haven't been able to find them around. Obviously a quick search on Amazon turned them up.  Pros:  -Maximized every last drop out of the tube (I use them on toothpaste tubes)  -Keeps the tube looking clean, as opposed to having that rolled up end that always comes unraveled (like I used to have on my toothpaste tubes)  Cons:  -a little hard to get on a full sized (ie, toothpaste) tube at first, but then it's not an issue for about 6 or so months  Great product, feels like it's one of those As-seen on TV things that most people would just ignore, but I'm glad I didn't.
5.0	Another Insinkerator refugee here.  Bought a 9980 to replace a Badger 5+ that leaked and seized.<br /><br />Installation was a breeze.  I was a little iffy about the mount at first, but I found it very solid once bolted to the sink.  The unit pops right onto the mount when soaped up as suggested in the instructions.  There were a couple of dimensions on this unit that were different from the old one, but a quick swivel of existing plumbing made everything fit perfectly.  My only real complaints are that the built-in cord was difficult to remove for hard wiring and there's not a lot of room in the cavity at the bottom for the Romex and wire nuts.<br /><br />Operation's great.  The clank when it starts up has taken some getting used to (still freaks my wife out a bit), but after that it runs very quietly.  This thing is way overpowered for most of what I throw at it, but it's ground up all of it with quiet, dignified aplomb.  Peach pits are a little noisy, but the motor doesn't seem to notice.<br /><br />Now if you'll excuse me, I need to go find more stuff to grind up.  :-)
5.0	Very nice! Smaller than I thought  but it's worth what  I pay!
5.0	Let me tell you something about these-for the price, they are worth it. Seriously. I got these lights in, and set them up-beautiful. I camped for two weeks, and I think halfway through the first week I forgot to turn them off and just left them on. Sunday night as I was packing to return home on Monday, they were still on-dim, but still twinkling. Didn't even have to change the batteries once. Not bad. Would definitely buy these again.
1.0	only work for one day then stopped working keypad wouldn't unlock door. paid a little more money and got something of better quality
5.0	My husband and I are building a greenhouse and read that Hardware Cloth will keep moles and other critters from digging though your floor.  So, we purchased 4 rolls and could not be happier with the product. Ease to lay out,  MUCH cheaper than any local store (they wanted 1.99 a foot!), and maximum protection I highly recommend!
5.0	The legs were identical to the legs on our sectional.  Perfect fit and height - We are very happy with the purchase.
5.0	"This was a great price for the shade cloth, so I decided to buy one. It's well made and HUGE for the price! It's just what I needed to partially shade my little garden here in the desert! We have very intense sun, so I'm hoping that this year, my plants will be \\""more comfortable\\"" beneath it! Wish me luck in getting beans and corn this year, and happy gardening to all!"
5.0	perfect replacement for old doors
5.0	This product was very secure in the box when I unboxed it was very secure inside and very easy to set your own code<br />I am proably going to buy another one of this product
5.0	We purchased this item from Costco for $[...]. The bladder and faucet were going bad on our old system and it was time for new filters so I decided to do the full upgrade. First the install was very easy except for 1 small detail. If you have a stainless steel sink they require you to use a 1 1/4 inch knockout to punch the large hole. These are expensive tools. I did find one at home depot but it was part of a kit which was $[...]. Instead I purchased this bit from harbor freight.    [...].      The large bit worked perfectly. Just drill a pilot hole if you don't have one and use the large bit. Took 2 minutes. The rest of the install was a breeze and the unit installs easily. It is lightweight and has a nice brushed nickel faucet. Really enjoying it so far!
1.0	bought this to replace 2yr old sylvania.  Thought I was getting a DPST and had to use relay to pick up other load.  I hope this lasts longer.  Same unit missing pole
5.0	The consistency comes out smooth and it's an easy to use product. Filled gaps and cracks well. But, the color is NOT gray as it's stated. It looks more like a wood glue beige color when it dries.  Note: It doesn't harden like a rock, more soft and mushy to the touch. But again, it seals so it delivers. It's been 3 years and the stuff still has held through long icy winters. I bought another brand of caulk a year ago to fill some open cracks and the stuff is junk, the dried caulk has broken up like peanut brittle. Go with this GE brand.
5.0	Great price - nice quality. Couldn't find anything like this locally - even tractor supply which has good pricing on bolts and nuts. I used these to hang 6 carriage house homemade garage doors - size 4 feet 6 inches by 9 feet (4.5' x 9'). Doors are over 3&#34; thick - so they are quite heavy. Used the N130641 Bolt Hook with these. Work great!
5.0	Clip arrived fast, fit my opener perfectly, was easy to install, and is super cheap. Very happy with all aspects of this purchase.
1.0	I had received a set of wireless alarms a few years ago and they worked great so when I bought my new house I put in an alarm system but the windows were not armed so I bought two boxes of these alarms from Soundbytes. When they arrived not one of the 8 worked, so they sent me another 2 boxes and not one of those 8 worked. I then sent back the 4 boxes and asked that they send me another 2 boxes but to make sure they tested them first before they sent them out to make sure they worked and when I received them not one of them worked. They did refund me everything but still I am left with no wireless window alarms. I think it was the batteries that were bad but apparently Soundbytes didn't carry those batteries, go figure. So I would be cautious when ordering from them
5.0	I like bidet very much and I recommended this to my friends and relatives. I wish to order more as a gift to my friends.
1.0	The product picture is very misleading.  The filters came in an unmarked package, not the one shown.  The filter boxes only opened on one side (it's difficult to understand how it can filter air if the air can't pass through the filter).  The filter element was paper, not the foam type that was in the original filter (or shown in the picture).<br /><br />I was able to utilize my existing filter box to put the filter element in for use but I would not recommend these to anyone.
1.0	Simple and sweet - I wish I had read the reviews before I wasted my time and money on this. It did not work, not even the slightest bit (and I use Mighty Magnets). I am astounded it has not been pulled from shelves, Krylon should be more concerned about their brand's image.
5.0	I ordered two sets for our patio pergola and liked them so much that I ordered two more sets! They give off a soft low glow that doesn't attract insects and I love that they're solar powered. I would buy them again and recommend them as well.
1.0	The shower head didn't work I try to send back but was no possible !!
5.0	This is a great extension cord,heavy enough to handle current loads with no problems.The yellow gives this extension cord high visibility so that you know the location of the extension cord at any time with a mere glance and the lighted indicator at the end of the extension cord is a very nice professional touch,you don't end up plugging the extension cord in and unwrapping it only to find out that the power outlet you just plugged it into is faulty,with this extension cord you know that your power outlet is working the moment you plug this extension cord in.Trust this extension cord,it truly is heavy duty.
5.0	Needed a new stopper to replace the rubber on the one we already owned.  A nice replacement.
5.0	The interface is clean and clear; the multiple sensors work just the way you want them to; the remote apps work very well; installation is easy. All I need now is 2 more thermostats and a few more sensors.  More than one room?  Get ecobee.
5.0	Love the convenience of having my opener on my key
5.0	Our fuse box kept switching off from the water hitting it outside. It hasn't happened since this was installed.
5.0	Bought this for my grandsons skateboard themed room. They are large enough to make a good impact, and look classy!  Love it!
5.0	Solid adapter that will reduce the fitting size to a garden hose or higher capacity pump hose. So far so good.
5.0	So far so good very easy to install I guess time will tell
5.0	Satisfied with price and works just as well as oem. Planning on ordering three more for use later on.
5.0	I tried the other and it was so-so. Then I purchased this at Home Depot for under $5.00.  The caulking remover is versatile and even has a little hook underneath to hook into the nasty old caulk left in the gap and you yank it out.  The best part of this product is the applicator.  It has a soft silicone applicator that's in the end of the plastic.  It's hard to see in the picture until you magnify the pic.  Anyway, it's easy to use and very smooth.  I did a small job (about 5 feet) with the other product and it looks amateurish.  The did another job (about 10 feet) with this product and it looks professional.  Buy it and you'll be happy!!
5.0	Swapping out filters on the fridge is easy and the water tastes great.  I don't think there's anything else to review on this product.  Drink more water from your refrigerator. Good for you and uses less plastic bottles.
5.0	installed and ready to get another 10 years out of that dryer
5.0	this worked fine with my three-year old Kitchenaid KPSF20EVMS9. Installation of the icemaker was fairly easy. Only trouble was removing the top drawer out of the bottom level freezer to get to the icemaker.
1.0	The description is very misleading. There is nothing about the item that is a switch.<br />This is ONLY a Zone Controller. Leviton says it this way:<br />&#34;Item Description<br />Vizia RF + 1-Button Zone Dimming Controller/Virtual Dimming Remote 3-way RF Controller for multi-location control, with LED locator and brightness display. &#34;
5.0	roomy, sturdy, good looking
5.0	I work as a bag handler at the airport, and I go through gloves pretty fast. As a woman, it's always a challenge to find women's gloves made for hard work.    I used to buy the black Mechanix gloves with the velcro, thinking they were the best. I bought them by the dozen because the fingertips would be worn through anywhere between a couple days and a week and half. The velcro would be shot in about 10 days. It sucked and it was expensive.    Then I tried these. I bought three pairs eight months ago. I still have all three pairs. Not a single one blew a fingertip. And because these have no velcro, they didn't become uncomfortable or start falling off your hands.     In addition, they are machine washable (at least mine were) and held up to working in the rain. These are so far superior to the velcro-wrist ones that I'm really surprised that anyone buys those. Well worth the money!! Comfortable, sturdy protection that holds up to heavy wear and frequent cleaning.
5.0	The filters are as good as the original. No problem with fit or leaking I will buy these again can't beat the price.
5.0	I'm finding dozens of uses for these things!
5.0	great filters at a reasonable price.
5.0	The filter performed as expected. This was a good experience after the bad one with the previous product. I recommend it to all.
1.0	"Bought this to use with my Black and Decker 18v drill/etc battery charger. These chargers are \\""Dumb\\"" and will fry your battery over time, so you need to turn off or put a timer on it so you don't overcharge.  This little item fit the bill perfectly.<br /><br />Edit 2-12:<br />Ok, there is some kind of error in this thing, noticed a long time ago but just now getting around to it.  The 1st one worked great for 9 mos, then began having erratic timing.  Got another one, same thing but right out of box.  Avoid this item."
5.0	Just bought this brand new innovative product.<br />Love that this can install in a desk or kitchen drawer to allow charging devices to be put away instead of on the counter!<br />The cord that connects the power supply in the back of the cabinet to the outlet in the drawer is protected by what looks like a hollow bike chain so that it is flexible but can't get pinched or caught up in the drawer.<br />In addition to standard 3-prong electrical outlets, it also has USB ports for charging your I-Phone or I-Pad (or similar) without the plug end piece.<br />I am an architect and bought this to show my custom home clients.  It appears well constructed and I think my clients will really like it.
5.0	The filter works as it is designed to do and by shopping I got them about half of what I paid last year.
5.0	Excellent product, I have had it over a year now and use it nearly everyday. It produces the freshest, cleanest tasting water you will ever drink, the pets even notice the difference.<br /><br />*****UPDATE 12/2/2013*****<br /><br />I have had this distiller for about 2 years now and use it 5-7 times each week.  Our municipal water has a terrible bleach smell and it seems at high demand times it's even worse, I guess they just dump extra bleach in the system to make up for not cleaning the water properly.  We never drink the tap water and until we discovered this product we were buying bottled water, this distiller also cut our recycling amount in half, no more plastic gallon jugs and water bottles.  I noticed that the condensation coils below the fan on the top of the unit were collecting dust and stuff so today I took it apart to clean the coils with the hope that it will be working as good as the first day we used it.  After reading other reviews I decided to clean the inside of the unit with white vinegar in place of the chemicals that came with it. I filled the base slightly above the fill line with undiluted white vinegar (about a gallon), brought it to a boil with the top off for 20 minutes as directed on the chemical bottle that came with it.  As the vinegar boiled you can actually watch the residue break off and dissolve/fizzle leaving the inside almost as clean and bright as it was when new. Thanks to all for posting there reviews and helping me keep this excellent product like new.
5.0	I truly thought I was going to have to break out the router and chisel and spend hours to make this fit around a heavy 40 year old wooden door.  I installed everything in maybe 15 minutes.  I spent more time doubting it would fit than installing.  Everything went in place with ease, with no special chiseling or routing and everything fits perfect.  After I removed the old door strike, I lined up the EZ Armor door strike with the existing locks (and they were not installed to anything standard), and I marked the top screw hole position with a hole punch, I drilled the hole, then inserted the top screw with the drill.  I then drilled the other holes and popped the screws in in about a minute.  I was shocked it was that easy. The hinge plates and the plates that mount on the door were just as easy, if not easier. I should have filmed this installation.  It is scary to look at the door strike plates I took out and the little screws that held them in place.  Every outside door should have this level of protection.
1.0	It came poorly shipped. The boxes were crushed but the candles were fine. The size is too small for my purpose. I need them a little taller. I recommend this product only if it is shipped differently.
5.0	work as advertised. and easy install.
5.0	Yes this item is a little expensive however considering the lack of local availability in my area for the water filter I needed for my refrigerator it was a very reasonable purchase.
5.0	These lanterns are wonderful, be gentle, get the right temp outside and let the gases build. They float forever!
1.0	Someone should have wore loves when putting them together... There are fingerprints underneath that you cannot get rid of :(
1.0	The descriptionof the packaging was unclear and I ended up ordering 2 packages of 4 when I only needed one package.  Also, they did not fit the casters I ordered.
5.0	got just what I expected ....great value, good service
5.0	The area of the states I live in has awful tap water. It's necessary to filter it at least 1x unless you grew up in this area and are used to it or you just don't have any sense of smell/taste. Anyway, I pair a Pur tap filter up with a Brita pitcher and it works great. Turns nasty water into pure no taste drinking or water to cook with. These replacements can be kind of pricey at your local retailer so picking them up on Amazon is a good idea. Especially if you need to filter a lot of water.
1.0	I had purchased similar lights in the past and the quality of the lights has diminished greatly. When the lights arrived I felt that they were used or a return from another customer.  Two of the lights had burnt out bulbs and had to be returned.
5.0	Beautiful product! A perfect warm temperature for a low lighting atmosphere and no heat emission. I will be purchasing more.
1.0	This is the worst camera I have ever seen. Unfortunately its the only camera that will work with the system. Do yourself a favor and get another security system, with cams that show something besides pixels.
5.0	Exactly what I was looking for: slim-profile, lightweight but sturdy and not ugly. Easy/smooth to use, and to tote from room to room. Yes, the barrage of warning stickers was a bit comical, and it took about 15 min + goo gone to get them all off. I actually enjoy those sorts of tasks, but I can see how it can be irritating. Though not something to keep me from purchasing again or recommending.
5.0	Works great! I painted my Mom's entire stucco house in probably three hours. I started off using the adapter for the gallon can but it turned out to be too much of a pain, if the gun was a few feet higher than the can it wouldn't pick it up so I had to constantly lift the can. I ended up just using the cup and it worked much better. It sprays great, cleanup was somewhat of a pain but when done the gun is like new again, I even got virtually all the paint off the outside of the gun and cup but I spent about 45 minutes on the clean up. I would definitely buy this paint gun again.
5.0	I had to do a bit of drawer modifications to get these to work properly in a retro-fit, but it was well worth it. These are rock solid and gave my otherwise unremarkable drawers a real feel of high end.<br />I'm mixed on the need to buy the (absolutely necessary) locking devices separately. It does give you a choice of what type to go with, but for a novice like me I ended up having to wait another few days for them. On the plus side, removing the drawers is almost eerily easy. They just kind of float on the rails. No problems so far with that.
5.0	Very solid and great for that area that has only one outlet!
5.0	I've purchased about 12 of these in order to replace my incandescent recessed lighting.  They are a great replacement and I've had no issues with dimming them.
5.0	Instead of spending $200 on a new opener, I spent $1.75 and 20 minutes and got my Genie Screw Drive working again.   Tips on replacing:  disconnect screw rail with door open so you can lay the rail on top of the door.  Use a ladder with at platform that you can place the motor head on after you disconnect it from the ceiling.   Watch your wires when you are moving the motor head around - so you don't pull any out accidentally.  When you remove the old coupler, (it just pulls out) make sure to remove any debris left inside the hole it goes into before you put in the new coupler.   Reconnect the screw rail to the motor head before you mount the motor head back on the ceiling - easier to align the holes the bolts go into.   Make sure you remount the motor head straight so that the screw rail is perpendicular to the garage door.   If your door starts and stops after you replace the coupler, you need to adjust the force screws on the motor head.
5.0	It is so nice to be able to find specific parts online for those &#34;easy fix&#34; items around the home. This part arrived in two days and was exactly the fix for the one on our microwave that had lost a retaining tab over years of use. Took 2 seconds to fix. I like how the photos from this vendor place the parts on a grid of 1&#34; x 1&#34; squares so you can validate dimensions visually before ordering. I have ordered far too many things based on specifications measurements that were just flat wrong, the photos don't make that mistake.
1.0	First of all, this shower head LOOKS very nice, I have no complaint with that.  But it has five settings: one is so hard it is painful, and the other four are so weak it's almost like having a baby spit on you.  If you want your shower to have water pressure that is anywhere between pain and practically undetectable, you should definitely search further.  I wish I liked this: it's nice to look at.  But I am very sorry I bought it.
5.0	Plastic closet rod holders break way too often.  These will last forever.
1.0	The 1 star does not indicate that I hate his product. The issue i have with it, is that on the day that I actually needed it, Power Failure in the building that I work, and this was purchased for just such an event, it completely failed after about ten seconds of use and i stood there in the dark.<br />  Ironically enough, i was previously carrying another flashlight, heavier, bigger...but it was never unreliable. This one is being sent back. Carrying again my TrustFire TR-3T6...bigger, heavier...but its not failed yet.
5.0	We purchased these doorknobs to replace the old ones inside our home. We wanted locks with keys and these were easy to install, look really nice and you can re-key them to any key you would like. I love that feature because I do not have to keep track of 6 different keys, just 1. Great product for a good price.
5.0	works great and as expected
1.0	Stopped working after 3 days, what a cheap alarm. would not scare a fly away.please do not buy one to scare anyone off.
5.0	I had previously purchased some smaller LED bulbs (http://amzn.com/B00CRHG63Y) to use in a tower fixture that were too dim and threw a warmer/golden light instead of a bright, crisp white. So I ordered these as replacements. They are GREAT! To me they seem easily as bright as a 40W bulb and really light the fixture up beautifully; however, it is a cold/white light. The color of light is a very personal preference. To some, this white light may seem too cold or harsh but my place is really dark so I love it.<br /><br />There is a TINY lag between flipping the switch and these guys lighting up, but nowhere near as long as a CF bulb's delay.  In fact, if the switch didn't turn on multiple lights simultaneously, I probably wouldn't even have noticed the delay. I can highly recommend these bulbs.
5.0	Its was nice and looks neat and i haven't placed it on my wall yet but it was nice one i got it.
5.0	Shipped very quickly!  Exactly what I needed to make my own chalk paint.  Item came with recipe for the paint mix.  Will buy again!
5.0	Best and cheapest security system out! Easy to install and use. I have experienced no problems as of yet.
5.0	This is the best hand lotion for men, and even women, on the market!<br />This is the 3rd time I've bought OKeefe's!  I have given them to my friends and family as gifts and they all love it!
5.0	Just what I wanted! These are very nice and useful feet. Ordered them for my Technics SB-LX7's and they are perfect. They lift the speakers up about 3/4 of an inch and they stick to the bottom very well so be sure to place them evenly because you will not beable to get them off. Will buy again if needed.
5.0	we got 4 of these for various places in the house.  They work great, they give just enough light to see by, but not enough to disturb.  We have them in the baby's room, daughter's room and 2 bathrooms.
5.0	Needed a ceiling fan for my laundry room, but it is a fairly small area. This fan works perfectly...keeps the air moving and has the light fixture built in.
1.0	If I could give it zero stars I would. I had it for about a minute and the knot holding it all together broke.
5.0	I have 4 of these lights and found them to be very helpful.  Our civic club purchased 10 to be handed out for Neighborhood Night Out to several<br />older seniors.  We felt this would be a good thinking of you gift.  It is something everyone can use.  I will have more feed back after October 2nd and will let you know how our seniors liked them.
5.0	This worked great for me and I was able to repair my LG washing machine on my own quickly and easily. If you have any questions or trouble check out the videos on Repair Clinic they are very well done. No problems whatsoever since installing this new pump.  It is an easy repair and takes about 30 minutes if you go slow.<br /><br />What is really fantastic is having these kind of repair parts available on Amazon Prime - very helpful!
5.0	Kind of funny that the Duck Brand has you coming and going.  Buy their duct tape.  Then, buy their adhesive remover!  This works great at removing scotch tape from counters, removing price tags etc.  It has a nice scraper on the cap that helps with the removal.
5.0	After being quoted way more than i thought it should cost by a pro I went shopping for a better way to paint since i really hate all the back n forth and up n down time suck of it.<br />It seriously took me 2 minutes to paint a 10' x 12' wall minus edging. I completed the whole room with vaulted ceilings in about a total of 5 hours including the hand edging with standard brush and set-up/tear down over the course of 3 days in btn driving kids around and doing regular mom stuff. I got mine at lowes for $25 bcz i wanted to return it and not pay shipping fees if i didn't like it.<br />Further there was zero splatter or ladder climbing till edging time which saved time. I used almost a gallon of paint but the stick saved lots of paint for me wrapping roller after use and not spreading all over trays.<br /><br />I spent $35 paint + $25 roller already had brush. So $60 instead of the $350 i was quoted by a pro. Of course i only did one coat but still it saved a bundle and was waaaaaaay easier than the tray dip method. I will enlist my husband to help save another $2k on the rest of the house. The paint pros are probably using similar tools and making a killing.
1.0	Ok 1 start it is because the devices are compatible with the HUB!  How am I to use the hub if its limited in what it can control for z-wave devices....
5.0	Good quality plastic runner.  Neutral tan color works well with most stain choices. Glued easily to wood using 2-part epoxy.
5.0	These have been great for storing our kayaks, on the dock and in the garage. You can mount them at a height that's easy to lift the boat to. You do have to be careful not to pull the sleeve off when you're taking thy kayaks off the brackets.
5.0	Super light to place where you don't have an electrical connection and no sunlight to use a solar. Easy to change out the batteries and they last several months. Great light.
5.0	Love these lights as I can block out &#34;Blue light&#34; and/or adjust based on my mood, if I'm entertaining, the season, and even for the type of movie I might want to watch.<br /><br />Love them!<br /><br />-G<br /><br />P.S. I'm more relaxed and feel more calm.
5.0	Its good for its intended purpose
5.0	Beautiful candles.  Nice light and scent.  The timer works great!
5.0	Worked out fine for  our customer's favorite desk chair, hard to find in metric thread
1.0	I purchased these bulbs because the listing stated 80 Lumens. Comparing to a normal incandescent of 4 or 5 Lumens I couldn't wait to see the lighting. WRONG. The manufacturer does not state the Lumens, gives a different lifetime (25,000 hours) and the packaging lists an annual cost of $0.16.... The given specification must be for a different product. This bulb is a single wimpy LED.
5.0	We have a long driveway and needed advance warning when someone is coming toward house.  Mounted this in trees and it works great.
5.0	Raises the bed enough to use the space underneath the bed for storage.  Think I'll get more for all my beds.
5.0	Ordered these blankets to cover a heavy piece of leaded glass and a big framed poster. Both moved from Boston to Seattle and were completely undamaged.
5.0	Works much like a Maestro Dimmer from Levitron.  Fades lights on and off with a single touch.  Hold your finger on the touchpad to manually adjust the brightness up or down.  Zitrades sources great products and no exception here.  My only commentary back to them would be to possibly include the DC 5.5mm plugs for ultra simple set up.
1.0	Did not work in my samsung fridge. It leaked and flow was slow. I even tried a second one thinking I got a dud.
5.0	The previous homeowners installed a genie opener, but no wireless remote at the door...<br /><br />I bought this so I wouldn't have to walk into the house to open the garage door.<br /><br />Easy to hang, easy to program!  Highly recommended!
5.0	Very nice  Would order again
1.0	really cheap but you get what you pay for.
5.0	Ordered two 52 and one 42 for our new outdoor covered patio.  Arrived promptly and well packed.  Great product.  Great value.  Too early to comment on the outdoor application.  I'm satisfied.
5.0	It looks cute in my room. Thank you for the fast response!
5.0	I use the item to clean the hard to reach areas on my lawn tractor, under the mower deck, under side of the tractor frame. It's great for the tight areas, gives great pressure and I would recommend it to anyone to buy one.
5.0	This item is hard to find in home depot so I order it online. It arrived in good order and I am satisfied.
5.0	This fan came quickly and well packaged.  the finish is top quality and installed easily with an optional extension rod.  The wires are long enough to allow up to a 4 foot extension rod without adding extra length. The included rods are for flush mount  or 6 inch extension.<br />There was no problem with wobble or balance, the fan came with a balance kit just in case.<br />The fan blades are reversible, with dark walnut on one side and a light teak color on the other.  both look very good with the bronze finish.
5.0	I ordered the Wall Decorations for my grandaughters bedroom and received them within the expected delivery date which is a big plus for me.  She loves them and had fun putting them on her bedroom wall.  Thank you for a positive shopping experience.  Happy Holidays!
1.0	I bought two lamps. I don't know what happened. Different heights and it were dirthy. Feel like used one.
5.0	I was replacing one that I had for some years the remote went bad .they work perfectly if used within the distance recommend
5.0	great product...plenty of room
5.0	Having recently bought this very good spotlight has enabled my wife and I to better take care of our horses at night when they get spooked for any reason.    I live in Horse Country in South Florida for the greater part of the year, it can get very dark at night around these parts since there is no electricity in the stables, running a generator there is not an option.    Lugging one of those rechargeable halogen lights whose charge only lasts about 20 minutes gets very tiresome, especially when you are checking on restless horses early hours of the morning and the light starts dimming on you.    This Cyclops CYC-9WS Thor-by-Sirius light guarantees us ample time to get to the stable, with more than adequate light output and plenty of charge left on it.    My wife likes it so much that she now wants one for her use in case power goes out in the house and I am not there with mine, as it some times happens.    Great light to take with you in your truck or car since it fits in most glove boxes, too.    About securing the red lens, you are supposed to line up two grooves on the inside walls of the lens with two small notches about an inch past the front of the spotlight body. Once aligned, gently push the lense on as far as it will go and twist it clockwise about 1/4 of an inch to lock it in place.    Once this is done, the lens should remain securely in place and not fall off.    Those notches on the body of the spotlight, one on top and the other on the bottom, are very small and you really have to look and feel for them.    ------ June 26, 2014 update -----  I have finally had to replace the battery in it. Not a bad run at all, still amazing!!!    Now, with a new battery in place, it shines once again, as it did when brand new. I could not ask for more from this spotlight. Wife and I are extremely pleased with the service this spot light has given us.
5.0	Very nice looking fixture. Easy to install. Had to buy online to match our shower & tub fixtures that we bought at the store. We are happy with the product and the delivery was ontime.
1.0	I ordered this item on Amazon from Utimate Data, to use in my Fitbit pedometer.  These only last about 3 weeks versus 2-3 MONTHS for the original battery.  Examining the package, I now notice that they are NOT Maxell batteries, but generic &#34;Lithium&#34; batteries.  And made in China, not Japan. However,  At $3.50 for 25 batteries, I'll just use them up.  But beware - you may not be getting the batteries you are expecting!  They are cheap crappy, low quality batteries with very short life.
1.0	I'm sure this toilet is lovely. However, it wasn't the right one for my household and we had to return it. That was 2 months ago and I have yet to see the refund.  I held off for some time writing this review, attempting to give them the benefit of the doubt, but that didn't turn out well at all. Although customer service is very polite when I call to inquire; I've gotten nowhere. Apparently they can't call their warehouse directly to inquire about the returned item that should be reimbursed, they can only send email inquiries. Thats dumb. I have never heard of a company that is unable to have full communication with its counterparts. Sending yet another inquiry email is not the best response to my 2 month delay. If you're buying a product from the Pluming Depot I surely hope its the one you need because you'll die first if you wait for an issue to be resolved.
5.0	I have cats and this works just great because I have to change once a month
5.0	Perfect for adding another line for an icemaker without cutting or soldering pipe
5.0	Love it! Buying a second one for the shower downstairs!
5.0	I bought a MPP over 20 years (Pre Internet in my part of the world) ago so mine has the cable on it.  Between this and my Highlift Jack I've never been where I could not work myself back out and have moved or lifted a number of large things including 2 outbuildings/sheds.<br /><br />When I bought it I expected to replace it with a Warn bumper winch once I had saved up enough money for one, but found this so useful and cost effective that I never did.  The MPP also allows you to pull your vehicle from any angle instead of just from the front which is very useful.<br /><br />I'll have to check and see how the list the weight ratings now, but when I bought mine the numbers listed were lift and were doubled for a pull or drag load.  Being able to pull at a rate of 12,000 pounds is quite useful at times.  The handle is the fuse and will bend before you break the MPP which is a nice feature.<br /><br />Several trucks later this is still in my truck box waiting for the next time I (Or someone else) get in over my head.<br /><br />SRC
5.0	This light is surprising bright for an led flashlight as many I have tried are dim or too &#34;yellowy.&#34;  Can't go wrong for the money, especially since they give you batteries with it.<br />I reach for it a lot.
5.0	I repaired my microwave in a flash...and the best part is that I was sent enough to repair 2 more microwaves!  Great seller!
5.0	good price on hard to find intermediate base lamps.
5.0	Compact receiver is very easy to hide in a book case but the signal is long and loud enough to let one know when something sets off the sensor.  I replaced another brand of driveway alert and the Skylink is more sensitive and has better range in a wooded area.
5.0	Good product, good price......so far, so good.
5.0	Bought these with a matching pulls. Looks great and the price was better than big box store. I highly recommend.
5.0	It's a good filter; It's a bit more expensive but you get more gallons (750) of water from it than other cheap, generic filters (you get less gallons of water). So, in the long run, this saves you more money than the generic ones. Another thing I would want to point out is that this filter (newly installed) gives us water with alkalinity of about ph8+, so we don't have to buy those bottled water from stores which when tested, showed water alkalinity of ph6 to ph7. For one's health, I recommend this filter.
5.0	The lamp is so beautiful!  Looks great in the dining area in the kitchen.  Had intended to get an inverted lamp but lights do not penetrate the lamp and all the light is directed up to the ceiling, so I'm glad I bought this one.  Well worth it's price.  Would highly recommend it!
5.0	Love this.  I like the features and like that you can push the lock button from the outside and now I don't have to lock the front door with a key.
1.0	What a piece of junk. I bought a house that had a whirlpool dish washer in it. I typically love whirlpool products. After a little over a year use I found this piece had fallen off. The holding pin had worn down. So I replaced it. Next one didn't last but about four months. The next time I purchased this I ordered 3 of them. You have to have this for the dish washer to clean the top rack sufficiency. The pin that holds this item up is poorly made. Until it is time for a new dish washer this piece is a necessary evil. On the upside it take about three minutes to replace.
5.0	this wall decal is everything I wanted and more and I just love it arrived very fast. but I must say when putting this on your wall cut it in half and apply it in sections. all in all a Great buy and I really love it. I think you will too.
5.0	These set of 4 candles are great, they add carefree lighting to any area of the home.  Soft glow that feels soothing and sets a lovely warm mood.
5.0	Heavy weight plastic that lasts for years. Suction cups on the ends keep water from getting on the floor. I had this hanging in my shower for over 10 years of good service.
5.0	This is a very helpful item for people with arthritic knees who have difficulty rising from the commode.  The arms and height make it much easier to rise to a standing position.  It also is easy to install and remains firmly attached to the toilet.  Finally it is easy to keep clean.
5.0	Great product. We own rentals, and replace all of our kitchen faucets with this Peerless 221.
1.0	Tried several of the hangers and all with bad results. One fell and broke right away. The glue seems old also.
5.0	Follow me on Instagram for pics.<br /> Focus_david<br />Love the decal. 2010 focus. I put it on my rear window. Love it. Easy to install
5.0	We absolutely love these medicine cabinets.  We installed 2 in our newly remodeled bathroom.  We installed them recessed and found they were very easy to install.  Love that the shelves are adjustable.  Love that we have 3 mirrors.  If we had not recessed these, there were 2 mirrors to be installed on the sides.  These really add to the modern feel of our new bathroom.  They were well packaged.  I'd buy these again if I had a need.  One of the contractors for our bathroom remodel stated that he really liked them too.
5.0	I have been using Joy Bidet C-1 for about two months. I love this product. It is easy to install and use. It cleans very well.
1.0	This product can barely hold itself up let alone curtains.  It also bends when you try to tighten it.  It has very weak construction.
1.0	I HAVE CASABLANCA FANS IN THE PAST THAT WERE GREAT AND DID GIVE ANY PROBLEMS. HOWEVER, THE CASABLANCA PANAMA REVERSIBLE 6 SPEED DC FAN WAS FULL OF PROBLEMS. THE FAN HAD A JERKING MOTION AND WOULD NOT RESPOND TO THE REMOTE CONTROL WHEN YOU WANTED TO REVERSE THE DIRECTION. ON THE LOWEST SPEED IT WOULD RUN SLOWER AND SLOWER AND QUIT TURNING AND TRY TO GO OPPOSITE DIRECTION. THE DIRECTIONS WERE FOLLOWED AND THE REMOTE WAS PROGRAMMED AGAIN AND AGAIN. NOW I KNOW WHAT YOU MIGHT BE THINKING THAT THE INSTALLATION WAS DONE BY A NOVICE WHO DID NOT WIRE OR FOLLOW ALL INSTRUCTIONS. BY THE WAY, THERE WAS NOT A LIGHT KIT AND THE REMOTE RECEIVER WAS BUILT INTO THE FAN. I PAID A MASTER ELECTRICIAN TO INSTALL THE FAN. HE MENTIONED THE MINUTE THAT THE FAN RAN A FEW MINUTES THAT IT WAS JERKING AND THAT WAS NOT NORMAL. WE WORKED WITH FAN UNTIL WE GAVE UP AND I SENT E-MAIL FOR A RETURN LABLE FROM AMAZON. AMAZON IS NOT AT FAULT. I HAVE PURCHASED ALL TYPES OF PRODUCTS FROM AMAZON IN THE PAST AND WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO.
1.0	Doesn't adhere to wall after a few uses.
1.0	As everyone else already mentioned, and I clearly should have taken note of, this lock is junk.  I bent the cheap key trying to set my combination.  Apparently, the trick is you have to push it in really hard before turning it.  You can't just push it in and turn it, you need to use force. Also, this is brass as depicted in the picture.  It used to be a brass lock, but now it is just a cheaply painted gold color.
5.0	I love the pine cones on this piece. It looks gorgeous in our rustic home. Perfect. I would have preferred to get a screw with it that was the same color as the piece.
5.0	They work great, they light up the walkway just have to make sure they are positioned correctly in the sun to get charged. Happy with the purchase.
5.0	Honda Civic for my grandson's 2nd birthday.  His dad loves Hondas and my grandson loves cars.  Such a cute idea for his room.
5.0	Great quality!!!! Believe me worth the cost.
5.0	beautiful, but it's getting time to replace the battery :(
5.0	I love this one too as I can put a touch of Dr. Who stuff around my house!  Another great conversational piece when I have company over at our house.
5.0	Best toilet seat on the market based on our needs and assessment.
5.0	If you're looking to oil some wood, this is it. It's also food safe so if it gets in your mouth, while oiling wood, you won't get sick.
1.0	I  would not buy this product again. The back plate screws to the wall. The hook slips onto the backplate except that slipping is the wrong word. They needed to be hammered on, the result being minor cracks in the drywall. I put the hooks within about 6 inches of drywall corner bead. The crack was along the bead.  Do not recommend.
5.0	The cleaning lady says this is the best. My stainless sinks are 20 years old used a lot every day still beautiful. Expensive but worth it--hard to find best available and price on Amazon
5.0	This thing sticks like glue!  Got two for our new tiled shower so we didn't have to drill holes.  Perfect!!
5.0	Philips bulbs have always worked for me.  The product dims well and the color of the light is great.  Will use more of them.
5.0	I used this for my hampton bay fan and it functioned just fine.
5.0	My garage door opener is too old for modern wireless models, but this one worked great! All I had to do was hook it up to my two wires on the garage door opener and set the code. Worked like a charm!
5.0	Easy installation and wiring and works perfectly
5.0	Great product, very small...was looking for a small device to mount in car, since the car did not have HomeLink.  Easy and quick to program.
5.0	All Shark Bite products have been simple and easy to use. The have a good quality feel and do not feel cheap like the other brands that you can purchase at other DIY type stores.
5.0	I went to Home Depot to buy a new garage door opener. It was $35.00 and I didn't even know if it would work. I did not buy it. I came home and ordered this one on line for less than $15.00 and it works perfect. What a great savings.     Thank You
1.0	We installed this faucet for a customer about a year ago. The lever part of the handle came off, and looking at it I realized the female threads in the handle body were completely stripped. The is very shoddy construction, and what makes it worse is a web search was completely fruitless in finding any real information. No parts diagram, parts list, suppliers, anything. All I could find was the &#34;Lightinthebox&#34; site, which is completely useless unless you want to buy a new faucet. Advise staying away from this brand.
5.0	These battery powered LED lights are intended to provide illumination in areas where it is only needed for short periods and on demand. They will sense movement and/or heat, and then remain on as long as the movement remains.<br /><br />They will work only in darkness, so in order to test them it's either necessary to try using them in a very dark room, or you can cover up the light sensor that is used to sense the ambient lighting level. They will not go on if there is even a fairly low level of light in the location already. But in dark conditions, they work great. They'll sense movement from a few feet away and then turn on and provide a very nice and strong amount of light. They'll stay on for either 12-15 seconds or so, if the moment does not continue, or they will stay on for as long as movement in the vicinity of the light continues to be detected by the motion sensor.<br /><br />Initially I had difficulty in getting these to work, until I finally realized that the room had to be very dark in order for them to turn on. Once I understood that, they worked just as expected.<br /><br />Unlike some LED lights, these use 4 x AAA batteries rather than a rechargeable battery. That could be either a pro or a con depending upon how you feel about rechargeables vs using disposable batteries. Lifespan of the batteries in the light will of course depend upon how often they are used, and where they are placed, but since LED lights draw very little power the batteries should last for a reasonably long time.<br /><br />The lights include a magnetic strip with an adhesive backing strip that can be attached to the underside of a cabinet or wherever you wish to place the light. One great advantage to this design is the flexibility of locating it anywhere, since it's not dependent upon AC or other power.<br /><br />These are quite small, just 7 inches or so in length, but the light output is quite good.<br /><br />I don't see the practicality of using these in a kitchen unless they are intended as simply a night light type of function. The illustration shown here on Amazon almost suggests that they can be placed under cabinets to provide lighting throughout the kitchen as the normal source of light, but in my opinion these are not suitable for that purpose. I think that closet use or other infrequently accessed location is more what these will be best used for. If they are used in a kitchen as shown in the illustrations here, then they will only turn on when the kitchen is otherwise dark and movement is detected. So, as a sort of night light for the kitchen, they would be ok.<br /><br />I don't think that multiple strips of these lights could be used together, because the light sensor for any of the lights would detect any of the others that might be operating, and it would not go on. It would not be possible to have several of these in the same room and expect them to all operate simultaneously, in other words.<br /><br />They are available in both a 'warm white' and 'cool white' color temperature. Again, for the occasional use I'm not sure the difference is as important as it would be for lights used for constant illumination, reading, or other purpose.<br /><br />I received this light as a sample at no cost from the seller and for the purpose of review, and I have no affiliation with either the seller, or Amazon.The illustration shown here on Amazon almost suggests that they can be placed under cabinets to provide lighting throughout the kitchen as the normal source of light, but in my opinion these are not suitable for that purpose.

5.0	It prevents my water from tasting like poor people water.
5.0	solid and easy to attach to frames--looks good and provides attractive lighting.  some of these can be flimsy and cheap looking
1.0	"Fortunately, only one with the help of the oh, so kind and helpful representative of BTSC. My much anticipated purchase arrived this morning, and after help from BTSC in locating bulb and cord, which were securely packaged, seperately from heavier lamps, I have one of the VERY lovely lamps plugged in and glowing radiantly. The other three are gifts, however much I would like to keep them too. I already have a salt basket lamp, which I really like, but this lamp is stunning. I highly recommend this lamp, and BTSC. Great product, and fantastic customer service!<br /> Update : Dec.16,2012  Having solved the dilemma of cord /bulb, I ordered another set of these wonderful lamps. Of the 4 delivered, 2 were obviously defective, wood bases not secured to salt lamps. Unable to fix with screwdriver,as recommended per e -mail exchange with seller. Further discussion via e -mail, seller asks for my phone number so issue can be tended to. After complying with request, I received VERY condescending reply,\\"" Sure, that 's what I 'm here for,  I 'll call as soon as I get a free second! \\""That was two days ago! I 've still not heard from them. These lamps were to be gifts, but I cannot give a defective lamp as a present. I 've got to wonder what kind of quality control is in place here, 25% defective products? However, these are VERY lovely lamps, and if you 're fortunate to get them in ideal condition, they 're great, but if you get the 25% defective items, so sorry, you're stuck with it! Good -luck to you. Oh, thanks GK!"
1.0	My licensed master plumber said this item was a piece of junk.  It fell apart so II did not bother returning it.  A $60 lesson
5.0	Exactly what I ordered and arrived as expected.  I haven't tested it in a fire or anything, so I can't comment to that effect.  The key turns, the lock works, and it feels like I could drop it off a building without it opening.  Well done!
5.0	I use it for my shoes. It is easy to use. And a 60-foot can be used for a long time!
5.0	We use these to ID equipment from a distance. We have a number of wireless mics and need to tell one transmitter from another by sight. We tie a wrap of the same color around the antenna of the xmtr/rcver pair. Works great.
5.0	Easy to install. Very quiet.The instructions were reasonably well written... if you get a step out of order then you will have to go back and put the components together in the correct order. This replaced another opener and the brackets on the garage ceiling did not have to be redone. And lastly... everything I needed was in the box.
5.0	very good service and fast i like the way i recived the pack . i recomend the person for the service
5.0	I have used other TSA locks in the past but these are, by far, the best.<br />The location of the numerals allows very easy entering of your code. I<br />highly recommend them.
5.0	This is a pretty bad @$ showerhead with a very reasonable price point. The five settings all work like a champ. My personal favorite is the combo full body and jet style spray. The massaging pulse setting is really great as well....and, it actually leaves me feeling much cleaner than my old shower head did. I credit the filter for that. I am definitely glad to have purchased this.
5.0	Product is easy to program and use. A must for keychain, bicycle or auto use. It's priced right, and delivered quickly.
5.0	Very pleased.. Price and Quality will purchase another Will see how it holds up for the long term. A ok
5.0	Home maintenance is beginning to be my jam. Finding exactly the right part and having it show up two days later makes it a whole lot easier! This kit had everything we needed to refurbish a seriously funky humidifier. Disaster averted!
5.0	There were some concerns when i read that it had a plastic taste to it..but after i ran through the steps they provide on start up I didn't have that problem. I cant tell you how much i love this! I keep it on a little stand in my kitchen and honestly the noise is very minimal. I also have a young child and love that i can turn off the hot water feature. This is great and one of the best price points.
5.0	I recently completed a ground - up restoration of a Powermatic Model 81 Band Saw.   This included replacing the original three-phase Leeson motor with a newer single-phase.  Leeson provided the exact size, power, and case needed.  This is a very smooth, quiet powerful 2hp motor.  The re-seller used by AMAZON was experiencing some hiccups in their processing of my order, but their response to my queries came quickly, were helpful, and courteous.  I know that when I purchase through AMAZON, that I have their backing and protection through their brokering process.
5.0	Very cool to see how much electricity things use, I also use this on a small solar set up tied into the house.  Nice, easy way to see how much electricity my solar panel is producing.
5.0	I bought two of them to build my house. They work beautifully and must if you are framing your house with only two people.
5.0	The parts came quickly and were the correct parts.  Installed without much trouble.
5.0	Bought 7 of these to replace old ones thru the house
5.0	I love these lights so bright, I want to decorate the whole house in these and wrap them around everything, There so long on the string...all you see is the  led lights.  Coper wirer string not visable  try not to tangle them.
5.0	Im 16 yrs old and I'm rewireing my 1964 ford falcon this wire was perfect for the job so I recommend to anyone looking for some wire at a low price
5.0	I've been using this tub/shower set in the master bath for over a year.  It does the job, has a good spray pattern, and doesn't leak.  The installation went smoothly without complaint.
5.0	The pressure from my showerhead seems to be much higher than it ever was!<br />Much more refreshing
1.0	I should have paid more attention to the bad reviews on this product--I wrongly figured that the bad reviews were written by crybabies, and that a GE product would be quite acceptable in the right hands. Actually, it's a piece of junk, poorly made, gives very little illumination, takes too many expensive batteries, and worst of all, quit working after two on/off cycles of the cheesy switch. Back she goes to Amazon. I was very happy with their return service, including printable RMA packing slip and prepaid USPS shipping lable!
5.0	Looks great in my kitchen, exactly what I was looking for at a great price. Arrived quickly and was easy for my handy dad to install.
5.0	This is the third Blanco board we have purchased. The 440152 is an excellent board. We particularly like the &#34;wrap&#34; feature that allows the board to fit snugly against a counter top
5.0	Great product, nails are a bit longer than I expected but should be ok with the larger pieces they are being used for.
5.0	It works just as I expected.  I use it to see if my front counter.  I can see who is there and how busy they are.
5.0	When I received this light bulb for review, I knew exactly where it was going....the laundry room!  With the previous light bulb that I had in my laundry room, there would be stains on my boy's shirts that I would miss simply because I couldn't see them.  It's not that the room was dark but man alive, with this new LED bulb, I can really see the clothes now and any stains that are there!  This is a nice bright light and really allows you to see clothes better.<br /><br />I definitely want to purchase more of these because of the savings that are made over time, with not replacing the light bulbs so often.  I'm all about recycling and using less and this definitely will assist me with that!<br /><br />Great product!
5.0	Plantation Red color was rich and deeply pigmented -used for repainting vinyl  window shutters and metal front door. Only one coat needed and worked well keeping a wet edge . My neighbor was so impressed, I painted hers too.<br />The best paint I have used in 40 years. Well worth the money.<br />Was surprised to see that the can lid was dented when taken out of the box though. There was no leakage or break in the seal. Otherwise , I would have returned it or sent Old Village a picture. Still a fan.<br />I am anxious to try new colors . I have used four others. Tom Hoffman,PA-C
5.0	Works very well however the price is too high.<br />It has been attached to the door of the refrigerator where recipes and other list are kept. Since the fridge is white guest think that the writing is on the fridge itself. :)
5.0	Great filter, works as advertised
5.0	Very good, very satisfied, will come back again!
5.0	Such a brilliant product for my basement where the light cord is hard to find in the dark & my hands always seem to be full.
5.0	Very girly! Easy to put on, just make sure you have a credit card to go over it once its placed where you want it.
5.0	As advertised. Part was new and workeedd perfectly.
5.0	Well built, it's super heavy duty, an has a grease fitting on it. Best of all is the price! Great buy!
5.0	Quieter than the old Badger that it replaced, which had started leaking due to cracks in the housing. I had previously installed one of these at the old residence, and liked it, so there wasn't really any question what I would put in the new house.
5.0	These knobs are well worth the money I spent..as they say, you get what you pay for.  They are beautiful.
5.0	I got this product over 2 weeks ago and it works very well, little high pitched noise when its on but it has to be absolutely quiet to hear it. Glows well in complete darkness, haven't tried it out in anything but complete dark. All in all its a great product for the price.
1.0	very flimzy and hard to install
1.0	Be careful regarding any mirror purchased from an American Standard bathroom collection. We bought an America Standard collection for a guest bath that is rarely used. The mirror started deteriorating within a couple of years of installation. American Standard will do nothing about it. We will not be purchasing any American Standard product since the company will not stand by the quality of its products.
1.0	UPDATE:<br />We've had this showerhead for a few months. At one point, we turned the water on and absolutely nothing, not a drop, came out. We messed with it, took it down, took it apart, still nothing. Apparently some kind of regulator in there had about a millimeter and that blocked all water flow. We had to pull really hard on the whole thing to kind of stretch it out and it worked again. Now a few weeks later it's freaking out again and water is coming out intermittently and an O-ring keeps coming off while showering. My new review title is what I just heard yelled from the bathroom. This item is nowhere near the quality of the original. Avoid it.<br /><br />Original review:<br />Bought this to upgrade and replace a much older version of this showerhead. Great product, good quality, excellent water pressure. Love the flexible hose!
5.0	This product does catch the unforeseen particles of dust and also cuts down on the household dusting leaving more time to enjoy the weekends of 1 less household chore to do.
5.0	perfect fit and price for an otherwise hard item to find
5.0	goes with the seaside theme i was going for
5.0	These hooks work great. I have tried other hooks that i bought from a store, and they all just wouldnt stick for more than a couple of hours. these hooks have been up for a few days now, and dont show any sign of falling. its even holding my heavy winter jacket, no problem !
5.0	Had another Ott lite previously.  It broke and decided to purchase another one because it worked so well.  Would recommend this to crafters for their work.
5.0	Big savings easy to install and would recommend it to any DIY person.
5.0	Never really heard of Ana Bath before this, but I'm glad I followed the advice in the reviews. Very happy with this product. Seems like our water pressure has gotten better, perhaps due to removing the constrictors.
5.0	A little tough to program after installed so be sure to install the batteries and program before installation.  It does the job!  I'd buy again!
5.0	I've used Watco before and I have always been amazed with the results. It will make your old woodwork look new again by simply rubbing it on your woodwork and letting it set about one minute and then wiping it off. It looks as if you have completely stripped the wood, refinished it and then put a high gloss shine on it. Be sure to choose a color closest to your finished woodwork. One quart goes a long ways; it would most likely be enough to do all of the cabinets in a very large kitchen.  It is a Great product and I highly recommended it!
5.0	The product arrived quickly in perfect condition. It's ready to use. I used the adhesive tape provided to press the door bell onto the front door trim and plugged in the receivers. Pressed the doorbell and both receivers worked instantly. There was no assembly involved and no need for the instructions to have it working instantly. It's still working perfectly. It looks nice, too. The push button on the front door is small -- not garish like some doorbells.  The price is low and the product is excellent. I was (and still am) very happy with it. It works!
5.0	We bought this to cover a scratch post for our 3 crazy cats. We initially ordered one roll but ended up needing 2. They both came very quickly. When we ran out of sisal we bought some from Home Depot (handy) but it smelled so strong of either an oil or chemical we decided to wait the 2 days to get the stuff from Amazon. This has a slight odor but nothing compared to the stuff from HD. Very happy with the product.
5.0	Great color and light output.  No noticeable difference from replacing the 50w halogens.  Would definitely buy again.
5.0	I don't know what I need to say about these, They did what they were designed to do... I would recommend  these bolts.
5.0	"Good durability: I first ordered this 5 years ago when our old float switch died.  It is still working well today.  We live in a wet area and our sump pump is running on sunny days too.<br /><br />I just ordered a backup after hurricane Irene reminded me that I don't have a backup float switch.  Thought I'd throw in a review here.<br /><br />I researched the three types of float switches out there.  Wide angle (this one, think of it as a buoy on a chain), mechanical (think of it as buoy threaded through a rod), diaphram (pressure sensing).  I ruled out diaphram pretty quickly, as the pumping range, i.e., pressure set point usually can't be adjusted.  Between wide angle and mechanical, wide angle can handle higher starting current draws (85A vs 60A for RVMS type) and large pumping ranges (you are only limited by the length of the cord and the size of your sump pit really), while mechanical (search for RVMS-10, RVMS-15, RVSM-20) has adjustable pumping range from 0.75 in to 6.5 in.<br /><br />Adjustment and range: I anchored the float switch to the 2\\"" NPT discharge pipe that comes out of the sump pump.  Activation and deactivation is at roughly 45 degree angle up and down respectively, and depending on your requirements you can decide how long your tether length should be, and how high up on the pipe should you anchor it.  Manual for this model shows that if you use 3 inch tether length, you have a pumping range of 5.5 in, although I don't know why you couldn't use shorter length.  One thing is for sure, if you want really small pumping range, then RVMS would be a better choice, as 0.75 inch would be pretty hard to achieve for this one.<br /><br />Failure modes: The design of these things are pretty simple.  Gravity opens or closes the electrical contacts based on the position/angle of the float.  There are two possible failure modes, contacts welded shut (pump always on) or infinite resistance (pump never on), which is how our old one failed.<br /><br />Duty cycles: If you live in a wet area like me, you probably want to go with the highest pumping range that will still keep your basement dry.  Otherwise, you are looking at a lot of on/off cycles in a year, and will eventually wear out the switch and/or the pump.<br /><br />The specs can be found online at<br />[...]<br /><br />This comes in different cord length, 10ft, 15ft, 25ft, 30ft."
5.0	These timers are great. I travel a lot and got three of these timers to make the house appear occupied. We have a three bedroom, one story house, and two of the bedrooms remained unused for 10 months out of the year. We placed a fake TV in each room, which can make the room look somewhat occupied. However, adding a table lamp plugged to one of these timers can really fool any would be thieved.<br /><br />I bought three of these timers; two for two table lamps placed in each unused rooms and one for a table lamp in the living room. We set the lamp in the living room to come on and off at interval times and at wake up time so we don't have to walk in the dark...it actually acts as a wakeup alarm. They are easy to program and I highly recommend them.
5.0	Inexpensive battery holders shipped from China. Hold the batteries nicely, clip together, appears to be decent quality plastic. No weird smells. Great deal for $4.
1.0	I ordered a white toilet seat. The picture was white and there was no other color listed in the porduct title. They shipped me a biscuit seat. Shipping & handling was $12. They will not compensate me for any shipping to return the seat or order a new seat, even though they admit that this is their mistake. Customer service says they will suggest that the photo be changed. They say there is nothing they can do for me.  I would never purchase from this outfit again.
1.0	"We thought Bagster would be a good alternative to a clunky dumpster. We're doing some landscaping, and have a very tight schedule for deliveries (dirt, gravel, rock, sod, etc.). We called Monday morning to schedule a pickup. We were having 10 tons of gravel delivered Saturday (5 days later) and thought the 5 day window would be sufficient to get the Bagster off our driveway, since the website claims it'll be picked up within 3 days. Thursday=no pickup. Friday=no pickup. After calling Friday, I was told I'd need to wait until (probably) Monday. We'll, thanks, but your lack of any sort of organization and failure to deliver according to your website has caused me to delay the delivery of gravel by a week. Thanks, Waste Management. Key word here is \\""waste.\\"""
5.0	This was a gift for my 4 yr. old niece. It is absolutely beautiful and high quality. All hand-crafted and the perfect gift! It came in excellent condition and my niece loves it, looks perfect in her room.
5.0	Water really tastes nicer.
5.0	Fast shipping .... nice quality....makes my CBG like like it was custom made.... thnx
5.0	Great well-made handles and at a great price.  Worked very well on all my doors
5.0	We had a customer that wanted to have the refrigerator door pulls to match the door cabinet handles. I was amazed to find that Amerock made large versions of the handles, and this worked out well.
5.0	Although the plastic appears flimsy, it does the job well.  Saves much time over our single can crusher (we really drink way too much pop). Can't speak to the longevity of this item, but for now we are very happy with it.
5.0	Perfect lighting. ..much cheaper than purchasing locally
5.0	WORKS GREAT - THANK YOU VERY MUCH
5.0	Worked great.  Used caulking to attach it to the lower section.
1.0	These are such a cute idea, but even if you use dry erase markers, they don't erase completely.  Kinda disappointed, but obviously can't return them.<br />Don't waste your money.
5.0	This is a great product. I was skeptical at first because of the low price but I was impressed. I actually have one in each bathroom. I would recommend and would also purchase again.
5.0	I purchased this filter because my old one had worn out completely! My dryer model is LG DLEX7177RM, but this LG 5231EL1003B filter replaces it. It fits perfectly in my dryer and works great! I have been searching for this filter everywhere online, but I couldn't get my hands on it anywhere. So glad Amazon had it though!
5.0	Its great light. I love it.
5.0	I bought this almost a year ago to wear in place of my diamond engagement/wedding ring combo; I am a nurse and wanted something easier to clean and wear with gloves without worrying about loss.  Since I have received it I have rarely taken it off - it is beautiful, substantial without being bulky, and very comfortable.  I get more compliments on this ring than I ever got on my original wedding set.  People cannot believe that this ring costs so little in comparison to it's look and quality.  It has held up extremely well having been worn almost daily for going on a year, withstood frequent handwashings without fading or signs of wear.  And it is durable!; I knocked my hand on the corner of a wall and the wall took a beating from the ring while the ring remained unscathed!
5.0	Like the bracelet very nice quality but it's too big for my wrist, be careful when sizing. Do not add extra space for charms as I did which is why it now doesn't fit. Hoping EvesErose will exchange it for me since I have not been able to wear it.
5.0	Very pretty.  Wore for girl's night out and having very sensitive skin, no reactions or problems.  Nice size too.
1.0	Ring size is not correct. Not a size 10.
5.0	The necklace came as pictured. It is very nice. My daughter wears it everyday. It seems to be of good quality.
5.0	This ring exceeded my expectations. It arrived from Amazon in just 2 days - not bad for Christmas time. It looks beautiful on my wife's hand. I had been watching for a great deal on tanzanite since I had come back from a cruise. This was much better than the over-priced tanzanite jewelry I had been seeing.
5.0	These earrings are the cutest!
1.0	First of all, the necklace came in a plastic bag and the chain was completely knotted up. It took me 30 mins to unravel carefully so the chain would not break. After straightening it out, the chain looks really cheap and the charm is very tiny.  I will be returning this item.
5.0	Beautiful ring!  It fits my soon to be husband and his characteristics perfectly!
5.0	it is great! if you wear costume jewelry this is a good place to keep your rings as it keeps the air from getting to them so much, thus less time till they turn color
5.0	These earrings are beautiful.  I love the green eyes.  I have received many compliments on them whenever I wear them.  They are heavier than I thought they would be, but I love them.
5.0	I love the attention to details and the size. I have been told by others that it is a beautiful piece of jewelry!
5.0	My daughter loves them.
5.0	very happy with purchase, exactly as described. Very beautiful earrings. Not to big and the cut was excellant. again very pleased
5.0	bought this for my stepmother directly from the bradford exchange and she loved it. i liked it as well but could not afford one at the time and cannot get one now as no online company ships to uk and uk no longer sells - sold out...<br />but it is a simply stunning necklace and worth every penny.
5.0	tooo sweet.  love them. super sexy they were exactly what I was hoping for thank you so much. great seller
5.0	Love this ring!!! It's beautiful and my husband loves it!!
5.0	This is a really beautiful charm.  It is very heavy though and weighs the charm bracelet down on the section of the bracelet it is on.  If all of your charms are big and heavy it would work fine but most of mine are delicate and light.  I believe I will use it as a pendant on a chain around my neck.  It is VERY beautiful.
5.0	so pretty , looks like expensive pearls. so ritzy
5.0	This ring is pretty tough, seeing how I do lots of hands on activities at work.  I just wipe it down once or twice with my shirt and it looks brand new.   This was a change of pace ring for me to replace my gold ring.   She has the nice platinum, but I'm not looking to spend a lot of money when this works just as good.  Nice fit, wide for my big hands.. and tough!
5.0	Great necklace at a great price. My daughter loved it and it looks better than priced.
5.0	I got this for my baby! I absolutely love them! They are small and look really cute on her ears.
5.0	I really like this necklace. My one regret is that I lost one of the anchors and don't know exactly where I put the other one. I feel so bad. I will take time to sincerely look for it.
5.0	This is a beautiful brooch but not heavy.  It was exactly what I was look for server as a button on a very fragile open cardigan type top.<br />It is great and not over stated.
5.0	Good as expected, and value too.
5.0	Bought them for my 6 year old daughter she loves to wear them when we go out. Price was super perfect.
5.0	Pair this one up with your watch and other bracelets and it looks expensive<br />for very little money.  The gold beads and iced out bow are what's in now!!!
5.0	Love this necklace.  So delicate, a gentle reminder of my love for dogs!
5.0	Wore to church on Sunday....got so many complements
5.0	I bought these earrings for my cartilage piercings, and I love them! They're small, but noticeable and match anything. Very happy with this purchase!
5.0	My niece loved this bracelet. It is beautifully made. Very delicate and we'll made for the price. Great buy.  So pretty.
5.0	I love the weight of the ring! I gave it to my husband since he had lost slot of weight and I will buy another from this seller when he needs a smaller size. With tungsten steel you cannot resize it...but it's ok because the price is excellent worth buying again!
5.0	This pendant is a lot larger than what it looks like in the advertisements. A very fun way to add a splash of color to any outfit. Great for gifts as well. I love the detailing on the chain, it adds a little something extra to the necklace.
1.0	These earrings are very pretty with nice sparkle and are a good, wearable size. However, after wearing the earrings twice, one jewel has already fallen off and one earring has bent enough that the clasp has stopped working. I like the earrings enough that I'll bend them back into shape and try to glue on the lost jewel, but I would absolutely would not recommend purchasing these earrings.
5.0	Just lost my brother.  I think of him all the time and this charm helps.
5.0	just love it... what more can I say
1.0	I ordered this bracelet,  right on the package is the maker's website which sells the exact same one for 16.99.  What a rip-off!  Price was marked up 225%.  Crazy!
5.0	"I love the design of this cat, its pointy ears and body size. I like to change things, so I clipped off the black \\""rocket\\"" and put black nail polish on the eyes to give some standout, and put on a short black necklace. Have gotten lots of lovely comments. Meow!!"
5.0	I love it... ! Beautiful finish,  thank you very much..
5.0	Having ordered earrings in the past I am becomming better at knowing the size as transposed from metric and these were exactly as I hoped/thought. I have worn one of these (as I have only one ear pierced) more than 20 times since it arrived and not only have I loved it but many others seeing it did not know it from a genuine stone. All those who have seen it thus far has complimented me on it and asked where I purchased it. I have been happy to provide them with the link through Amazon. They arrived when promised and were packaged very much as some ordered that were much more costly. I would not hesitate to order again from this seller and have already made a wish list for futher purchases. Thanks very much, Troy J.
1.0	This necklace arrived much smaller than shown. It appears to be poorly made and its not attractive at all. Looks like a dollar store item. Very poor quality. Definitely a horrible buy
5.0	The order arrived very promptly. The beads are pretty and just the right size to be comfortable. The string can be lengthened to fit a larger wrist. I contacted the vendor to inquire how to do this and received a very prompt and courteous email response. I am very pleased with this purchase.
5.0	This product was exactly as described.  I can't say enough nice things about the product.  I wear this necklace and jewelpops on a daily basis
5.0	Awesome product and service! Thank you!
1.0	when i looked at the picture i thought the chain would be thin but it ended up being really thick. The chain was thick and heavy but i guess it would be a overall good chain but i didnt like it
5.0	I was very pleased with these ear rings!  They were a bit thinner than I expected, but that was my fault for not reading thoroughly.  They are well made and very well priced.
5.0	Belly ring looks a little different than pic shows. Pic shows a ball that looks kind of see through to me. It just has that certain look see through balls have. Well, this is definitely opaque and I love it much more than the pic!! It's like a light hot pink with black specks. I love it! Would buy again
5.0	I must have purchased this after the glitches were worked out because I knew it was an engraving on silver. It is not highly visible in all lights, but that's what makes it interesting to me. It has a now-you-see-it effect that I love. I get quite a few compliments from people when I wear it and many people ask, &#34;Has that always been on there?&#34;<br /><br />If you want something that is as mystical as the Archangel himself, then this is a great buy. If you're looking for something that is seen all the time, it's not for you.<br /><br />Also, about the packaging. I didn't have a problem with it. It was packaged well and did come from Israel, Jerusalem to be exact. There's not question this and the olive wood keychain came from the Holy Lands. I don't see a problem with that, nor do I understand the anger of some of the posts about it not being packaged in the US by Amazon.
5.0	Excellent conversation piece, easy to make.  The best idea for gift giving for the holidays, or just because.  The charms are very small, but that's what makes it unique and personal.
1.0	Within one week of getting these earrings they started to turn color on me.  By the end of week two half the earring had turned dark greenish black.  They are cute and very light but cheap. You get what you pay for.
5.0	These are cool my sister loves them
5.0	i bought this for my 12 year old sister for her birthday. it's all intact and very pretty. iT is bigger than i expected, which is fine.
5.0	My wife loves it and she's very picky especially when it comes to me buying her things , mind you the turqouise stones aren't real still a good buy no regrets there.
5.0	Item was delivered on time. Description was good.  I brought it as a gift.  They collect things of owl images and she just love this one and wear it a lot. Nice job.
5.0	this is a very delicate and beautiful piece.it can be worn with everything.very classy piece.get lots of comments when i have it on.
5.0	i wanted to get oval studs made to match my engagement ring but wanted a &#34;trial&#34; pair before plunking down the money -- i'm loving these so much that i'm not going to bother getting real diamonds.  i love the light green amethyst color -- the pic is very representative of the color as it is very pale.  sturdy posts that don't bother my ears (cheap earrings make my ears itch).  so far, i've been wearing them every day (for about 3 weeks now).  but at $17 a pop, who cares if they don't last!?  they definitely do not look like $17 earrings.  i'd say they could easily look like $80-$100+ earrings that were bought at Nordstroms (in other words -- very nice costume jewelry, but not necessarily Tiffany's.  And I only say they don't look like fine jewelry because they are bigger than I would ever be able to afford as real diamonds).
5.0	I absolutely love these earrings. I like bling and these earrings did not disappoint. First set of jewerly that I bought online that haven't broke or wasn't misleading.
5.0	Purchased as a gift for my daughter, she loves it!  Much better quality than similar items sold at stores like Walmart.
5.0	A great gift to give to someone you really care about.
5.0	Nice looking ring. Looks expensive
5.0	They look real, and I highly recommend them. I bought an extra pair incase I lost one.
5.0	Excellent exchange. Great product.
5.0	I get complement from my family and friends
1.0	Not as pretty up close.  Not well made and did not come with earring backs.
5.0	Love it! Thank you! It is exactly how I it looks on the picture.
5.0	Good quality.  Dainty but not chintzy
5.0	ADORABLE EARRINGS TO WEAR IF YOU LIKE TINY JEWELRY
5.0	This product is absolutley perfect. I was worried about it being too short because one of my piercings has a lot of scar tissue but it still fit! It's not too tight or two long its perfect. It is small, but not small enough to where the earring is not noticeable. They also do not bother me when I sleep on them. The only problem is that the threading makes it painful to put through your ear, however it's not that painful and can be easily relieved by covering with soap. My ears are also super sensitive to metals and these have not bothered my ears at all. 10/10 would recommend.
5.0	The celtic design with a blue stone is very appealing.  It looks good and fits well.  This is a purchase I would recommend.
5.0	i chose this 5 star rating, because it is very well made, and love the gold on it.  very shiny :).  i love the rhinestone crystals that is around the edges of the rim of the pendant :).  it is a beautiful piece of jewelry.  my baby loves it though.  i got it for him, because he loves basketball, and watches the knicks game all the time lol.  thats my baby ^ ^.  i love this pendant for my baby, because he's not picky with pendants :).  he absolutely loves it lol.  i recommend this pendant to everyone that loves basketball lol ^ ^.  thanks for your time :).
5.0	Just the right size & length  & the right price.  Can wear with anything.
5.0	great chain and yes it shines to,  Using it with my cross and it goes real well and thus happy with this purchase,
5.0	Beautiful, masculine, bright and shiny ... comfortable beyond expectation.  This ring if simply wonderful!
5.0	The pendant is beautiful and the chain is very nice. I love being able to use the chain for other pendants I have also. I am very happy with this purchase. It arrived in a nice little black bag which I appreciated also.
5.0	excellent will buy another
1.0	I was disappointed in this necklace. I was excited to receive it and wear it, but it's too short. It's fits like an uncomfortable choker. Not sure what to do about it at this point.
5.0	This set looks great for a summer outfit.  I arrived<br />faster than expected.
5.0	My grandaughter love it.  It was just the right size for her.
5.0	Just received this morning and am absolutely in love. Size it true to fit!!
5.0	Awesome bracelet.  Very cool.  Have had tons of compliments.  Received a day early.  Has a great leather scent.
1.0	This was actually an 18&#34; chain when I purchased a 20&#34;. The quality was fine, but it was not what I ordered. It was too much trouble to return, so I just gave it to a friend.
5.0	Not a deep artificial blue, but a soft and gentle shade. They look great and are undeniably quality jewelry. If you are bad about losing backs though I would be wary.
5.0	Love them!  I ordered these earring as a gift and was surprised at how pretty they were.  The recipient loves them and wears them alot.  I only wish they were still in stock.
5.0	This ring was a birthday present for my 10 year old granddaughter.  I thought the ring was very nice and she was thrilled.  Just the right look for a preteen.
5.0	I just love that the ring helps me keep Jesus in my thoughts. Every time I look at my hand I am reminded.
5.0	Very good service from Jewelsforme. Will deal with them again, and recommend the company to friends and family. Keep up the good work, and thanks.
5.0	this pc is very pretty and we love it for are jr bridesmaid in are wedding we all said it is prettier after we got it thank you
5.0	Tracking the package online, this was indeed shipped out within 10 days of ordering it, and it did arrive in the U.S within 2 weeks of ordering it, however, for some reason, it still took another 2 weeks to reach it's destination, so keep that in mind if your are ordering a present for someone, shipping takes a month. That said, it is super pretty, and sturdy, they are well made, it is much nicer and better quality then you would expect for the price! These rings and big & showy- they are not dainty, but every one I have ordered looks just like the images shown.
5.0	This ring looks very good and my lady liked it. The texture is smooth and the writing is clear. For the price its wonderful
5.0	My daughters love this set!!!
1.0	Adjustable? not really.  It holds a circular shape, my wrist is more oval than circular.  All attempts to bend or shape have failed.  Long story short, it's not really comfortable.
5.0	This is soo pretty, it fits my daughter perfect, its not too long, yet not too short...She's been showering in it and it has not faded a bit
5.0	It looks awesome! Got it before the estimated day. I got a free gift wich I love n I even got a candy. Couldn't be any better! :) And I'm looking forward for my next purchase.
5.0	I bought this for my niece for Christmas and it fit perfectly.  She was surprised and excited and she loves it.
5.0	I love Swarovski crystal.  I recommend this small necklace for teenage girls, if they like subtle pink.
5.0	Beautiful, dainty, cross necklace.  Money well spent.
5.0	The beveled tungsten band with facets looks great in person. It has a bright, almost mirrored, finish. I purchased it as a wedding band for my fiance. It fits extremely well and looks very classy.
5.0	I love these! They're beautiful and are comfortable - I have very sensitive skin and my ears tend to get irritated quickly from most earrings, but these do not affect me adversely and I get a ton of compliments, which never hurts. They're really lightweight and sparkle; large enough that they catch the eye, but not so large that they look awkward.
5.0	Very nice!!! Great quality bracelet!!
5.0	I love this charm totally enhances the beauty of the bracelet
5.0	The red jasper cross that I received was nicer than pictured because each piece of stone is always different than the other . There are variations in the rock strata that make each one unique . The turnaround time was quick as well . I'm very pleased with the product .
5.0	Pretty and nicely made.
5.0	I bought it for my granddaughter's first birthday.  The size (children's) is perfect for her.  I can update the review later once she wears it--I will be giving it to her in September.  I think it is beautiful--I looked at many and read many reviews.
5.0	A gift for my wife and she loves the design and wears it everyday.
5.0	Ordered this in my true size of 6, but found it a bit snug, but it's an individual thing.  Because this ring is truly beautiful with shiny metal and beautiful sparkle, I exchanged for a size 7.5 for two reasons:  If the ring spins or twirls on your finger, it doesn't matter because it's the same design all the way around, and I like the option of wearing on different fingers.  Plan to leave these on as part of my daily jewelry.  They're also beautiful to stack if you like that look.  I found Metal Masters very professional, accommodating, and easy to work with.  I've tried other retailers who make exchanges unbearable, even impossible....live and learn with online shopping, but five stars for Metal Masters.  Would highly recommend ordering from this retailer.
5.0	I love my bracelet! This is the first bracelet I have purchased in years and I made a great choice.
5.0	I got 4 of them for all sisters for my youngest sister's last Christmas. We wear them every day in her honor and they hold up to daily wear- except for the little Tai tag. One of the 4 I ordered came in silver, the other 3 in gold. Simple yet beautiful.
5.0	Pretty,good length hasn't turn as yet had it for 2 months
5.0	My niece is into all things cupcake, so this seemed to be the perfect necklace for her.  It looks great, and I wish I could see her face as she opens it up Christmas morning!
1.0	Ordered in the gold, and it came with only a small portion of the gold showing, the rest was sterling . You could only see the gold if the ring was turned sideways where the &#34;X&#34; meets.Very disappointed and no sparkle to it . A piece of junk for the price. Maybe I'll figure a way to use in my hair.
5.0	This is a solid purchase for the price. I had bought a single princess channel set and I wasn't satisfied. My fiancés engagement ring has dual princesses in the band so this was a perfect match. The ring is gorgeous my fiancé and I love it.  Great vendor service, quick turnaround.
5.0	We both wear them on different occasions and whenever we wear them they accent us very good. We absolutely love them....Wouldn't have purchased another pair!
1.0	I purchased this charm (and another from the same vendor) in February 2013.  I never wore my bracelet much, but recently began wearing it and have worn it 5 times in the past few weeks.  I never wear it in water or to bed or anything.  The silver is now wearing away leaving pinkish/reddish colorations on both of the charms.  I just ordered three more charms, not realizing they are from the same vendor.  Guess you get what you pay for.
5.0	These are beautiful necklaces.  I love the secret guardian angel.  I have one and bought one for my Mom for Mother's Day this year.  It is a special gift.  It is wonderful to see how unique each piece is.
5.0	I purchased this for a female friend of mine that owns a motorcycle scooter store in Phoenix. It has a nice weight, but is not huge and heavy. Cute as a key chain or a purse adornment, or to hang on a zipper. Seems very well made. Just perfect!
5.0	Everything is what it says. I have had it on since I got it (2 weeks) and it is gorgeous- I get many compliments and it is the best right hand ring ;)
5.0	I had been looking for a 'cord' ankle bracelet for some time. I finally gave up going to different shops and came to Amazon. I found 2 that I loved immediately. I ordered them the same day I found them and they came in the mail in 3 days. I love not having to wait long for my order! I put them it on and haven't taken it off since. It goes everywhere with me and still is in great condition. It hasn't stretched out or faded in color. I love it!
1.0	Broke the first day having it
5.0	Got this to make a bracelet for my wife's Christmas present! She will love the colors and the high quality of this bead! Beautiful!
5.0	I bought 2 not as dark but there still pretty.
5.0	I'm a new and big fan of the Pandora-style bracelets, unfortunately, I can't afford Pandora branded items.  I've purchased many beads from Amazon and eBay to make my own.  This bead is beautiful!  I love it!  I found a few coordinating beads and have made an awesome bracelet.  The purple colors are rich and deep.  Great quality!  I'd definitely buy from this seller again.
1.0	My fiance bought this ring to propose with last christmas, when it arrived at hiss mothers they both could do nothing more than to laugh. So last min my fiance went to another store to buy a different ring. After he proposed and gave me the new ring he laughed and showed me this ring, it does have three diamonds in it but so small you can hardley see them. We often find ourselves laughing about it. This ring is nothing but a joke. Save yourself the money, go to walmart, rings there are better than this!
5.0	They are fast and I love this ring, my husband loves it as well, he does a lot of outdoor activities so this was perfect for him. I ordered the wrong size the first time and the sent a new one within a week of me sending them the wrong size back. It matches my white gold engagement ring so it looks very beautiful. I would highly recommend these rings to others. Great deal for the price as well.
5.0	Gorgeous! It's oval and fits better than the round 8&#34; style. Shine, shine, shine. Got two other colors and got the earrings to match.<br />Great quality for the price!
5.0	This product was very well on time, and I was very impressed that it was very finely crafted. A beautifully great product. Thank you!
1.0	Vary cheap looked like something you would get out of a bubble gum machine
5.0	These earrings are lovely and easy to wear. They go with everything, and have a nice weight as the teardrops gently swing against your neck. They've become my go-to earrings.
5.0	Yes my daughter & I love this! We are sharing it! Our fun reminder to Travel to Great places soon!! And it s much bigger than we Imagined we love !
5.0	Beautiful pieces of jewelry. Nicely manufactured.
1.0	shipped from China,I think it's fake..
5.0	I LOVE THIS RING. THE STONE WAS SO BEAUTIFUL AND THE COMPANY DIDN'T SKIMP ON A THING.<br />SUCH A WELL MADE RING.I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS RING TO ANYONE.I ALSO BOUGHT THE SAME<br />RING IN SAPPHIRE IT WAS THE MOST RICHES SAPPHIRE I HAVE SEEN. GREAT PRICES, AND YOU REALLY<br />GET GREAT MERCHANDISE. AND THE DELIVERY WAS QUICKER THAN THE DATE THEY GAVE ME. I WOULD ADVISE<br />ANYONE TO TAKE A LOOK AT THESE GORGEOUS RINGS.  oconnors79@yahoo.com
5.0	It's a silver chain sporting a really tiny pink bow with a teardrop-shaped gem hanging underneath it. It's really pretty and nice for a subtle touch to your outfits.
5.0	I wear this every day! The size was exactly as I expected it to be, and the real thing was exactly like the photos. It had arrived in good time, too. 10/10 would buy again if the ring got lost!!
5.0	I ordered the brown. It's a beautiful honey color, but prettier than amber. There's  peach undertones in the stones,  The quality and workmanship are outstanding, The stones have an excellent cut;  very sparkling with lots of depths of fire. The setting is quality and the plating is beautifully done, no &#34;tell tell&#34; bubbles. Looks just like a 14k setting. The closures are small round hoops.<br /><br />The stones are about 7mm. They are about 1&#34; in length. Nice movement on these dangle earrings, but not too much.  They hand nicely from the ears.  They stones face forward.  These are the type of earrings that can be worn with dressy attire, jeans or for work.<br />They look simple and elegant.  I don't usually say this; however, if ordering, expectations will be exceeded. Super speedy delivery from this seller. I received in a little over a week. Thanks Yazilind.
5.0	Sometimes the enhancing and lighting of jewel photographs make them look nicer than they really are, but this is definitely one example of the contrary! I hadn't had my hopes too high for this necklace, that's why I was  pleasantly surprised when I finally received... it's really really nice! The design is somewhat unusual and though the diamonds are very small, you can still notice their shine. It's true that the chain is very thin, but I think it works well with the pendant. You just have to handle it carefully and make sure it doesn't tangle. I recommend it!
5.0	i wear this ring every day!  it's beautiful, simple, delicate yet understated.  i don't like big bulky jewelry, so this is perfect for me.
5.0	i wear this everyday-had about a month now and no trouble with it,would get it again
1.0	TOTALLY DISAPPOINTED!!!  It looked like it came out of a gumball machine.  This was the cheapest looking ring I have every seen.  It still had the &#34;Made In China&#34; sticker on it.  Returned immediately.
5.0	I bought this necklace for a friend.  When I received it, I was really pleased with the quality and beauty of this necklace.  Although I new the size of the necklace when I bought it, it seemed bigger when I got it.
5.0	Looks even much nicer in reality than the picture. I would recommend it to anyone who likes sterling silver charms.
1.0	honestly this was the cheapest thing on amazon. the crystal inside is plastic and the &#34;bronze&#34; outside and chain are like aluminum and IT BROKE 387289743 TIMES
1.0	It didn't look as good as the pictures,  plus I bought a engagement set for the same price  UT add less I got my refund back quick
5.0	Completely satisfied with the looks.
5.0	I love this ring..the size is perfect and it's even cuter in person. It took a bit long to get here, but once it did I couldn't have been happier!
5.0	I recently got my ears re-pierced....These were one of the earrings I chose...Beautiful and feminine......not huge, but can be seen........looking forward to wearing them....update! I love these...many compliments on them...very pretty,small but not dainty...just lovely and a must for butterfly lovers such as myself....recommend these
5.0	Let me be clear I can NOT wear cheaply made metals... This ring is amazing! True to size. I ordered this to replace another ring from Amazon.... Unfortunately it turned within a month ( sapphire and cz band )  .....This ring is extremely.comfortable lightweight... And shines like crazy!  XOXOX I LOVE THIS BAND XOXOX
5.0	Cute gift for my niece, came 2 weeks before anticipated date!  Very excited!
5.0	Purchased for a gift for my niece, she loved them!  A nice little surprise in her mailbox she said and nice quality for novelty earrings.
5.0	I love this money clip this is the 4th one I buy. To give as gifts and I kept one myself. My husband has one and he always Carrys it with him. I will probably buy more in the future. Thanks.
5.0	But my wife looks stunning in them! And the earings are radiant. And yes, you are not getting a $799.00 (or $7,999.00) set of pearls but at this price point you shouldn't be expecting them either! For what I paid for them via Amazon, they were little more than a string of costume pearls and earrings would have cost and they are VERY VERY not costume. Stunning, bright, flashy, elegant, beautiful would all be words that I would associate with these pearls. We have only had them for a week so I can't speak to longevity but that being said, I would definitely NOT feel bad recommending these to anyone. They also were delivered in a pretty little black with bow box (the one in the picture). If I could do this again, it would be a no brainer!
5.0	Very well made, accurate miraculous medal details done beautifully.  I got the smaller 22 mm one for myself and this size for my mother. Worth every penny and some sell this same size and weight medal for so much more<br />It was well packaged and arrived promptly.
1.0	I got this item several days later then expected, and it arrived with a very large, noticeable crack!  I was also charged $6.50 for shipping when it arrived regular mail with $1.23 in postage.  It took over three weeks to get a replacement and now my inbox is flooded with spam to get me to buy jewlery- and this is the only thing other then books I have bought online.  Both the stone and the necklace itself are poor quality and not worth the trouble.
1.0	Please read the description carefully, item can fit in the palm of my hand and is so tiny it is ridiculous? It will be returned for credit!
5.0	It is beautiful, Larger stone but not too big, actually just right. Matches my other green amber. Have already received compliments on it at work. Fast delivery. Good stuff!
5.0	Love love love this ! It is so beautiful ! Everything they describe and more love it !!
5.0	more beautiful than anticipated. more portable than envisaged. its a beautiful birthday gift for a lady close to your heart. sings the happy birthday song as well. has enough room to add earings or a necklace within the box. surely its a gift that will stand the test of time and memories.<br /><br />Sola
5.0	I was upset when my first bracelet started to unravel, but your customer service was awesome! I got a new one the very next day. thanks so much!
1.0	very pretty however, to tiny, not what we had hoped for probably will not be ordering jewelry on line ever again.
5.0	I wear this piece every day and I love it! People ask about it and they seem to like it too. Very cool!
5.0	Love the product.  Cute as can be.  The only complaint is how long it took to get here.  Once i saw how cut the hair clip was i really didn't mind the wait.
5.0	I absolutely love my ring !! It looks like it's real and it's not to big but not small :)
5.0	A perfect gift for a December person!  I am giving all my daughters & granddaughters their biirthstones  for Christmas!  I know they will really love them!
5.0	Bought these for my wedding and they are so beautiful. Elegant and the perfect length. Love these. Would look amazing for any kind of occasion.
5.0	These earrings are a beautiful gold color with high shine (not like the illustration which makes them look dull).  They are the perfect size for me, and I appreciate that they are not so heavy that they pull my earlobes down like some other earrings that I have.  They are light weight and comfortable.  The closing is all one piece, hinged to the earring, so you don't have to worry about losing a backing, and they are easy to put on and take off.
5.0	Just what I needed.  Perfect size to put on a safety pin and pin inside my shirt.  Not cheap looking and delivered in a timely manner.
5.0	I am using it to hold my medical alert tags and were it continously during the day . seems strong and a good look as well. overall a very good product for the price.
5.0	Nice ring...pretty good quality and made an excellent stage prop!
5.0	This taper seems to be more clear with pink glitter than it is  red. It's still good for stretching though.
5.0	SIMPLE YET CLASSY WAY TO SHOW MY SUPPORT & AFFLIATION TO MY BROTHERS & SISTERS IN OUR THIN BLUE LINE FAMILY.
5.0	Thisbracelet is beautiful. This is a very bold and ornate toogle bracelet ...If you are a woman who likes to make bold statements with her jewelry you will love this.
5.0	I was actually surprised at how pretty this ring is. The stone has a lot of sparkle. I am very happy with it.
5.0	compared to other reversible omega's this one was a steal.  I have had it for a couple of years now and it is still in great condition.  It arrived in a very nice wooden box as well.  Very nice quality.
1.0	I have a handful of tie bars and this, Sir, was not a tie bar. Not only did it come scratched up, but it was more like a cheap, miniature money clip than it was a tie bar. No moving parts, just a smaller opening on one end that could be (awkwardly) stretched over the tie, unlike ALL of my other tie bars that open and close with a hinge (or hinges). Would NOT recommend.
5.0	just as pretty as in the picture. Very highend looking, no inclusions and well worth the price. If there are other colors available I will shop for more. thank you
5.0	I liked this chain so much that I bought three of them.
5.0	i wear these tunnels pretty much daily. they are easy to put in and take out to clean, great quality.
5.0	Gave this to my sister who raved about it. Happy I selected it.
5.0	These earrings are beautiful!!
5.0	It's a beautiful ring! Size 5 was available (unlike other dealers). My wife loves it. Shipping was fast and the price was most reasonable.
5.0	This is a good ring for the money. It scratches easily but hardly noticeable. Very lightweight and comfortable to wear.
5.0	Purchased 2 of these for my sisters for Christmas and they loved them! The price is unbeatable and delivery is reasonable and worth it all when I saw their reactions. I am planning on buying more for my friends.
5.0	I purchased these for my wife as an extra little something for Valentines Day. She really seems to love it and it looks nice along with the other charms on her Pandora Bracelet. Besides, Pandors charms are very pricey so this was a great value.
1.0	I am very disappointed in the chain i received. I wore it for about a week and then noticed my neck was dark on the side and checked the back of my neck and it was dark green. This chain turned dark brown and left a dark mark all around my neck. Its not sterling silver.  I would not purchase anything from this company again and recommend you don't either. I'm reporting this company to Amazon for selling fake merchandise. Don't buy from this company.
5.0	like very much.  size is perfect
5.0	This is a lovely dainty necklace that is not too overpowering.  I will most likely used JN Monograms again.Thank you!
5.0	These earrings are gorgeous. They look very expensive and hang well on the ear,not heavy at all.Would have loved for these to come in silver.
5.0	My now husband bought me this ring for when we took our vows to become husband and wife....I love this ring sooo much it was a great price and so pretty. Very glittery and smoothe. My best friend loved it so much she has requested that I get her one so she can wear it on her thumb. I am very happy with this ring I would recommend it to anyone.
5.0	I purchased this charm for my son who is enlisting. It is sturdy, manly, solid and the detail is fantastic. There is no clasp and it slipped right over his head perfectly. It's a good length for a man, and a good size for a charm. It also shipped in time for Christmas even though it said the seller takes additional time (4-5 days) to process orders. We placed the order 12/16, and received it on 12/22. This was a very positive purchasing experience.
5.0	This is a unique, high-quality pendant with intricate craftsmanship which comes packaged in a beautiful 'faux soie' pouch in a matching embroidered cloth-covered box.....all around great presentation. Additionally, their customer service reps are friendly, efficient and very quick to respond to any questions one might have about their merchandise.
5.0	Love this charm since I just moved to Providence to go to Johnson & Wales University.  Comes in a very handy Alex and Ani draw string pouch to my surprise.  Overall very happy to add this charm to my Alex and Ani collection.
5.0	I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of this necklace.  The size of the stones on the necklace were smaller than I expected and the length was much shorter that I thought it would be, more like a choker.  I just connect the clasp towards the end of the chain and it makes it a little longer.  It arrived sooner than quoted and that also made me happy.
5.0	Ring was larger than I thought but is very nice
5.0	These small hoops are perfect for a busy 2 year old girl. They will not get lost or fall out. The design is simple and attractive. They look adorable on her. they are just what I was looking for.
5.0	These are beautiful earrings and the color deep blue.  I have to say I will be purchasing again as I've already lost one!
5.0	Cute little charm.  The back of it is flat and hollowed out, though, which is fine for my purposes, but might be a problem for someone else.  The shipping was super fast and I am really pleased with this purchase.
5.0	Beautiful charm. Highly recommend it.
5.0	I bought this with the necklace to match and they make a good pair.  This bracelet is a good length and the color matched perfectly with the necklace.  The clasp is a little difficult to do by yourself but because of the length it is do able.
5.0	They're perfect for what they're intended for, to hold up sleeves. The need was simple and these are affordable and do the job without muss or fuss.
5.0	This was a great addition to my holiday themed bracelet. It is clear and centered well.  It's a very cute link
1.0	Came already ripped and took a very very long time to arrive. Didn't even bother to return it. Very dissatisfied.
5.0	This bracelet complements the gold (genuine, toned, plated, or otherwise) beads and Pandora accessories quite nicely. I ordered five of them. The wide-holed charms and beads work best. I couldn't find too many gold-colored Pandora-like bracelets for some reason; but, there are many silver, silver-toned, and silver-plated ones. Several leather or leather braided bracelets are out there as well. I began making Pandora-like bracelets out of pure boredom. Assembling pieces and parts can be time-consuming. I find placing stopper either in the end beads or on the bracelet helps (keeps the beads from sliding off the bracelet. This bracelet's clasp is a stick in and drop type catch. Haven't tried but suspect with a great deal of movement, the bracelet would be jarred open and lost. But, if some serious sports or acrobatic dancing activity is going on or planned, it might be best to take it off.
5.0	I just received this item and plan to give it to my God daughter who is 3 1/2.  It is quite lovely and delicate.  Perfect for a girl her age.
1.0	It broke before I put in on the first time.  It was a gift and I am trying to figure out how to return it.
5.0	This has the look of a brilliant champagne diamond and is often mistaken as such.  If you like that look. I would highly recommend it.
5.0	"The stones are a pretty shade of pink, mine are a little bit more \\""watermelon\\"" than the photo and that is perfect with me, love their color. Just note the bracelet is on the small side, my wrists are a bit less than 7\\"", and it fits perfectly for me, not loose nor tight."
5.0	These are really adorable on, and much more classy than most children's earrings. They look much better in person than they do in  the picture here. Cute as can be!
5.0	Like this piece a lot!
5.0	It is a wonderful thing to have with you always and I am so glad that I got it.<br /><br />Thank you,<br />Glenn
5.0	Love these!  They are a perfect size to take anywhere!  They feel great in my hand but small enough to put in my pocket so I have them with me at anytime.  Beautiful color.
5.0	SO MANY PIECES AND ALL INTERCHANGABLE  MY DAUGHTER LOSES PEICES SO QUICKLY FROM HAVING TO REMOVE IT FOR SCHOOL  THIS WAS A LIFE SAVER AND MONEY SAVER
5.0	I bought this for my girlfriend and she liked a lot it looks very nice and the skull it´s well made.
1.0	I used this for a temporary band. Stones fell out within months. Junk.
5.0	These earrings are beautiful and super cute! I saw these exact same earrings in a major department store for a lot more than I paid on Amazon. I couldn't believe my good fortune! The earrings are in 3D (puffy), finished on both sides. They're not heavy, but there is enough weight for movement without pulling on your ear lobes, so if you're piercings are a little stretched for whatever reason, you should still be able to wear these earrings comfortably. They're a good size, but if you like big, bold and long, these earrings are not for you. My hair hangs just to the bottom of my ear lobes and these show up quite nicely, but I think they are substantial enough to go with any hair length. The French wire or fish hook are a good length, but if you need more security, put some of those rubber post backings on them to secure them in your ear (slip the hook through the hole in your ear and push the rubber backing onto the hook as far up as you want). I would buy these as a gift for any gal who likes her earrings to hang a little closer to the ear. They would also make a great gift for a teenage girl. Give these a try, I think you'll be pleased.
5.0	The colors are beautiful, the packaging is simple, and the effect when worn on the neck of my best friend is breathtaking.
5.0	I bought these for my granddaughter.  I would be proud to give them as a gift to anyone; I was tempted to keep them for myself.
5.0	Really love them !! I'm happy I bought  them!!!!
5.0	I ordered these for my wedding. I was nervous that they would look cheap but they don't at all! They look great on camera, They sparkle beautifully and look great with my dress. Very happy with my purchase!
1.0	Wish I could return it.  The backing fell off after the first day and I already lost an earring.  It's quite beautiful, but what's the use if the backing isn't secure :/
5.0	I love this ring!  I bought it as a replacement wedding band when pregnant, and I enjoyed wearing it until my swelling hands grew out of it.  The fit is very comfortable and the design looks expensive but not over the top.
1.0	This chain looked totally different after I received it. I wanted to return it immediatly, but I didnt want to go through all the process, so I gave it away!
5.0	I was looking for some nice Christmas earrings that would go with everything and these hit the spot. Love the dangle, love the whimsical design, love that they're sterling silver. I'll wear these for years to come.
5.0	We love the ring! So far its strength has held up! I love how smooth it is on the inside. I got it for my boyfriend as a promise ring and he loves the ring. The only downside is that for some reason it gives him a tiny rash that itches but he likes it so much he said he doesn't want to return it and that his finger will get used to it :)
1.0	I keep seeing people wearing wings and they have them backwards. This isn't the right way. They're backwards. So don't buy this because one day when you're wearing it, somebody's gonna notice and when they tell you what are you gonna say? &#34;It was pretty.&#34; Save yourself from the embarrassment and find a correct one if you want the wings.
5.0	Another winner from Yazalind!
5.0	I really love these ear pins a lot.  I get compliment on these and the others I have purchased.  They are easy to put in, easy to wear, and I often forget I have them in!
5.0	"I've been searching for months for an evil eye piece that I love. I'm glad I found it. Who couldn't use a little extra protection from bad ju-ju?<br /><br />This bracelet is beautiful, looks delicate and a very \\""eye-catching\\"" piece (pun intended :) It's sturdy enough to wear everyday."
5.0	The color is the blue I wear most often, so it was the right blue for me.   The lever backs are secure and of good quality, so they never hurt my ears.  I am very happy with this company for all those reasons.  That's why I have bought 3 pair, so far from these people.
1.0	The leaves broke right off very poor quality of silver beautiful design needs improvement this item is way to thin and not worth the money it costs to ship it.
5.0	Beautiful, classy and appears well made and of high quality.  Arrived exactly 2 weeks after ordering/paying in bombproof packaging!
1.0	Not good quality. It rusted in very few months time. l would say didn't even make it to 2 months. Don't buy!
5.0	The bead is just as it looks; beautiful.  Each bead is individually made so it's not identical, but still a great addition to my bracelet.
1.0	Ordered this to be delivered by Christmas. However, they decided to ship it postal ground. I have no idea why. They did refund the additional shipping charge. But I will never use this vendor again if I need anything sooner than '10 working days' which is what my estimated delivery time is now.  On top of that they didn't even ship it until after Christmas.    I wasn't notified of this until I contacted them to get shipping information.  Only then did they tell me they screwed up.  I should've looked at their feedback comments before I ordered from them.  It appears that I'm not the only one experiencing these issues.    Thanks for screwing up Christmas, Pugster.  At least now I know to no longer deal with you and I will advise the same to my friends and family.    Edit; just received this today.  I'm not sure what it is they sent me, but it's nothing like what I ordered.  I ordered a brooch and what they've sent me is some sort of tiny multicolored hoop. Contacting them now to see if I can get a refund.    If I wasn't convinced before that these guys aren't professional and are a tragedy waiting to happen, I no longer have any such doubts.  I'm just hoping that they can manage a refund correctly.
5.0	Awesome, Love Love Love!!! I wear it everywhere. I also didn't realize that it came with a chain. If ever I lose this I will probably get another one!
5.0	Thank you so much for sending my order so fast. I love the set of earrings I feel you can never have to much of a good thing and this product is the proof
5.0	Great Company, Great Jewelry.The silver initial was just as shown in the picture.  Got it right away, and I can't wait to put it on the charm bracelet.
5.0	this is very pretty and I have several people ask me about it because they want one. So I tell them where I got it
5.0	I loved the way this looked.  Thought it was very professional!  Recommend it !  May wear it on my ID Badge.  I like it a lot better than the one we had in the LPN program.  Quick delivery too!!! Was very pleased.
1.0	This ring is great for the first few weeks of wear. If you are like me and wear your ring all of the time, then you will notice that it quickly starts to show wear. The black color of the titanium rubs off. The protective coating over the wood in the band gets scratches and turns cloudy. If you are buying this to wear as a back-up then it should be fine. I do not recommend trying to keep this on your finger for the rest of your life.
5.0	Fast shipping, and a great price for the product! It's the finishing touch on my outfit, and it seems pretty durable. I love it. (:
5.0	I absolutely love my necklace. I didnt think it would be so pretty but it is all I expected & some!
5.0	I bought this because my husband's nickname for me is jellybean and he is getting ready to deploy again and I thought this was a cute way to remind me of him while he is gone
5.0	This charm was exactly what I was looking for. Just the right size and good quality: depending on what cord/chain you pair with it can be perfect for both men and women.
5.0	Downside of a smartphone is the battery last for such short amount of time. I don't  have to be afraid of my phone die anymore. I can get 180 emergency phone hours from this cute emergency charger. Definitely a love item. Worth a try.
5.0	I absolutely love these. I wanted something that looked like I had my ears gauged, but also look professional for work. these are awesome.
5.0	This are great and they are easy on my little girls ears which are newly pierced
1.0	Cheap materials used.  Very disappointing, especially when the design of the jewelry is so pretty.  I do not recommend buying.
5.0	It was beautiful and my daughter loved it !!!!
5.0	I love there jewelry it's different from anything I've seen and I get compliments every time. Love it will be getting more.
5.0	This ring is exactly as described. It's a little big for a size 5 but not too much that I can't wear it. I absolutely love it. It is exactly what I was looking for.
1.0	what a waste of money this was. the item's latch broke with an hour of putting it on. cheap, cheap, cheap!!
5.0	Just as I expected.  I love them
5.0	Very fast shipping and my girlfriend loves it.
5.0	I bought this for my fiance because he wanted an engagement ring, and considering we will replace it in a couple of months this is perfect.  It is such great quality that he said he wouldn't mind keeping it, all for $18!  It is seriously as good as you can get when it comes to tungsten without diamonds.  I highly recommend - looks just like the picture.
5.0	real betsey johnson so cute these were my favorite ladybug earring on Amazon. Heart shape spots and blue eyes so cute wear them for good luck
5.0	We love our dachshunds. I purchased this necklace as a gift for my wife but wondered if it was a bit too extreme to wear. She loves it! It's actually very nice and tasteful, not overpowering. I bought the matching bracelet so she could wear them both on occasion. The necklace arrived on time and was shipped so that there would not be damage. She did tell me not to purchase the matching earings. She thought that would be a bit too much to wear.
5.0	Ring arrived without packaging, just a small plastic Baggie in a large padded mailing pouch. However, the ring itself is flawless to all appearances. I purchased this on behalf of a friend, and she was thrilled to receive the larger twin to her own band as a gift for her special someone. This is a well-wrought piece, with a lovely satin-finish flanked by polished beveled edged. The inside edge of the ring is curved and polished for a comfort-fit. For the price, you will not find higher quality.
5.0	Gorgeous. Shiny.  Stone is clear and brilliantly cut. Fast shipping.  Great value for the price.  Durable - I wear this set everyday and have had it for more than a year.  This is a duplicate order in case I lose or damage the one I'm wearing now.
5.0	Beautiful ring, and wonderful seller. I couldn't be happier with both. The ring is exactly how it looks, and it is very good quality and looks great and feels very comfortable.<br /><br />I had a problem with the size being too large, and so I ordered a smaller size and Trigrade happily refunded me when I returned the large size.<br /><br />I am very pleased and would highly recommend this ring to anyone, and Trigrade is a wonderful seller to purchase from.<br /><br />Thank you!
5.0	I had an issue with bracelet. They shipped the part with wrong color. I left my feedback just for the sake of it. I was pleasantly surprised when seller contacted me next day and offered full refund and apologized about the error.    They let me keep the the bracelet as well.    Great customer service. I don't have any issues with the product as well.
5.0	I have this necklace in the rose gold plated, and it's very beautifully detailed.  The tree of life represents different things to different people.  It's been representative of protection, healing, knowledge, family, immortality and good-just to name a few.  It's symbolism goes back hundreds of years and spans many religions and cultures.  The chain of the necklace has a lobster claw clasp that's small, but easy to fasten, and measures 18&#34; with a 2&#34; extender, so 20&#34; total.  The pendant has a a bit over a 1/2&#34; drop, not as big as 3/4&#34;.  It's small, but seems to be well made, the stones are inset well and it has a moderate amount of sparkle. It's smaller than it looks on the model in the photo, and that's actually a good thing in this case. I received it free in exchange for my honest review.
5.0	The earrings are very pretty and the color I was looking for. They<br />are exactly as pictured and I would recommend this seller.
5.0	these, in a one word summary, are amazing. They arrived extremely fast. I ordered them on a Friday and received them on a Monday. Along with another pair of white plugs that I'm also satisfied with. The only thing about these plugs is you need to develop a technique for putting them in. But they fit great once they're in and you don't have to worry about losing the O rings. Overall very happy with this product. (:
5.0	beautiful necklace! 😍 & received faster than expected
5.0	Just as described - actually more beautiful than picture.
5.0	I bought this ring for my daughter for Christmas she loved it so much.<br />She is 13 and is very picky . It was a great hit.
5.0	It's perfect for my wrist. I am 140 pounds and this fits me so well. It's not too big and not too small, it's perfect.
5.0	I got this for my step mom. It's dainty and perfect
5.0	The rings are beautiful!!
5.0	It was a gift to a dear friend and she wears it a lot, so I guess you likes it, it is truely beautiful on her outsits.
5.0	Love the bracelet! I believe in the magnets that help relieve some of my aches. I wear it all the time.
5.0	Love it, my hubby gave me my engagement ring in a fortune cookie 20 years ago
5.0	What a gorgeous ring.....looks just as great on my finger as it does in the photo!  My friends have complimented me on this unusual piece of jewelry & are amazed when I tell them how little I paid for it!  One of the coolest-looking rings I've ever owned!
5.0	Very nice! Heavy feeling very solid! 110% satisfied in quality and authenticity
5.0	This is a sturdy and beautiful Necklace. My daughter loves it.  Came in a box so it made it perfect for wrapping.  The color is beautiful and it looks great. Not sure why they say it's for Men, My Daughter was thrilled.
1.0	one size does not fit all, TOO big for size 6
5.0	I was looking for something different for my bracelet collection. This bracelet is well designed and beautiful. A great casual-looking piece to wear whenever!
5.0	So cute. Came in time and looks perfect on! This was a great price too. Most importantly it came in time to give it as a gift for a pi phi
5.0	Just what he has been wanting,sits flat on chest. Excellent Quality
5.0	I love these earrings just beautiful.
5.0	beautiful, love the ring, a tip for ceramic rings, my old ring would sometimes get a gray mark on it and was hard to get off. at first I thought it was metal peeking through. then I decided to try using my ceramic stove top cleaner,just a little and rubbed lightly. It works . my old ring always looked new and shiney.
5.0	Nice necklace. Bought it for my 6-yr-old so she could give it to her sister (who is 20) for Christmas. The pendant is very tiny though, but nice.
5.0	I received this for Christmas this year from my husband. The picture doesn't do it any justice. It's beautiful, and so sparkly.   Thank you
1.0	I am so disapointed. DO NOT BUY. It took three days which is fast but I used prime and it should have been here in two, so now it's late. On top of that it will get to the person I got it for even later because as soon as I held it for the first time the shorter metal end detached from the braided braclet. I demand a new one or I'll fix it myself. I was in love until I saw it came to me broken. Outraged.
5.0	Item was as described and I am tottaly satisfied with this purchase . would recommend to others as well. Great
5.0	The item in question is a great product and I would buy from this seller again in the future.  I have great respect for seller’s that take great pride in their products and especially if the product is made well and the price is right.  In this case, all was satisfaction.  Thanks A Million!
5.0	Good value. I wear them daily. Comfortable and look good.
5.0	delicate lovely ring for when I don't want to wear my diamond band, perfect - and when I say delicate it is super tiny and adorable!
5.0	In 2012 my husband and I were searching for a different sort of matching wedding bands, and we searched A LOT. After tentatively deciding on this one for me, we were pleasantly surprised.  My engagement ring is white gold and I was worried that it would clash, but they compliment each other beautifully.  The price was awesome, the surface design really is scratch resistant, and we get a lot of compliments.  The only complaint, which doesn't take away from the overall satisfaction, is that the metal on both sides of the design, and the design itself, isn't as brilliant as in the picture.  BUT that's understandable since I'm sure they used bright lighting for the pic.
5.0	This is the most beautiful locket that I have seen in a long time. The design is very unusual and the weight of the locket is unusually heavy. I hope the chain is able to hold it without a problem. The locket came in a very speedy manor. The dealers explanation of the locket did not do it justice. It came is a timely fashion. I will not hesitate to do business with this merchant again in the future. Thank You for the prompt manor that this sale was handled. I appreciate it.
5.0	love them just the size i needed
5.0	These look expensive. Had a complement the very first time I wore them. Would definitely recommend. They are beautiful.
5.0	these were gorgeous and perfect for the wedding! The back kept falling off though so I had to use one of my own.Worth it.
5.0	I absolutely love my monogram necklace!!! It is simply gorgeous and I will definitely be back for more!! LOVE! LOVE! LOVE! LOVE MY NECKLACE!! Thank you so much!!!! Highly recommend!!!
5.0	I retract my first review of this ring. I was wrong in not giving it the chance it deserved. I am sure the heat caused the discoloration when I first put on the ring. Since then, I have been happy with my purchase. The size is a perfect fit and the ring is shinny and reflective.  I would recommend this company for their quality and consideration to their customers .
5.0	Beautiful earrings and they arrived right on designated time.
1.0	Bought green Amethyst ring and very disappointed, no color at all. Sending this one back.
5.0	This is one of the most besutiful ring  I have in my collection, the citrine is very clear, the amazing yellow color its design, the rectangular shape makes the stone very sophisticated.
1.0	Didnt like it. The quality of the chain was horrible. The rope chain was loose and was coming apart and the clasp had a dent and the welds had build up on each side of the clasp. Wouldnt recommend it to anyone to buy.
5.0	I wore this necklace everywhere; hot tub, beach, pool.  It lasted a few years before it broke.  I'm still giving it a 5/5 because I love the style and certainly the rope part can always be replaced.
5.0	Just so beautiful. Love the color, even brighter than in the picture. I am pretty well never pleased with chains, almost all seem to catch themselves in the fine hairs... but really, this chain is not so bad. It does not take away from the quality. And even better, I am already happy with it, because it did not come apart within a week. I don't wear it all the time or anything, because I have tons of necklaces... plus it has to be said, I feel good wearing it. Almost like it was charges with positivity before I got it.
5.0	still needs to come with chain
5.0	My 12y old son was given this for Easter. He loves it. Perfect size. Great quality and I don't have to worry about getting broken as it is stainless steel. Great size for a female or child.
5.0	I bought these for a friend of mine who will soon be Mother of the Groom.  She loved them.  They're very well made and look like they were much more expensive than I paid for them.  The stones were all well matched and are the perfect size.  Not too big and not too small.  The colors are just beautiful and match her gown perfectly.  I'm going to buy a pair for myself!
5.0	My husband is from a strong Irish family... He is also military. I bought this as an inexpensive replacement for him to wear at work.
5.0	I bought these for Saint Patrick's Day and am very pleased. They are really pretty and the stone is bright. They are bigger than they look in the photo.
5.0	Perfect. It was exactly the way it looks online and falls perfectly on high neck shirts or dresses. So glad I got it.
5.0	Quality made, great coloring with shiny gold trim, shows up well on a jacket or hat.  Show your colors by wearing the Gadsden!
5.0	We bought this for our 9 year old daughter for Xmas. It is beautiful and has some weight to it. It does not feel cheap in any way whatsoever. I would question if this is a real sapphire, but that is not important to us. The cross is well worth the cost & hopefully it will last a long time.
5.0	Beautiful & Came In A Week Before Said Due Date.
5.0	Looks like it would cost a lot more, Very good item for the money.
5.0	These are great for people like me who lose earrings all the time. I use these in my ears and then they are flat on the back
5.0	Beautiful. It has a lovely look to it. If you are wondering what kind of red it is, my stone goes on the warm side, so the photo of it looking like a fall color red is accurate.
1.0	Very cheap. It fell apart after wearing it once. I would not recommend this to anyone. This is not a good buy.
1.0	This locket does not close properly. As far as I feel... It is broken. If it wasn't such a hassle , I would return it!!! I am disappointed.
5.0	Love this ring.  Cannot believe how great it looks for the price.  Very happy!
1.0	I was under the impression that I was buying a piece of jewlry for my husband and this is clearly for a women and too little for a man!
5.0	I've received multiple compliments on these gorgeous bracelets.
5.0	Love this ring. Beautiful. Heavy weight and always get compliments on it. Would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone.
5.0	Good weight to this ring forn the money.  At this price you can't miss on this ring.  My wife loves the ring.
5.0	This was way better quality than I thought it would be. I wear it ALL the time. Great conversation starter and a great price! Super fast shipping too!
5.0	Excellent product! Great seller! Very pleased!!👍😁
5.0	Just as described! Delicate and beautiful!!!
5.0	This necklace is beautiful! It has more of an eggplant hue than it appears in the photo. It falls gracefully right below the collarbone. After buying this for myself, I definitely plan on buying more as gifts. This was obviously crafted by some very skilled women! What a wonderful way to help these women lift their families out of poverty!
5.0	Stunning necklace. Arrived in a nice gift box suitable for wrapping.  Chain was a little short for my taste, but I just put the pendant on a chain I already had.
5.0	I bought this ring as a Father's day gift for my husband as a replacement wedding band. He absolutely loves this ring! It is very lightweight and stylish. I would recommend this ring to anybody.
5.0	Absolutely beautiful, great price for a great set of pearls.  My wife and I are very happy. Thank you so much
1.0	Back that has pin on it broke off so I can't use it! I threw it in the back of my jewery case.
5.0	I'm so glad I gave it a try even if the reviews were terrible.<br />A lot of people think this is too thin, I agree it is not thick looking as the picture showed, but it is not thin also, I mean $89 for real silver and designed style cuff.<br />I compare it with ARGENTO VIVO cuff. this cuff is about two times cheaper but two times better quality.
5.0	I purchased these little plane for my son's room who has an airplane/jet themed room and I was really inpressed with the quality of the planes. They feel just like actual toy planes, like I could take them off the ceiling fan and hand them to my son to play with. My son loves for us to pick him up so that he can touch them! With the planes added to the chain it does not make the ceiling fan chain extra long or extra short, it is just the right length for us, but that depends on how high or low your ceiling is too. I am short 5'0, but my husband who is 5'10 can reach up and grab the ceiling fan chains with no problem, he can't touch the ceiling or the fan itself though...lol So hopefully this helps in trying to figure out how long the ceiling fan chain hangs with the aiplane chain added to it! Hope this helps! Enjoy!
5.0	The earrings are beautiful. Haven't seen anything like them in stores. Beautiful made jewelry. I hope to see more of her designs on Amazon
5.0	These are absolutely the best and most beautiful I have in earrings I am sooooooo happy with them that I have ordered 3 more pairs and I may order others in the very near future thank you these are so beautiful. I would like to shout out that I am not in Colorado anymore I am in Santa Cruz California. I just wanted to say that these hoop sparkly earrings are the bomb I am just sadden that they are not available right now when they are I will be there. I would recommend these earrings to you all they are absolutely awesome thanks
5.0	I love this bangle bracelet.  It fits very nicely and I love the way it spreads open for easy slip on to my wrist.  Once in place it snaps snugly on my wrist but not tight.  It looks good and seems to be made well for an item in this price range.  I would happily order from this seller again.<br /><br />As an Amazon Prime member this bracelet qualified for free two day shipping and my bracelet arrived on time in perfect condition.
5.0	Excellent detail on this pedant !!!!!!!
1.0	This necklace is very cheaply made and looking.  It is so small you can't even tell what the charms are. This necklace has no quality to it.  Very disappointed with this necklace.
5.0	My Wife wanted something silver, not too fancy but yet had to be special.<br /><br />This necklace hit every target and she loved it. She has not taken it off yet.<br /><br />Thank you to whomever designed this and thank you Amazon for getting the necklace to me on-time for her Birthday!
5.0	My fiance proposed with this ring, and I am absolutely in love with it. He told me to find a ring I liked, and we started looking everywhere. We went to lots of jewelry stores, and looked at a lot of rings. I found a Vera Wang that I thought was &#34;the one,&#34; but of course it was almost $4,000. Realistically, that just wasn't practical. But at least I had an idea of what I really wanted. And even though we didn't have the biggest budget, I wasn't going to settle. I mean, I'm the one who will be wearing it everyday anyway. So I searched everywhere online for a similarly cut and set cz, and this was it. We were skeptical ordering something we hadn't seen or tried on, but with all the positive reviews we read, he went ahead and purchased it. It arrived a day before the expected delivery date, and we were both blown away with the quality. After all, we had been looking at real diamonds for so long I was expecting to be a little disappointed in the look of a cz, but that was not the case. It's beautiful and I get compliments on it all the time. You really can't tell a difference between this ring and a $4,000 ring.
1.0	Doesn't look as &#34;silver&#34; colored as shown and it doesn't fit my bracelet!  have to figure out how to return it!
5.0	Beautiful. Very pleased!
5.0	I'll echo the positive comments already posted here.  For $9, this is a great tool.  I've resized my watch about 3 times (moving links for better comfort) and it has done the job every time.    Things to note:  1. You will need a pair of needlenose pliers to full extract the pin. People buying this tool probably already have some.  2. You need enough patience and attention to detail to not mar your watch.  If you can't sit still and be careful for more than 5 minutes, don't bother doing anything with your watch - just take it someplace.  3. It's plastic, it's cheap, but it works.  Things might not line-up perfectly if you just slap your watch in there.  Go slow, be careful, make sure you're lined up.  It'll work just fine.
5.0	picture does this jewlery no good it is much more beautiful in real life but i would not recommend buying this if you preffer long posts/ bars to go through the piercing.
1.0	Very disappointed in this charm. Within two days, a few of the stones have fallen out of the little paw prints. Will be contacting the seller to see what my options are.
5.0	This was much prettier than I expected, and the diamonds were a really nice touch :)  I gave this as a gift to my friend and she loved it!
5.0	Very nice.  This one can act as a block on the bracelet as it screws on.  Love the little feet.
5.0	Very cute for a girl on the basketball team.
5.0	Absolutely beautiful!
5.0	I bought this for my son's girlfriend. My son was very impressed and wished it was coming from him.<br /><br />The sapphire is very small. The Blue topaz floats inside the caged heart. Very sweet.
5.0	lightweight and simple.  has a good feel to it.
5.0	beautifully made Bracelets of Amethyst, Rose and Tiger's Eye; really impressed on the beauty of them.
5.0	Beautiful, love 1928 brooches.  Buy when I can.
5.0	Looks elegant, nice pendant size, great message.
5.0	Dainty and very nicely made.  Just what I was looking for in your product.  I love them and have ordered others.
5.0	I love these earrings. The picture doesn't do them justice. The centers are much more elegant than the picture shows them to be.
5.0	Beautiful earrings for the price!  I was satisfied.  They were better than I expected.  They are round and without flaw.
5.0	bad ass ring get u some of that yea great price
5.0	I bought the cufflinks to wear for a Riddler costume and I was surprised at how inexpensive they were! They showed up earlier than the estimated delivery date, which I was very surprised about since they were coming all the way from China. They are really great quality and they even sent a chain that I can wear them on as a necklace! I am really impressed and I will be ordering a lot of things from JBlue in the future!
5.0	Worth your money good quality
5.0	Lovely pendant with great detail. I bought this after reading Deborah Harkness's Shadow of Night. It reminds me of Cora. I can't believe that they discontinued this item, it is so well done. I would have gotten it for my sisters and best friend as well.
5.0	I love the ring it fit's perfect and maybe i will get more jewelry from you guy's or tell people to buy from you .
1.0	I bought this for my boyfriend abd im looking at it right now and I do not like it it looks cheap as hell
5.0	Such a wonderful piece! I have got it to go along with a pair of earrings that i got LAST Christmas! it is stunning in person! So very shiny.
5.0	Have not had any problem with them since I purchased them one month ago.
5.0	"I absolutely love these earrings!! My husband bought them for me as a \\""just because I love you\\"" gift. I wore them out last night and got multiple compliments!"
5.0	OMG!! I just received these earrings and they are fabulous, and luscious but daring. They are all glittery and a very good size and so different that they will most definitely attract the looks and compliments. The price is phenomenal for the quality. Can't wait to wear them whether it is to just go to the supermarket or to a party. Don't hesitate if you're on the fence; they are worth every penny!!
1.0	Received these and they are junk...they stick out too far from your ears and the backs are too big for the thin posts. I had to take backs from another pair of earrings and when I woke up earring was half off my ear. Do not waste your money.
5.0	Just what I expected! I love it and get many compliments on it! Everyone thinks its another piercing in the ear so if you want the look but dont want to pierce your ear id definitely recomend this little climbing man
1.0	The clasp does not stay together and the necklace is always falling off.  It is impossible to wear for more than a few minutes.
1.0	This is the image and yantra of the Goddess Kali. If you're going to put the a high price on a goddess pendant, at least have the right goddess. People who look for goddess jewelry DO know the difference.
5.0	I love it!! Exactly how I pictured it and it looks beautiful on my bracelet.
5.0	Great buy.  I really like them.  Receiving them made my day.  Well worth the money. Thank you.
5.0	I ordered this bangle bracelet and two other peices from this collection. I received all three and they are all just stunning. The bangle bracelet is exceptional in craftsmanship. It must be European! The colors are more vibrant than shown on line and there is a small silver line that goes in between the two colors on each link that I did not see on the photo online. The quality and presentation are just superub. I bought it for myself for a Christmas present. Now I will have to wait, but it will be worth it. I will be ordering more items from this line in the future.
5.0	Excellent! Fit was dead on. My wrist falls between an 8 and 9. This was a perfect fit.
1.0	Clasp broke after third time wearing this chain.
5.0	soo beautiful and elegant!!!
5.0	Really cute style; it looks nice on my hand.
5.0	Five plus...have a brother with down syndrome..proud to wear the Down Syndrome Awareness bracelet. Bought a second one for my brother.
5.0	This is a really pretty ring that is complimentary to my other jewellery. I have nothing bad to say about the ring and it arrived on time.
5.0	I love this jewelry I wish there was more of everything, like sets.  I will definitely buy again.  It is very detailed.
5.0	they looked good on my girl, i like them
5.0	I bought this ring right after I got married and it's great! I've had so many comments from men and women about how much they like it and they've never seen one like it before. I'm buying enough to last a lifetime, that's how much I like this ring. The only negative thing towards it is that it can get a little scuffed up, other than that it is flawless. Not disappointed at all.
5.0	These are awsome . They stay in place I always buy the tunnels with the rubber o rings there so east to take in and out to clean and there very light . I'd recommend them .
5.0	These are beautiful. I get so many compliments when I wear them. And the price was unbeatable.
1.0	This chain is not the right length that I ordered and it is weakly made. Not good at all
1.0	Too Big, Not the right size
5.0	The charm was the perfect size for a charm bracelet.  It was finished on both sides, which is a must.  Many charms seem to only be finished on one side.  The price was good for sterling silver.
1.0	I am very unsatisfied with the product that I got.. yes they are forceps, but I ordered SLOTTED clamps.. and got regular forceps.. im mad because the piercing I needed to do I now can not .
5.0	This band is beautiful,  It is a lot heavier than ever thought.
5.0	This item is perfect. I had purchased as a gift and was not disappointed.
5.0	I ordered this ring, it comes just as it looks. Modern and so Cool. Love it, it was worth it
5.0	Absolutely beautiful!
1.0	It's way too small, both the length of the chain and the pendant. I plan on taking it back. It's also very cheap looking.
1.0	Update to original review. The hello kitty evidently was a decal that already wore off!<br />This was my first time ordering on this site and I am thrilled with the quality. I am a grandma who adores Hello Kitty and just started my charm bracelet. All the other Hello Kitty charms were out of my affordability but this one looks like it cost much more!
5.0	Very pretty & all that I wanted.
5.0	My daughter loves it!
5.0	This is exactly what I expected and i was not disapointed.  It is a lovely piece and arrived in a timely manner.
5.0	Was impressed..they are very sturdy..wasn't expecting that..and they are GEORGEOUS!!!
5.0	Very beautiful.  I like it very much.  Looks so nice on my ankle.
1.0	I purchased this band because I was traveling out of the country and did not want to bring my actual wedding set with me. At first I loved the ring. It fit well and was comfortable. Within a couple days of wear I noticed a very tender red ring forming on the skin were the metal touched. I am guessing I am allergic to this ring although I have worn tungsten in the past with no trouble.
5.0	Beautiful! Just placed another order to give to a dear friend for her 40th birthday gift. It's just the right size...not too big not too small
5.0	Very beautiful and just the right size. Had my charms on my chain with spacers prior to getting the charm holder. With the charm holder it looks so very much better
5.0	Cnt get enough of this watch.. Amazing... This is my second one sold the 1st one i bought.. No diamonds are missing and seems sturdy like the 1st.. I did run into some issues with the 1st one with the hans motion but that was due to a bad battery stopping and strating this battery seems good so far.. For the price  look and quality def worth a try.
5.0	Fits in my nose perfectly. Discreet for work. Love it!
5.0	It was given as a gift and the person who received it loved it. Great as a gift and worth the money.
5.0	I love this bracelet -- I now have this one and the pink, and I would definitely recommend them to others.
5.0	The ear rings were the hit of my daughter's Christmas. They well worth the cost,arrived on time, better than expected.
5.0	I purchase this as a Christmas present for my mother and she really loved it.  it is much more elegant than the picture depicts. Very happy with this purchase!!!
5.0	My wife is pregnant with our first.  I ordered it as a valentines day present and she loved it.  Wears it everyday.
1.0	VERY disappointed in the quality. looks and feels like a gum ball machine ring. I'm sure its not good quality metal either so it will probably turn my finger green in color. thought it looked nice enough online without spending a fortune. not a happy costumer
5.0	Turned out to be exactly what I wanted. Fits perfectly and the quality is great. I would highly recommend this to anyone.
5.0	Love the rings they look so much better when you actually see them up close love everything about them good quilts nice appearence  over all very satisfied
5.0	I really love this ring but may have to return it for a larger size I was hoping it would come in half sizes The size 6 fits but is tight getting it off but think the size 7 may be too large. I may call a jeweler to see if it can be stretched a bit so I would not have to get the bigger size otherwise it is a beautiful ring.
5.0	Delicate, beautiful pair of earrings.  Description noted flaws but I couldn't find them.
1.0	Bought as a gift for my niece's baby girl. Not happy with this item. So small it would have gone right thru the baby's ear.  Box it came in was smashed and broken and hinge was scotch taped together. Returned it
5.0	Love this clicker! It fits great and its so cute in! It fits in with all of my other piercings. Super feminine.
5.0	Happy with my purchase. I received the ring on time and it looks like the picture. Its a very cute ring.
5.0	With weight fluctuations that I have, this is my 4th gold band.  It is very comfortable, and I like the deeper gold color.  Comfort fit does make a big difference.
5.0	I Love my Dog-kids, and these adorable well-made paw-print earrings remind me of them every time I put them on.
5.0	I love the look of Hematite but it's ususally presented in unattractive ways; bulky bracelets, too heavy earrings, etc.  I own A LOT of jewelry, but nothing like this.  I really feared it may be too 'young' in style for me (well over 40) - but far from it.  It's comfortable, lightweight, obviously very flexible to fit everyone, (it very easily/loosely wraps around my wrist 5 times) and the gray and black together is indeed gorgeous! While I love jewelry, I'm critical about it too - and I'm serious in giving this bracelet a BIG 5 stars!  I'm betting you will too.
5.0	My daughter is interested in learning swahili, and so I got this for her. She loves it! It's very well made and quite lovely.
5.0	Got this as a gift for my friend who has a cartilage piercing! it was perfect! Small enough to fit perfectly on her ear but big enough to still tell what it was! It comes in an adorable little box and is a perfect little gift! Dogeared has such good quality and its always so very cute! Amazon has great prices for them!
5.0	It's beautiful and she loves it!  Just the right size.
5.0	The ring is beautiful exactly like the picture, it shines and has the small milgrain edges to give it a little detail.   My husband says its perfect and very comfortable.   Thank you Showman Jewels
1.0	The hook must be made of cheaper materials because they made my earlobes burn (I'm allergic to cheaper metal) and I had to remove them within minutes. They are heavy and made cheaply--the dangle chains had permanent kinks right out of the bag, and they are attached to the bottom of the big spiral rather than being attached to the hook at the top, which limits their movement and looks ridiculous from any other angle than straight-on, where you can see how the chains are attached. The earrings have so much potential to look expensive and elegant, so it was a real disappointment.
5.0	beautiful, small but solid
5.0	"Please see the customer image I uploaded. The ring is beautifully etched with a floral design that includes a little antiquing. It is solid copper measuring 1/8\\"" high and is stamped inside with the word 'copper'. The finish is highly polished leaving it feeling quite smooth against the fingers. The photos don't do it justice!"
5.0	Bought this as a gift for a reunion. It was really pretty the type is small, but it would look tacky if it were bigger. Its a nice weight as well so it feels expensive
5.0	Very eloquent.  Love it!
5.0	This necklace is just what I have been looking for; it is perfect!  It comes nicely packaged in a cute little blue bag and the necklace on the Endless Wave information card just as it appears on Amazon.  The size is just what I was looking for to wear on a daily basis!  The quote on the back &#34;The Waves of the Sea Help Me Get Back To Me&#34; speaks to me as I find my peace while at the beach.
5.0	A very nice cute one. A piece of special treat. It is worth a try if you are not sure with it. I used to have a lot of jewelries in Chinese classic style. However I thought it looked childish to put those staff on me so I gave them away. Now I am kind of missing them.
5.0	Love the CareRing covers... perfect for where I work and are very comfortable!!!
1.0	See the picture of the pendant?<br /><br />See the nicely muted emerald and silver colors?<br /><br />Yeah, that's not what you're going to get.<br /><br />What you will get is something so bright and shiny that I have to wonder if you took it outside that the crew on the ISS could see it from orbit.<br /><br />Gaudy is an understatement.
5.0	I bought these for a Christmas gift. They're pretty for the price point.
5.0	Beautiful ring and my future husband says it is the most comfortable ring he has ever tried on.  It is heavy and gorgeous.  I can't believe I got it for this price.  Extremely happy with the purchase.
1.0	I bought this set as a replacement while I waited to have my ring re-set.  Its very pretty, but it feels so light and I fear it will fly off my hand.  Definitely paid more than this thing is worth. :(
1.0	I loved the ring so much but after a week it started to turn my daughters finger greenish. I was so embarassed because the discription said 10 carot gold ( Not plated or overlay) so i sent it back.  They were great about taking it back.
5.0	My boyfriend ordered this necklace for me and I absolutely LOVE it!  I receive compliments on it nearly every day!!!  It is a great heavy piece. Arrived as expected with no problems at all.
1.0	Really liked bracelet, but after 7 months of occasional wear the magnetic clisure stopped wotking.  I can no longer wear bracelet.
1.0	I bought this watch holder in being proactive so that I had it in case I had a hard to open watch in the future. That day came this week and this watch vise failed miserably. I put one of my watches in the vise after removing the band that I couldn't open and tried to open the watch with a watch opener. On of the little arms immediately snapped off. It turns out that the little holders are in the block by 2 threads! Now its too late to send the thing back. I'm totally disappointed. :(
1.0	I got two sets of these rings (in slightly different sizes). They came quickly; however, the engraving looked like it had been done by a grade schooler. It was unevenly spaced and crooked.  Also, the second set of rings I got didn't have the same &#34;tungsten carbide&#34; internal stamp shown on the product picture. The first set did. When I looked more closely, the second set was not even a set at all - the supposedly matching rings were actually different tints of the silver color and had slightly different (from each other) manufacturer's stamps on the inside! These rings are cheap; but, in this case, you get what you pay for. I cannot recommend this product.
5.0	I ordered the royal blue and yellow, the colors and the necklace itself are even prettier in person! I also love how big it is. Such a beautiful statement necklace. An excellent purchase from Amazon! Great packaging as well.
5.0	"I am very pleased with the new \\""Germany-flag\\"" charm that we purchased for our daughter for her charm braclet.  This transaction was awesome!"
5.0	I'm in love with this bracelet. came just in time for my road trip and I wore it that weekend the whole time
5.0	I purchased this adorable horse charm as a gift for my six year old sister for Christmas.  She just adores horses.  She rides every week and speakks to you about horses like an adult woman.  Her eyes just sparkled after she got through all the wrapping and ribbon to get to the gift inside.  She wears it everyday and even named the horse (lol).  Thank you so much for helping make my baby sisters Christmas so special.  This was my firsst purchase from this seller and also my first on Amazon.com.  It was super smooth and easy.  Thank you again...Justina C.
5.0	Love it!!!! Looks amazing, way more stunning in real life!! So much glamour for such a small price is awesome!! Not sure how it would be for everyday wear, but perfect for special occasions/events! Such a unique design too!!
5.0	Nice earrings for my mom!
1.0	I so regret ordering this. In the pictures it appears to be a smaller pendant than it actually is. I was looking forward to wearing my beautiful evil eye pendant but when it arrived in the mail, I was Grately disappointed. Unless you like wearing pendants that are very big like this don't bother ordering. I will try to send it back. One positive thing I can say is that it arrived much earlier than the estimated time.
5.0	This is a excellent set, its look really great, I love it.  The color is like it shown in the page, and the size is perfect for days or nights.
1.0	The magnet on the ring is not strong enough to hold a very thin scarf.  I was very disappointed as it is very pretty.
5.0	Love it . So many colors of green and I didn't have this one  !
5.0	Small. But my daughter really likes it.
5.0	These collar stays are not of very good quality. They are much thinner than most.
5.0	My wife had me purchase this for a good friend as a birthday gift after her friend saw her wearing a similar Ruby Red NETAYA item we had purchased and after examining it was surprised at how inexpensive it was as it doesn't look like a cheap piece of costume jewelry. I used to make and repair jewelry and though these aren't high end pieces, they are quality pieces.[[ASIN:B006C6AY3E 7.50 Carat Blue & White Sapphire Heart Pendant in Sterling Silver with Chain]]
5.0	These adapters work well on the card that have no holding to put on racks. I'll be going back for more and will recommend them to my other jeweler friends. I like good service and this company seems to have a lot that interest me. I'm so glad they came up with this idea as I was using Velcro which didn't work so good.
5.0	This was an excellent purchase. It arrived on time and it looks just like it does in the picture. Great quality as well
5.0	Love these earrings!  I bought others from  the same source and they were all perfect .
5.0	When it arrived, it was even prettier than I thought it would be.  I needed something that is practical to wear to work without costing a fortune.  The Snake Chain is perfect for every day wear or a special occasion.  It doesn't look plated which is a huge plus, sometimes plated jewelry gets too orangey looking.  The size is perfect for me, and it wears really pretty.<br /><br />I received this product at a reduced cost in exchange for my personal and unbiased review.
5.0	Very high quality and heavy we love them!
5.0	Chrismas is coming and I ordered this as a gift for myself. They arrived fast. I didn't expect they look so small, but they are really nice-made and pretty. Love them!
5.0	Exactly what my fifteen year old wanted.
1.0	I bought this for my daughter for her birthday because she loves pandas.  She loved it! Unfortunately she had it on for all of 10 minutes when the ring tore out of the head. The head, The description said &#34;hardened clay material&#34; but it was really &#34;weak clay material&#34; and it only took a few minutes to ruin it.  Because I bought it while she was out of town and wasn't able to give it to her until she got home I was not able to return it because of their return policy so we were just sort of SOL. Although she didn't hate it I have to give it 1 star because it was cute but that's about it.
5.0	Very Pretty Band-<br /><br />I just love this Band.  Just enough to make you hands look very, very pretty.  I even brought a much smaller size for my pinky finger and it looks &#34;Great&#34;.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br />F.E. Manuel
5.0	Extremely nice for the price
5.0	"This is a great little ring.  It's not a cheap, flimsy feeling ring, this has some weight.  I sometimes have reactions to wearing other metals (even 10k gold), so far no problems with the surgical steel.  The 3 mm width is good on my smaller size hand.  I could have gone 4 mm with no problems.  I've never tried the \\""Comfort fit\\"" before but really like it.  My only caution is in the sizing.  They do give warnings about printing options when printing their sizing chart so pay attention.  My ring size was measuring in between the 7 and 8 on their chart so I went with an 8.  It was a little too big so I returned it with no problems and had a 7 sent instead.  All in all this was a great deal and I would definitely do business with them again."
5.0	I bought this beautiful red necklace for myself, but my daughter ended up confiscating it from me. It's bigger and prettier in reality than on the website. Everybody now wants the same necklace. I'm like'' go find your own''. If you order this item you will not be disappointed. The necklace is of good quality. The color red is just soooooo red. You will get many compliments....I can guarantee you that someone will try to confiscate it, so you might want to buy two.....
5.0	I get a lot of compliments on this earring. It makes quite a statement so I don't wear it everywhere.
5.0	if you have small wrists, it works<br />if you have wide wrists, it works<br />its adjustable and serves its purpose.
5.0	Just got my ring, love it, it is beautiful, period. I love amazon. You give us the opportunity to shop and get bargains.
5.0	Another great buy from KONOV! Would highly recommend
5.0	:) !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!would want to get this again,its worth the price and value,if you you r looking for something nice this is it!
1.0	This is a beautiful ring but the stone fell out within 6 months of having it & the silver is light weight. Buyer beware!
1.0	This ring is actually &#34;red synthetic turquoise&#34; per the receipt that came with it, not bloodstone as advertised and does not appear to be a gemstone as pictured.
5.0	these things are evil....thanx
5.0	"I bought this lovely rune pendant  almost a year ago for my (then) 19 year old daughter,. It arrived in due time, is very beautiful, also very nicely packed and with a nice card explaining the virtues of the gift, both symbolic and material. My daugter is very delicate and wise, connected to the \\""good spirits\\"" of the worlds. She loves it, appreciates its symblic promise, and it suits her beautifully. It's a great choice for anyone with a refined taste and alert spirit."
5.0	WOW.  This is a great piece.  Very substantial, well-made, and the details of the piece can only be appreciated with the naked eye.
5.0	Lovely, cute little earrings. I can wear them in my ears for days without any sensitivity, which is great. Would definitely recommend these to someone looking for small earrings they can wear all the time!
5.0	Beautiful.  I bought these to decorate a cake in the shape of a bible to be opposite a scripture for a bridal shower the groom loved the ring and wants it after the bridal shower.
1.0	It came way too large
5.0	I love their products and will defninitly order from them again!  They ship quickly and deliver as promised.
5.0	Very nice earrings. Good quality.  Great for wearing everyday.
5.0	I ordered two of these rings, one for my husband and one for me. He loves it. I really like it, just wish the metal part wasn't so dark. It's a little darker in person, but still a very pretty piece. I have received many compliments on it. For the price, it's a great buy!!
5.0	I am very happy with this. Very. Pretty. Chain could be better, but if I bought this at Zales,<br />I would have their cheap chain too!
1.0	I haven't even had these a month and they are rusted and look horrible. Very poor quality.
1.0	Who wears this?????? The . . . .v v v v v v v v v queen of England? U
5.0	This ring is beautiful and large. You want be disappointed.  I wear it almost daily. Its Keeps shine. Everyone ask where did I purchase it.
1.0	already lost the stone out of one due to the setting moving each time I put them in or take them out. consider a heavier setting with thicker prongs.
5.0	as far as I know it was well received. The color is bright and true to the image, good sparkle
5.0	I absolutely love this necklace. It is very simple yet classy. I wear it everyday and get compliments on it.
5.0	Beautiful ring in a true red color.  Good quality and is comfortable to wear. The setting is too small in size to call a 'statement' piece, but for someone who wears multiple rings, it's a good accent ring.  It's getting a lot of wear during the Christmas season.
5.0	Absolutely gorgeous! I've had sooooo many compliments on this ring!
5.0	Beautiful, very nice quality Sparkly!
1.0	I've had this bracelet for several days and cannot get it to open. Seems to want to twist with great difficulty but, won't open. After $#20 in customs fees plus the cost/S&H, I wouldn't waste your money on this.
5.0	This was a gift from my sister who is so close to my heart - so it has extra special meaning to me.
5.0	I've been wanting a pair of earrings like this for a while.  I love them. From far away you can't really tell what they are. But when you're face to face with people,  there's no mistaking what they are. Shipping took a minute due to distance but I knew that before ordering.  Great item...perfect seller. Definitely recommend!
5.0	I bought it for myself and I like it. The stone is large and it has a nice colour, and the chain is probably too long for my liking though.
5.0	Bought this for my son. ordered late Friday night received Monday. Super fast shipping. Product is perfect and he loves it
1.0	these are a small child's earings- not even a teenager would look good in them.  I had to raise them close to recognize Minnie, otherwise, they look like a red and silver shiny dot.  Cute for a very small child.
5.0	I bought these and a similar pair by Majorica for four times the price. Side by side you can clearly see why one is more expensive than the other, but on the ear, in an everyday setting (or somewhere active where you don't want to run the risk of losing one) they are pretty and a great backup pair of pearl earrings.
5.0	I love it! it ia exactly what I was hoping for. It is heavy and sturdy and the necklace hasnt broken yet and doesn't show signs of wear yet. Its a great product and arrived much sooner than I expected . thank you :)
5.0	I was so surprised with how nice & pricy these pearls look....in person they look as IF I paid an arm & leg for them...this is definitely a great GIFT idea for someone special.
5.0	We purchased these earrings for our 5 year old and they are the perfect size for her. They are not as small as a piercing earring, but just a bit larger. Perfect size for a young girl. Our little princess loves the bright pink color and that the earrings really sparkle :-)
5.0	recieved them on time and I love them.
5.0	THIS PRODUCT IS MORE BEAUTIFUL IN PERSON!
5.0	very nice gift for my daughter she liked it
5.0	This bracelet is perfect with everything! I love the mix of gold, copper and silver. Fix well. I love it.
5.0	Bought this as a gift for a purple lover and it was so pretty when it arrived, I almost kept it for myself!
1.0	it started breaking up after using a week or ,the material is very bad its a waste of money and thats it
5.0	I'm submitting the same review for each of the cufflinks I purchased for my wedding.<br /><br />These were all solidly built items and each of the groomsmen in my wedding party loved them.<br />They are much more fun than the stock (junk) cufflinks you get at the tux rental places. and the colors really make them pop.
5.0	Got this as a Easter basket stocker. I decided to get one for myself. They look heavier than they are. I love them and so does the person I got them for.
5.0	Arrived on time.....a bit larger than anticipated, but the quality is superior!
5.0	I am pleased with this ring. It is holding up well. My job is very tough on my jewelry. It was also nice to see that the colors of the stones actually matched the picture perfectly. Have had pieces that were off by several shades, and the color of this ring was important as it is my fiance's birthstone and will be worn as 'something blue' in our wedding.
5.0	Beautiful chain and much thicker than most chains.
5.0	I adore this bracelet. It tends to catch on things from time to time but it's handcuffs, of course it will. Well made and looks great.
1.0	I HAVE NOT YET GOTTEN THIS ITEM!!! CAN I GET SOME INFORMATION AS TO WHERE IT IS OR WHEN I WILL GET IT?
5.0	A touch of class to your daily routine. A good solid plug for a great price. Great buy for anyone.
5.0	Bought this as a Christmas gift for a &#34;tweenager&#34; and it was a hit.  she really liked the look of it and enjoyed checking to see how her &#34;mood&#34; affected the necklace by changing colors.
1.0	I bought it thinking it would be as awesome as it looks on the pictures, but it is totally defective looks cheap you can see the glue on the corners of the stone and when i asked to return it they referred me to amazon which is such a complicated issue that i dont wanna deal with.
5.0	I love this necklace.  Great detail in the pendant.  The sterling chain is sturdy and just the right length.  The necklace is beautiful and the claddagh and the celtic knot are detailed.  This was a great necklace for the cost.
5.0	Lovely chain - perfect match for the pendant I had made.  Verified 14k gold and I feel it was well worth the price.  Chain is nice and strong.  The pendant it will hold is an heirloom, so I wanted something strong.  Clasp closes firmly and opens with proper amount of effort.  No complaints!
5.0	Have a corded skull bracelet that doesn't stay tight but this clasp is wonderful.  Also have one with a buckle that I enjoy.
5.0	We love them. Bought for our 45th wedding anniversary. We try to get new rings for our anniversary every 5 years or so. These will take there place among others we have. For our 50th I will give her a diamond. Not because she likes them better but 50 years is worth the extra expense.
5.0	This item is unbelievably beautiful considering the price.  I simply cannot understand how something so inexpensive can be manufactured, packaged and shipped at such a low price.  I will wear it proudly and have little doubt will receive many compliments.  In addition, I received it far earlier than promised.
5.0	It's not your typical 108-bead Mala, but it is striking, light, easy to wear, and very easy to keep count of the chants with.  So far, it hasn't stretched, although that wouldn't be such a bad thing at all.  It does lack &#34;marker&#34; beads (larger beads interspersed with the smaller beads), so if keep exact count is important to you, another mala might be your thing.  If you just wish to have something physical to hold to help you work through the chants, this is awesome.  BTW, the green bead is a swastika, a traditional component of many malas, so you may have to take time to explain its significance and educate people when you wear it.
1.0	I got this ring today in the mail and as soon as I put it on it chip cracked and broke so upset
5.0	These earrings are gorgeous. I've never received so many compliments on a pair of earrings, and I own plenty of other earrings. They are super versatile. I've worn them with a basic tee, and I've sported them with a snazzy dress. They compliment any outfit. You won't be disappointed with this purchase!
5.0	I was a bit skeptical about the quality of the necklace due to the low price, but in the end, I was very satisfied.
5.0	Very lovely on my daughter
1.0	Came in ugly and bent
5.0	Stunning, very high quality, beads are beautiful, this will be worn a lot!
5.0	Very different from the rest. Good quality. Thank You.
5.0	Arrived on time.  It is bigger looking than I thought.  I was worried that it would be really small.  I don't think the chain is silver.  There appears to be some tiny marking on the pendant, but my eyes are not good enough to read it.  It is very adorable and I love the design.  Having the little stone makes it sparkle.
5.0	Great design and excellent quality. Inner rim of the ring is very comfortable. Its an excellent product. I got the rose gold option and it was lighter in actuality than in the picture. Still, I'm completely satisfied with the product and wont hesitate to get another.
5.0	My son is going to Ireland & I wanted him to have the good luck Claddagh on him somewhere for the trip. He's NOT a jewelry person but, he loved this. Nice little piece of jewelry for the great price!
5.0	Good leather material, very comfortable and fits perfect.
1.0	My fiance bought this ring just received it today stone missing band bent & big stone is loose!!! Very very disappointed!!!
5.0	Fast shipping! Great ring, great price
5.0	These nose studs are perfect, just what I was looking for, perfect size also! I will be referring friends when they are looking for nose studs! Thank you!
5.0	I loved it, looks exactly as pictured..
5.0	its pretty lightweight, but beautiful! I've gotten so many compliments on this necklace. Its just awesome!
5.0	What is the color of the neck chain?
5.0	I didn't get the red one because it was no longer available, The company sent me an e-mail, and asked if I wanted another color, or if I wanted a refund. I chose another color, and it is really beautiful! I love it.
5.0	This was a gift.  Was very nice, well made, came quickly and well packaged.  Overall I was very happy with it.
5.0	I LOVE IT. I HAVE MANY COMPLIMENTS ON THIS JEWLERY. I LOVE ANYTHING WITH ANGELS OR ANGEL WINGS.  THANK YOU SO MUCH.
5.0	Just received this today and it's really pretty and I feel good about the purchase. The quality is nice and at the price I paid for it, I wish I bought more.
5.0	I got what I wanted at a great low price! It shipped fast and I had no problem with my order what so ever!!
5.0	We bought this and several other rings for my daughter's 3rd birthday.  Finding rings small enough for her finger was difficult so my husband suggested toe rings.  It worked, they fit - however she looses them easier than real rings.  First time wearing it, she lost it without realizing it. However, my son found it so we learned that they were going to be hard for her to keep track of.  This ring was very nice, great quality.  I bought a couple others that were around the same price and definitely cheaper quality.  This was really cute, much cuter on that the picture shows.
1.0	They did not give the size in the description.  They are good for a seven year old.  Beautiful earrings but too small
5.0	Perfect item i ever got
5.0	Love the Wyoming AND the Utah charms. Going to search through vendor's ware and see what else I find!
5.0	This is one of my favorite. They are real pearls, but of course imperfect, which is why it is so much fun wearing them. I can spend less but have different accessories everyday, which s so much better than fake plastic pearl!
5.0	I got these for my wife to go with her engagement ring as she really likes alexandrite. She has three holes in each ear and these sit in the top one, and even through her hair they sparkle and shine. She has had people ask her if they are blue diamonds, she just smiles and says no, guess again!
5.0	I love it because its something you can wear with anything and me I dress by my mood and it compliments my mood every time. Great buy!
5.0	super cute ring holder.  The long tail and big head are adorable.  Great to keep by your sink to have a place to put your rings when you remove them to wash your hands.
1.0	Awful..fell apart after wearing once
1.0	I actually had to order a second pair the first pair broke when I put them on the first time I tried to wear them. I am hoping for better luck with the second pair
5.0	These Swarovski Zirconia Princess-Cut Stud earrings are just as advertised! They do indeed offer the brilliant shine and flawless clarity that makes them look like natural diamonds! I also really like the silicone covered push backs. They are so much easier to handle and extremely comfortable against the back of my ears.<br />The size of the earrings is just right for me - they are about the size of the nail bed on my little finger. The stones on these earrings are actually just a bit smaller than the stone on the matching pendant of the same (3 cttw) size.<br /><br />I would highly recommend these earrings to anyone looking for an alternative to spending thousands of dollars on the real thing!
5.0	It fit my finger very well. I really love it so beautiful and pretty.The shipping process very fast and excellent .
5.0	The pictures really don't do this ring justice. It is absolutely beautiful.
5.0	This product took awhile to get here, but when it did, it was well worth the wait!!  Love these cute Kittie items!!
5.0	Returned because it was too big  - my fault.
5.0	This ring looks great and fits even better.  Like all other tungsten rings it's a little heavy but i like the way it feels.
5.0	its  a  nice  ring  me  and  my  girlfriend  loved  it  a lot
1.0	I was given this ring by my husband, it was beautiful.  The gold was alittle thin in the band but I loved it.  Because of the diamond stood so high I wore it only when going some where.  The ring was purchased in May, so I have only had it for a short time.  The Dimond including the setting in the center broke off and is gone.  For the amount of money paid for this ring, its very upsetting!
5.0	i love it!!!! it is so beautiful! and i would recommened it to others!
5.0	I have my own Pearl set & I bought this one for my daughter's HS graduation since she's always borrowing mine.  I love it & she does also. The pearls are lovely & the clasp on both the braclet & necklace are much better than the set I originally bought & returned for her.  This set exceeds my satisfaction & then some.  Would buy again!!
5.0	stunning!  looks better than the real thing and at the price, who cares if it scratches or tarnishes (which it has not so far)??  if it does, buy a new one next year!  Mine looks fantastic and sooo believable!  i wanted an upgrade for our tenth anniversary and my husband would rather buy a vacation or a nicer car than throw money at a diamond, so i got this...  so glad I didn't drop +20k on a real one!!  I wear it with an eternity band (also amazon collection) and the set is perfect.
5.0	I purchased this as a replacement for one of my favorite necklaces, which was very similar to this one. I am not disappointed. The bar gives off just enough sparkle and it doesn't seem to twist while you are wearing it. It's one of my favorite pieces of jewelry.
1.0	Stop lying to people. This ring is surgical steel not stainless. U can't resize surgical steel. Look for the s.steel that mean surgical not stainless
5.0	Received pendulum in little package, but just as described and shown in picture. Quartz is very clear, so clear in fact that I would suspect it to be glass except for a small fracture line you'd expect from quartz.
5.0	The Earrings came in 5 days after i bought them, and i was very satisfied in the packaging. the quality is very good as well as the finish on the earrings itself. i would definatly purchase more from this seller in the future and recommend them to any and all of my friends who are interested in the particular style of ear candy!!!
1.0	Crystal was very small and the piece hooked through the eye hole was cheap and fell off the first time I wore it on a necklace and lost the crystal. Very disappointed
5.0	In my previous review I wrote the bracelet came undone at the draw string area.  I purchased three and two had this problem, I fixed it with glue.  The owner saw my review, contacted me and replaced both bracelet, one in which I received a refund for and  at no additional charge.  Her concern was truly amazing.  I wear them pretty much everyday and get plenty of compliments.  It's great to see that people still have pride and stand behind what they sell.  Thank you :)
1.0	I was really excited to gift these earrings to a close friend of mine who loves yellow diamonds. Upon getting the package, I instantly ripped it open to see the earrings. One earring had a noticable chip in the side of it. Then taking a closer look, the two diamonds are different cuts! Both square shaped, but one is a princess cut, and the other is something else. One has a flat surface, while the other is a table cut. I paid for expedited shipping to get them here on time, and they did arrive quickly, but I have to meet her for dinner in an hour, and now I have no gift to give. I am returning these. They are terrible. If somebody bought these for me, I would wonder why they wasted their money. I would not buy these for myself, and they are definitely not gift quality!
5.0	I grabbed these at a great rate during the Christmas sales, they are my every day go with everything earrings. You won't be disappointed!
5.0	I got these for my wife for her annual Christmas party.  She really likes them.  She doesn't like the giant earrings, so these were perfect.  They went well with a snowflake pendant I also bought.  If you're looking for small snowflake earrings that are very pretty and glittery - look no further.  Great product.
5.0	I love this charm. unique and fun since you open it and there is a beautiful red heart picture in it. It looks just like in the picture and the description was accurate. very happy with purchased.
5.0	Sons' birthday ift, he loved it.
5.0	This is really a nice ring at a good price my husband really liked it
5.0	Very comfortable to wear. Looks as nice wearing it as it does in the on line image. I would recommend this product.
5.0	Perfect size and quality; Modest. I LOVE THEM!!!
5.0	Ok, let me start off with saying that this piece is beautiful. I wear it everyday and get compliments on it all the time.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the piece that I originally received from the seller had a clasp that was a tiny bit loose. I notified the seller and was able to get my necklace replaced hassle-free. This seller is extremely concerned about making sure that the customer loves the product, and is entirely satisfied with it.<br /><br />I am now wearing the necklace with the tighter clasp all the time, and it has not come loose while running, swimming or sports. I highly recommend this product as a birthday present for friends or significant others. Thanks a lot Peora for a wonderful shopping experience!!!
5.0	Needed a quick gift and it fit the bill, I would buy it again knowing it worked out as well as it did.
5.0	Looks just like the picture. Nice size ring.
5.0	I have hunted this type of ring for a few years.  It is what I consider to be high quality i.e. it is made well and is not flimsy as some great value jewelry items can be.  It is truly beautiful and will make a great Fall accessory.  The center stone is about a 3/8 in. wide and about 6/8 in. long so it's not overly big or too dainty.
5.0	Great gift idea for my besty....she loved it. I have 4 more in ny wish list to purchase  for gifts
5.0	my hubby bought this for me and I absolutely love it I get a lot of compliments on it and people think that they are real stones
5.0	These earings are fabulous! ! Not heavy at all! Highly recommend! Love them! The size is just right, I can wear them everyday!
5.0	The ring exceeded my expectations. It came on time and the packaging was quite nice. I was also surprised to see 3 of the Tiger images on it. It is a stunning ring and i love it.
5.0	Practical and eye catcher
5.0	we couldn't afford platinum so we decided to go with a titanium band to replace my broken white gold one.  cheap, comfortable, and attractive!
5.0	Gorgeous Rosewood beads for a cheap price! Wear them all the time with my tigers eye mala and hematite one which I use for meditation.
1.0	Bought this ring for my husband birthday.  He wore it about a week and the band torn in half.   The company called after I left a negative feed back, left me a message.  I returned to call to John, but they where closed for the holiday and I have not heard from them since.  They offered to replace the ring, but I can not get anyone to return a call to get the problem taken care.  Very disappointed in the whole process.  THe ring has good detail and my husband was pleased but not we are both disappointed in the customer service from the company.   Would be pleased if they would return a phone call and replace the ring.
5.0	THIS IS A BEAUTIFULL SET BUT ARRIVED LATE, I WILL KEEP IT FOR ANOTHER SPECIAL OCATION THIS YEAR LIKE A SPECIAL DINNER FOR MY HUSBAND BIRTHDAY.
5.0	Precise made with quality, I recommend to have it, very good price.  But you should order ½ less than your ordinary size.   My size is 13, but I found the best fit for this ring (because its comfort) is 12.5.
5.0	MY 17YR OLD DALMATIAN JILL JUST PASSED IN NOVEMBER.THIS LOOKS JUST LIKE HER!!.  I LOVE THESE CHARMS AND ORDERING ALL OF THEM WITH THIS PICTURE AND THE BEAGLE ONE.  THEY ARE SMALLER THAN PICTURED!!
5.0	My son like it very much he walks around all day he never takes it off he really likes this
1.0	Not happy...something in the Steele makes me itch and I can wear stainless Steele, but not this.
5.0	I bought this a while ago for my girlfriend and it looks amazing! i was scared on how it would look when it ship to my house but when I open it, it looks perfect! No scratch or anything. Loved how the diamond sparkles when the light hits it. :)
1.0	Sizing is not correct. I ordered a size 6 and the ring fits my daughter who is a size 4 1/2. Stones were quit smaller then picture displays.
5.0	Love this item, perfect match and wear with my black one!..TY
5.0	This piece is extremely beautiful.  It is fun to wear and I got a lot of compliments on the necklace and earrings at a wedding.
5.0	My bands are beautiful
1.0	I have not been able to wear the necklace. The clasp broke the first time I used it. It looks good in its little bag, though.
5.0	I got these as a gift for my girlfriend. These looked good online (I could picture them as really looking beautiful on my blonde, blue-eyed, fair-skinned girlfriend) and had a few good reviews but I was still wary of purchasing these.<br /><br />The last time I bought jewelry online it was a pair of earrings that promptly broke the third time she wore them. Needless to say I did not write a glowing review for those.<br /><br />Shipping-->Excellent<br />This set arrived exactly as quickly as they were meant to (thank you Amazon Prime) which equated to just in time for me to present them to my GF on a romantic weekend getaway.<br /><br />Quality-->Excellent<br />This earring and necklace set look incredible on my GF. She is constantly receiving compliments on the set (I've personally witnessed this). That said these pearls look great. I'm a fan of any jewelry that stands out in a subtle way and these pearls do just that. They're called black pearls but they look almost dark green and they are certainly uncommon (big points in my book, true taste involves being outside the ordinary to some degree).<br /><br />Durability-->Excellent<br />It's been weeks of fairly steady wear and these have not broken (doesnt sound like a big accomplishment but see above for my last experience getting jewelry from Amazon).
5.0	Beautiful, I love this earing
5.0	Quality boxes and fast shipping! THANX!
5.0	I honestly really love this necklace, it fits well, & it's a good summer wear.
5.0	It's nicely cut clear crystal with translucent AB (aurora borealis) coating on the back, which gives it a very pretty sparkle. Just as described, and shipping was quick.
5.0	This ring is SO beautiful!!! I loved the picture of it when I ordered it, but when it got here I couldnt help noticeing that it looks even better in person. I took my wedding pictures with this ring on and it looked amazing the entire time. I wear it everyday and never have any problems with it. I would recommend this ring to everyone. It is a Great Buy*
5.0	Very nice. Everything it said it was and more! Will order more products from them in the future.
1.0	I ordered these item as a gift for my mother (I also got the December).  Neither of them were the right color.  The December was more of a bright blue color and the February were pink in color.  Would not recommend.
5.0	These are very pretty earrings!  Exactly what I wanted.  They are small, which was what I was looking for.  Want to wear them all the time.  They fasten securely, so no concern about losing them.  Perfect!
5.0	Bought this as a valentines present for my boyfriend and I just know he's gonna love it, perfect size and delivered just in time
5.0	Big and blingy &#34;play&#34; jewelry, great when I want the sparkle without worrying about real jewelry.  The chain is not on the same par as the pendant; I immediately slipped it onto a much nicer snake style chain that matches the shiny finish on the top of the bale.  One of my girlfriends threatened to steal it thinking it was real.
5.0	I really like this bracelet, it is well done and very well packed, I like the price and is well clean and very nice
5.0	well made, was as described. easy to take links out and put back in if needed.
5.0	I love this anklet and it looks beautiful.  I received many compliments.
5.0	Beautiful and much loved
5.0	looks great. cant wait to give it to my soon to be husband
5.0	fits great and looks great! Nice quality!
5.0	I bought these for my son and he just loves them. They are a larger earring, but my son really likes them.  Very durable too.
5.0	I love this toe ring, the fact it's Hawaiian in design was a huge plus for me!
5.0	These were actually good quality, it does come in pairs not just singles if anyone was wondering. This is good for someone starting to gauge. I believe the biggest plug is smaller than an inch maybe a 7/8 because they go right through my earlobes. Quick delivery compared to what Amazon had estimated came almost 10 days + early.
5.0	I am a newly enganged gal and I am unique to say the least. When I received this ring as my engagement ring I was amazed, touched and happy as could be! Sleeping Beauty turquoise is my favorite stone and sterling silver is my favorite metal. The price was reasonable and I love it! The ring is a bit smaller than pictured but it is just what I wanted :)
1.0	Took a long time to get the item.  When it came the necklace was broke.
5.0	Looks amazing and received in a shorter amount of time than predicted, also looks stunning in the sun light due to the high polish.
5.0	KONOV does it again! Love the products they sell! Price, quality! Fast shipping! Recommend to everyone! Love this band, Leather, stainless steel! Fits great.
5.0	Came on time and fits very well. I'm very skinny and I thought that would just slid right off. But it fits perfectly. Even for people that are a heavy than me. I had my mom tryed it on and it still fit her well. The string doesn't really show either. So even if you have a skinny wrist or yours is bigger/normal size it will fit just fine.
5.0	Lovely necklace and will be one of my favorites as spoken by my sister-in-law on receiving this gift.
5.0	I bought this ring as a replacement for my lost &#34;wedding band.&#34;  I paid $35 for this ring, and, when it arrived, it had the little tag on it with the size and an MSRP of over $400!!!  How could you not love a ring like that??<br /><br />I like the way the ring looks, but you should note that the stones vary in color from very dark blue to medium-dark blue.  I do like the dark setting to make the diamonds more subtle.
5.0	Wonderful set of japa mala.  Fast ship, sturdy product, would definitely order from this seller again.
5.0	When I wear these earrings people always notice them. Yet the earrings are not large. They are perfect and very lady like.
1.0	I did not get what  I expected, I could why it was so cheap! Because it is!!!!!!!
5.0	Very delicate and pretty. I love it.
5.0	I hope this last a while. I'm a fit 200 lbs. male and it fits perfectly. Love the magnetic hasp. Looks much more expensive than it was.
5.0	My daughter is a Hello Kitty fanatic!!  A friend of mine purchused this for her birthday.  I cannot wait until she see's it.  I love it and it looks very strudy and able to withstand the &#34;love&#34; a 6 year old will give it.<br />I would recommend this for your little girl whole heartedly.
5.0	luv these  earrings they are beautiful, well made
5.0	Even though i didn't buy this ring here. It has been my favorite piece of jewelry.
5.0	Absolutely beautiful.  Purchased for wife for birthday along with pendant.  She fell in love with them immediately.
5.0	This bracelet looks so good in the summer months ahead.  It can be worn casual or with a cute maxi dress.
5.0	These are lovely, comfortable earrings.  They come off too easily, hence my need for a second pair, after having lost one earring !!
5.0	The changeable hoops are exactly what I was looking for.  Only wanted peridot to add to my jewelry collection but have the added bonus of citrine, garnet, amethyst and blue topaz.
5.0	I truly love this bead and I always get great comments from friends
5.0	So it's not &#34;real&#34; diamonds, but the casual observer would never know.  Further, the ring is a comfort fit with a slightly curved inside.  AND you cannot beat the price!
5.0	Is a good thing to be a muslim, things like this is unique, is a blessing from Allah peace be unto him
5.0	This is a beautiful necklace and I absolutely love it. I have had it for a few months now. It is unique looking, very feminine and looks so lovely with many kinds of clothes styles. It is however very light and looks like it can be easily broken. And if it does brake, I will just have to buy another one of these!
5.0	This is my second purchase from this seller.  Once again, the necklace exceeded my expectations!  Even though the necklace was inexpensive, it is very well made and doesn't appear to be &#34;cheap&#34;.  I have received many compliments when I wear it.  My first necklace, which is a year old, still looks great and is in great shape.  I wear it at least once a week.  No problems!
5.0	I love the hot men's stainless steel......,
5.0	Just what I was looking for
5.0	It's really beautiful
5.0	Love this charm! It's super cute and I live the marcasite. I like the clasp attachment, too. It makes it so easy to space charms as I collect them.
5.0	I love these earrings perfect amount of dangle, not to big or too small,dress up or down ,great value and get lots of compliments on how nice they look.
5.0	I love this.I purchased it for my mom for Mother's day.So beautiful.Great buy and arrived in great time.
5.0	i love my ring i bought this one and the matching one for men and its great a few scratches but for the price its a good temporary ring
5.0	I ordered these only to discover they were much too big for me.  They made a perfect gift for a friend.  Nice!
1.0	I ordered these earrings when they were on sale for $99.00 because I thought they were an excellent deal. After they arrived and I put them on, my fiance noticed (from 6 feet away) that one of the studs had a large black spot right in the middle.  I will be sending them back tomorrow.
5.0	I normally prefer big earings and i normally use big earings to office too.This is just right and is not too jazzy and could be used for casual wear too
5.0	The stones are a beautiful color, and they're very pretty earrings packaged in a nice box. I recommend these.
1.0	To big for bracelet  Have to check also if is sterling silver so it won't turn black and make sure it fits pandora
5.0	I bought this as a replacement box for an engagement ring. It was perfect! The hinge is well-made and the quality of the box is top-notch for the price. The inside is the same material typical for most jewerly boxes. The color of the box looks great!
5.0	I read the reviews of other people and some had bad things to say about these rings.  I had tried other ring sets, but they did not touch me like these did.  With other rings they were just rings not personality, or romance.  I have had these rings for about 30 days and every time I see such sparkle I get tingles, like I'm looking into the future in a mirror.  The cut is amazing, Swarovski outdid  themselves this time.  And I make jewelry and always use Swarovski for sparkle and shine, like stars.
5.0	Great product, fast delivery. Would do business with again. AAAA++++
5.0	i bought a few of these Alex and Ani Bracelets for my girl for her Birthday and she absolutely Loves them.
5.0	Beautiful,  quality great,  just waiting for my exchange of ring size.  Highly recommend it.
5.0	I love these earrings.  They are so cute and look just like their picture.  They hang very well.  Together with other items from the &#34;Paris Is Always a Good Idea&#34; items, they make a very cute jewelry combination.  There are several other pieces of jewelry.....necklaces, bracelets and earrings from this collection.  These earrings are my favorite.  One thing to watch, however......the price changes from time to time.  I've seen it as high as $34.99 and as low as $24.99.  If you see the low price, grab it then.  It will change.  I know!
5.0	I love this nose stud but it is very tiny.  Can be difficult to put in when this small.  The color is a nice shade of pink.
5.0	The stones are beautiful and big enough to be seen peaking through my hair.  Well made.  Very very pretty! tf
5.0	Epoxy set crystals in a silver frame with a prong set crystal station between the post and the dangle- these earrings have a nice amount of movement with 2 free swinging connections. They are sparkly, a nice size, and work well for a lot of outfits. The blue will dress up denim and the sparkle works for evenings in dressy clothing. They look nicer than the photo with good coverage of crystals.<br /><br />All that would make these a solid 4 stars, the 5th star is because they are actually wearable. Most of the earrings I wear are made by me so I know the hooks and weight will work for me and it won't be something that's irritating enough that they get removed after a couple hours. This is one of the very few commercial pairs of earrings that I've ever been able to wear all day that didn't bother me at all. The fact they are a nice size and so sparkly makes them one of my favorite pairs of earrings.<br /><br />They come with standard butterfly clutch backs and clear rubber backs. The butterfly clutches are very secure. I didn't try the rubber backs.<br />Review item provided at no cost, this is my honest experience and opinion.
5.0	"I purchased this pendant as a Christmas gift for a young woman whose name I selected as a \\""Secret Santa\\"".  She loved it and wears it frequently!  The pendant, a great value, is nicely-made and appears to be of high-quality.  Presentation-wise, it arrived boxed, accompanied by a velvet gift bag.  Overall, a nice purchase for a happy recipient."
5.0	Lovely.  My granddaughter loves it.
5.0	i love it<br />great quality<br />great design<br />great price<br />very stylish<br />love the designer<br />very happy with the product...  :)
5.0	I had been looking for a stack ring for a while and fell in love when I saw this one. Since I have received it, I haven't taken it off. I also get complimented on it when anyone sees it.
5.0	This is just stunning I wear it everyday!  It's just beautiful!
5.0	My Daughter bought this ring and she loves it. It is made very well  and looks great on her finger.
5.0	I LOVE this ring!! It fit perfectly and looks like a million bucks. It's very solid and beautiful!
5.0	These earrings are truly beautiful.  I cannot believe they can be purchased at that price.  I have already ordered them twice.  Very satisfied with this order.
5.0	These earrings are actually colored rods inside a thin layer of clear glass but I don't think it detracts from their look. Simple cute earrings. They fit my 4 G ears perfectly. At first my hair got caught in them but flipping them around pretty much fixes that problem and they stay in well.
5.0	Without repeating everyone else, let me say you get great value for what you pay.  It's classy, comfortable, and shiny - and looks like it's going to stay that way. It lives up to the 'comfort fit' label by being comfortable, sliding on easy and staying on.  Its not white gold or platinum but it looks just as nice and so is the price. And at this price, you never have to worry about losing or breaking it. This will likely be my daily wear ring. Buy it now while the price is right!  Update: May 7, 2015 The ring remains intact but it has been prone to scratches. I recommend removing the ring prior to doing any kind of work with it (dishes, gardening, woodshop, etc.) Otherwise it's still a nice ring for the price.
5.0	I love this necklace.  We just recently purchased a 2003 Candy Apple Red Mustang convertible and I love anything with Mustangs
5.0	I just got them, and I love them.
5.0	This is a lovely bracelet and I wear it ever day, including at night when I sleep and in the morning when I shower. I don't want to ever take it off.
1.0	1. I had to wait FOREVER for it to come<br />2. I got 6 duplicates<br />3. I only received one that was advertised
5.0	Perfect size for little girls not too long. Pretty and quality crystals and nice setting. Champagne color is clear and shiny.
5.0	They came on time, they're the right size. The flares were a little large and I did have some difficulty bending them enough to get them in my ear so I trimmed the back flare enough so it would fit. I've had other flared silicone tunnels without this problem. But, other than the flare I would recommend.
1.0	Clarity was deceiving in the picture.  The stones do not look chocolate, they look like a Citrine. However, it was a Christmas present and there was no time to return it.
5.0	They are perfect to pare with a business casual attire. Multicolored stones make it easy to pare the earrings with practically any attire.
5.0	Beautiful, well made. Goes with everything--casual to formal!
5.0	i bought these knowing that they werent gonna be AMAZING. But actually i was surprised. i got alot of them that i will actually use. i got 5 glow in the dark ones all different solid colors a swirly one a striped one one wit ha happy face heat one and a pnk and green ying yang ne one that was white with a red flower and some others. my batch im very happy with. they come in a little draw string pouch and arrived four days before the anticipated date. will definatly buy again
5.0	Got them for my daughter and as soon as I handed them to her she put them in and started to take selfies!  They came in early and looked just as promised with a free gift!  A wonderful chain that she quickly confiscated for herself!
1.0	I got it but so far only 5 colors on it which i was expecting to have different color.
5.0	I got it as a Christmas present for my boy friend and he loves it.
5.0	Awesome! My girlfriend loves it!
5.0	Red Star. Great. Exactly as described. This Red Star could typify a Hand of Miriam, a Metallic Hand with a Red Gem.<br /><br />KONOV has another Pentagram with 6 Red Gems. I like both of them. If you're interested in the other one, the Gems appear Orange in the photo, but the Gems are actually Red.<br /><br />The Red Star is significant to Communists, or it is significant to Jews as the Hand of Miriam.
1.0	Bad quality, it's already discolored
5.0	This jewelry set was just beautiful when it arrived and I breathed a sigh of relief! Initially, I was a little nervous to order the set because some of the reviews had said that the jewels were loose or prone to fall out, but the settings in my necklace and earrings appear to be very sturdy. The pendant has some heft to it which just adds to its high-end feel. I'm planning to use the necklace to round out my wedding-day jewelry. I have other earrings that I'm planning to wear, but I couldn't be happier with the way the necklace works in the overall ensemble. It sparkles brightly in the light, has a beautiful and unique design, and has plenty of length to work with in the chain (you can either clasp it shorter or longer). The only thing that I might say against it is that when you're wearing it, the chain part looks dark in comparison to the very bright and sparkly pendant. In reality, the metals are the exact same tone, but it might have been even more beautiful if the chain had been designed to shimmer in the light a bit as well. That way the difference in metal color between the part with gems and without gems wouldn't seem quite so stark. But overall, I'm so very pleased with this purchase - it'll be hard to wait until July to wear it!
1.0	the screw back portion of the earrings are way to short which caused sores on my baby's ears.  Do not buy theses.  The design is horrible and the stem are way too short for babies, i think they make these for dolls.
5.0	Excellent quality. Size 5.5 (smallest?) Is a little big on my 6 year old nephew.
5.0	This ring gets noticed.  The quality is super! It just looks like a very expensive ring that you would find in a famous high- end jewelry store. I am very pleased that this ring exceeded my expectations.
5.0	Placed order for 3 sets of this item!!  They are really sharp!!
5.0	These bracelets are so lovely. Really intricate and well designed. They don't seem like those common cheap knock offs. This in fact looks very expensive. I bought for me and my mother!
5.0	Needed for a special person commemorating a special day.  After having it engraved, it was beautiful and she was very pleased.
1.0	This ring has a very poor setting for the center stone.  It actually wobbles and I should have sent it back but got ill and just did not get to it.
5.0	I was very impressed with the speed and packaging of the items, very good quality  for the price. The charm is a great size and is thick not thin. So glad I ordered this and you get TWO for the price of one will make cute X mas gifts for nail techs you know or starting up students.
5.0	My fiancée and I bought these rings (matched set) for our engagement back in April, and they are holding up amazingly! We *never* take them off and are generally not kind to jewelry, but these are just perfect. Mine has bent to fit my hand, which is good. The stones are dull in indirect light but dazzling in the right light. We bought them for $11 a piece.... really can't complain.<br /><br />Oh and when pressed to guess, nobody can tell they are so cheap. Not even jewelers.
5.0	These were a gift and were better than expected.  So nice that I ordered another pair for myself.
1.0	The piece is pretty, but it is so lightweight that it falls forward under even the lightest weight chain. Also spins around on a light chain.  Bezel not large enough for large clasp chain to fit through. Will not lay flat. Very disappointed.
5.0	Arrived faster than expected. Perfectly described.
5.0	It's hard to find earring to fit & stay in your nose sometimes but this does the trick and I love the color
5.0	Loved it Did not wear yet
5.0	The style is very good, just the buttons do not look very solid, and too long, my wife is Chinese, the hand is not so thick.
1.0	The images on this page show the Compasses placed in front of the Square. The actual received item is the opposite.<br /><br />This item is nearly worthless as received.
5.0	I love it. It is beautiful!
5.0	This ring is absolutely what my daughter wanted. It's delicate and pretty and has just the right amount of sparkle. :) The size is pretty true too.
5.0	Just Perfect and I love it will wear everyday and show off to everyone that asks, plan on ordering more...
5.0	very nice at a great price and fast shipping.
5.0	Love the earrings . . . but . . . the jackets are a real bear to use.
5.0	I have so many cufflinks. This is my latest addition and also is the best. This item goes with many colours. So I wear it at least three days a week. This is my best buy of the year.
1.0	cheap iam disappointed
5.0	My belly ring got lost in the mail and after a month i decided to email and find out what was going on with it and the company was very diligent in their response and making sure I recieve it. I just wanted to say thanks and even though it isnt here yet I am sure I will love it. So excited to try it..
5.0	Came with a nice card in it, it was my baptism cross and couldn't be happier!
1.0	Very cheap. Tried to open clasp & the chain separated from the clasp. Not wearable now. If I could give it no stars, I would!
5.0	We have had our rings for many years now.  They have always been comfortable to wear.  We get comments on them quite often as well.  These are not over the top flashy, just handsome masculine rings.  They are rugged and take a good knocking about with no scratches.  I recommend this item without reservation.
5.0	in good condition  easy to use  looks exactly like the picture and is an amazing trick on all friends haha ;D
5.0	The charm is really exceptionally nice.  Very sparkly and the shoes move independently from one another.  Exactly what I was hoping for.  Very high quality.
5.0	I love these ear stretchers because they are a great alternative to spending too much money at the shop or risking blow outs to your ear lobes! I reccommend these to anyone looking to gauge their ears.
5.0	Just received this beautiful onyx faceted bracelet today. I had searched high and low in department stores for a plain and simple bracelet like this. Nothing that I looked at thrilled me. All were either too small with round beads and not faceted or big beads that did not look good on me. The beads on the bracelet are the perfect size - 10mm- and shine and glisten when the light hits them. The bracelet also pairs well with other bracelets that I have; I do like to layer my bracelets so this works well. Also, the plain black color works well with both silver and gold so it matches basically everything I have in my jewelry collection. I love the price as well. I could not find a similar bracelet for the money and would have to do tons of traveling and waste precious gas if I were to find one. I am so thrilled I purchased this bracelet.
5.0	"Plenty of sparkle and nice vintage look. Simulated amethysts are lighter than pictured, but still have plenty of color. Length 7 1/2\\"". Width 3/8\\"" for the wider link, 3/16\\"" for the narrower link."
5.0	Sent as a gift to my sister.  She said the quality is very good and was very happy with it.
5.0	fun - esp for valentine's day
5.0	Beautiful earrings in hard-to-find color.
5.0	Quality was great. The size was PERFECT. I am a half size so the size was just perfect. Its hard buying rings where they don't have half sizes. I would definitely recommend this product.
1.0	Who in there right mind would pay 45.00 for a freaking keychain!? What is wrong with you people and your prices! ITS A FREAKING KEYCHAIN! NOT A BAR OF GOLD!!!
5.0	I bought this necklace as a present for my friend's birthday and she absolutely loved it! She said it was very cute, and she wears it out on special occasions.
5.0	BEAUTIFUL VATICAN LIBRARY COLLECTION ST FRANCIS OF ASSISI PET TAG.  LOOKS GREAT ON MY ITALIAN GREYHOUND. A NICE SIZE FOR SHERLOCK.
5.0	I love this plug set i have only went as far as pluging my ears with a 6g. i dont want anything bigger than that. I recommend ordering some coconut oil to help switching sizes also, dont rush it take your time with the set.
1.0	received this item today in the mail, and it was broken not even on a hing but in the middle, can't even super glue it to fix.
5.0	Very nice ring. I originally wanted a eternity band to wear as a every day ring but something that was also eye catching and came across this ring. The silver is very polished, the CZ's also sparkle and look like real diamonds. This ring has flare and will definitely get noticed by others. A good buy!
5.0	love the size, look real
5.0	Very beautiful light wieght. Smaller then seems in pic....so do wear more often. Every time I wear them someone will stop me to admirer them.  Sale price good, would not pay more.
5.0	Beautiful iridescent stones, lightly colored, and well fit. Very intricate, delicate, and beautiful. Girlfriend loves these.
5.0	Fast shipping!  It's solid, and reading the reviews of others, I am taking care that it doesn't scratch.  It's smooth and doesn't feel flimsy.  The blue is a little darker than the picture displayed (it's being illuminated by bright lights there) but I dig it.  A nice addition to my ring collection.
5.0	Frankly, I was amazed that I was able to receive the pineapple bracelet.  Well done!
1.0	The post on these earrings broke off the first time my daughter wore them. I went to put them on her ears and they just snapped right off. My daughter was so disappointed. She did not even get to wear them once.
5.0	my little girl loved this and wants to wear it everyday to school.  I am getting a matching one for myself
5.0	Since purple is my favorite color these are right up my ally.  The color is dark but vibrant at the same time.  They have alot of sparkle to them which makes them stand out.  I also love the design and the length is perfect.  They are nicer when you see them in person than they look in the picture.  I would definitely recommend these earrings.
5.0	Wife loves the ring.  The flower is large extending about 1/2 finger's width on either side.  Not a dainty ring.  The stretch band is very comfortable.
5.0	purchased as a gift very pretty well made
5.0	So beautiful and delicate. I'm having a traditional church wedding in a few short weeks and I just know these will be perfect. Very very happy.
5.0	It was a good buy for a friend who admired the one I was wearing.  I item was as it appeared in the advertisement.
5.0	I had a plain rust colored hat that I never wore because it needed something to make it pop! This pin changed that plain hat I had into a fashion statement that is excellent! It is so perfect that people compliment me whenever I wear it! When I go out now I see people in my circle trying to decorate their hats with pins such as this. It is a beautiful pin. What a compliment to any outfit!
5.0	Was purchased to give as a gift
5.0	I bought this to be sure I would like the look before investing money in a similar diamond band. I wear it with a platinum and diamond ring. Have been wearing it for a few weeks now.  Very well made. Have gotten several compliments!  Looks real- not at all flimsy or dull. Will hold out on buying the real thing as long as this holds out - then might just get another one of these! I would definite recommend. Great as a stacking ring also.
5.0	This is lovely!  It fits very well, has two length settings so it can fit different size ankles.  No sharp edges, very comfortable, Lots of fun to wear!  My favorite ankle bracelet this summer!
1.0	I thiught I was getting something great but this turned out to be trtick or treat junk!  This is the second time I got something like this and each time it was from a different company.  Don't buy this crap unless you want it for a costume party or to give to your child to play with!  JUNK! JUNK! JUNK!
5.0	Beautiful and sparkly, great cut. Awesome, awesome deal for the price it's a GREAT ring.
5.0	Nice earrings. Thank you.
1.0	One star, but it could perhaps change later.  It is not quite as pictured.  The stitching inside the wallet is black, instead of the red shown.  The fastener on the chain is not as shown.  It does not even close all he way.  I would not trust it.  It came sealed in plastic and when I opened it, the fumes burned my eyes.  It has a toxic paint thinner/plastic smell.  This &#34;fabric&#34; wallet seems to have a lot of plastic in it.  I have hung it in the garage, hoping the stink will eventually dissipate so I can use it.
1.0	within 3 hours of wearing it one of the leather strands broke, it wasnt tight whatsoever
5.0	Beautiful !  I have several infinity rings and this is among my favorites.
5.0	This item was really nice, great quality and was delivered very fast! It came in a very cute box and bag. My daughter loved it!
5.0	My niece is a mini Wonder Woman in the making, and she was really stoked to get this as her birthday gift. It actually looks nicer in person, than in the photo: the WW isn't quite as light silvery, as pictured. It's just right.
1.0	I was disappointed in the size of the earrings my daughter chose.  They are entirely too big. I wanted her to return them, but she insisted that she will wear them when she is older.
1.0	I have never had any issue with sensitive ears, but I purchased these in several sizes and every pair bothered my ears so badly they became infected.  I'm unable to wear them.
5.0	Great item and the delivery was in time. Prefect thanks
5.0	Easy to unscrew. Love the rose gold. The coloring is perfect.
1.0	You need to really watch the sizing and when it says return for full refund read the fine print because they subtract postage and I didn't see that stated any where
5.0	I really loved these plugs. Not to heavy not to light.
5.0	Awesome,  just the length I needed!
5.0	Great product made extreamly well. Very surprised how much of a quality braclet this is a such a low price!!!
5.0	Clear detail and vibrant color. I gave up as a gift and my friend loves it.
5.0	I bought this for my grandma and she loved
5.0	Usually you get what you pay for so I was nervous at first about the quality given the quantity but the stretching set is amazing, I see no difference between these plugs and tapers in this set and the ones that you buy at piercing kiosks or stores that are in the mall. The price of this 36 piece set is equivalent to 2 pieces that you would buy at the mall, if you are wanting to stretch your ears or you know someone who is wanting to then buy this without a second thought, unless you like wasting your money :p
5.0	i get so many compliments on these earrings.  i love the blue/green color of these and the picture is very accurate of the color.
5.0	lovely,just as expected,very happy with the purchase
1.0	Cheap and crappy - they don't look anything like pearls. Save your money, go to a jewelry store and buy something nice.
5.0	They are a little bigger than I expected, but I still love them :)
5.0	I bought this for a zipper pull on my jeep coin purse. It is just the right size. I am very pleased with the charm. All the girls at the jeep club wanted to know where I got this. Will buy more for my sewing projects. It is cute and very detailed.
5.0	perfect color and soooooo tiny and cute. just a baby pop of color.<br />Happy with this purchase! Search the box well if they come with other things.... i almost threw them away... tiny earrings with Tiny packaging.
5.0	My wife loved them.  They are very attractive and since she is happy, I am happy.
5.0	"I've bought my wife a lot of jewelry over the years, but she told me this might be her favorite piece yet. The simple design and perfect finish are stunning. Easily the best \\""bang for the buck\\"" I've ever found for jewelry, which frankly, can sometimes disappoint. No disappointment here."
5.0	I`m very pleased with this ring, it looks so real, got a good deal on it. I recommend this ring to anyone that`s looking for something but doesn`t cost a fortune.<br />Thanks so much
5.0	And she loved it, she wears it daily.  And I mean EVERYDAY, if you have a lovely lady who'd like a necklace, look no further.
5.0	Very nice! Well made, easy to read;
1.0	The black is coming off !!!!!!!
5.0	These are absolutely beautiful.  They seem to be good quality and I definitely recommend them.  I got them for my 7 year old daughter for a stocking stuffer.
5.0	I wear birthstone rings for all of my 3 daughters and my 2 grand-daughters....not sure how,,,I lost the pinkie diamond for my youngest grand-daughter, Ruby...She is now 41/2 my finger was empty......This ring is even more beautiful than described!!<br />Hard to find size 4.5<br />I am over the top thrilled<br />Thank You X 1000
5.0	These cufflinks are fantastic. I wondered if the gears would look stacked on each other like gears would look or if they would be kind of even with each other and they're more realistic looking and stacked. These are also heavy and substantial - not cheap feeling at all nor flimsy. Made to last.
5.0	Perfect gift for a baby shower. I do think it's tacky to have a 2013 penny instead of a 2014. It's easily fixed and not a problem, but still unbelievably tacky...shame. However, the gift is perfect, sweet and sentimental.
5.0	My 15 Year old saw these and had to have them. She wears them all the time. I like how stylish they look. Very nice choice.
5.0	Gorgeous bangles.  I am getting others in more colors.
5.0	The brilliance of these Swarovski stones is top notch.  I have been complimented on them on multiple occasions.  I keep them clean and really only wear them when I go out on weekends.  They compliment any outfit and add a touch of class.
5.0	These do exactly what I need them and aren't uncomfortable at all. My only suggestion is not to wear them for too long if you can help it. Since the tops aren't rounded, food get stuck underneath and can get into the piercing itself, which can cause infection and is just gross to clean out. Besides that though, I love these! Perfect.
5.0	I purchased this Tungsten Carbide Men's Wedding Ring as a present for my husband for Valentine's day and both of us couldn't be happier with the purchase.  The ring priced at $19.95 was more than reasonable and my husband received a metal wedding band that would stand up to his punishment.  The etched design on the ring is quite attractive, too.  Would recommend this product to anyone in the market for a Tungsten band.
1.0	This item looks really good. Them you get ready to make something and it falls apart. It does have really gemstones but the chain is the problem. It broke as soon as I pit the claps on it. Not durable at all. But is pretty to look at if it is just sitting there
5.0	Great necklace for what you pay.  This EXACT dog tag is sold by Reeds Jewelers so you can imagine how much money you save by buying it here.    The dog tag is small, but still has that classic look for a man.  It has a solid feel and the diamond is a nice touch.    It's also nice that they wrapped the necklace itself in a protective film.  That way, it's guaranteed to arrive scratch free.  It's annoying when other companies don't do this and you get a new item with a scuff.    Very pleased with this purchase.  Can't wait to get it engraved.
5.0	I ordered this along with 2 other items from Pro Jewelry. It was better than expected. Very well made and quite cute. My granddaughter loved it and put it on her Pandora bracelet right away.
5.0	I bought several tie clips for my son's wedding along with several ties in different colors. The guys had on white undershirts and I ironed on their superhero logo. Great addition to the wedding and great wedding pics.
5.0	It is beautiful and well made.
5.0	Was a great gift. Good price. Fits perfect on her anklet. Not too small, not too big. Easy to keep buying different ones becuase of the price.
5.0	looks elegant, classy and very good quality
5.0	Just received my necklace I Love It. Thanks Buyinhouse.......
1.0	This is not anything an  adult would wear. It looks like junk play jewelry.  It is also gaudy. Rather than dangle down in a flow, they overlap each other too much to see each clearly. Big waste of money.
5.0	Great product! Not too flashy but just right to dress up an outfit.
5.0	My granddaughter loved it!
5.0	Earring were better than excepted, size good and color was beautiful plus metal is great. They would make a great gift.
5.0	This is a beautiful pendant!  It is set in sterling silver and just sparkles at just over 5 carats.  The color is exactly like what is pictured.  The only thing I would do is put it on a nicer chain.  It comes presented in a lovely gift box.
5.0	wow ~! Just pops ! make any outfit classy
1.0	These hoop rings broke after only a few times of being worn. Disappointed with the overall quality of the product.
5.0	This is an adorable little charm and it looks terrific on my Pandora bracelet.<br /><br />I purchased this two weeks ago for $8.40 and I see the seller raised the price to over $20.  For $20, it is not worth it, so try to find it for less.
5.0	I got this after I was baptized as a reminder of my new life. It's so delicate and sweet. I buy necklaces and bracelets from Efy every few months. Their jewelry is high quality and very unique and beautiful!
5.0	These earrings are fairly small, but that was what my wife was looking for.  They look good and are easy to attach.  Classy but not gaudy.
5.0	My man loves this ring! Everyone who holds it is shocked by the weight and quality.  I recommend to anyone looking for a tough, durable, and stylish men's ring. Love it!!
5.0	The product was received on time and as described and was instantly appreciated by the receipient (it was a surprise gift).  The workmanship was very good and appearce cassy.  Overall a great value!
5.0	Not as pearlie looking as I expected.
5.0	Beautiful earrings.<br />I have not worn them long enough to say whether the posts irritate my holes or if the plating lasts.<br />Since the zirconia stones are not covered they can be cleaned to stay shinny.
5.0	looks so real. fabulous quality...get so many compliments on this ring<br /> a definite style piece that will last forever. love it
5.0	I ordered both the large & small climbing man cuffs. I must say...I absolutely adore them! They are so cute and unexpected!  I have piercings all the way up my ears but wearing earrings became too painful . These are perfect replacements! Quick delivery!  Great seller! Can't recommend enough!! Try it...the price can't be beat! Thanks!
5.0	I bought this bracelet for my grand daughter for Christmas.  She has worn it many times and really loves the hearts.  I told her she holds my heart in her hands.
1.0	After getting this for my wife for her birthday, we got divorced.
5.0	I bought this necklace for my boyfriend's brother for Christmas, and he loved it. I, also, love it so much I might buy myself one. It came just as advertised and was definitely worth the cash.
5.0	Earrings are very dainty, and not overwhelming.  They go with many things, both casual and dressy.
5.0	These earrings were a gift, she loves them and wears them all of the time. They are very good product.
5.0	The ring is very pretty and my daughter loves it. she just wanted a small but still a little blingy stone and she thinks it's perfect
5.0	I love this necklace.
5.0	My husband's wedding ring no longer fits his finger, so we've been looking for a replacement. While he's not a jewelry wearer, he does like a unique wedding ring. Something that's different without being loud or gaudy. This ring was the perfect replacement. The style is smart, clean and special, like him!
5.0	They're fantastic, I will definitely order this product again.
1.0	Unfortunaley, the actual earrings are a shabby reflection of the very nice ones shown on the website. They are poorly cut and oddly shaped and do not match each other. I am sending them back.
5.0	I just received these and I absolutely LOVE them! They are perfect for my cartilage piercings. They are small but noticeable, which is what I was going for. They are very comfortable so when my hair yanks on them it doesn't hurt like the larger earrings. I will be getting a few extra sets for all my others piercings!
5.0	I bought this charm for the loving memory of our fallen 19 Granite Mountain Hotshots who lost their lives battling the Yarnell Hill fire on 6-30-13. I got it just in time for the seventh month anniversary. It came on time and fit perfectly on my bracelet. Will buy again from this company.
5.0	I gave these as a gift! Very nice quality. Recipient loved them. Unique, different and made well. Unusual... Nice detail.
1.0	The product looks cool, and if you are a guy and wear it under you shirt; like I do, Then it works perfect. Problem  I have had is that it has turned my skin green in areas and after a while the silver coating started to wear off.
5.0	Any fan of Assassin's Creed will appreciate this simple pendant. It's different than your typical shark tooth, cross, skull or flame pendant that you see most of the time. Smaller and more delicate looking in person than the picture because this is, of course, a close up and detailed picture. Any fan would like this in their collection.
5.0	Shipped extemely fast and they are Really pretty charms!
5.0	I love my new Mezuzah and I wear it every day! It is beyond expectation and I get many compliments on it. Seeing the scroll makes it even more special because it reminds me of my commitment to Hashem and His love for me. This seller will definitely have a repeat customer!
5.0	they were pretty prompt with the rain and good quality definitely a nice compared to what I've seen out there and it will prompt and courteous on sending out to me
5.0	Believe me, like the one with the skull this one is awesome, looks better in real life,  again nice ring, I love it.
5.0	Got compliments on the necklace the first day I wore it.
5.0	omg I was shocked to open the package and see how big they r. they were better then expected, good quality, so pleased with this purchase.I purchased 1 for my son and daughter and grandmom for xmas gifts.
5.0	Shipping great, product absolutely great 10 times better than I even expected
5.0	I am very happy with my purchase.  These are for my bridal party.  I can't wait to share them!
1.0	Changed color. Beware! Not good quality whatsoever. Only took a month to start showing color and wear. Buy something higher quality.
5.0	I was looking for a set of pearl earrings for my teenage daughter, these are so nice I will have to go back and order a pair for myself!  Everything from the presentation (the box packaging has a very classic look) to the way the earrings are displayed in the box, the quality of the earrings and fnally the handwritten note thanking me for my purchase and care instructions.<br /><br />At this price I can afford to purchase these for all my nieces as well!!  I have already checked out other items for future purchase.  I have confidence whatever I purchased will be to my expectations or higher based on this experience.
5.0	Super cute necklace! Good quality for the price. I have worn it probably 20 times and no sign of tarnish yet.
5.0	I was looking at other rings around 40-60 dollars with black and white diamonds & I decided to check one more time for a cheaper price and I came across this gorgeous ring... It came in the mail with 2 day shipping, very fast!! And it came in a small brown box... I'm in love... Amazing little ring.. Must buy!! Recommended ..
5.0	It looks exactly as pictured and is a steal for the purchase price.  Arrived earlier than expected as well.  Will be wearing it often.
1.0	"The \\""sturdy elastic\\"" is thin as cheap thread and split on the second wearing.  The magnet that held the cover closed was not glued properly so one side fell off and had to be reglued.  Very cute idea but poorly executed.  I will try to restring it but this was supposed to be a watch, not a kit!"
5.0	It is absolutely perfect! For a VERY VERY reasonable price-I received a necklace that looks like the eternity necklace from Tiffany & Co. The chain is delicate and weightless around my neck, and the silver is of a very high quality. Plus, the necklace goes with EVERYTHING! I'm absolutely loving it.
5.0	My wife like it a lot, and I like it too. Whie and yellow gold looks the best. I will recomended to others. Thanks.
1.0	Within a couple months of wearing ring a stone fell out.  Dazzling Rock will not replace free of charge and basically says we should have had the prongs tightened.  One would think the prongs would come pre-tightened.  Will never, ever buy from Dazzling Rock again.
5.0	I was so-so about ordering this ring but when it came Im glad I did. It is beautiful! It does stick up a little higher than I thought but Its ok. I read some of the reviews that said that it didnt sparkle in the light, BULL! Its almost blinding!!!! Order it you wont be sorry!!!!!!
5.0	Great price! Thanks so much!
5.0	i ordered these in pink.. i really like them they are beautiful..easy to put in and easy to clean..they are easy to store when you are not wearing them. i received this product from a review site at a discount for my honest review. thank you
5.0	Got this today and am totally and completely satisfied with my purchase. The watch itself is a bit smaller than I had anticipated but that certainly does not take away from the beauty and elegance of this necklace. Seems very well made and would highly recommend.
5.0	I just got this ring and so far I can safely say that it meets all my expectations for a good durable wedding band. I am a machinist and an very hard on my ring and today I put it through its paces and it still looks brand new. The fit if the ring is comfortable and the size is true. Overall a great product.
5.0	Great deal on cute earrings.  They need a sturdier backing, but I used some from other earrings I own.  Otherwise, for the price they are way cute.
5.0	What a pretty silver chain! I was impressed by the quality! Definitely a good buy!
5.0	Cute choice for our 5 year old granddaughter.  Bigger than I thought they would be and more colorful.  She was pleased.
5.0	All the steel tapers I have bought from this seller have served exactly the function for which I bought them; stretching my ear-lobe piercings. the little rubber o-rings do fall off once in a while, but the shape of the taper keeps it from falling out anyway. Also the seller sends jewelry in cute little jewelry boxes that work great as small re-usable giftboxes. I will certainly be making more purchases from this seller.
5.0	It really is a beautiful little necklace.  Nice length and delicate weight on the chain, and a nice sparkle on the pendant.  Nice for everyday wear.  Not too dressy; not too casual.  Lifetime guarantee was a nice surprise.
5.0	Sterling silver hoops--just what my husband's niece wanted for Christmas. They're pretty and something different that she didn't already have.
1.0	It somehow isn't as nice when you get it as it appears in the picture. the biggest problem is the flowers hang with their faces downward like they are looking at the ground. Its just made of string mostly and isn't very well made.
1.0	Cheap. The earrings came and still had glue strings around the post. Sure enough, after trying to take them out of my ear, I pulled one of the pearls off of the stud. Would not recommend. I've bought $1 earrings many times and they've never broken like this.
5.0	I was the first one to open this box.  I was excited  to seed how a piece of quality jewelry could be sold at this price.  At first I was disappointed when I saw how light the gold in this piece was.  The thick lines of the necklace also turned me off.  Had I been had?  nope; not at all.  The workmanship, quality , and detail on the piece is clearly among the finest I have ever seen.  My wife was overjoyed with the quality; especially how the artist successfully managed too put such highly extraordiinary quality into a such a small piece of 14 k. gold.
5.0	Very lightweight and nice. I wear his bracelet 24/7 and love it!
5.0	Great product love it also the fast shipping thanks
5.0	I am very pleased with this purchase. The ring I purchased at the store was dull in colour (both the stones and the metal), one of the stones fell out, and this was only after one month of wearing! This ring is pretty and the crystal sparkles nicely. My piecing and navel are a bit small, and I was worried that this ring would be too large for it, but it's very nice and feminine looking, not bulky or overstated. Very happy!
5.0	It is beautiful, I was worried about the size but its wonderful
5.0	This is a very well made pendant and it is better seeing it in person as opposed to on the page. It is shiny and expensive looking.
5.0	It was delivered promptly. I have owned it for a week now and it feels and fits well. It makes great accessory for every day wear.
5.0	Just as picture shown.
5.0	My granddaughter loved it.
5.0	I got this for my mom for mothers day and she loves it.the detail is great and it is not flimsy at all.very pretty and looks great with everything!
5.0	For the price with gold as high as it is these are very pretty earrings. You could wear these everyday.
5.0	Nicely done version of a classic pendant, not overdone and nicely presented
5.0	These studs are beautiful!!! The cut, color, & clarity is fantastic for this price. Even though the stones sit kind of low in the setting behind the prongs, that doesn't take away from the beauty & actually makes me feel more secure about wearing a setting with prongs instead of bezel set, as I usually wear, because they feel more secure in the setting & there is less fear of snagging the prong & it giving enough to allow the stone to inadvertently come out, as I have experienced in the past.
1.0	As soon as I put them in four Diamonds at the top fell out and two at the bottom fell out
5.0	These are beautifully crafted works of art but it it wise to realize they are symbols of  a deeper truth; you are a Child of God with certain attributes, characteristics, motovations and desires.  Understand the nature of your sign and then use its strengths to reunite with God and fulfill your part in the plan for humankind's retrurn to spirit, brotherly love and the awarenees that God is all, happening now in love beyond words.
5.0	We took my granddaughter to Disney World and she loved it.  This pretty little charm of Snow White arrived on time and in mint conditions.  My granddaughter loved it.  The colors are vibrant and it is just plain pretty.  I would highly recommend to everyone.
1.0	This product is far from what is announced here. The quality is poor, the yellow gold side width (compared to red side) is uneven. It has some scratches and other surfaces details. It is not confort fit. Both my and my girlfriend's have these kind of defects.    Very poor jewerly crafstmanship in this item. It feels as it is about to break, looks too fragile.    Too bad I cant get my money back, cos' I live outside the States
5.0	what a cute little necklace! Just as beautiful as in the pics.
1.0	Not what I expected.  Very small.
5.0	I got this ring for such a great price and like it  so much I have thought about getting more in different sizes for other fingers.
5.0	If someone works in a heavy duty job or do a lot of construction this is the ring! Easy to clean and keep going he love his ring.
5.0	Little bigger than what I thought but beautiful.
1.0	delivered straight from the factory in china, my little robot charm was sealed in its baggy, with the arm unscrewed. I was sad. it seemed broken. not sure if i can screw it back on. clearly the child labor in those chines factories do shoddy work :-( shame on them!
5.0	Very good quality ring for such a low price!
5.0	Love em, theyre small enough where I can wear them take a nap and my ears wont wake up red and irritated. Material is not the best but thats a given for the price point.
5.0	I was really happy with this product, it was rightly described in the advertisment and was exactly what i wanted.
5.0	They are just what I  expected...beautiful!! Quick delivery. Very satisfied.
5.0	Great quality!  I love the fine details
5.0	I already owned 3 Alex and Ani bangles. This one was not in stock on the A&A site so I was happy to see it was available on Amazon. I can't wait to add more to my collection. Thee bangles will be the perfect Christmas gift for my kids teachers.
1.0	This is an update to my first favorable review.  I bought three of these for my pendant watches.  So far, two of them have broken.  The pendant caught on the refrigerator door, and, rather than feeling a tug and fixing the problem, one small tug and the necklace broke.  These sould hold up better.  I've had chains for my pendants that lasted for years.  These didn't last at all.  First small tug, and $$$$ down the drain.
5.0	Fit all my earring and very nice package!  I highly recommend.
5.0	Very,very nice set!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Good quality!!!!
5.0	Loveeeeed my necklace! Arrived tremendously fast; overall, I'm highly pleased with my purchase.
5.0	Is is beautiful I am going to have it blessed and my sister gave me the perfect chain for it I wear it almost every day.  Thank you so much.
1.0	The silver is coming off on my fiancé's hand. The ring is turning into a gold-ish copper color. I'm highly displeased with this considering we were to be married with this ring.
5.0	This is a beautiful statement necklace. People notice it! The chain has sharpish edges so I wear it over a button down.
5.0	Got these for my girlfriend for her birthday.  She loves them!  Considering the low price and the bright color of the earrings, it was a good deal!
5.0	beautiful almost the size of a silver dollar
5.0	I think this is a great way to show my love of the USA. My &#34;Pandora&#34; charms are all representative of things that are important to me. When I saw this nice sterling charm at a reasonable price, I knew I had to add it to my bracelet!
5.0	Nice Bracelet....fast delivery!  Attractive bracelet with vibrant colors.  The quality of the bracelet looks good.  I ordered the same bracelet in black.
5.0	Bought this so I could wear it for my MRI due to not being able to wear metal worked great love the color and it shipped on time
5.0	I needed a replacement chain and this was the exact size I was looking for.  Beautiful, dainty, and fit my small pendant perfectly.
5.0	These earrings are well made and look high quality. The color is purple, but more of a bluish-purple rather than a reddish-purple.  It is a little on the heavier side (so no crazy head movements on the dance floor), but they're not so heavy that you would notice the weight just sitting around.
5.0	I am happy with this purchase. The only thing i would change is the thickness of the gauge, it looks like its popping out of my ear all the time.  It was delivered on time and they are very pretty.
5.0	I have four holes in one ear and these are perfect for multiple piercings. Small, pretty, easy to get on,and comfortable. Great price too!
5.0	This ring is pretty in the picture but in person it's beyond beautiful!  I wanted 1 large genuine stone ring, when I saw this it completely fit the bill. And, at the price, I feel like I got a major steal!!!  This ring is not for ppl who like timid pieces. Absolutely awesome!!!
5.0	Love them! They did just what I needed and they are adorable. Fit my fingers just right, and it is a high gloss as stated, although I always took my rings off when washing my hands, not to tarnish.
5.0	I got what I wanted. I believe it even came in the mail early
5.0	Beautiful.. Thought these would be filled with alabaster veining, I was pleased to see nothing but Lapis and Pyrite veining. Great buy for the money!
5.0	This is my second time purchasing from this seller & I am once again a very satisfied customer. Wasn't sure what I would wear with these when I ordered them, but didn't care they're so cute! Package arrived on time in a cute leopard print box. They are very lightweight but don't feel cheaply made (although you can tell they are not as sturdy as they would be if they were name brand). Can't wait to rock these & I will definitely order from this company again.
5.0	Beautiful and I wear it on my everyday clothing often.
5.0	it amazes me when i get inexpensive jewelry like this that is so pretty.  i have this in green, blue, and pink.  so lovely!  sparkles a lot.  not high end, but i didn't pay high end.  it was better than i thought!
5.0	Very, very nice cross.  Very durable and has a nice silver finish.  Has somewhat of a rough texture which makes it masculine also.
5.0	I was so glad to get these... FIVE DAYS EARLY. I was hoping to not see the tunnel at all while in, and that's exactly what I got. Very lightweight, easy to put in, and they are perfect.
5.0	Was looking for an inexpensive gift for my girlfriend. She really likes the ring and and the quality seems pretty good for this price level.
5.0	Love them, my second pair..comfort!
1.0	I ordered the item based on a picture, when it came in it was different. I was very dissapointed, but didn't send it back, I gave it to  one of my friends and she loved it!!! So if you go by the picture I would say don't order the item ....overall it's nice , very very small size too.
5.0	Even nicer in person! It was a gift but I wish I had my own!
1.0	The only good thing about these earrings was that the shipping from the seller was fast & free, I ordered these late last week either on Thursday or Friday and received them today (Tuesday). Otherwise I'm very unsatisfied. I just received these today and the crystal fell out of the earring as I was putting them on, barely even had them through my ear and it was on the floor. The other earring was also bent which I noticed as I was going to put them on but wasn't too upset about that since you can't tell once the earring is in, but still very upset that the crystal fell out before I even got a chance to wear them. Overall I would not recommend, although I didn't read the reviews so I don't know whether or not the crystals fall out often or I just got a bad pair.
5.0	Looks very good! Love it!
1.0	Would never buy this again it broke when I opened it
1.0	All the gems fell off in less than one hour of wearing it!
5.0	I am very satisfied with this ring. I have received several compliments about it. I love this design and found this ring while visiting the limited time daily specials at Amazon. I'm so glad that I did! The price was great.
5.0	Nice !!! will buy again.
5.0	Ok if you are anything like me you look to reviews to give you a little more detail then what is printed in the product description. So to give you an honest review on this product: it is truly stunning! I am no boasting at all, when you see the ring, you really can't believe how shiny it is! Here is the thing, my fianc&eacute;e and I are getting married on the 6th of July and we could not find a band for her ring, it is a black diamond ring with black plated gold. And everywhere I looked I would find a black diamond wedding band but the band would be made of platinum/silver/white gold....etc. And the only ones that I could find were way overly priced from around $900 to the mid $1200 just for a wedding band!!! Nothing in my price range would perfectly match her ring and I wanted to make sure I put as much effort into her wedding band as I did her engagement ring. So finally with after giving up hope and thinking about just letting her wear the wedding band behind her engagement ring so they would not see the discoloration in her band and ring I somehow came across this beauty, it matched perfectly. It had the same plated black gold feature that I was looking for it and was just in my price range....ACTUALLY WAY BELOW IT! It was truly a God send. And also I am not sure how well it describes the size but the ring is tiny, I know most women do not want a bulky ring but this one is truly beautifully made! If I can I will upload some personal pictures just so you can see the spectacle of the rings glamor. For anyone in my situation of looking for a perfect match to a black GOLD diamond ring this is your match! And just for anyone that just loves fine unique jewelry. This is your perfect match as well! I COULD NOT BE HAPPIER WITH THIS PURCHASE!!!!! Also depending on where you live the shipping is super fast! I was suppose to get this ring next week on the 27th of June and it came early today and I live in Georgia. So that is also a BIG PLUS!!!!! Thank you DazzlingRock for making my special day complete!ng my special day complete!
5.0	Purchased this ring in remembrance of my friend who passed and music was his passion. The ring is as described and thick not cheap. It brought tears to my eyes knowing I have such a beautiful piece to help me keep my friends memory alive. I Will always love you Jujubee.
5.0	The pendant was beautiful and my granddaughter loved it. It was her first grown-up necklace. The reason I wrote this was I like another one of your customers thought it was a full necklace, meaning chain and pendant. When you are shown a picture of chain and pendant it means necklace.  So this is a reminder to other customers read more carefully. I will be back as a customer I was very happy with the quality and my other purchases... Your 5 stars in my book.
1.0	Hello ,<br />this product is same in picture but in mater of fact it is too small and tiny that make it un noticeable.<br />not worth the price regarding it's size.<br /><br />DONT LIKE IT EVEN IT IS EXPENSIVE
5.0	I've gotten a lot of compliments on this ring. I love its simplistic and modern design. The amber looks great, especially in the sun.
5.0	My daughter had some of her jewelry stolen earlier in the year..including her horseshoe necklace..I bought this one to replace it and hopefully cheer her up...It is beautiful..more so than the one it replaced,,delivery was fast and it came in a very nice gigy box..I NEVER write reviewes but often read them..I has so impressed with this necklace ..here I am writing a review
5.0	I bought this for my girlfriend as a surprise Christmas gift. The pearls are absolutely gorgeous and she loves them. I would definitely buy them again
5.0	Exact and unique handmade items as described.
5.0	Great small size and painless posts. I developed a metal allergy after my second pregnancy that ever went away. I have five piercings in each ear and these make it much less painful to wear small decorative sparkles for special events.
5.0	This looked perfect for my 13 year grand child. I gave it to her yesterday and she loved it. It has a cross with a heart  which are two things that matches a rope necklace she has.  Happy with purchase.
5.0	I absolutely love these and I wear them everyday. Wish I could buy more of these same earrings. Great buy.
5.0	It fits perfectly. For a small wrist though.
5.0	Amazing studs love them!
5.0	This is one of the few rings that has stones embedded in it and the design is intricately fashioned at a great price!
5.0	Bought as gift. Recipient was very pleased!
5.0	I received the rings today and they are beautiful!!!! I love them. The color is so pretty. I put them on as soon as I opened the package  I am very pleased with the purchase thank you for such a beautiful set of rings.
1.0	The stones are beautiful but the earrings are really large. Also I returned them because they were clip earrings which I did not realize at the time I ordered them.
5.0	Exactly as pictured -- great quality! Hit a slew of great deals on Amazon!<br />This little owl is gorgeous!<br />Purchased for my wife as a Christmas gift. She's happy!
5.0	this was really fun! everytime my neice wears it, she texts me a photo of herself holding it above her lip<br />it's quite the hit with her friends too
5.0	Love oriental symbol - collector, I will be looking forward to see if there are any new oriental symbols available.
5.0	This is a doubled necklace with a clasp.  It's pretty, sturdy, and exactly the right length for me.  It's heavy, though, which is something I like but perhaps someone else may not.
5.0	Beautiful color as shown
5.0	My first time buying anything on amazon. I was very pleased to receive this bracelet in a pretty blue box in a white bow so pretty. Im very pleased with the product. I bought it as a gift for someone however I felt in love with it and kept it for myself. :)
5.0	Well first off I ordered different kinds of ear cuffs, but this one kind of surprised me when I opened the package because I was hoping for an earring that made it look like the octopus went through my ear, but instead it was just a regular ear cuff and I'm happy with that since most ear cuff earrings do break in the mail, but these came out just fine and I have yet to wear them!
1.0	turned green the first day
5.0	Very cute. So far the coloring hasn't faded. I wear this necklace in the shower. It looks great.
5.0	it really nice, i am very happy
5.0	my daughter just loved this pendant it was wonderful
5.0	i love this necklace & have received lots of compliments.<br />it's very cute & the jewels on the front are sparkly & bright.<br />i love it!
5.0	Perfect size toe ring! Not to small and not too big.You can tell what it is and ive been wearing it now for a few weeks and it is compfortable and attractive. Recommended for gifts to girlfriends/wives if your looking for something small, cost efficient and memorable to give that will look good and be worn repeatedly if not all the time!
5.0	We ordered this for our 12 year-old son who wanted wolf things for Christmas. It came it very quickly, safely packaged. It was a perfect gift, better than I thought it would be. It is a metal tag with a vinyl-type, glossy overlay and picture on both sides. He hasn't taken it off since - and the price was right.
1.0	just do not buy i am not satisfied at all. Although it came quick, i hate it. It came off when i was running. If you do purchase please change the cord immediately so it doesnt fall off on  you.
5.0	these are beautiful!! love the size, sparkle, clasps, etc.. i love these!!!so much so that im waiting for another pair
5.0	I love this bracelet because it is simple and if I want to dress it up, I wear it with other bracelets.
5.0	Have to say,I like It, as much as my wife enjoys wearing them ,the chain is not thin very durable and the butterfly are just the right size. The stones Are not as color full as the picture, but with the silver color the stones do stand out
5.0	These pearls are beautiful and the price is amazing. The 16in length hits right at my collarbone which is the perfect length for me. They are subtly pink, just enough to add a warm luster to the pearls. The knotting is a bit stiff, but feels very secure. I can't wait to wear them out!
5.0	Great quality! Tough ring!!
1.0	Looks nothing like the picture may be good for a child to play dress up
5.0	These earrings are very nice. I bought them for my mom. I wish I had ordered a pair for myself. They looks to be of good quality and the blue color is very clear.
1.0	Too stiff and odor too strong. The lock does not stay closed; when I wear it it comes off.
5.0	Perfect and as pictured
5.0	This is a great personalized charm.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND this seller.  Very nice and kept in contact to see exactly what I wanted. A+ all the way
5.0	So cute looks like butterflies
5.0	Loved Them they wore very nice. Thank You
5.0	I loved it, so did my 17 year old daughter.
1.0	I purchased this necklace and will admit that it's beautiful.  Very delicate and very pretty.  But after taking it out of its packaging and trying it one once, the clasp broke.<br /><br />I returned it to Amazon and received a replacement.  Once again, it's beautiful!  But after wearing it only on four separate occasions, the clasp broke again.<br /><br />I don't have the original packaging anymore - silly me - for some reason, I thought that the clasp would not break again - and so, can not return it for a refund.<br /><br />Maybe I will take the pendant to a jeweler and have it put on a good chain with a strong clasp?
5.0	[[VIDEOID:fc22d99bfdc1a282b18e6ed8069180f8]] I love jewelry with black and white diamonds. Having black diamonds in a piece can make the piece of jewelry have a more casual feel, so it goes with tee-shirts and jeans just as well as with your holiday sweater and dress plants. This elephant necklace is so adorable, being done in sterling silver and lined with tiny white diamonds, and then having just the elephant's ear done in black diamonds. I think having the ear done in the black helps the outline of the elephant stand out more, and make is much more identifiable as to what shape the pendant is.<br /><br />The chain that comes with the pendant is really nice. It's a silver box chain, which means even the chain itself will have a bit of sparkle and shine to is when the light hits is. Box chains are by far my favorite, as I find they don't catch onto hair as easily and roll smoothly against the skin. I find they tend to also be the strongest style of chains. They can handle pulls and tugs without breaking.<br /><br />The elephant pendant is a nice size, being similar to that of a nickle. Large enough to see what it is and be noticed, but not so large that is looks out of proportion. The elephant has an animated trunk up shape. So for those who believe that having an elephant with a trunk lifted up is good luck, this one has is. It even comes in a gift box so if you're giving this to a friend who like elephants, a school teacher or someone who likes them for good luck, it comes with everything you need for gifting it. Very cute!<br /><br />Sample provided for review
5.0	I got this for my sister for her birthday and I know she is going to love it. She tells my kids this saying all the time.
5.0	I had to buy a gift on behalf of my sister for my mother's birthday.  My sister loved it as did my mother.  We had a butterfly theme for her party and this dainty, beautiful necklace was admired by all.  The delivery was quick, as well.
5.0	These earrings have become some of my favorites, and I have lots of lovely, expensive jewelry...thanks to my husband.<br />I am very happy to have found Bling for gifts and for small treats for myself.  Thank you,<br />S.W.
5.0	My earrings are great.
5.0	This ring is legit. No scratches after the first month, looks exactly like the picture and fits perfectly. This exact same ring at my local jewelers (I checked) is $299+. Get it here for 90% off and call it a day. I may just get a couple!
5.0	These are beautiful earrings and I love them. They look very nice on. I think you will find them easy to put on too.
5.0	Very cute, excellent quality
5.0	Having a two-year old these came at a great price and I don't have to worry about her pulling them out of her ears.  Its hard to find screw-back earrings without paying a fortune or that aren't made so cheap she can get them off. these were affordable and look great.
5.0	This is very delicate, and very pretty. I wear it with everything. It looks good with casual wear, or when you dress up to go out! It's so lightweight, that you forget you're wearing it. The chain is shiny, almost looks like white gold. I'm glad I ordered it What can I say...I love it!.
5.0	If I didn't know the rings were cz's, I would believe they were real diamonds. The were a really good buy, until I can afford real ones like this.
5.0	I haven't heard any complaints from my sister about her necklace. If something is not a good purchase she would certainly mention it. She's probably had it for close to a year now. So I am taking no news as good news on this. I do have to say it is absolutely beautiful.
5.0	this ring is one of the best till yet from the look of it and the way it feel great on my fingers,it exceeded my wants from it.<br />thank you.
5.0	Very light earrings! Fast shipping too!
1.0	They sent me two different size gauges to begin with and i called to have it fixed and they sent me another pair but they also were not what i ordered... They proceeded to send another pair and yet again sent me the wrong pair. they sent a hex design when i order a circle design. I called again and they said they would correct it and send another pair and that was either false or they were lost in the mail somewhere because i never received them and i finally decided it was not worth the time or effort to keep trying to get what i ordered and payed for.
5.0	This necklace actually looks pretty nice. My daughter loves it. Has a magnetic latch and can be opened so that small charms can be put inside.
5.0	I live the earring very femenine, light and classy  But I put the rubber back because they tend to fall  Off the ear.
5.0	Very nice good quality
5.0	i really liked that it came early, i love the color which is just like the picture, and this being the first time  i ordered anything they were very good and helpful with any questions i had.
5.0	As advertised and well cut, clear, flawless
1.0	I'm not very happy to be honest, I had only had the ring out of the shipping package for 3 days. I realised the stone had fallen out when I went to the grocery store. Now my ring has no gem. Again I'm pretty upset almost mad
5.0	Adorable!  And this little ring is very high quality!
5.0	Perfect for the evening engagement.  Used it at the beach in the evening  when I proposed. It made the dido mind sparkle even in the darkness. Great find and price.
5.0	This is a really nice bracelet. what you see in the picture is excatly what you get. except the cross section might be a little smaller, but it's perfect for me. Apart from that, the seller has exceptional customer service. I'm definitely buying from this seller again.
1.0	I ordered this over a week ago.  Amazon promised two day delivery.  When I click on my order status, I get a message that they 'need a little more time.'  Why?  For what?  What's the status?  When can I expect to get this item, which is needed tomorrow?<br />Not much information from amazon, and no way to inquire about this.<br />If this is the only way to get their attention, maybe this will work.  I need this item tomorrow...<br /><br />Now it's been two weeks.  Any update, Amazon?
5.0	It is exactly what I was looking for and I loved the box and little bag it came in.  The color is even prettier in person.
5.0	They are so cute.  I bought them for my daughter and she gets lots of compliments on them.
5.0	This is a great product.  It got me exactly where I needed to be for gauge size 00.  Good price too.  In stores it would cost a lot more to buy each one or even a smaller set.  I recommend this to anyone starting their ears to gauges.  :)
1.0	Not only is it three time it looks in the picture, it's cheap and UGLY. I am so annoyed with it, I literally have to throw it away now.
5.0	I was very pleased! It fit perfect and was exactly as described. Have not turned colors at all and don't break my skin out!
5.0	I received this bracelet and was pleasantly pleased with this purchase. So shiny and thick but not too heavy. So attractive.
1.0	Timely shipment. Just what I expected.
1.0	this is a piece of junk its says 5 inches more like 3 inches if that and made for a baby
5.0	I bought this ring four years ago and is still intact. It is simply beautiful. I've been wanting to buy one more for my sister, but it has been discontinued for a log time now. Please bring this ring back, I'll buy five more :)
5.0	Wonderful crimps.  I was able to crimp with my hands prior to setting with piers.  Perfect for my projects
5.0	Lays nicely against my wrist and I like that it is adjustable.
5.0	Good value for the price.  I am coming back for a 2nd one.
5.0	Very unique and pretty.
5.0	Gorgeous green glamorous chandelier earrings! They are 11.5cm long, grazing my collar bone when I tilt my head.  They are of substantial dimensions but not heavy to be uncomfortable. The green is dark & intense like real emeralds.  The gold is filigreed in the 3 round sections, & the gold tone is marvellous!  These are elegant & a bit of bling.  The price is amazing for the quality -they look  like they cost many times what they do!  I would wear these when glammed up, but would also put them with heels & jeans or tights.  I am sooooo happy with these!  They are so presentable, they would be a cherished gift.
5.0	Love it not to big! Just the right size in everyway for a monroe! very pretty! Sparkly and easy fit!
5.0	This is a beautiful piece of jewelry, particularly for the price.
5.0	Very beautiful.  looks like a much more expensive necklace.
5.0	This ROSEWOOD STAINED RING GIFT BOX really is an impressive way to give a ring.  The box measures about 2 1/4 inches by 2 inches, and it's just under 2 inches tall.  It's lined with a white leather-like material that makes for a classy presentation.  A ring fits securely into the slot provided, and it doesn't move around or shift position, even if the box is turned upside down.<br /><br />The box seems to be made of wood (or wood veneer), and it's stained to look like rosewood.  It's polished to a high-gloss finish.  It's definitely an attractive little box and will make a nice storage box after the gift is given.<br /><br />I recommend this highly.  It's much nicer than the little white cardboard boxes, or the typical black plastic ring boxes you find in department stores.  And it's not much more expensive!<br /><br />Nice box, great price -- this will make your gift look twice as beautiful.
1.0	This is the first review I've ever written for a product on Amazon. I looked all around for a necklace that is similar to Tiffany's diamonds by the yard, and finally settled on this one. When I first got the necklace, it looked pretty. I did not wear it though, as it did not look like it would hold up with everyday wear. So I put it back in the jewellery box it came in. The next time I took it out was two months later, and the metal had turned black. What sorcery is this? I've seen this before with cheap jewellery after you expose it to water everyday for weeks, but this hadn't even been exposed much outside the jewellery box! Very disappointing.
5.0	I love this little charm it was a perfect addition to my family charm bracelet. This ones for my mom
5.0	I recently purchased this ring because I wanted something to wear to work without wearing my good set. The rings arrived before schedule and are very pretty. I have had many comments on this set. I would reccomend the set!!!
5.0	So many colors. I would definitely buy it again. Great value. None of the stones have fallen out for me.
5.0	Really beautiful, great color, a solid bracelet
5.0	Got this wonderful bead yesterday. I am very very pleased with this bead,it looks just like the picture.It will go so well with the rest of comic galaxy beads.<br />What a super find!
5.0	a great looking, well made cross...love it!!!
5.0	MAN I SAY THIS IS A HELL OF A PIECE MAN I LUV IT ANDD WILL PURCHASE MORE THE CHAIN ITSELF IS BEAUTIFUL AND THE PEND IS KIND OF LARGE I SAY THIS I DO AGREE WIT OTHERS ITS SOMETHG THAT U WEAR ON OUT GOING EVENTS OR ETC .....
5.0	it was nice to see that no one had the same one at the party that i when to and i got so many like on it
5.0	I bought these as a gift  for my husband and he loves them.  He loves the unusual cross design.  He has gotten quite a few compliments on them. Thank you
5.0	see i never leave reviews only when i really love a product/customer service .....I love my necklace!!!! I just had to place two more orders for my sisters!! they loved it so much! it looks very classy and the font and size is great!!!!
5.0	I bought these for my wife.  She loves them and they look great on her.
5.0	I gave this necklace as a gift and I was pleasantly surprised when I saw it in person; it is very delicate and beautiful.  Also, the saying about karma is perfect!
5.0	Nice quality, fit well, comfortable. Excellent ring. Looks just like the pic.
5.0	I love love love these earrings...........picture definately does not do them justice..great quality
5.0	Beautiful rose gold finish. I am sure it will be a hit on Mothers day
5.0	I got this as a gift for mom..And I would say I'm more then likely to buy this again. The set arrived on time and was just as described. About a year later she is still wearing it. It didn't break and holds well. It also came with certificate proving the ember is real and unique.
5.0	My husband gave me this necklace as an early Mother's Day gift and I just absolutely love this necklace....it fits perfect and it looks much cuter in person.
5.0	Got these for my daughter in Washington DC to wear to a Costume Ball!  She adored them, they arrived in plenty of time and are simply stunning!
1.0	Doesn't fit well and always comes undone.
5.0	These earrings are just as they appear in the picture. They are small and very light weight.  I have worn them all day and can still hardly feel them - they are very comfortable, don't bother my sensitive earlobes, and stay on securely.  One small quibble is that the presentation box that these come in is very utilitarian, not the best if this is intended as a gift.
5.0	Nicely finished, the details are also very neat. I changed the hoops for others I liked better, but I'm very happy with the celtic knot!
1.0	My own fault for buying. At this price, I should have expected just a waste.  Product was broken when it arrived.
5.0	It's really nice, it looks expensive and I've had tons of compliments. I've showered with it and it hasn't tarnished. It's jus a little bit bulky but shines like a diamond very happy..
1.0	"I was extremely excited to obtain this ring and was waiting for the ring to come for which it came very quickly to my Post Office.  Upon opening a rather large sack I was extremely shocked to see a little box wrapped with plastic protective wrap.  Upon opening I was surprised to see a ring rolling around  a plastic sack in a pierced earring box for which I was not extremely thrilled.  There on the label said, \\"" 10k Gold Black Onyx and Cultured Freshwater Pearl Ring\\"" which appeared to be a oversized Pearl extremely LARGE around black shiny plastic.  I have purchased black jade and this was not what I received!! This ring has a pearl way to Large for the black setting which was onyx and not jade.  To wear this ring you would have to have a extremely large hand for the relationship of the pearl to show correctly.  Without leaving the Post Office I immediately placed the ring back into the earring box, packed it and returned the ring priority mail/guaranteed confirmation.  Amazon was GREAT....I called them they filed a claim, and within three days the ring was back at Palm Beach Jewelry.  I believe that Palm Beach was shocked that I had gotten delivery confirmation on the return!  Full Refund Credit was given one day later!  The picture is excellent but the pearl verses setting is out of balance unfortunately!"
5.0	I was looking for beads to match a real turqoise bead I received as a gift. I also had an opal bead that shined with a turqoise color when the light hit it and I wanted to highlight these two beads. I found this lovelie turqoise bead by Bling and have been really pleased with it. It did just what I wanted. It blends with, and highlights my other two beads. At the price, you cannot beat it. Some of Bling's solo colored beads are a creamier color, but this is the traditional, see through glass bead that is beautiful on its own or in concert with others of a similar color. I am very happy with it and hope you will be also.
5.0	Goes nicely with black or other colors and the strange states of mind that it's appropriate for. I like it a lot.
5.0	Very nice. Quick shipping. Very good quality
5.0	I am a professional photographer and received this for my January birthday.  I love so much!  The detail in extraordinary....even has the viewing screen engraved on the back of the charm.  I've been searching for a camera bead/charm at Pandora, Zable, etc. None of the other companies even compare to this one!  THANK YOU!
5.0	I bought several colors as presents when these appeared in a lightening deal. The colors are really nice and the quality of the beads and extender are high.
5.0	This ring in gorgeous! I bought it for my fiance and he LOVES it! You'd never guess you got this ring for such an incredible price! Doesn't look cheap at all. It does run a half size too big though... We have 2 now :) hah.
5.0	These earrings are a perfect size for a new baby girl. they are a little difficult to put on since the ball is so tiny but once on they are great. the post is also small so it does not pinch the back of the baby's ear.
1.0	The earrings came and while the flowers are adorable, they are not gold plated. In fact, there was a sign in the box that said silver. I bought them for someone who just got her ears pierced and I needed gold-plated. Very disappointed.
5.0	Absolutely beautiful, it matches my band and gives it a little sparkle.
5.0	This ring is beautiful in person! The color is a perfect rose gold. Shipping was two days faster than the fastest expected date!
5.0	Love it just as advertised
5.0	The Snowman charm seems to be well made, and is very cute.  I'm looking forward to using it at Christmastime for a Christmas-themed bracelet.  It arrived within the stated range of time.
5.0	I had read the mm size on this charm but was still surprised by how small it was-tiny really.  But still the silver is beautiful and the message is meaningful. I placed this on my charm bracelet's clasp ring and it looks nice. The charm arrived quickly and was well wrapped.
5.0	I ordered this and it came in remarkably fast and it's perfect. Looks exactly like the picture and it's not heavy feeling like some others I've ordered. Awesome product!!
1.0	Am returning them.The shields hang horizontally istead of vertically as they should.
5.0	This piece is gorgeous. Love, love, love. The seller was prompt and packaged well.
1.0	I did not get this bead showing. I receive something different. I kept it, but it was not what I order and now it shows that they do not have it. How convenient.
5.0	love these! just as described and pictured
5.0	Very pretty! I always get compliments! I always like AK accessories.
5.0	These earrings are beautiful! I received a lot of compliments while wearing them. They have a very delicate/rough look, quite a paradox. It's a perfect blend of two styles.
1.0	last a week then it got dark
5.0	Love my new  bracelet
5.0	Beautiful Pendulum!  Love it!  Thank you for the fast shipment!
5.0	Awesome product ! Very nice piece of jewelry.
5.0	Excellent very beautiful nice lobster claw clasp.. good width.. Not to large or too small..  Very shinny
1.0	Rating: POOR<br />Just awful. Extremely poor quality. Links have separated on multiple occasions. Brought the piece to a jewelry store to have repaired and each time, another link would become detached. Lost confidence in the item and will not wear it any longer. Wrote to the merchant Silvance to request they replace the item but they ignored me and failed to acknowledge. So, a POOR rating is given to this item and a POOR rating is given to the merchant, Silvance.
5.0	Great nose ring.  14k gold, easy and hypo allergenic. Prompt shipping.  Good price.  Attractive nose ring. No prongs to wear down, twist, curl or break.
5.0	Just got this ring today. So far so good i like the color and the weight is very light ( i usually wear tungsten ). This is NOT a fragile ring. Black ceramic rated a 7 on the Mohs scale of hardness, which makes it harder than every metal, except tungsten. Tungsten is the hardest metal known to man with a hardness of 8. I have done a lot of research to find the perfect wedding band and i like to keep things new and fresh so i keep switching out my wedding bands (with wife's approval). So spending $20 on a band is great but I'm still a man who likes quality, hence the research. My only gripe is that they ship the ring in a giant manilla envelope with no box what so ever. Hope this review helps make your decision easier.  P.S. Stay away from gold or black tungsten it is only a coating that doesn't last long. Tungsten is naturally silver in color everything else is just a coating. Ceramic can come in many colors.
1.0	If you want to do work on a bracelet before you actually can wear it than this is the bracelet for you. I broke a nail just trying to set the thing up in order to wear it.
5.0	I bought these earrings 3 years ago and wore them every day, until I recently lost one when I brushed the back off by accident. But they were perfect for those three years, and I'm back for another pair because they're beautiful, look real, and the posts are 14k gold for my sensitive ears. They're also the perfect size, not big enough to be showy, but not too small either. Delivery and packing was perfect as well. These are a great value!
5.0	Perfect! It works and is very durable! &#60;3 Thank you so much!
5.0	I really love these earrings. Will buy again.
5.0	I am a big fan of Spider-Man and when I saw this I had to buy it. I had no idea how it would be except the description. Well I received my spider today and must say WOW! it is made with a professionalism and skill that really exceeds my expectations. If you like Spider-Man you should order this I believe you won't be disappointed.
5.0	The seller is excellent to do business with. we bought the ring in eBay, and we are very pleased with it! Thank you Shiree Odiz
1.0	The top of the belly ring is sideways....
5.0	Ordered this and received it in two days. Beautiful just like the picture!
5.0	The pendant is pretty and elegant. The chain suits perfectly. Can be worn everyday or on special occasion. Highly recommended.
5.0	love the ring! and it took some time to get to me but over all i love the item and the packaging was great
5.0	Perfect Christmas present for my wife.  She loves them. Not much else to say, just you should have seen her smile.
5.0	Exactly as described even better than I thought its a nice size and very strudy!! Will buy from seller again.
5.0	Came fast and fit well on my husband looks just as the photo - nice quality
5.0	I love this bracelet! Even though I cant yet put it on by myself because of the clasp i still love to wear it. I recieved my item at the beginning of its delievery date. Cute Item!
5.0	Bought this for a Bridal Shower gift. It was a hit!
1.0	it looks good, even better than it looks in the image, but when you put it on... it really scratches my neck.. I tried to keep it for sometime around my neck, but I could not.
5.0	Bought for daughters. They love it.  Just bought another one for a friend.  Great gift, she loves it. I have compliments on mine all the time. I never take it off.
5.0	This wide foxtail man's bracelet is really nice. It's just the right width and it has a nice shine too.
5.0	This is a very nice set of jewelry to wear anytime. Sure love all the sparkle! Thank you for the pretty set.
5.0	I wear it every day, looks great!
5.0	Very pretty earrings. They are very light, and that is both good and bad. The bad is that they can work their way out of your ear without your noticing. I lost one twice in the house that first day. I need to get the holders for the back to make them stay on better.
5.0	I purchased the set of three rings.  I gave one to my grand daughter that said it is so cute.
5.0	Besides it being long! I love it!
5.0	these are great even for my 2 yr old daughter... they are awesome to sleep in also .... love them
1.0	Doesn't lay nicely when worn. Very cheaply made. You get what you pay for.
5.0	I just love how this look on me. everyone thinks they are real. I wear them everyday. they don't pinch me ...I wear them as a septum, and lip piercing
5.0	gift for my wife and she loved it. the photo is a little misleading. the diamonds do not look black
5.0	Took a month to get here, but, dude. 89 cents, man.<br /><br />The chain is fixed, so you have to slip it on, and there's no length adjustment. But it's still cute.
5.0	They are smaller than the pic portrays, but still nice. The colors are lighter than it shows, but I still get compliments
5.0	arrived on time..so cute...it's a Christmas gift for my granddaughters so I haven't taken it out of the cellophane wrapping..but I'm very pleased with the way it looks..looks durable. .
5.0	Works like I expected, and it's super cute to boot. It also arrived in a really timely manner. Thank you!
5.0	I was a little nervous to buy a ring online (this was to be an engagement ring), but I was so enamored with it that I took a leap - and man am I glad I did.  It was (is) so beautiful, she loved it, it is SO her personality, and best of all, she said yes!
1.0	Hated these and returned them. They were even too small for a four year old.
5.0	This ring is so cute! It did take awhile to ship and when I received I forgot I had ordered it. Looks exactly like the picture and has a great fit.
1.0	This Cross is NOT made out of Brass!  It is made of some type of flimsy 'metal' that appears to have been 'sprayed' with the most ugly, dull, greyish-dark gold hue of paint or lacquer to give the appearance of a &#34;textured metal&#34;.  The description clearly states the metal is Brass; moreover, the picture of the cross magnified appears to be also made of Brass, however, that is certainly not what I received.  If I saw this in a store for 1 cent I would not even purchase it.  It also is much smaller in dimension, substance, and in overall appearance.  The adjustable cord is all one piece, so if one has a medium to large head circumference they would certainly never be able to put this cord over their head without a struggle.
1.0	Very poor quality studs. Did not like what I have seen. It looked like cheap product made in China. WOULD NOT RECOMmEND TO BUY. I end up paying $1300 which is D color and I clarity.
5.0	These are large earings. The shell is beautiful and the color is great. Just know that they are very large. I usually dont wear such big earings, but these would be perfect for an evening out.
5.0	This is a beautiful ring and it runs true to size.  It appears to be a white gold or platinum, and is very, very nice.  Some have stated that it is wide on the finger, but no, the comfort fit  feels as good as it looks.
5.0	This necklace is absolutely beautiful!  It's a gift for a new mom and I am sure she will be delighted!  I would highly recommend this to anyone.
1.0	My chain arrived with no clasps at all. And parts of the chain were too short to even work. Luckily I had purchased some other cheap &#34;gold-looking&#34; jewelry that I had to scrap anyways. So I used parts (clasps and pieces of chain) to fix it and make it work. It look a lot of time and patience to tinker with it and make it just right, but it looks pretty sexy when I finally nailed it. It is very cheap and links break easily, so I have extra gold links on hand just in case.
5.0	I can't say enough good things about this company or this product. My chain arrived in a cute little gold box with instructions to register it for the warranty. It is simple and to the point. The chain is the most beautiful yellow gold and lustrous and very clean. You can tell on delivery that they store their products well, and may even clean them before shipping! Thank you lifetime jewelry for a gorgeous chain to display my favorite gold cross on once again. I will recommend these chains to everyone, the quality is unmatched.<br />DISCLOSURE: I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.
5.0	The case is well made and I can put two layers of jewelry in the case. Just what I was looking for.
5.0	just sparkly and beautiful - wears well -  I have it on my winter white coat lapel as I am a breast cancer survivor
1.0	I received this item in a knotted mess. I didn't even try to untangle the necklace but promptly returned it.
5.0	I bought these earrings for myself to wear everyday in the office. They are the perfect size since I have smaller earlobes. For reference, they are about 1/8th of an inch<br /><br />I'm very happy with the purchase given the color and clarity of the diamond, not to mention it's set on platinum. For those who are concerned that they are not constructed as screw-back post, no worries, they are very sturdy.<br /><br />High quality gems at a reasonable price with a classic and timeless look - you won't regret it
5.0	I love it , but I want more biger
5.0	Ordered this ring on Thursday. It arrived Saturday and it is so beautiful!! It sparkles like crazy and I am totally impressed. Worth the money. Looks great on and not too heavy!! Buy it!!!!!!!
5.0	It's gorgeous, classy and really beautiful. It enhances anything you wear...even t-shirts.
5.0	this ring was classy. my bad, ordered a size 12 since half sizes were not available and I lost it!
5.0	You simply cannot do better for the $21 price. The size is amazing; they look really substantial. They are strung very well. It is true that they are neither as perfectly white as in the picture nor as perfectly round, that the clasp could work a little more smoothly, and that there are small flaws on every pearl. But from 3 feet away they look uniform, the flaws are not perceptible, and they look appear to be a much more expensive string of pearls. I would highly recommend these at twice the price and would have still been satisfied at five times.
5.0	this is a beautiful set.  i bought it for an outfit for renaissance fair.
5.0	I wanted a nice little silver ring to go along with another ring and this one is thin enough.  For the price it is perfect.
5.0	Husband loved it immediately.
5.0	great addition to a charm braclet. It served as a great give that i can just keep adding on to. the product came quickly and was as descrived.
1.0	After trying the clasp in joining the bracelet together, it was impossible to open it again, so I discarded it.
5.0	I just got mine and I love them both and can't wait to give my bf his. They're amazing! Thank you so much I love them
5.0	PERFECT GIFT IT FITS PERFECT ON THE PANDORA BRACELET COMES BOXED NICELY READY TO GIVE AND BEAUTIFUL
5.0	I love this ring!  It is exactly as pictured and it arrived promptly.  I am very pleased with my purchase.
5.0	After my son got his ear pierced last summer and he was able to stop wearing the original starter earring, we quickly learned that he can not wear cheap earrings or he gets infections. We switched to 14 kt gold ones and while they don't give him infections, they're also quite pricey! I got this earring as an experiment to see if he could wear silver earrings and these work great. They don't bother his ears and the design looks nice, almost like a hammered metal square. It gives the earring a little more depth since it's not totally flat. These were priced reasonably, attractive, and it's his favorite earring.
5.0	Love this charm.  Fits and looks great in the heart shaped lockets I have.
5.0	When I saw these earlngs I thought they would be perfect on my wedding day.  If you go into a Bridal Salon or something like, David's Bridal on-line, you are not going to get the real stuff.  If you take a good look at those brides wearing their big CZ bracelets and earings---perhaps with some fake pearls, it devalues your whole get up.  If you want to use &#34;something borrowed&#34; that's great.  If you want beautiful earings that you can wear on many more occassions and pass down to a daughter or a family member, this is a great style at a good price.  I received many complements!
5.0	Have not worn anything else since purchase .
5.0	I love them.  They are very light.  I do not normally take them out.  They are sparkley.
5.0	This is a BEAUTIFUL necklace, so I'm giving it 5 stars; it looks absolutely like a real diamond, and I couldn't be more pleased. Hopefully, this won't happen to another buyer, but when it arrived, the stone was not in the setting, so I took it to a jeweler and he placed the stone back in for me ($20) So--because it's so beautiful, I still give the necklace itself 5 stars, but hopefully someone will check the necklace before they mail it.
5.0	I bought this in memory of my late father who was a WWll vet, but best of all the parent I adored. I would buy it again.
1.0	cheap and doesnt stay on
1.0	Couldn't get pins out to get to fit my wife's wrist and when I finally got one out, couldn't get it back in for her to even wear loose. Wasn't able to contact the seller or manufacturer to report and haven't been able to get it fixed locally. Surprise present gone bad and a few tears shed.
5.0	got this as a valentines gift. excellent ring set. they are very beautiful. got here very fast. worth every penny
5.0	i love this ring was the size i thought it would be.  I will order from here again very happy with ring.
5.0	Have not used yet but when it arrived, It was lovely and I knew I would wear it for most items on Club weekends
5.0	Was much nicer in person, love it!  Thank you for the quick shipment as well.
5.0	This bracelet has such beautiful colors abd fit me well. I havent worn it yet but I will soon! Cant complain!
5.0	I had been searching for a head piece like this on etsy for ages and finally thought I'd look on amazon. I found this, purchased three more like it, and am very satisfied. Would definitely purchase again!
5.0	exactly what i wanted, the only problem was the length of the chain for it, after switching out the chain everything's ok.
5.0	The ring is everything that I could hope for. The quality of it is outstanding without a doubt. It has a very smooth, elegant design and feel to it that I noticed right away with it. The ring size options were perfect and prime is determined on the size of the ring. If someone is a fan of skeleton watches then this ring is even more perfect as the design of the ring goes very well with a skeleton watch which I only noticed due to some stranger telling me how good they matched. Furthermore, this ring reminds me of the Ring of the First Born Son from Dark Souls so that is cool too.
5.0	VERY PLEASED THE PRODUCT IS BEAUTIFUL AND WHAT THE PICTURE IMPLIED.<br />IT IS SOMETHING I WILL PLEASED TO GIVE AS A GIFT
5.0	I loved these belly button rings.  I can go out to a shop and buy one for $15. But why should I, When I can get 20 cute Belly button rings for under 5 dollars. I got an adorable one with a Bunny on it. I love it. I also got one that has a Playboy bunny look a like too. I got alot of cute colors and designs.
5.0	This necklace arrived in acceptable time and was cute. The color is bronze, but it isn't the same as in the picture. The eyes were also a little scratched, but it's not too bad. However I will have to fix the little rings that hold the owl's body together, as they are bent and I am afraid it will fall apart when worn.
5.0	This pendant is beautiful. I bought it as a gift for my Girl friend and she love it. Every time I see it on my GF I am happy that I bought it.
5.0	Boyfriend loves and can't stop wearing.
5.0	I bought this for my husband who insisted he didn't want a bracelet, but when he saw it, he was really surprised at how nice it looked. He put it on right away and has been wearing it ever since. It fastens like a bracelet and looks more expensive than the price I paid at Amazon. He even forgot to take it off when we were snorkeling and it came out of the salt water still looking like new.
5.0	Bought this for my cuts, she loved it.  I want one for myself.
5.0	I got this as a Xmas gift for my 6 year old daughter.  She loved it!  For the price, it also seems to be fairly good quality.
5.0	I bought this as a gift for my daughters boyfriend and he loved it. Very nice and does not look cheap
5.0	They were beautiful but I had to give them away because they were too big and reorder 0.
5.0	Gorgeous pendant.  Note that it is quite heavy.
5.0	I bought this for my 7yr old daughter for an honor roll present and she loves it so much. Its a beautiful and simple necklace.
1.0	I ordered these and they are small and they keep falling out of my ears at night and when I bump them. They look good but they definitely aren't what I wanted.
5.0	Awesome fit and looks great on...thanks
5.0	for the price she loved it and i loved it and most of all my wallet. highly recommend this ring
5.0	Nice size for a little girl.
5.0	Love these earrings..
1.0	Cheaply made. Should have known better.
5.0	This Heart Pendant is one of my favorites to wear.
5.0	beautiful plugs!!! great quality and they sparkle like real diamonds! shipping was super fast too! would definitely recommend buying! great quality for an awesome price!
5.0	I lost my best friend this year. I will wear this for her. I loved the message.
5.0	LOVE them. My ears are very sensitive and I am always losing an earing. They are perfect! That's why I ordered a second set!
5.0	For the price you cant beat it. Takes for-freakin-ever to get here but who cares. Buy this necklace today thanks.
5.0	I Love it! Best purchase ever! It looks extremely good, no chips or anything at all. The cord feels really good its really soft and doesnt irritate the skin like many other ones. Service is amazing! They also put in an extra bracelet and necklace as a gift!! I will definitely be a life long costumer.
5.0	Great price. Easy to use. Great idea.
5.0	Love this sparkling necklace worth the price but doesn't look cheap!
5.0	This product is amazing. My boyfriend and I decided to exchange rings, and since he is military and is constantly working in harsh conditions I wanted to get a Tungsten ring. I didn't expect this ring to be as sturdy as it was for the price I paid! For $20 we got a ring that is pretty heavy, yet comfortable. The matte finish is nice, although the ring is definitely black and not gray like in the picture, I personally think that it looks better that way. It really does not scratch just like it advertises! He's had it for a month now and it looks just like it came out the box. The box it comes in is also really nice. A really great product over all and I recommend that if you're looking at this review now, get this ring!
5.0	Awesome little earring...have gotten great compliments!  It has stayed in very well..surprisingly.  I suspected it would come loose but it's hanging in there!  :)
5.0	solid,weighty, much better quality than other rings purchased from other vendors in the same order. I wear it as a pinky ring. I will be buying more from this designer
5.0	This bracelet is truly lovely, and exactly what I was looking for. Something to celebrate both our relationship and her faith. It came in a lovely little box, with a prayer card that says the same thing as the bracelet. She is going to love it, and it was absolutely worth the money.
5.0	I love these small earrings!  The picture was just right.  I love the size.  Not too big and not too small.  Product came as promised.
5.0	Bought this as a gift .... and they loved it ....comes with two extra hooks jus in case something happens
1.0	This item was to big for nose and ear
5.0	I just got this tonight after ordering this 3 days ago as a Christmas present. It came much faster than expected. The quality is great. This piece looks so much better in person than it does online. Definitely a great purchase, especially for the price.
5.0	Great! It came in the cutest package to give to the recipient & she loved it, also came with a coupon for future purchases. I'm def ordering more.
5.0	The size of the stone was perfect! It also has the quality associated with Kendra Scott's products. Went well with the earrings that are similar in nature. Nothing negative to say about the necklace at all.
5.0	This ring was perfect!!! My husband loves it!! I bought another more expensive ring but he wears this one all the time.
5.0	The earings looks similar to what is pictured. I loved the product and am sure it will look even better with the right dress. The delivery was prompt too.
5.0	I got it for my mom for mother's day, and she loves it.
5.0	nice belly ring daughter loved it
5.0	Simply beautiful and captures the Lord's essence. A great icon.
5.0	Bought this for my granddaughter.  She really likes it
5.0	Very pretty. Better than I expected.
5.0	This is a really nice product.  It is made from quality leather, and seems to be pretty durable.  It is comfortable to wear and fits very well.  As is a concern with alot of leather products, it doesn't have a smell of from the chemicals used to dye or tan it.  It has a very faint smell, but thats normal.  I believe this bracelet will be around a few years for me to enjoy!
5.0	this was a gift for my mom's bday and I love it so much, I may have to get myself one.
5.0	Very classy and expensive looking necklace. Great for any occasion.
1.0	I had received this from my fiancé and was soo happy with it until a year later I had come to find out I had lost  my diamond.  I I was soooo unhappy. Not worth the sixty.
5.0	This is an amazing ring!  I have an antique engagement ring that I paired this with.  I searched and searched for a ring that would have the antiqu look like my engagement ring.  I found it in this one!  Itisn't a wide ring maybe 1 or 2 mm.  It also looked GREAT alone on my other fingers. But, it looked soo great withmy antique engagement ring that I use it for my wedding band.  Does NOT look cheap at all!  I was inpressed and a bit surprised it didn't.  Does not turn my finger either.  Good quality!
1.0	terrible material. just, absolutely terrible. I accidentally left one in my car and it MELTED from 20 degrees Celsius. that's really concerning.
1.0	Broke tha first time I tried to put them in and I wasn't hard on it. Just slip it in. I've been putting earrings in for 35 years. I feel like I'm pretty good at it. But these? Obviously beyond my level of expertise.
5.0	My favorite bracelet of the few I purchased a few months ago.  Easy on-off, secure latch and simple design.
5.0	Gorgeous! The blue stone is a little bit lighter!
5.0	This item is well made, sold at a great price, easy transaction and timely arrival. I recommend this seller and product. AAA++++
5.0	My daughter saw this necklace in Canterbury England but didn't buy it, then when she went back she couldn't find the shop again, so she was very excited to see it in your store. I bought it for her for Christmas and she loves it!!!! Thanks
5.0	I purchased this bracelet as a birthday gift for my husband.  It's heavy and thick. I was a bit surprised to see that the id plate did not have a satin or matte like in the picture however, you definitely get your money's worth.  I actually took it to a local jeweler and had them tell me it wasn't silver because it was too heavy. I think that he didn't have the right equipment to engrave it so that was all he could say.  My husband will love it just as much as I do.
5.0	My Grandaughter saw this Necklace and wanted me to order it. She kept looking in the Mail for it, she wears it all the time.
5.0	Love them! There nice and soft so you can sleep and not have them hurting you.
5.0	great product! works great with tap water and a teaspoon of dawn
5.0	Just as expected, this is a thin, silver, shiny ring. It arrived without scratches, sizing was correct, and looks great.
5.0	I was very pleased with the quality of the watch I received. It arrived quicker than I expected. Customer service was excellent, I will buy from this site again.
5.0	They're kind of small, like the mushroom pendant they came with, but they shimmer real good.  Mom goes to the senior center everyday, and all the girls compliment her on her jewelry. Which boosts her ego, and which is why I like to buy items like this for her.  And perfume.  Which I've found at Amazon ABSOLUTELY MUCH CHEAPER THAN ANYPLACE ELSE.
5.0	This pendant was exactly what I was looking for.  It is beautiful and well make.  The CZs are brilliant and set very well.  I get compliments every time I wear it with an Italian box chain which I also purchased from Amazon.  I am thrilled with this purchase and I would recommend it to anyone!
5.0	Absolutely lovely worth the wait
1.0	They're great but I can't wear them because the post is too short and it pinches my ear lobe...
5.0	These clip earrings are very, very pretty....look very expensive as well.
5.0	I got these a while ago, and I am very pleased with my purchase. These were for my daughter, and I hear everybody saying how cute the colors and the glitter are. They are the perfect size and they don't look overwhelming like some lip piercings do. She combines them with her clothes and makeup, and they just look adorable. They were totally worth every cent.
5.0	The ring looks great and you can not really argue with the price. I have had it a few days and have weight lifted twice and there is not a scratch on it. I recommend the product to anyone that has a problem with scratching their soft metal rings.
5.0	I'm very pleased with my purchase! The gem is the perfect size and came exactly how it was described.
5.0	I researched this purchase pretty extensively.  I had a gold band that was impossible to keep clean and always looked terrible due to the scratches etc...  I have been wearing this band for over three years and it looks exactly as it did when I took it out of the box.  It literally has zero nicks scratches or other blemishes and I have never taken the thing off no matter what I'm doing.  I'm fairly certain that it will stay that way unless I take a diamond plated drill bit to it.  As other reviewers have stated the item does appear darker than the picture.  I can't say for certain if that has happened over time or if was like that when I got it. I will say that based on the other reviews I expected it so don't want to dock a star over it.  Short version is I would buy it again and recommend it to anyone.
1.0	Poor quality, doesn't look as silver at all, very small stones. I will not recommened it to anyone. I was very dissapointed.
5.0	makes a great gift for girls any age! and the clasp is so much better than all the other ones! now i can finally put on and take off my bracelet with only one hand!
5.0	Not too large - not to heavy - good locks - my wife is petiite and these are a good size - not over powering.
5.0	To put it simply, The chain looks real as if its a 120$ chain, only a professorial jewelry guy can tell if it's real or not, but the homies and the ladies think it's real, It turns any outfit into a swagg outfit instantly, You cant go without this if your a urban guy, or got swagg star like me ;)If you dont have a chain buy one NOW at this price you cant go wrong, SWAGG UP MAN!!!
5.0	This ring is beautiful. ....well made and sizing is true. Would recommend this product to others..!!
5.0	Not expensive, sparkling, looks very nice with my pearl pendant. Just what i wanted. Looks like real silver, but i am not sure if it actually is.
1.0	"This \\""little\\"" necklace was not at all what I thought it would be. It was a good color of gold so I kept it, but the circles very very small and the chain was very short."
5.0	I wear this constantly on a necklace with other charms and am so happy with it!!
5.0	Very pretty and elegant.  Arrived just as pretty as the picture.
5.0	This is a pretty strong ring. The price makes this even better. I have had mine for over a year now and it is still going strong. The clear surface has some minor scratching but it is not noticeable. I am pretty careless with mine. I sometimes wear it when I am lifting and it has been raked against the concrete more times than I can remember.
5.0	Such a beautiful charm. The picture really does not do it justice! Very detailed, dainty, and very well made. I recommend this charm!
5.0	This is a very beautiful and expensive looking brooch. My husband bought this for me and I have never seen anything as unique and delightfully beautiful!! I love the dazzling effect that the brooch has when you wear it. Would recommend to all.
5.0	This ring has to be one of my favorite rings that i own. I love rings that are very unique and different from what is normal. Not to mention  i love to collect &#34;antique&#34; rings will be buying more from this company in the future!
5.0	Look great. Can't tell they are not real diamonds (from normal viewing distance). I have gotten many compliments, they didn't cost much, so I'm not too worried if i loose one. Order multiple sets at this price  SHIPPING TOOK 10 DAYS!!!  AMAZING!!!
5.0	I'm using this ring for my fiance's wedding ring. it's a great ring, and the price is great too!
1.0	not sure about the look .
5.0	I've been searching for a ring like this for a long time it's simply beautiful and the color of the stone is perfect a true garnet, thanks...
5.0	I like seeing these types on my wife. The are not to big and not to small, not to flashy and add just enough to her out fits, a good buy.
5.0	I've worn this ring quite a bit, and have gotten numerous compliments!! Women said to me today, &#34;wow what a rock!&#34; I just smiled...(every time I try to say that it's not a real diamond...women say..you don't have to tell anyone that...&#34;), so I skipped it today. Fits nicely, comfortable to wear, is still very shiny and sparkly!!<br />I will update if necessary!
1.0	Very disapointed very small for the price 21cents more i could have got the origimi owl charm & be the correct size
5.0	The disc is exactly the right size.  The sequence in the center is very noticeable, too.  The earring is the perfect size and drop length.  I bought the gold ones, too!
5.0	Sealed, sterile condition upon arrival.  Item was exactly as described.  Titanium posts have worked out well with my overly sensitive skin.
5.0	They're pretty small and neat. Works perfectly as a nose ring and earrings for that full ear coverage.
5.0	Very elegant ring and well finished and the box too I love it and my wife too but it is smaller than it appears on the picture
5.0	Probably my favorite septum ring I have ever gotten. It's perfect for me, subtle but still visible.
5.0	My wife really liked this little thing, it seems to be well made and is very pretty.  For the price, it is a 5 star item for sure.  The down side is now the wife wants earrings to match.
1.0	I was very unhappy when I got my ring. It was extreamly tarnished and left black dust all over my hands. The picture makes it look shinny and clean and it is anything but. The metal it is made from is extreamly frail and is easily bent out of shape. Also, once apart, the ring never sits right again even though I have put it back together correctly.
5.0	First off the picture doesn't do these plugs justice, at least the ones I got. In the stock photo they look like cheap corian like stone but they are really very nice. But the flare is big but if your at my size (00g) or bigger than it doesn't matter you'll get them in fine, (as long as you've been at that size for a while)
1.0	Not only was I sent a completely different color, the metal around the jewel looks like it's gonna drop the stone out any second! Not aqua. Baby blue is the shade I was sent. Complete crap!!!
5.0	These earrings really look like real diamond hoops. I have gotten so many compliments on them and everyone thinks they are the real thing! Absolutely beautiful!
5.0	They are just what I was looking for.  I thought they were well represented in the photos. I bought them specifically for a wedding.
5.0	I bought this for my nieces 19th birthday in October. I am now considered the beat aunt ever. It is bigger ham I thought so be sure you consider this fact before purchasing.
5.0	Love these and love the look of the jewelry on.
5.0	Came to my home in a timely manner.  Was even better than expected.  Beautiful green crystals.  My daughter LOVED it.
5.0	I'm a fan of bioplast since the first time I wore one of these! They feel great, and the variety of colors is amazing! I love the combination of simple shape, convenience (no pain, no sticking to clothes, no weird marks on your skin when you wake up in the morning), and pretty colors! You can mix and match with your outfit and it always looks good! Love love love them!
5.0	Love, love, love my new bangles. They are so pretty and made in the USA. Will be buying more for sure
1.0	Dark and cheap-looking; believe me, upon delivery these earrings look little like what is pictured, as they are very small and the colors of the &#34;metals&#34; and &#34;gems&#34; don't have the high contrast as what is pictured. Very much NOT worth what I paid.
5.0	These are quite lovely. The pearls are flawless and have a beautiful luster or shine to them.  The color of my pearls are true to the picture.  The pearls are actually larger than I was expecting but the length of the earrings is slightly shorter.  They hang just below the earlobe but have a nice little dangle to them.  The crystal in the setting is very sparkly when the light catches it.  This is my second purchase from this retailer and I will buy from them again.  Also, the gift box is adorable and a very nice addition to the overall presentation.  I would recommend these earrings for a good basic pearl earring or even as a gift.
5.0	I needed rose gold accessories to pair with my new rose gold watch. This necklace is super cute, true to color and just the right size (not too big or small). Very happy with purchase and delivery.
5.0	perfect just what i was looking for. not to big not to small just right. i love them<br />love them.will be back for the others to<br />thank you
5.0	These were more beautiful than I could have expected..They go with just about anything.  I can add one of more to a chain and wear around your neck.
1.0	This product is very low quality and came with bent pegs on the ear rings which is very disappointing as the necklace is great.
5.0	this ring is absolutely beautiful, love it, love it, love it, the stone is a good size and the ring sparkles.
1.0	Get what you pay for. My wife promptly threw it away. 8/9 year old probably. This isn't retro, it's cheap
5.0	Looks awesome, feels awesome. I love it, and get a lot of compliment on it. Thanks
5.0	The charms is exactly like the picture - sits very nicely on my bracelet - looks amazing -love it!!!<br />the colors are really nice and stand out
5.0	Exquisite silver bracelet set with amethysts and peridot.  Fits my tiny wrist!  Bought to match an expensive amethyst and peridot necklace and looks very nice.  This is hand-made and real quality.  Worth every cent.
5.0	Well I can definitely say it's real gold. My wife is allergic to regular metals and she hasn't had any problems. Also matches her black diamond wedding ring. Very simple earrings and well built.
5.0	These are much prettier in person when you see the light on them.  I gave them as a gift and wish I had another pair to keep!
5.0	My friend has brain cancer (level 4) and these came In just In time.I gave one to him and his mother...and I wear mine everyday! It reminds us of The fight for life we are In!
5.0	This necklace is exactly what I was looking for. The silk cord is nice because it doesn't pull my hair! I would definitely recommend it :)
5.0	Beautiful product. Everyone who sees them loves them. Very impressed with the quality of this item. Planning to buy again for a friend.
5.0	I bought these earrings and a purple top for my niece's birthday, and she loved the earrings very much
5.0	This is just lovely! so happy with the purchase.
5.0	I love this it is so pretty with the sparkling pink stones around the cameo.  It is way prettier than I expected it would be. I bought it for my Mom she collects pins and I know she is going to love it.
5.0	I absolutely love this  bracelet! It's polish is super shiney and the quality is great! I don't want to take it off!
5.0	I totally in love with this pair of earrings, and have received so many compliments on them that it is difficult for me to count! They compliment beautifully most of my outfits, are not heavy at all on my ears, and make me look absolutely fashionable all the time. The vendor is also fabulous and their packing materials and delivery time most definitely wins them 10 stars and more if the scale went higher!
5.0	As good as we expected . They look Great!
5.0	Great chain. Real heavy. Shipped quick tio
5.0	It came right on time and fits great.  The stone doesn't exactly look like real turquoise but it is very pretty and I love the setting.
1.0	BEWARE well-meaning Web Shopper. This produce is tinny and junk. The back of stud doesn't fit against the ear, thus it sags. Also, if this is even gold as it says, it is tin-foil thin. The clasps will not hold the stud on your ear long as they slide off when first purchased. If that is not enough, AMAZON ALLOWS THIS COMPANY MAKE YOU PAY RETURN POSTAGE!
5.0	What's not to love?  Great price, I wear it with my other bangle bracelets and I've gotten so many compliments on it.
5.0	I absolutely love this necklace. The moonstone has a nice, subtle color and some small imperfections that I think add to its beauty. I actually think it looks more beautiful in person than it does in the picture, and it looks great on as well. The one and only drawback I have experienced is that it was difficult to thread the clasp of a chain through the tiny holes at the top of the pendant, as they are quite small and are placed at an awkward angle to one another. After I finally got the pendant threaded on a chain, I decided that I did NOT want to go through the process of rethreading it ever again. I used to use that chain for a variety of different pendants, but I've now devoted that particular chain to this pendant forever. I decided it was worth purchasing another simple silver chain to avoid the hassle of rethreading this one again. Otherwise, this is truly a lovely pendant!
1.0	Lousy product! If they had looked as good as the picture, I would have kept them and been proud too wear them.  However, this was a lousy misrepresentation.  The earrings were about 1/8 the size of the picture.  Amazon, you should watch more closely what you put your name attached to.
5.0	Love, perfect statement stud.  I receive lots of compliments every time I wear.  I also bought the pink as a birthday present.
5.0	This work wonderful. I really love my ring. the detail to the flower to perfect.<br />I defiantly recommend this ring if you like silver and fashion ring!
5.0	Looked so wonderful with my wedding dress!
5.0	fun and trendy prod =) def recommend! makes fun and cute gifts!  loved it =) stocking stuffer or just b/c gift!
1.0	The money clip arrived in mint condition, but that was the last time I saw it in anywhere close to that condition again, after just a few days use the clip had noticeable wear and scratches on it from being in my pocket, the finish is scratched and doesnt look very good at all, and I've only had it for about 2 weeks. For the cost of this of money clip you can get something much better.
5.0	This is a purr-fect little tray to give as a gift to anyone you know who is a cat lover. Not only cute but reasonably priced too so if you are a cat lover as well you could get one too!.
5.0	I have been wearing this ring for several weeks and in harsh environments with not problems so far.
5.0	My friend just loved this.  She went crazy over it, and if fit her perfect.
5.0	I love it!!!! Better than I expected.  My sister and granddaughter are planning to order one for themselves.
5.0	Small but awesome, don't expect the stone to shine as a rock, but it look just fine! Personnaly, i like this product.
5.0	Good and cheap, just the way I like it.
5.0	Bought these for my girlfriend a couple weeks ago, she absolutely LOVED them! Definitely worth buying! Only complaint would be that the box they come in is a little poopy but It'll do the job.
5.0	Very nice I was very satisfied.  It was smaller than I thought but very nice
1.0	Looks beautiful, but not real silver, so it made my husband's neck break out in a horrible rash! Very disappointed!
5.0	loved it! it fit just like i wanted! so glad i made this purchase and got this great deal on this beautiful ring! thanks so much!
5.0	Perfect accessory for Florida day's and evenings!!!
5.0	These are so cute and perfect. I love them. They are perfect to dress up or down. Very well made. I recommend highly!
5.0	I love it. All my rings fit, and I have lots of space left for brooches and stuff. Mind that the case is big and would take plenty of space, but it's so practical. I could never find anything in all my boxes and cases. Problem solved!
5.0	Since there wasn't a review on this necklace I went ahead and ordered it anyway....great decision I made! I LOVE it! I'm wearing now and haven't taken it off! It's my everyday necklace!
5.0	Very pretty use for work  badge
5.0	Mom wanted something to make her feel beautiful -- these were perfect and she loves them.  Lightweight, stylish, and beautiful.
5.0	I bought this bracelet for a friend during a rough time and she loves it. It is very well made and looks great! I am very pleased with the product, especially for the price, and would definitely reorder!
5.0	This is a very pretty bracelet and not cheap looking like I feared it would.  I purchased it with another one and wear them non-stop.  Bright silver hasn't tarnished at all.
5.0	Very nice earrings. Good quality and well made. I've worn them several times and they are very comfortable and attractive.  Thanks.
5.0	I no longer have to go hunting through bags and other places to find the one ring I want ro wear on a particular day since this organizes them beautifully. The &#34;glass&#34; is actually plexiglass, which I prefer--now I won't have to worry re: possibly cutting myself if the box falls and the glass breaks.  The box has a very secure clasp as well.  Very happy with my purchase.  Got the smaller one (about 36 holders in it) and after putting in all my rings still have about half the box waiting for more.  No problem--will get busy soon buying more rings!!
5.0	First off it came way earlier than expected! My boyfriend and I got these as part of our 2 year anniversary present and it was perfect. It fits perfect too! No complaints! :)
1.0	Lovely, shipped quickly and exactly like the photo. Then barely two weeks after I got it a stone fell out of the band. Hoping I can get a replacement
5.0	These are AMAZING!! Beautiful, lightweight and a perfect design.
5.0	Nice bracelet!  Gave it as as gift.  Has nice weight and adjustability. And yes, it it shiny and cool looking'
5.0	It's not only durable but eye catchy. I have received many compliments about this piece. It's also very easy to clean. Just dish soap and water. DO check the screw that attaches the cross to the clasp. Mine got loose and I thought I lost my beautiful cross but found it on the floor of the closet in the hotel room. The stones are intact. i never lost one.
5.0	Love the colors and love the charms, this is going to make one of my girls very happy! I definetly have to buy more.
1.0	When I received the earrings I noticed they did not have the rubber backings - I assumed from the long design of the post that they were not needed.  Bad assumption, I lost an earring the first day.... very sad.  They were cute.
5.0	You can purchase this cuff link case with confidence.  The wood id superior quality as is the hardware.  If I were to make any criticism, that would be in the packaging.  I am environmentally opposed to over packaging.  It's beautifully packaged, but that is the case with most quality products.  I hope one day companies will package their products more simply.  But sitting on your dresser, there is no question that this case wouldn't be a stunner.
5.0	Wearing  it now.a favorite  ring.it is also a memorial  to my husband. 5-18-2014. Lost his life to an aortic  aneurysm.
5.0	i love these charms they are super cute and went great with my charm bracelet i had put togther for myself
5.0	I wear a lot of silver, and these earrings were both pretty and a good price.  The leverbacks work well (which is not always the case) and the earrings are a nice length for shorter hair styles.
5.0	We really like the ring however, it runs a bit small and I cannot find my paperwork to return it to order a larger one.
5.0	This bracelet is made ver well and strong. Received it today and put is on right away!! It goes great with my San Francisco wardrobe. That was the reason I bought it!!
5.0	My wife loves it, runs rather small. Not for someone with a fully wrist.
5.0	My husband loves his ring!! A little wider than he likes though.
5.0	Fits me perfect.  High quality bracelet.  I have a very small wrist....probably 6 1/4&#34; almost childsize.  This bracelet fit me perfect, but buyer beware that this is a pretty small sized bracelet.  I love the pearls, it looks absolutely beautiful and I will keep it forever.  It matches my 3 row necklace perfectly.....I LOVE it!!!
5.0	I'm an avid ring wearer and I am absolutely in love with it. I like rings that I can keep wearing without them turning my finger green. I knew that a sterling silver ring won't turn the ring or my finger a different color, but it fits perfectly on my pointer finger. It is secure enough that I won't fall off but loose enough that it wouldn't suffocate my finger either. Hoping it won't break from the wear-and-tear of leaving it on all the time, but for now, I LOVE IT!
5.0	I purchased this necklace for my daughter in law as a gift for her first Mother's Day! It is beautiful!
5.0	i just got my ring in today && i absolutely LOVE it. i was afraid that maybe it was going to be too thick but it's the perfect width. size was right on too so that was nice. it's MUCH more shiny in person compared to the photo. i've been wearing it for well over 6 hours now && there's no discoloration on my finger. Material is light but still has some good weight to it. Best thing is, this ring is NOT fragile at all && I will definitely be wearing this on a day to day basis!!!
1.0	these were BLACK in color, NOT as advertized.
5.0	I love it! It's great and looks exactly like the one from the show. It fits well.
5.0	Love these earrings, please olive leaf earrings are very stunning looking while wearing definitely a good buy and would recommend
5.0	Wear them every day!!!!
1.0	The earrings doesn't look like in the picture. Looks cheap and the crystal looks like plastic.
5.0	Just lovely.  Small but that is one reason I love them, I am 5'2&#34; and do not like big earrings. I wanted to buy another pair as a gift but they are not available now.
5.0	I ordered both green and blue and the blue one is absolutely stunning. It has a nice bright blue shade which brings a lot of attention.
5.0	I'm very happy with the weight/quality of this chain.  I bought it  for a rather heavy Thors Hammer pendant I've had for years, and was originally concerned with the durability.  I've got to say I was (and still am) very pleased with this necklace. Highly recommended.
1.0	If you try to hold more than 40 bills in it, the clip bends then is no longer secure for less than 40 bills. It's easier to show in person than describe but that's the best way I can put it.
5.0	The earrings I bought from Amazon were absolutely great!  They arrived about a week before Christmas and, with some clever wrapping, my fiance was extremely pleased.  I highly recommend them!
1.0	These are not green.  At all.  They are cloudy and gross.  I am returning them today.  I highly do not recommend.
5.0	Very nice deep wood finish. I love the neutral color and natural look. The bangles are also very sturdy and smooth. These fit great to, I got some wood bangles in the past that were too big. They are exactly what I wanted and they match the description perfectly. The gun metal gray ones are slightly smaller than the wooden ones which looks nice together to me. Delivery was fast as well. I would buy from this seller in the future.
5.0	The ring is perfect! Beautiful, heavy, and seems like it will last forever. I accidentally ordered the wrong size and the return process was incredibly easy (instructions included in the package) and I expect to receive a new ring at the correct size in just a few short days! Thank you AshMil!
5.0	I had searched for a bracelet to match a necklace I had purchased for my daughter for Christmas. This beautiful Sterling Silver Infinity Black Diamond Accent bracelet is a perfect match.  It came in a beautiful red box designed with accent ribbon.  I can't wait for her to open this beautiful package.
5.0	I am so pleased with my new ring although it is a little uncomfortable to wear.  I'm not used to wearing it all the time It  feels too thick.  But it is very pretty on the finger.
5.0	Well worth the price and well made, very satisfied with purchase, like the chain length, and it really sparkles in the light!
5.0	I actually gasped when I opened the pouch! Yes I saw the pictures on-line here but they don't do this beautiful ring justice.  I am very impressed...the ring is one piece..not a top attached to the base.  The faceted agate and marcasites sparkle like the sun...the marcasites do appear translucent just as stated but the glow  from them is breath-taking. looks like the piece was re-assessed for pricing now...I really feel fortunate to have purchased it at more than 50% off its current price... a classic piece.
5.0	Stones are a little &#34;foggy&#34; but otherwise these are beautiful earrings for a great price.  They are actually better than I expected.
5.0	very high quality. i am surprised how nice it is for how little the cost. the gem is large and looks great on the finger
5.0	I bought this for my wife for our anniversary.<br />The stones are clear, the settings and chain are nice.<br />It was just as described--beautiful.<br />She loved it!
5.0	for the price this is one fantastic chain it looks great and is a little heavier than i thought, but thats ok
5.0	My daughter loves angels and turquoise - what a perfect combo and she wears it with her jeans and boots but most definitely could be used for special occasions.
5.0	I bought this as a gift for my 16 yrs old cousin. It looked great on her petite neck and body frame. It doesn't look too classy nor too cheap, perfect for the teen's gift. And she loves it.
5.0	After having stretched earlobes for years I finally decided to take out the plugs and let my earlobes shrink so I bought these as a little reward for myself, the earrings are cute and just what I expected, the shipping was quick so I'll buy from this seller again.
5.0	Good little earrings for the price.  I bought these to match an expensive blue and gold cameo I bought from Amazon and they do the trick nicely.
5.0	Bought this as a promise ring for my grand daughter.  And she loved it.  The promise is to not have any alcohol before her 21st birthday.
5.0	Just what it looks like in the picture. Luv it.
5.0	Ordered this for my daughter for Christmas and she is going to love it. She loves cats and requested a mood necklace as one of her gifts so it goes perfectly with her style.
5.0	look good with every thing and very real
5.0	I bought this for a coworker. I see her wearing it fairly often. Nice quality piece for a good price.
5.0	Got it before expected delivery time. Great ring looks expensive.
5.0	Fits great, looks great...love it! Thanks. .will purchase again!
5.0	sturdy for price and easy to assembly.
5.0	Its a beautiful necklace. The chain was broken when received but it was an easy fix. For the price I paid it was not a big deal! I'm happy with it all the same!
5.0	This was a gift and she loved it. I liked it so much I almost didn't want to give it away!
5.0	This is really nice. I got one in Toledo, Spain years ago and I saw this one and I fell in love with it. The details are so fine and the gold work is brilliant. There is something special about &#34;damasquinado&#34; jewellry which was stared by the Arabs and Jews of medieval Spain. It is yellow or green gold hammered into black metal. I wore this cross to a fuction this past Friday and it went very well with a tweed grey brazer and a gold lame shirt. This product is top quality !!!
5.0	I love them!!! The Maroon is perfect for my Fightin' Texas Aggies!!!  Next on my list is the necklace to match.
5.0	Fit great and he loved the style. Got in in a good time for being standard shipping.
5.0	Very please with this product.  The earrings are so rich looking, you would never know that they are sterling silver.
5.0	It is very nice and rich looking.  I wear it almost every day.  A great buy.
1.0	Not happy at ALL with this. This the music not isn't darker. its the same color and lightly pressed into the wood. Its really hard to see the music note. also BE VERY CAREFUL you have to order 2. THIS DOES NOT COME AS A PAIR. THE PRICE IS FOR ONE YOU MUST DOUBLE IT. Seriously...I have 2 ears..why would anyone order one? Really?
5.0	Bought for mothers day and my husband's mom loved it. She put it on immediately.
1.0	Cute ring but it gave me 'green finger' after a few weeks - maybe a month later.  Had to throw it away.
5.0	Absolutely love this ring! It is just as described and fits perfect.  I would recommend this seller to everyone, did I mention the fast delivery?!
5.0	I love the fact that it was so cheap but well put together, and made of quality materials. I was very satisfied.
5.0	I didn't know for sure what size I needed so I had to order twice. No problem in returning the first one, great service. And these rings are tough. I work in the natural gas industry and this sees a lot of...well abuse. Can't see any scratches and the design still looks good. Had it for over two months so I'd say it's durable. Great price for great product.
5.0	Very nice earrings. Good quality for the price. They were lovely and exactly what I had expected. I would recommend them to a friend.
5.0	deluxe item. lots of protection for jewelry. Good for storage.
5.0	Beautiful tiny star charm. Perfectly casual on an adult, perfectly sweet for a little girl.
5.0	Love it! A few jewls have fallen out but I was expecting that. A little snug on my wrist but I don't have skinny wrists. Still love this item
5.0	very sophisticated looking
5.0	great little chain for the money : )
5.0	The sterling silver Celtic ring fits perfect..
5.0	This reasonably priced  replica of the Pour Le Merit exceeded my expectations.  I am thankful I found this on Amazon<br />and purchased it for my Red Baron display.
1.0	The cross that I receiveld has very little of the detail that is Exhibited in your presentation. Needless .to say I was very disappointed.
5.0	Just got my ring today and I couldn't be happier it's gorgeous!!!
5.0	My husband bought this for me to wear on days I can't wear a large diamond at work, and I love it. I've never seen I1-2 diamonds this clear and sparkly, not cloudy at all. I don't see any visible inclusions or feathers.They also appear very white. I prefer 10k gold because I feel that it is a stronger alloy and more durable. I've seen similar bands for over $500, and all my coworkers think my husband spent a lot more:) I would recommend this ring to anyone looking for a sparkly, thin band.
5.0	Looks more expensive than it was.
5.0	This is better than the picture online.  The perfect goft for the person that loves angel figures.
5.0	very beautiful and seductive pendant. quality at a very good level. chain is very pleased, but it's better than the one that is on the photo. In the right hands can feel the weight and quality. While only the most amazing experience.
5.0	I bought this for my girlfriend and she never takes it off. I would recomemd this item  for any man to by his better half.
5.0	My son loves his necklace.
1.0	Don't make my same mistake! I got this from Amazon and was stunned with my credit card bill arrived and I saw the cost of shipping.  Other places have free shipping; there's no reason to pay all that extra money just for shipping such a small pendant.    One upside if you do buy from Amazon, though, is that you can put it on your rewards credit card.  Let's just say I now have a LOT of airline miles.
5.0	This bracelet is a special one. I own it myself and have bought several for gifts.  It is very heavy for its size and is made very well made.  There is nothing but good things to say about it!  It is shiny, not too heavy, and very pretty.  I do, however, wish it came in and 8&#34; length, too.  Thank you for such a nice product.
5.0	I chose this charm to place it at the right end of the bracelet and it's the perfect piece  It's not too bulky.  Perfect to end the line in the bracelet.
5.0	my order was here in 2 days , before it was suppose to be here it was what it said it was , i would recommend this site to people and would use it again
5.0	These earrings were a great deal!  Wonderful price and exactly as pictured.  They are very light and comfortable to wear.  I am so happy I purchased them and received complements the very first time I wore them.
5.0	These are quite beautiful and perfect gifts for granddaughters who need to know their Guardian Angels are always with them.
5.0	This was a gift for my husband. He loves the ring and says it even more than  his wedding ring 😁. He's got a lot of compliments on it. If your man is a nerd (like my husband) he will love this. The coloring is very nice not to in your face but not invisible either
1.0	I have ordered a lot of jewelry items through Amazon.com, and I have to say these rings are the cheapest thing I have ever gotten. You can barely see the cz's in the channel settings and the silver has a dulll finish.
5.0	Good quality, same as if I went to the store and bought it. Arrived on time, in a cute box, it also came with the little card that has like the quote on it or wjatever
5.0	Beautiful... Very enchanting.
5.0	The earrings looked to me &#34;dangling&#34; too short at first, but when I put them on, I realized that the stone is exactly where it should be, not too low, not too high !<br />Look expensive .
5.0	This is no small charm!  It's pretty big and has substance to it.  If you are looking for something a little bigger than the others, than this is the necklace you want.  The myth of the Phoenix is very interesting also, which just adds to this charm and necklace.
5.0	This elegant pendant is both attractive and classy. It features a 18-inch sterling silver, a marcasite design that wraps around the garnet-colored tear-dropped shaped glass &#34;gem.&#34; It's definitely a piece of jewelry that will attract attention. It's distinctive looking. The marcasite has a design on it, and the scrolls wrap around the gem so that it can actually be seen through the gem and makes it appear that the gem itself has a design in it. It's a larger piece of jewelry that will stand out, especially against bright colors or white. The marcasite itself has a silver and black color to it. This stunning piece of jewelry will certainly attract attention wherever you wear it.
5.0	Loved it. Very nice quality, light weight and yet works well with the charm I put on it, I needed the charm to lay straight and this chain made it possible. Loved the price, arrived earlier than expected and very pleased with my purchase
5.0	This ring is beautiful! The picture doesn't do it justice. It's size is dead on, and I have gotten so many compliments!
1.0	It was broke and the material is very cheap.  I got what I paid for.
5.0	Very cute and stylish.
5.0	This pendant is so pretty, I might have to order another one just for me! Even thou it doesn't come with a chain, it is beautiful and easy to add to a chain.
5.0	I bought these earrings a couple of weeks ago...    They arrived SO quickly and I was so pleasantly surprised!    I don't think the picture does them justice. The hooks are amazing (and ALSO sterling silver, not just surgical steel) and the butterflies are just perfect.    They are so well-made... excellent workmanship and quality materials.     I thought they'd be a tiny bit smaller, though. My only criticism is that I wish I could have seen a picture of them being worn by a real model.     Other than that, I really love them and wear them all the time!! :o)
1.0	A paper clip is a better quality. The flower looks like a spec a dust
5.0	It's a very nice ring....the band is thick...nice sterling silver and the stones are beautiful.
5.0	My wife loves this bracelet!
5.0	Oxidized beads are just the right size... not too big or heavy.  Looks good at shortened or full length, with or without an enhancer. Highly recommend!!
5.0	Beautiful!  Arrived on time even with a snow storm :-)
5.0	My three year-old picked this out for his mama for Valentine's Day and she really likes it.
5.0	Wear this all the time
5.0	Beautiful snap charm! It has a 3-dimensional quality that looks even better in person.
5.0	People complained it was to small,b ut its really nice fitting and very pretty. I would recomend this product to others.
5.0	I bought this ring as a &#34;gag&#34; gift to include with my daughter's Maypole Queen gift.  The gag was on me.  She LOVED it.  I was so surprised at the quality of this little, extremely inexpensive ring.  It's precious.  Now, the Prom queen wants one to mark her special year!  Great graduation gift for the Prom Queen, Homecoming Queen, etc.  Precious and seems to fit true to size.
5.0	Arrived quickly, in beautiful condition. A great value for the price. Not just for combining with southwestern themed jewelry. Quite classic and clean.
5.0	Absolutely beautiful and so petite! Perfect!
5.0	I bought this and it came a few days later. Packaged extremely well... its beautiful and i love this, would recommend to anyone this will keep me good for years to come!! Thank you guys you did an awesome job!!! :)
5.0	Love these earrings. Great size, sparkly and not flimsy like some other ones I purchased. Recommend.
5.0	Recommend.<br />Pros:<br />Larger than it looks in picture; perfect for a necklace.<br />Rubys have nice rich red color.<br />Cons:<br />None; Wife loved it!
5.0	Just got this in the mail - Only 3-4 days after purchase. As stated in other comments, the chain is very tiny and thin but I think it is sturdy. EXACTLY what I had hoped it would be. The clasp is solid and sightly. The gold is a high shine and a bright gold. This is a super petite chain. If you want someone subtle and classic, this is for you. I am very happy and highly recommend.<br /><br />Note: I shopped around for this necklace for weeks. This is by far the most fair price I found.
5.0	was looking for 11mm pearls because the 8mm are just too small.  amazon's pearl listings can be confusing and full of knockoffs, but  these look great.  there are about 2 or 3 slight inclusions on each pearl, but you have to look real close to see them.  nice lustrous color too.
5.0	This necklace is made fabulously!  I wear every day and at night. It's light weight, attractive and comfortable. This necklace is great dressed up and dressed down. I totally recommend!
5.0	Purchased this as a gift to my daughter!  She loves it and it looks great on her Pandora charm bracelet.
5.0	Love them! Fast shipping!
5.0	She loves it.  Im a hero.
5.0	I bought this for my husband with a message engraved on the inside... we had to have it resized a few times, but they did so in a timely manner and with no problems. He gets compliments daily.. very pleased with this purchase!
5.0	These earrings are a way to have the beauty of sterling without the hassle of tarnish darkening the metal and needing cleaning.  A good price too since I tend to lose earrings all the time.  Less expensive than white gold.
5.0	I bought too big but I will get it resized, my fault, other than that it is extremely gorgeous. I have nothing else to add.
5.0	I received a lot of compliments on this set.  It was exactly what I was looking for.  Really a fun item.  Brings smiles to all those who see it---and quite frankly isn't that's what it's all about?
5.0	This ring is simply stunning! For being a cubic zirconia and plated it is absolutely gorgeous. The cubic zirconia sparkles and shines so perfectly it is sure to be noticed! Whether you need to find a ring in a less expensive side for your significant other or you, yourself want to buy a ring for yourself to act as if you are taken so you are not bothered while out on the town, this ring is perfect. Perfect for a teen to give his significant other without breaking the bank. I have small fingers so I chose a size 5 since that is what my other ring is and it fits just as good. I showed it to my friend and she had no idea it wasn't real. It really is a spectacular piece of jewelry. These are absolutely my very own honest opinions after having received and tried this product for free in exchange for an unbiased and honest review.
5.0	The product was simply everything it was promised to be.  I proposed to my fiance back in november and this box made the night very special.  It gave the ring that extra sparkle and it arrived right on time for me to make my trip with this beautiful box.  I would recommend it to anyone.  It is difinently with the extra money.  It shines just like it does in the display counter.
5.0	This is a very beautiful bracelet. It's better quality then I thought.<br />There is one word to describe this: Perfection<br /><br />Happy Hunger Games, and may the odds be ever in your favor
5.0	Good quality and feel
5.0	I get many compliments on how striking this bracelet is.  Very thick leather, but not too heavy, and a beautiful polish on the metal.  Fits very securely and is easy to buckle and unbuckle.  With the thick leather, though, it's more suited to casual wear or business casual.
5.0	Cute and affordable. Can't wait to get more!
5.0	Present for grand daughter. It was a very sturdy piece at a very good price. The piece has a good weight to it and even nicer then picture.<br />arrived in a very shot time a very good experience will definitely use the seller again. Amazon and its associated stand behind their product so I always buy with confidence
5.0	Great jewelry solid piece bends great the only problem I have it that I wish I would of ordered a smaller gauge because 5/16 was too big for my forward helix. I would send it back for a smaller one but I pieced my ear with it and I know it's not good to touch it too soon next I'll do a segment in 1/4 inches.
5.0	These beautiful earrings were just like the photo. They arrived very quickly. Good quality for the price.
1.0	The quality and look were not what I had anticipated. Very flimsy.  I would not recommend this item
5.0	I get compliments on this ring all the time. It arrived quickly, and is real. I am very sensitive to fake jewelry I get a rash and turn green, this ring has not done that to me. I work at a restaurant so I always have my hands in sanitizer water or something of that sort and its still so pretty.
5.0	I bought this bracelet with my son's name and his birth stone - the moment I got it I put it on and haven't taken it off since.   It is so pretty and it goes with everything.    Also, the delivery was quick and customer service (who you have to contact to give them your personalized info) were very efficient.    Highly recommended.     PS. It probably looks even better if you have more than one child and you get two or three strands together.     But I also like it just the way it is!
5.0	So pretty! Will def order again
5.0	very pretty and shipped very fast, thank you
5.0	Beads are small but pretty and resemble the featured picture.  They are for the most part pastel and I'm sure most of these bracelets vary in their appearance.  It has a rather delicate look, but most of the beads have intricate designs on them. I recommend it.  I actually received this sooner than anticipated.
5.0	Was super happy with it!!
5.0	Classic vintage look that goes well with light or dark shirts. Adds a nice touch without being too large or overstated.
5.0	The ring is a good width, is very shiny, seems durable so far, and the styling is comfortable to wear every day.
5.0	Very pretty birthday present for a 4 year old dance enthusiast.  Appears to be of good quality.
5.0	Beautiful. Very boho chic. Light weight but well made.
5.0	80s baby good quality all I need is some bamboo earrings & a 4 finger ring..love it im gonna buy another 1
5.0	I gave this to my Partner(now my wife) and she loves it!! It is beautiful and is exactly what she wanted!!
5.0	My daughter loves it. Very pretty and blings!
5.0	Looks super expensive, but is quite big for my wrist. I've been wearing it all week. I would defiantly recommend buying this product.
5.0	The product was good, it works easily, was a gift. priced well and it  arrived when it was promised.  Would recommend.
5.0	The necklaces were just what I was looking for.  They are for my granddaughters that will be born in April.  I wanted something as a rememberence of me.
5.0	Got it love it just what I was looking for
1.0	Not happy with the whole package, chain or pendent itself seem to be made cheap. Not worth the cost of it. Would not recommend .
5.0	This ring is great! It is made of a very strong metal and does not scratch easily like white gold. It fits just right and is very comfortable. And for the price, it's a steal!
5.0	I love this ring enhancer and complements my solitaire nicely.  It's even more beautiful in person. It runs a little small. I ordered my size, size 7, and it was too small, so I'm going to return it for a size 8.
1.0	The ring is  good quality but i recommend buying a size down. I measured my old ring to get the correct size which was .5 inches. The ring i bought was not .5 inches in fact, but .6. SO it looks terrible and I have no need for it. Thank you for the s***ty sizing.
5.0	Very beautiful. Only problem was that the bottom ball was kind of hard to screw off and on. Other than that i had no other problems it was very suiting for me and my friends loved it.
5.0	The left top & bottom are piercing I ordered its smaller then the one in the right . The one in the right is the one I've been having its so long and the the one in the left its smaller and better for me since they pierced my belly button very small . I really love this it's heavier then the one I had before and shinier . Took me 8days to get it :) love it!
5.0	I purchased this for my 15 year old neice.  Its pretty and well made and could be worn by any age.
5.0	just bought this product was great I enjoyed it is beautiful here where is well is very doable um can't say enough about it I really love this itemI definitely recommend for my friends.
5.0	Ring fits great ,great product,& my boyfriend loves it! & doesn't feel flimsy & cheap like I thought it would.
5.0	This set is so beautiful. I have to be creative and shorten it some it was very long. BUT I LOVE IT!! I get so many compliments on it. It is so sparkly and pretty!
5.0	Beautiful . My granddaughter is  going to love it. Fast shipping. 5stars
5.0	Love it!!!! Super fast shipping.  Just what I wanted.  I can't wait to wear it on my wedding day as my wedding band.  It looks beautiful with my engagement ring.
1.0	The necklace is beautiful in the picture but it looked very inexpensive (and small) when it arrived in the mail. I returned it promptly for a refund. I was very pleased with the seller's prompt and courteous customer service.
5.0	Smooth transaction, item shipped in a timely manner. Ring is beautiful in person and very comfortable.
1.0	This was NOT the necklace in the picture. It came as a thin silver necklace. No big loops like it shows! Very disappointed.
5.0	I ended up buying this in every color! Perfect gift have had mine for a year now no stones missing !!
5.0	The picture of this product does not do it justice......... It is the CUTIEST bracelet I own!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The colors are beautiful, it fits great..... it is perfect!!!!!!!!
5.0	"I was very pleased with my \\""book\\"" charm.  I am an avid book reader and wanted a charm that would show my love for books.  I liked the charm because it just said \\""book\\"" and could mean any type of reading material.  It fits very well on my Pandora bracelet and looks great!"
5.0	Don't let the gothic/burlesque label throw you off. I bought this to wear on a cruise with a fancy black and silver formal dress. It looked great. I was afraid it would look really cheap when it got here, but. even though it is plastic, it doesn't look it from a distance. For the price a real deal.
5.0	Beautiful!  Just beautiful, even better in person than in the  picture
5.0	I bought this back in dec 2012 and I have no complaints whatsoever. the band width is a bit smaller then stated so go up a size if you want it to match your band width. it beautiful and i still cant believe the price. no complaints! the ring size is also right.
5.0	It was a gift that ended up getting a lot of compliments.
5.0	Is perfect for me, I have a business of earrings and bracelets and it was so helpful to storage all my items in a very beautiful and fashion way. Thank you very much because the product come in perfect conditions and in the time assigned. I will be looking for more products of yours. Again, thank you.
5.0	Beautiful ring. My daughter loved it!
5.0	I lose these all the time so I decided to purchase this 20 Pack. Arrived quickly. Look exactly as described. Tiny. Only down side is the post turns green. I just throw the yucky one away and put in a new one. I would purchases this item again...
5.0	“WOW!!!! You cannot tell this is not real diamonds. Bought it for mother's day and it matches up perfect to real diamond necklace ring and earrings that cost major money. Buy from this company very fast delivery and quicker then expected. A perfect gift and the price is great but not good if the person has a very large fat wrist. Diamonds do not look phony at all just the right size.” A+++ Great job. Usually do not bother to write reviews but this company deserves it
5.0	Nice, even thought smaller than I thought
5.0	The earrings are lovely and pair beautifully with both pearls or diamonds, if you have multiple holes. I have metals allergies and have no problem wearing these for weeks at a time. I purchased both 2mm and 4mm. The 2mm are a bit small for adults; I should have ordered the 3mm for my second holes.
5.0	Very strong magnets. Very light weight. Exceeded my expectations.
5.0	The quality is perfect. I bought this ring 6 month ago and the ring is perfect! I recommend 100% to this seller
5.0	Love, love the earrings and will be buying more in the future.
1.0	I agree with the other reviewers, very cheaply made and not worth the price, even the reduced &#34;lightning buy&#34; price.  Saw them after they'd been given as a gift and was quite embarrassed, they looked like something out of a gumball machine. They arrived in a one inch square of shipping plastic which was setting inside a necklace box (the one with the little envelope in the back and slots for the chain) not even intended for earrings.
5.0	perfect fit looks great and on time.
5.0	I ordered this at a memorial token in memory of my great grandmother, aquamarine was her birthstone. As some reviews say, the stone is very light in color but in certain lighting looks more blue than others. None the less, it is a pretty ring with nice details that is more sentimental for me than for fashion.
5.0	Love it!!!!!!!! So happy with my necklace.<br />This was my first time shopping online, i will do it again for sure.
5.0	Just received my belly button ring and it's just as described. It's very cute and sparkly! I the size is just right! very happy with my purchase!
1.0	Item arrived discolored and was in bad shape. Very disapointed
5.0	As a musician I was enchanted with this unusual product when I first saw it on Amazon. It was a delight to find a treble clef and a musical note in one necklace. I enjoy wearing this necklace, which really sparkles. I would recommend this affordable product.
5.0	I love pearls and this was a perfect complement to my mother in law's pearls on my wedding day.  It is classic and great quality.
5.0	So pretty. She did lose one pretty quickly & we found it a few days later so I put clear rubber backings on them & closed them & they're good.
5.0	I got this bracelet for my hair dresser and she absolutely loved it (just as much as I did!). Such a great price too!
5.0	I noticed a beautiful criss cross ring in a TV commercial last year, it was so classy. I have been looking for a similar one. This is a  perfect piece. I wanted it for the right hand but not big or bulky. This looks and feels smaller in size yet unique and beautiful.<br />Love it!
1.0	It fell apart after wearing it only 2 times.  Keep in mind, it was only a few hours for each wear....  You get what you pay for....
1.0	To small never buy it again not for a man
5.0	It's a perfect size for me and is very sparkly. I was more concerned about having a good diamond as far as cut and clarity than size since I have small hands. This was perfect.
5.0	I like this December Barth stone earing .its very shine and light .I wear almost all the time in this month.
5.0	Love this necklace. Crown is a perfect size.
5.0	I bought these as gifts for young ladies I know in Brazil. They are all into bracelets and seemed to be genuinely pleased with them. I thought they were beautiful and not too expensive. Good choice!!
5.0	No one does &#34;whimsy&#34; like Betsey Johnson!  These earrings are pure, adorable fun!  So detailed & charming, I find the color palette goes with many items in my wardrobe.  Wear these cute giraffes with a black dress & yellow or hot pink shoes for &#34;fashion WOW galore&#34;!!!  They will start conversations, bring admiring glances & best of all make you smile!
5.0	I purchased these cuff links for my dad as a birthday present. And he absolutely loves them! He is a car fanatic. They were a great purchase and I would recommend them to anyone! 5 stars!
1.0	love my peace signit is good quality  very nice
5.0	Great earrings! Got these for my wife for her birthday and she was incredibly happy with them
5.0	THANK YOU. WILL LOOK GREAT WHEN GO TO THE BEACH. JH
5.0	Amazing gift to share with your best friend. Beautiful beading and extraordinary color.
5.0	got for a friend she like emm
5.0	This is very beautiful. Dragonflies have been my whole life and this will be a resting place for my ashes when that day comes. Glad I found this. :)
1.0	The chain that comes with this necklace is very dainty/poorly made, also the &#34;silver plating&#34; is over a very cheap looking metal and after just one or two months of wear the necklace looks terrible.
5.0	This is a pretty bracelet.  Sometimes it looks pink and other times, peach.  I think it depends what you're wearing. either way, it's pretty and is well made.
5.0	Great product for the $ amount.  Good stones and settings for this type piece.  Well made.  Exellant company.  I will come back to these people sometime.
5.0	Just stunning. Fit is about right. Beautiful color stone & not too bulky. Just what I was looking for. Much more stunning up close than on the computer monitor. I highly recommend if you are looking for a blue topaz ring. The silver is polished & stamped with 925 inside the band. Appears to be the real deal. You will not be disappointed.
5.0	I love this ring. Made fantastic. Great price also. SOA BABY. 😎😎
5.0	Just as pictured. Thank you.
5.0	They are a perfect size. Not too big nor too small. I would recommend these. :)<br />It's a good price too! So pretty! ;)
5.0	as with the pink ones and the black ones i got, this one is absolutely gorgeous. shipped fast and packaged well and beautifully too. the price was unbeatable; one cent; who could pass that up??
5.0	Not high quality metal so your ear may stink unless you clean it, but I expected this.<br /><br />Exactly as shown,fits well,stays on, and looks nice.
5.0	Just as pictured.  Perfect colors for what I wanted.  Came quickly as expected from Amazon and its sellers!
5.0	great quality i highly recommend this seller 5 stars
5.0	Love it! Simple yet classy enough to wear to Lynda Carter's Walk of Stars ceremony in Palm Springs last year. She loved it, too!
5.0	Love the gold rope how it shines
5.0	i got all different ones. theyre very cute. only thing is i got one with a pot leaf on it and i have NO interest in marajuana.
5.0	This ring has been in and out of my cart for months...but finally purchased it and I love it!!!
5.0	Exceptionally made and has substatial weight.  Great gift for anyone of Viking decent or a lover of the culture.  I believe it might be made for a man but can be squeezed together to fit a woman's wrist.
5.0	Very light-weight necklace but true to the color shown in the picture. I love this style, it will go great with my wardrobe!
5.0	super cute and solid silver! sits nice on your finger and adjusts to your size. I bought two one for me and one as a gift for my best friend.
1.0	The chain is so thin it's not usable. I had intended to give the necklace as a gift but ended up giving the person something else because of the poor quality chain.
5.0	These are so cute! I am buying myself a pair after purchasing these as a gift. The picture does not do them justice
1.0	Fell apart first time I wore it.  Thank goodness I did not spend a lot or I would have been very upset!
5.0	I'm not really into roses.  I'm more of a tulip kinda girl.  Having said that, I really love this ring.  Something about it called to me. (Strange to say, yes) It reminded me of The Dark Tower Series by Stephen King which I had just finished reading when I bought this.  I still love it to this day!
5.0	Good quality, relatively strong.
1.0	They were so small, I am not sure I will find anything to use them for.  I am disappointed, guess i did not realize<br />they were so small.
5.0	Pleased! Nice! TY! ;)
5.0	Looks authentic & keeps shine 👌
5.0	I ordered the necklace for Christmas for my 9-year-old daughter because it had both of her birthstones. It came in the mail in a timely fashion and is dainty and pretty. Thanks.
5.0	I bought this necklace to go with a gold Cross charm i got for my fiance. It was a perfect birthday gift, he absolutely loves it! I prefer white gold over yellow gold but being that the Cross charm is yellow gold i searched for that color. So when i saw this necklace i couldnt say no to it. Its true to the description and looks even better than the picture. It shines and is the perfect size. It came within two days of ordering which was way sooner than predicted and thats always a plus. I definitely recommend.
5.0	Ditto!!! Classy not trashy!!!
5.0	I love this necklace. Is very dainty but large enough to be noticed. I get lots of compliments every time I wear it. Good quality chain and bar. Good for stacking necklaces as well.
5.0	Another great ring from Gem Avenue.  This ring is heavy but not too much - I have small hands and it looks great and is comfortable.  The quality exceeds what you'd expect from the price.  I've already ordered another, similar band. My daughter keeps taking them when I'm not looking!
5.0	This charm is the perfect size for my Pandora bracelet.  The red is rich in color and it looks gorgeous on my bracelet!! I love the fact that you get two.  I was able to give the other as a gift.  The only thing that I have noticed is that one of the links has started to turn a rust color.  Great purchase!!
5.0	My daughter received these for Christmas and absolutely loves them!
1.0	The plate is not good
5.0	"This was a real stainless steal chain...some of the other products I looked at \\""seemed\\"" to be stainless but would only rust after showering a few times.  No problems with this chain...and it fits perfectly for me.  You won't be disappointed.  Will order from this company again.  Thank you"
5.0	Perfect size and comfort,
5.0	Very pretty, stays shiny and tarnish free.
5.0	My husband and I were shopping for wedding rings on amazon and he saw this and fell in love with it!!!  He has been wearing it since the summer and it still looks new.  I highly recommend this ring.
5.0	Really fun light weight earrings , quite large but I love them
5.0	I was simply amazed at the weight and feel of this ring, I swear it has the quality of any expensive counter part. One happy camper :)
5.0	Authentic Pandora charm!!!
1.0	The reviewer that claimed that these are not 4 gauges was NOT mistaken. I tried using Vaseline to get them in, it didn't work. They're not 4 gauges, they're 2 gauges. Also, I find it more than a bit ominous that the seller enclosed a health warning about lead based products. So apparently, not only do these not fit... but they can also give me lead poisoning???? Yeah, I really wish I hadn't wasted my money on these things.
5.0	I love these pendants they are so beautiful! They pair well with everything because they are not a specific color
5.0	I purchased this bracelet and gave it as a gift.  The individual that received the bracelet likes it a great deal.  Thank you for your great product and services.  You and your site make it easier for busy people like myself to provide awesome gifts at the appropriate times.<br /><br />Thx again!!
5.0	this was a beautiful necklace, and my granddaughter loved it.
5.0	Highly recommended for all looking to WOW a significant other. I got these for my girlfriend for our four year anniversary and she loved them! I've bought her diamond earrings before, but these are by far superior.
5.0	I wanted a slim but somewhat eye-catching ring, and this fits the description! It fits true to size for me. So far, I've worn it everyday for 5 months - all the stones have survived the power of the daily shower + soap, hand AND body lotion, dishwashing detergent, household chores, daily abuse from smacking my hand into things (accidental or purposefully), you name it.. It barely shows the wear and tear that cheap rings usually show. This ring wears and holds up great for me!
5.0	This was a gift for my middle-school aged granddaughter, who wears it to dress up for school events. She is very pleased with it.
1.0	I bought this as a gift on 18th December 2008 and they charged me 64.99. On Dec 19th 2008 the price was 39.99. I wouldnt buy anything from these rip offs again.
5.0	These are very elegamt
5.0	This ring was just what I was looking for.  It has a nice bright shine to it.  The comfort fit makes it really comfortable too.  I bought it to be a wedding ring for when I'm grubbing in the garden.  I would hate to loose my good ring!  It's absolutely perfect!!!
1.0	I got mine in the mail today. It was in pieces and the pieces were even too poor of quality to repair.  Just save your money or find a different seller that might have decent quality.
5.0	Great rings, especially at this price. Excellent communication and super fast shipping.
1.0	There were grooves in it like it had been melted together. Expected a smooth natural surface.
5.0	This ring is beautiful.<br />It feels heavy for its size, is polished to a high gloss, and has delicate, high quality, shallow engraving.  It doesn't look cheesy or cheap at all.<br />it seems to be ever so slightly larger than the size indicated.... but maybe that's just me?<br />All in all, a beautiful ring for the price! i'd gladly buy another.
5.0	Yay...better in person than in the picture, nice shiny gold.
5.0	This is one of the most beautiful crosses I have ever seen in Black Hills Gold! It is so pretty, I am tempted to buy another one just to have in case something ever happened to this one! It is very delicate and finely detailed and very well made. It is about 1 inch long and 3/4 inch wide, my perfect size. Shipping was fast too, even though the seller said it might take a few extra days. If you love Black Hills Gold and love fine detail, I suggest you get one of these while they are still available!!!!
5.0	I loved that the bracelet had three size options because I have small wrists and it was a perfect fit!  I am very happy with the purchase.
5.0	These are great, and I don't have to worry about them falling out or losing them when my hairbrush catches on them (a problem I had with my old hoops)
5.0	Nice quality sterling silver ring with yellow gold accent. It was the right size and scale for my hand. Pretty classy looking cultured pearl ring!
5.0	I got a size 5 and it's a wee bit loose, but not hard to wear at all. It's comfortable and shiny and not easily scraped. People really like it! I got my boyfriend one similar.
1.0	When I bought this belly ring I thought it was super cute and that I would love to wear it but after it came in the mail I wore it for two days when gems started to fall off and then the whole charm fell off.
5.0	Took a chance and bought a few necklaces from this seller, including this one, as Christmas presents. I am very impressed! They all look great!! The pictures provided do not do justice. At this $6.49 price (and free prime shipping), it's a steal!
5.0	My husband loves his wedding ring. This is heavy weight and really masculine looking! It is a wide width, so it looks great on my husbands hand.
5.0	I love this ring and so does everyone else!  It was shipped to me fast and arrived in perfect condition.  I would recomend, to anyone who keeps viewing it, just take the leap and order it!
5.0	My last nose stud fell out the other night, and I couldn't very well just pick it up and put it back in as it fell into the toilet. I know, right?! So I needed something in a pinch before my nose hole closed up. This was perfect. It was here in two days and was surprisingly good quality. As a matter of fact, it was better quality than the one I had in previously that cost me more than this one did. It also sits flat against your nose and doesn't stick out like most do.<br /><br />Overall, great price, great quality, fast shipping! And it's the perfect size as well!
5.0	Strong band  it's sweet
5.0	"I bought this on a daily special for less than $50.00.  The diamonds have a lot more sparkle than I had expected for the price. Very good value, and my \\""band geek\\"" daughter loves it."
5.0	These are amazing, I ALWAYS loose the ones that come with my single flaired plugs and its wayyyyyyy easier to get new o-rings than new plugs and these work perfectly!!!
5.0	This necklace is very nice, it is not childish. Its is very petite and feminine. Crafted very well there is no sharp edges on it. The stones were in place and it looked just like what I ordered.
5.0	My girlfriend loved it, so delicate and simple but beautiful
5.0	The starter kit arrived in the mail super quick -- and I love it!  A guide to stretching your lobes and a size chart is included in addition to the tapers and plugs.
1.0	These earring are junk. Only have had them for about a week and lost 2 stones and one of them won't stay hooked. The matching necklace isn't much better.
1.0	"3/8\\"" wearable size is 10mm.  A 5/8\\"" Gauge plug/tunnel is 16mm.  The description is misleading."
1.0	I didn't put them on as soon as I got them, but after a couple of weeks my ear turned green.... not good quality metal.
5.0	My daughter just LOVES these earrings!  They are exactly what I was looking for.  Will definitely be buying more in the future!
5.0	Great size and quality!  Removes tarnish extremely well!
5.0	Great service great products.
5.0	Great Product ! Thank you .
5.0	Great packaging great product
1.0	I would be better if the mental part would be out of stainless steel. They are cute.
5.0	I got me and my little brother this he and I love the we where them when we play the game
5.0	These rings are beautiful and come nicely packaged in a ring box inside a small gift box. Perfect for gift giving. I would advise, though, to check your ring size carefully. The comfort fit makes it fit differently than a regular band of this width. I think I could have easily gone down a half size.
5.0	I'm sure upside &#34;real&#34; beads, these might not seem as impressive, but I'm very pleased with them. The selection I got was really nice, with several rhinestone, 2 hanging charms, several glass beads, and several plain silver beads. I will be buying some clear coat spray paint to go over them &#34;just in case&#34; since they are only silver plated, if that. They look very nice on my bracelet and they all coordinated well. Shipping was EXTREMELY fast. Came in a padded envelope with some packing peanuts so they didn't shift too much. Shipped the same day I ordered and got here in 2 days!
5.0	MY ABSOLUTE FAVORITE NECKLACE!!!! I ALWAYS AM WEARING IT! IF UR INTO THAT HAWAIIN LOOK BUY THIS!
5.0	this ring i think could fool anyone. I have so many compliments when I wear it and the gals that want it<br /><br />Price  - - -GREAT, Shipping FAST and when you put the ring on it melts your heart.<br /><br />So VERY,VERY Satisfied
5.0	Bought this for my fiance to wear when he takes a trip in a few months. He's a good sport -- so hopefully tramps will leave my man alone when he travels.
1.0	I never got them. Still waiting and still haven't got them. I have no clue what's taking a long time but I don't have them yet .
5.0	"If your looking for shock value this is it. A little over the top for every day but I quess it depends on the gym you go to. Lol. Actually very nice quality and fits me perfectly so it literally looks like you \\""were\\"" screwed. If anything the finish is s bit too shiny."
5.0	Loved it.  Exactly what I wanted.
5.0	The beads were smaller than expected.  The plus was there was no red string holding it all together.  The brown elastic cord used actually accented the stones themselves.  I can wrap this around my wrist 4 times and it safely in place. I use this piece to help me remember to look on the bright side of things.  The different colors of this necklace are both beautiful and striking. In reference to its size I will say this, these beads are not 6mm beads.  The package itself doesn't mention the size.  It leaves me to guess it's probably 4mm. Without the red string holding it all together, it is a discrete piece of functional jewelry.
5.0	These religious cards are beautiful.  They look like I would<br />imagine the manger scene look like.  Would recommend.
5.0	The necklace set are just beautiful and I look forward to giving it as a gift next Christmas.  I was impressed with the seller because she made good immediately when it arrived with one earring broken.  I have the new earring now.
5.0	These are exactly what I was looking for in earrings, as I prefer the smaller size, plus the different colors.
5.0	This was a very very nice chain on my first order so I order me another one for my self
5.0	The product is great, ,my ears stretchiness..not so much
5.0	Wow is an understatement for this ring. My husband put it on and I was in a[...] It has the most amazing shine and glisten to it. Not too flashy but says a lot when you see it. Stunning.
5.0	I got my M charm today and I absolutely love it! It goes perfectly with my other charms on my necklace and it was just what I wanted! The personal letter with the packaging was cute. I will definitely purchase from you all again!
5.0	Perfect for my application.  I didn't want anything too expensive.
1.0	Given as Christmas gift. One earring broken. Pin that goes in ear not connected to main part. Other earring has bent pin.
5.0	I've been wanting this for forever and finally got one ordered. It looks just as pictured. I love it!
5.0	Beautiful ring and beautiful engraving, I just might have to get another. :)
5.0	good ring my daughter like it
5.0	Item was exactly as advertised.  It was a charm for my daughter's birthday.  Item was received prior to date promised which was also a plus.  My daughter is happy with her gift and so am I.
5.0	Received many positive comments.
5.0	I got much more than I expected. The picture does not capture the true beauty of this ring.Words cannot describe the colors and the quality is wonderful. Thank you so much
5.0	Very nice ! Good quality good price.
1.0	Wasn't as nice as it looked in the picture. Poor quality
5.0	The low price, the beautiful ring,but how about the 4C of diamend?
5.0	Very nice for the price !
5.0	These pins work great when I want to make longer earrings .Was so happy to get them .
5.0	Beautiful ring. I'm not exactly sure what to say other than I love this ring!  The ring is massive at 12mm wide, but it is so beautiful and comfortable to wear, I wear it on my right hand everyday and rarely take it off.
5.0	granddaughter loved it
5.0	Very cute charms, though when I ordered one of the charm .... girl with the ruby stone for July, which is what I wanted...it came with a yellow stone. 😞  The charms are a gift for my daughters. Locket necklaces. They are very happy.
5.0	This is an adorable ring at a decent price. It's large, so it makes a statement, and it has just enough bling to add pop to any outfit. Thanks again! I bought this in pink as well.
1.0	I thought they would look good with my new hair do. The earrings looked cheap. No I would not recommend these earrings.
1.0	The finish of all pugster jewelery products wear's off in a matter of weeks.  The cheap cost reflects the lack of quality of the product.  Do not buy.
1.0	Awful, I pierced my monroe myself and have never had a problem with a self-done piercing before but it took me a while to take the gem out the the plastic peice because i thought it would break if i used to much force. Now my piercing is really irritated because the gem is too small and keeps sliding through my lip, I cant remove it without feeling like im going to rip my face because of the difficult jewlery. The only reason i would rate it anything other than 0 is because its a cute little gem and perfect size for my face. Anyway do not recommend. Get a screw on ball lebret jewlery.
5.0	I had ordered two rings identical one larger size the other one smaller and I myself thoroughly love the ring that I got and so does my mother they are beautiful they fit perfectly and their well-made thank you for caring this product
5.0	THIS IS GREAT  FOR KIDS! im returning it because i ordered for an adult when it i liked it but just not for me!
5.0	I absolutely love this bracelet.  Not only does it remind me of an inspiring and empowering message every time I read it or hear the jingles of the charms, it's beautiful.  Disney Couture Jewelry is designed for adults and this bracelet is one of my favorite pieces from their entire collection.
5.0	These are the most beautiful gauges ever!!! Hubby hasn't worn anything else since getting these and they really look great on him! High quality, very durable and were shipped quickly :)
5.0	Purchased for my bridesmaids. They loved the bracelet so did I!
5.0	I love these earrings, they are exactly size and what I wanted. The quality is good, they are not flimsy or look cheaply made. They're nice and shiny not dull looking at all. Some people have stated that they are to heavy for them but they're fine for me. They're not a hollowed out circle like some hoop earrings are, these have a flat surface.
5.0	I looked at this ring for about a year before I bought it. I love it! I always get compliments on it! I am definitely happy with this ring!
5.0	I love this necklace. It is well made and looks nice on. I was not disappointed in the appearance or color of the stones; however, they are a little lighter than they appear on my monitor. I do wish the clasp were just a little larger; but, it's not so small that I need help getting it on or off. I receive lots of compliments every time I wear this piece. I consider this a great value for the cost.
5.0	Love them lots and wear now and then ~ Next time, I will go for the larger size and get the backs from Honora
5.0	I love this ring. I saw a different ring design in a magazine but it was the same brand as this one and looked it up on Amazon adn you save so much money for the same quality ring as in the magazine. The magazine said the listing had that other ring listed as $100....here you spend way less for the same quality of work and I love it and highly recommend it
1.0	Smaller then what it looks lick  on page.<br />The balls don't fit tight lick they should .<br />Should have gotten them at a  store.
5.0	I bought this pendant for twice what it is selling for now and I thought it was worth the price then.  This picture does not do the pendant justice; it is much nicer in person.  It has 3 different colors of amber stones and goes with many earth tones outfits ranging from greens and yellows to oranges and reds.  I am buying another one to give as a gift -- especially since the price is even better now.
5.0	Exactly as described.  Very nice ring.
1.0	Guage is too short. Would like to exchange for a longer gauge
5.0	beautiful ring excellent quality
5.0	I loved these earrings!! I talk past tense because I lost a wing yesterday. :( So this will be purchased again. Time was accurate.
5.0	I was nicely surprised when the keys arrived at how nice they are!  They are not too big and have a solid feel to them.  Great value for the money!  Got one for each family member and can't wait for them to see it!
5.0	I was so nervous ordering jewelry online, but couldn't find anything in the stores that fit the budget and style. This is a great bracelet! Fits around my wrist perfectly! Sturdy, the crystals are clear and smooth. Will not catch on my wedding dress. Sparkles like crazy! I do not regret this purchase and will be wearing it to my wedding. :-)
5.0	Nice looking necklaces that lay well without twisting. Customer support is top notch, and I'd order from them again.
5.0	Very cute. Thinking oh getting a tattoo with the anyersum survivor ribbon.
5.0	Not too heavy, but not paper thin either. Just the right amount of weight so I know that I'm wearing the them. I kinda expected them to be smaller, but I ended up liking its size which is about an 1 and half inch so consider that. Other that that I'm very pleased with this purchased!
1.0	I got this same exact ring in November for $30 and it is amazing. I barely take it off lol. This one is extremely overpriced.
5.0	I am very happy with my St.  Anthony medal.It is better than I expected. A fine quality of medal
1.0	The picture is very deceiving, and nowhere does it say that the item is larger in the picture! It is so small. I hate it!
5.0	Very pretty n looks great . Any mom would luv this necklase.  The message is so sweet n if it turns around no big dael looks good on both sides
5.0	My husband surprised me with the Texas A&M Aggies Collegiate Bead and it fit my Pandora bracelet perfectly. It is stamped 925 to indicate that it is Sterling Silver. The bead is high quality and I am very pleased with it. I plan to purchase another bead to give to my little sister for Christmas.
5.0	This ring looks delicate but it is well-made and correctly sized. It is difficult to find size 4 rings, but this is just perfect as a &#34;pinkie&#34; ring.
1.0	Didn't break right away like I though! But it rusted in less the. 3 days
5.0	Ring is beautiful & can easily be believed as real. The diamond is not over the top and gaudy. I wear in replacement of my wedding ring because my real one needs to be adjusted. Why pay the money to size my real one when I can change and wear such a beautiful ring and not worry about damage to it.
1.0	The medal is very beautiful, but the blue paint began to rub off within several weeks. Then,  I had a hard time removing the rest of the blue paint without scratching up the medal.
5.0	I have had this bracelet for about a month. I get so many comments. Everyone wants to know where I got it.
5.0	i thought it was beautifully done and i gave it to my daughter for christmas and she loved it very much. everyone who has seen it thinks it is really a beautiful necklace
5.0	very pretty and fits perfectly!
5.0	I love this necklace. I'very alway's wanted one and now I own one.
5.0	I get so many compliments on this necklace! It fits me so well! I love it! Very cute and stylish!
5.0	I love this ring!  it fits perfectly and arrived only a couple of days after I ordered it.  I would definitely by a ring from this company again.
5.0	This is my 8 month olds favorite toy!  She loves putting the toys in the basket and dumping them out over and over again!  She loves the rattle sound as well!
5.0	I bought a set of Fridgigears for each of my nephews for Christmas. They are ages 2 and 3 and both thoroughly enjoy this product! Plus it keeps them busy while their moms are cooking so it's a gift for mom too!
5.0	My 2-year-old loves cards! I get new ones once in a while. These are really good for such a low price.
5.0	They are what you expect....just toys, but they are decent toys for the price.  They are a bit hard to close so that is a bit frustrating for kids 9 and 11, but we were not surprised about that as we read the reviews.  Kids are happy with them.  It seems that you have a choice of &#34;harder to close&#34; or won't stay open most of the time.....so we are happy.
5.0	This doll was very beautiful and way better than the Monster High dolls in my opinion as well as my child's.
5.0	These are great! We purchased them for an under the sea party and were delighted to see each one has little tags hat can be used to hang them from the ceiling. We also plan to use them in the pool in the summer. They are great sizes, perfect for fun although scientifically inaccurate!! A bigger shark would just be scary though!!
5.0	Beautiful doll and quick delivery!
5.0	My daughter loves this!
5.0	purchased for my grandson (age 3)... my son (age 15) and husband (age 54) all love it--- a guy thing, I suppose
1.0	Looks MUCH nicer online. The base and globe look and feel extremely cheap and the globe splits in half. The levitation is very cool but the product itself is cheap.<br /><br />Returning.
5.0	Loved this advent calendar...and so did our 2 1/2 year old.  She looked forward to opening it every day!  Each day had a square you can open with a Christmas story picture and a Bible verse printed on the inside flap.  It is simple, sweet, and meaningful...and a great value!  We will be making this an annual tradition in our home!
5.0	I decide to buy this tea set per the reviews on the website. The desision is right and my two-year-old niece likes her birthday gift very much. The size is just for her, and she can play this with other children and adults. She can also dance to the music.
5.0	This game arrived at an appropriate time.  It is like mad libs for adults, and potentially offensive to everyone.  You can sit around all night not even concerned about score.... we did.
5.0	Grand Son loved & put it together in record time!
5.0	Xmas gift for 5y/o. He has learned so much already. Very happy mommy!
5.0	Gift for my 4 year old (obsessed with legos and ninja turtles) this matches the &#34;shell raiser&#34; toy that we also got for his birthday. This was a great addition.
5.0	This is a great item for the age of the child we ordered it for, and he enjoyed receiving it.  Delivery was great.  Thank you.
5.0	My local hobby shop used to stock these. These gliders fly great. It's not clear in the description but the wing folds in half for launch. After you launch it straight up with the included launcher, the wing springs open and starts gliding. Be prepared to walk! With a little adjustment, you can have them circle or fly straight.
5.0	One of the best transformers I have bought holds together very well looks exactly like the movie megatron  its also cool that he talks and makes sounds with gun very cool  flip out sword on his arm I kinda don't like that he is bigger than the fallen in vehicle mode you can see his head wich is kinda bad very good scale with leader optimus prime almost same size but megatron is just a little bit bigger but not that much very good toy.
5.0	Works great to control a shutter for a DLP-based SLA 3D printer that I am building.
5.0	Facially the silver haired Ken more closely resembles Bill Clinton than Rex Harrison. The tweed suit is very well made and I could only wish that they would have included the signature cardigan. I appreciate that the doll is fully articulated and poseable.
5.0	Perfect touch to the 1/10 scaled world.
5.0	Lovely pages. The black backing gives a fantastic framing effect to the stamp edges. User was delighted they didn't have to use those stamp hinge things. The multiple hole punches are also fantastic as many stamp collecting binders have the unusual two-ring style.
5.0	Awesome add on but shop around.  We got it for nine bucks at t r u via e bay.  I love how there is a little tank that pops up for the creature to rest in.  This and the Shellington set are the best.
5.0	The puzzle was selected for my mother who has dementia.  The pieces were big enough for her to find easier and they were very colorful and well made.
5.0	my twin three year olds really enjoy these toys. they came in their easter basket this year. good quality. good sound.
5.0	I got great cards! Enough to make a deck for each flag they gave me. I love the graphics of the cards! I recommend all card players to try this booster box because it gives you better cards then then starter deck I think. Also, if you need the rules for the game go to Buddyfight's website. Then, you'll be all set to go!
5.0	my daughter loved it everything cam in there was alot of rubberbands and she still making braclets today
5.0	we all love this bunny. super soft and the perfect size
5.0	Cuter than the larger Philbin.
5.0	Always a classic.  Great toy to interact with the younger set.  Not only did this toy bring back fond memories, but listening to my little nephew bust out laughing when my boxer popped his to was priceless.  Sometimes the classics are the best!
5.0	As expected. Kids loved it.
1.0	Title says pretty much everything, this figure is about 7 inches tall, it comes with several face expressions, comes also with several pairs of hands, an extra naked body and other accessories (weapons, helmet, etc) I guess my biggest problem is the design, the body has terrible articulation, you can also see screws on her wrists for example which look cheap and ugly.<br /><br />The shoulder articulation is by far the worst I've ever seen in a female figure of his kind. Her whole body comes apart easily which makes it hard to pose.<br /><br />The only thing I liked was the design of the several faces she comes with. Way over price also for the cheap poor quality plastic she is made of. I've seen kayodo figures with similar design, size, accessories, etc going for 25 dollars. Just because this a &#34;limited release of Sayaka Yumi&#34; doesn't mean they had to rip off the very few core fans Mazinger Z has outside of Japan
5.0	I bought my daughter a kit at Walmart for Christmas and didn't realize there was a difference in looms.  The one that i got does not come apart so she was limited in some of the creations she could do.  Since I am &#34;in the know&#34; now I got her the loom that started the trend.
1.0	It basically does nothing, huge waste of money. You're paying for the name only. Way too expensive for how simple it is.
5.0	I purchased these to be used in a launcher that is mounted in a paintball PAV (paintball armoured vehicle). They worked great. I am pretty sure that not even John Elway could throw them as far as we can with our air cannon. 125 yards.
5.0	fantastic for my maddy girl!
5.0	This guy is totaly awesome. I always liked prowl even the one on that new gay ass show transformers animated but this prowl out dose them all. he`s put together very well incredibly defined. it`s just like the real prowl. and I for one am imprest.
5.0	This game is fun but I know it will be even more fun once we've played it a few times. You kinda need to get to know the people so you don't have to read about them every time. Really fun tho:)
5.0	These batteries are a must have for the Hubsan X4. Each battery lasts about 6-7 minutes. I bought these along with the 4 in 1 charger to be sure I always have spares on hand. I have 8 batteries total - you can never have enough! Great price and they charge quickly and work like a charm!
5.0	If you are looking to add some complexity to your game, leaders will do that. Any strategy you employ can be improved by the leaders. Some leaders simply add mechanical changes to base rules that change it up or possibly aid your playing style. Even better, this expansion makes viable some strategies that could not be used before to win, such as winning with money.
5.0	Item was as described & my God son likes it alot
5.0	Great family game and a great way to spend time together. Nice to have found it at a good price.
5.0	I put this on the back side of my bathroom door. I use it to store my hairdryer, flat iron, lotions, and all sorts of things. Works perfect for extra storage for small spaces!
1.0	Was a gift and broke within a few days after Christmas .  The problem was that it fell apart when he used it.
5.0	Its rainbows and unicorns for crying out loud...loves it.
5.0	These stamps are beautiful! The pictures are clear with vibrant color. The stamps feature well known legends like Annie Oakley, Buffalo Bill, Wild Bill Hickok, and Sacagawea.They arrived quickly and were in excellent condition.
5.0	I love the doll.  Very fast transaction.  Thanks!
5.0	I fly large hexacopter, 16lbs and up.  I wasn't expecting much for 35 bucks but this thing is great and super stable right out of the box.  The flips are cool and can be done in all 4 directions.  I gave two to my brother in-laws for xmas and i got one for myself, we had so much fun flying indoors and outside.  They never flew anything RC before, so there were some crashes (hard ones) and this thing took it all and never broke, amazing!  Comes with spare props, i'd recommend getting spare batteries.  It flew for about 6-8 minutes but the battery can take up to 30 min to charge, so get extras to keep the fun going.  I'd recommend this to newbies and pros, tons of fun and the Bee body looks great too!
5.0	Good price for the quality. Great game to play. Others made of plywood. Neighbors love to play as do we.
5.0	Beautiful puzzle. I couldn't stop building. Pieces are plastic so they stay together.
5.0	"I have to admit that I thought this \\""snap together\\"" model would... well, 'snap together' a lot easier than it did. I quickly found that this model needed to be treated as a regular glue-type kit, and its age bracket should probably be more like 13+ (level 2).  Like some of the other reviews here, I'm an adult and I had to trim some of the components to fit, but if you approach this kit as a regular glue-type model, you'll be able to relax and enjoy it. it took me about three hours to paint and put together. Once its all together, it looks great! I love having it on display.     PROS: Inxpensive for the quality of the kit; very easy assembly instructions; Scooby and Shaggy figurines are exact relicas of the cartoons and come prepainted in the correct colors and tones; very colorful pieces and the decals have a 'cloth-like' feel; fun because it is a little challenging to assemble.    CONS: BE CAREFUL - the decals tear easily if you don't take your time removing them from the paper; I had to use an X-Acto blade to cut down the figurine's pegs (on their bottoms) so that they would fit into the seat of the van (I also had to use model glue to permanently fix them in place); I had to completely paint the spare tire, the wheel hubcaps, the parking and tail lights, and the roof racks (but I paint all my models anyway for a more authentic appearance).    FINAL THOUGHTS: Not recommended for children unless there are adults around who enjoy putting models together. It takes patience and a little experience for a nice job. Not intended to be used as a toy, but probably best to be placed on display."
1.0	I got this because I thought it was the same as one my girlfriend had that was really nice. The price certainly made me think it was going to be higher quality. The holes are drilled in such a way that the marbles sit too close together making it difficult to make any moves. I was having trouble and I have only met one fully grown person in my life who has smaller hands than me (size 4 rings are still a little loose on me if that gives you any idea..) My boyfriend has big club fingers so he played the whole game using the pliers on his Leatherman to pick up the marbles. Wish we could enjoy it more without such hassle.
5.0	I teach elementary music in grades 1 through 5, and am constantly looking for new ways to introduce musical concepts to the kids.  Along came &quot;Bop It&quot; and rhythm became something more than black and white notes on a page!  The students loved it! <br />Then along comes &quot;Bop It Extreme&quot; and it blew me away.  &quot;Extreme is a real test of musical pulse as well as ear to hand coordination.  But, beat it all, it is a great time!<br />I have two daughters, 7 and 3, and they both love it.  The three year old doesn't get discouraged with losing like the rest of us.  She has a great time dancing to the beat!  <br />5 very fun stars!!!
5.0	Exactly what i expected!
5.0	"This was a fun addition to my six year old's Christmas surplus.  She loves it and it went up immidiately in her room.  She has now slept under a fort for the past three nights in a sleeping bag, in her bedroom.  It's super cute and very easy to set up.  It offers lots of options as to set up and she is enjoying, remaking her \\""tent\\"" in other areas of the house.  She is now adament that we invite over someone else because she has to share the fort with someone else because it's just too \\""cool\\""."
5.0	Son loves it, no issues with it.
5.0	My 4 year old son loves this toy.  He has had it for several months and go back to playing with it often.  My 8 year old daughter has figured out that if she lays out the magnets flat in a formation, she can create 3-d shapes by pulling it up from a particular piece.  We constantly have children over for play dates and they all gravitate to this toy.
5.0	Grandson just loves the Rescue Bots.  Easy to use.
5.0	Among the Stars is a 2-4 player space station building game. You build your space station by choosing a card from your hand, paying the cost, and placing it in front of you. Each player pays the cost of the card and resolves the points for their card simultaneously. Cost is paid in two forms: monies and energy cubes. Your cards are then passed to the next player, and you receive the hand of cards from another player next to you. This &#34;card drafting&#34; is similar to 7 Wonders. You'll place 6 cards in a round, or &#34;year&#34;. You'll play 4 years and then total your score. While most points are scored as a card is played there are two other way to score points: delayed location scoring and objectives. Delayed locations have a yellow shading and score points at the end of the game. For example, score one point for each red military location you've built. Or, score five points if this location is the furthest from your main reactor. Objectives are face up and allow you to score an additional amount of points if you are the only player to complete the objective. Such as, have the most diplomatic locations or have the most delayed scoring locations.<br /><br />PROS:<br />Alien Powers- Each player gets an unique alien race where they get a special power. Immediately after playing we wanted to try the other powers. They offer a unique style of game play.<br />Components- The art is awesome and the clear energy cubes are a nice touch.<br />Ease of Play- The game is easy to teach, goes quickly with little down time, and feels like you built your own personal space station at the end.<br /><br />CONS:<br />Limited Interaction – You'll need to make choices on what cards you give to other players. You'll look around and compete for objectives with other players. But, sometimes you just can't stop an opponent from building an optimal location. Conflict cards can be introduced to improve this.<br />Building Up- The locations are shuffled together so the cards you get in year 4 are not necessarily more powerful then the cards in year 1. You are not building up to anything.<br /><br />Overall: I find this a great light weight tactical game that can be easily introduced to a wide audience of gamers. I've played it with 2,4, and 6(with the expansions). Each time it has been a hit. 2-4 players is best since when you pass your cards you will eventually get your original hand back. Six players felt crowded. You really feel like you are building a space station and it matters where you put locations! The locations points also match their name well which makes the theme stand out! This game is great fun! I find it to have less complexity than Suburbia. I put it at the same complexity as a Settlers of Catan or Lords of Waterdeep.<br /><br />Note: After getting the expansions, my love for this game has grown. There are more interactive locations and more depth and complexity added with Ambassadors. This game is a must own!year 4 are not necessarily more powerful then the cards in year 1.

5.0	Very soft, very cute.  My Winie-the Pooh loving grandchild loves him!
1.0	It is a very cheap piece of junk.  Super light weight, soft & mushy feeling.  Several of the colored panels fell off the cube as I took it out of the box.  I tried to glue the panels on because they fell off every time I turned the cube.  DO NOT BUY THIS, you will be disappointed.  One of the worst cubes I have ever bought.  I have already ordered a replacement from a different reputable website.  I will throw this away when the new cube arrives.  The bright side:  At least I only wasted $6.
5.0	Son wanted aliens for some reason and found this bag. Only wanted one, but it was priced right. Ended up buying them as a 'surprise' for good behavior and handed some out at Halloween - were a hit!
5.0	These are beautiful colored small blocks. They are easy to grasp and easy to grasp for very small hands. A nice assortment.
1.0	This is the OLDER version of HOP's Ninja, there is now a V4 and the price when buying directly from the folks in New Zealand is about 25.00 dollars cheaper.  So, why would you pay 25.00 more for an older version??  Yeah, my thoughts exactly.
5.0	I've selected this item for experiments. When I've got it, I revealed more options for exepriments that it was described on teh site. So, I was surprised! Very good and inetersting item. I'd recommend this item to pupils and teachers.
1.0	My 1-year loved this toy - but easily popped the top right off and shoved one of the plastic pieces right in his mouth that I had to dig out. This toy poses a serious choking hazard. The sounds of this thing also annoyed the crap out of my husband who was rejoicing when I finally tossed it in the trash.
5.0	a gift for a family member. She will love the chef mouse.
5.0	Bought this as a Christmas present for my nephew, and he absolutely loved it!  Easy to add the handle and change the wheel positions.  Great buy!
5.0	the product is great, i highly recomend it. dosent take much time at all to set up, and its really fun.
5.0	A handy item upon which to redirect your frustrations, rather than strangling the idiot you work with/for, give this handy ball a good squeeze or 50, plus it is good for your grip strength.<br /><br />These squeeze balls come in black and orange I can almost always find the orange one the black one sometimes is a bit more elusive.<br /><br />Works for me, your frustration levels may vary.
5.0	Wonderful set of blocks.. immediately loved by all four Grandchildren (ages 1-8)... I will likely order another set for my house... They are great to encourage creative play.
5.0	Great priced boys toy :-)
1.0	fell apart first time used it was not worth the price we paid
5.0	colorfully life like .
5.0	I bought this as a Christmas gift and was happy with the quality. A lot of sets are very cheap and the kids don't even like them; this one is heavy-duty rubber, most pieces are solid, so you don't get the cracking and crumpling most cheap plastic sets end up with after being stepped on, &#34;cooked&#34; with, and chewed on. The kids (1, 3, 4, and 5) all enjoyed playing with it!
5.0	Girls say next generation of Beanies
5.0	My granddaughters love this, especially when they dry them off and put them back in the bag. It gets played with in and out of the tub which is always good to see.
5.0	I already own this game. I've bought this as a Christmas present for someone else (I like it that much!). Awesome game for all ages. Aspects of game play are a bit like Yahtzee but with added elements of winning victory points while keeping your big monster alive and accumulating currency to buy special abilities. Would highly recommend the Panda Power Up expansion set. Adds a whole other level of awesomeness.
5.0	Nice... My cousing enjoy all the time with this... Now she have a place for her toys jajaja
5.0	My daughter loves her Webkinz.  She's 8 yrs old and loves playing with them on webkinz.com  And Brown Dog is her new favorite.
1.0	These just barely can fit a noodle.
1.0	I can't even give this product one star.<br /><br />There is NO PROVISION for mounting HO track across this bridge.<br />Atlas bridges include the track and design their bridges with hold downs for the track.<br /><br />Was very disappointed to find that this Walther's bridge doesn't do the same.  No way to run a train across it.<br /><br />........NCB
5.0	Right out of the box, I read the instructions, put in the 6 AA batteries, charged the copter, and was delighted with the first flight. Some of the other reviewers were very helpful in their suggestions to trim the copter with the dial provided to avoid spin when controls are neutral and to SLOWLY move the controls. Also useful was the advice to rest the copter battery before charging--a fact mentioned in the detailed spec, but not the instruction paper. I have a 2 1/2 story open area aboved my living and dining room that makes indoor flight fun and interesting. A big plus is the excellent LED lights on the copter--I like to fly in subdued light to let the running lights stand out. I like to simulate landing on a helecopter pad by landing on tables--good test of your 3D judgement and control sensitivity. The copter has taken minor bumps into walls, furniture, and railings well with no damage. The controls are so precise and sensitive that I'd not recommend this for children less than 10 or so. I did fly it outdoors, and it works,  but very minor breezes and its short control range make it impractical.
5.0	Daughter loved the toy
5.0	Great game! It requires a lot of strategy and you have to play with friends that are ready to get into it. You have to be prepared to take some time to really understand how game play works, but once you get it you will be hooked! Super fun, and I recommend to anyone who likes to be absorbed by the game. Definitely not for kids, this game is not like Candy Land or Monopoly.
5.0	grandson loves this little hero. He has played with it alot. Its sturdy and stays together once its put together which was fun for him to do.
5.0	This is a great  finishing product for a dollhouse.  I rated it low on fun and educational value as that is not its purpose.  It was packed well and shipped quickly.  I will be purchasing more.
5.0	Is exactly what it says it is
5.0	I wear a size 14 and many brands don't make this size that fits me good. Not so with OluKai! These are by far the best sandals I have ever owned.
1.0	I don't like that on the picture it has such a big panda and when you really get it it is small
5.0	This reasonably priced package of foam swords had provided hours of entertainment for my grandkids and their friends!  They've held up really well to the rigors of backyard swordfights. The kids love these!
1.0	Was very excited to receive this product only to be very disappointed.  Took a while to assemble.  Clown fish's valve was broken so it did not stay inflated.  Shark looked good, but the tail to make it move did not work well.<br /><br />Not very happy with product.
1.0	Not what I expected, my grandson wasn't happy, won't be buying anymore on line, pay to much for something that was original very disappointed.
5.0	The kids enjoyed them....
5.0	Toy is as expected. My kids play with it almost every day since they both love playing with the play kitchen. They are able to unvelcro and velcro the pizza slices. The burger is fun to play with - it has two layers - the beef and lettuce. The other thing is supposed to be a hot dog, but it looks more like a pastry with some whipped cream on top. They rarely play with that one, but I mainly bought this set for the pizza, so we're happy.
1.0	Didn't work straight from the box. Wish I could get my money back. False advertisement. Got my son's excitement/hopes up, and totally didn't even work the way it was advertised to. WASTE OF MONEY!!
5.0	I am very satisfied with this product.  IT is extremely easy to install and runs very quiet with good power.  The only mistake I made was not making sure all the water was out of the pump when winterizing it.  The water froze and broke parts in the pump.  I was able to buy the replacement parts without a problem directly from the dealer who sold it and they shipped me the new parts in two days.  This product is well worth the price.   Go to the store and spend double the money for a pump and filter that does the same as this will do.
5.0	What's not to like? I bought them to stick on random things around the office and make people laugh. It works! The different sizes are perfect for humanizing a wide range of otherwise lifeless appliances.<br /><br />The adhesive backing is strong (enough for googly eyes), and the paper backing is relatively easy to remove. If you are looking for a way to spice up the office atmosphere, these will do the trick
5.0	This coaster set is quite a comittment to build, but this is right up our 13-year-old's alley.  This is actually our second Knex coaster set.  Fun to put together, and fun to play with.  Our sons also have fun modifying the track plan and building other things.
5.0	I'm very content with this figure. Iron man looks amazing like a trophy on my book shelf. Even though i give it 5 stars i have to warn  you this statue can easily be knocked off its base. It needs to be kept away from anyone bumping into it. Other than that this statue is a must buy, enjoy.
5.0	great item, love it easily...wish they made more toys in this type of brand. maybe a little bigger and wider.
1.0	Broke open in the first 2 hours - messy gel all over!!!  Do not purchase this unless you need a mess to clean up!
5.0	This is a schoolgirl. I mentioned in a previous review that she fit in with my schoolgirl collection, but that review didn't make it past the censors. Why not? It is very much a figure of a schoolgirl.<br /><br />Figure is OK.
5.0	well, i don't know about you guys but i happen to like this doll... ALOT!!!! she is so beautiful! something about this chicka stood out to me more than the other girlz did. i wouldn't have picked neon green hair for a dark skinned doll, but on the other hand it actually looks very cool and stylish, and the purple lipstick pulls it all together(she kinda remindz me of grace jones who waz a major 80's fashion icon back in the day). i also like the fuchsia dress shes wearing, but it sucks that it's the only one she has, but oh well. i think shes more for display more than play so i wouldnt give her to anyone under 11 (in my opinion)
1.0	Bought this for my 10 year old and it just does not work, no instructions, no help line. Waste of money.
5.0	This toy was such a fun gift.  It has held up well so far and is just darling. It came fast and was in great condition.
5.0	I ordered a bunch of these to be party favors for my son's last birthday.  They were a hit with everyone from his 3 yr old 'girlfriend' to her 12 yr old brothers.  And (at least on my kid) they last a LONG time!  Even thru baths, sunscreen and swimming!
5.0	It's a slinky. It is matte black. It goes down the stairs by itself. What is cooler than that?
5.0	This is a great little bag for my daughters play time. It fits her doc toys and she carries it everywhere when she puts on her play doctor clothes. It is great to store all of the little pieces to her doctor kit.
5.0	I bought this for my niece and she loves it. The dog is bigger that I expected and is very cuddly and well made. I'm happy with my purchase.
5.0	Super cute. My daughter loves them. good buy.
5.0	It's very cute after fluffing it up a bit (from the packaging), but this isn't a problem. She loves it!
5.0	Our Daughter LOVES Liv Dolls! They are so STYLISH & made well! This one is her FAV!!! They have hair you will envy! You may wish you had their clothes too! The interchangeable earrings are an added bonus!
5.0	nice bright blue color
5.0	A cutie toy for your little gal!  They do love these cuddly toys!
5.0	Very durable and great solid wooden bridge.  It withstands my 2 year old being rough with it and he enjoys playing with it as it is sturdy.
5.0	love it , neat pitcure.
5.0	"I concur with the explanation given in this product listing about this Dancing Zombie's true to the game characteristics.  The sideburns are really cool and so is the guitar. This looks like michael jackson the most because of that red suit like in the game.  Although with the sideburns and guitar it could be elvis lol. I like the quality of the suit not any loose threads. Came with Tag which was good for me gifting this to someone. Some so called \\""expert\\"" friend of my child's did not even have this toy so my son was gitty to show this to his friend."
5.0	These were perfect to decorate the table at my daughters first birthday but too small to give to the kids. My one year old got most of the duck in her mouth as she is teething back molars. Adorable decoration but only party favors for older children.
5.0	Can I give these SIX stars??  THEY WERE AWESOME!!  They were the hit of my son's five year-old dinosaur-themed birthday party.  I used them as decorations for the party with clusters of three helium balloons on weights scattered on all of the tables, like centerpieces.  I bought two packs of these dinosaurs, inflated them for the party (use a bicycle tire pump!  They each take a LOT of air), then sent one home with each child as an additional party favor.  The kids LOVED them.  Each one seemed to know what to do...walked in and &#34;claimed&#34; one right away.  They were the perfect size...not too big, not too tiny.  They did have a little &#34;episode&#34; where they started to &#34;roar&#34; with each of their dinosaurs, which then broke into a momentary (contained) &#34;pillow fight&#34; with the dinosaurs, but then it was food and cake time so everyone settled down.  And the blow-ups were still very much intact.  We had one which sprung a small slow air-leak during the party, but that was it.  Each package came with one &#34;patch&#34;, too, which is nice.  Would definitely buy again, and would recommend.  If I could, I'd upload a picture to show how great they looked, but I'm not seeing an option for that...I loved these THAT MUCH!  They were both decorative and provided entertainment.
5.0	I love this original munchkin game. I've played it several times with friends, and finally decided to buy it for myself. Also nice is that the box fits nicely in luggage so it's easy to carry around if you're travelling.
5.0	This is very sturdy and excellent for growing babies. Although my daughter is not yet ready to play with this but she will love it in few months.
1.0	I've nearly dumped the kids out of this thing no less than 15 times.  I've rented the most beat to hell, nasty wagons from Zoos, Amusement parks and ones I've pulled off the curb and they all blow this one out of the water.  I have my original Radio Flyer with the wooden removable sides that's over 20 years old - It's rusted, rotted and one wrong look at it from falling apart, but I would use that before I take this thing out.    Bottom line is if you want to turn, you need an exit ramp length distance and have to start about 1/4mi from it, otherwise the wheels bind up and you'll dump the kids out.  The wheels on this thing sink into everything.
1.0	Don't waste your money.  Complete junk.
5.0	thsi cube it's a real nice becouse is very smoth  in the first turn than you ,i  love it .
5.0	This little chopper rules.  After removing the landing gear, the tail boom support struts and all the plastic from the boom, it will fly for 8-9 minutes on one charge and it moves forward with authority.  Anything faster would be useless in a house unless you have a really giant room.  It is so stable it defies logic and it is so easy to fly it lends itself to anyone who wants to fly whether they have rc experience or not.  It is also indestructible.  I have crashed it countless times.  My dog even snatched it out of the air and it survived after the props popped him in the nose.  He was fine and so was the chopper.  ust buy this and enjoy cruising around your living room.  The only down side is no outdoor flying while the sun is up, or if there is any wind.  Also, if you fly over a light or near a window during the day, the infra red will cause your heli to become unresponsive.  I think they may offer another model that is just like this but with 2.4 ghz.  That would be the ideal indoor chopper.
5.0	Very loud and well made! Nice color that grand the baby's attention!
5.0	"We've had this doll house for 4 years or so.  It is very durable, point proven once my 3 year old discovered it.  And despite it's compact concept, there is a lot of room inside to play with dolls. It has handles for easy carrying; we take it to the grandparents' often, with minimal effort.  The furniture (not included) fits nicely inside when folded.  Our house came completely unpainted, which at first was a detraction for our kids.  But I decided to decorate it, using my daughters' guidance as to what they wanted on and in it.  I used felt \\""petals\\"" overlapping on the roof for shingles, mixing up the colors.  I painted it pink (this one already comes pink!), and trimmed it with ribbon, gems, crochet flowers.  Inside, I made mini throw rugs from old socks, and trimmed them with ribbon.  Fun printed cardstock for wallpaper.  Tulle for the window curtains.  Now my daughters (ages 6,3 and 1 years) loves their house. Ours currently houses miniature My Little Ponies and the mini Lalaloopsies.  I think that the concept of these houses being really simple is great, supposing the kids can imagine whatever they want for it.  But kids love color, and if you use their imagination mixed with your elbow grease, this house can become one of their favorite playthings."
5.0	These coloring books have to be the best purchase I've made as a mom. I originally purchased the Water Wow! Fairy Tales book for my two year old daughter, and HAD to purchase more. I've spent so much money on the Color Wonder line only for my daughter to lose the markers or the caps within a day. These books have a little compartment built into the cover to securely hold the &#34;Magic&#34; water marker, insuring you won't have a toddler meltdown when she wants to color but can't find any markers. I keep the other 3 markers in a drawer just in case she does misplace one. There are four pages per book. Each page is similar to those you'd find in a board book and very durable. You can visibly see the outline of some of the animals/objects, but there are also some in the background that only appear with water. My daughter is always so proud of her artwork, and I don't have to feel guilty about having to save every little scribble she draws because they just dry up and she can re-scribble later. Depending on the amount of water your child uses and the duration of exposure to air, these pages dry up fairly quickly. Sometimes my kiddo goes buckwild, so I just wipe the color board down a little so it will dry faster. One of these books will run you less than one Color Wonder book and will last you a lifetime.
5.0	Grandchildren love it.
5.0	I had no idea i had such a need for steeds.  And now that i have such steeds, i have even more need!  Oh me, oh my.
1.0	This came with missing parts so we couldn't even put it  Together.  Big rip off.  Do not buy !!
5.0	So good, Amazing, Stupendious, Hilarious, Crazy, Ludacris, need I go on? There are really word requirements? This is really stupid.
5.0	My grandsons thinks this baseball pitcher is the best present he has ever received!  Once we got it set up, he was able to run it himself and is having a great time at batting practice. Although the pitcher is made for kids, my husband has had almost as much fun as the kids!  It is a great product to get them both off the couch and out in the front yard doing something physical together!
5.0	Very cute and my granddaughter loves them..
1.0	The marker hardly worked.
5.0	SO much fun!!!  We have had a great time with this expansion.  I was told it was the most fun Catan expansion, and it certainly is a blast.<br />I've only played 3-player games so far and I recommend increasing the number of victory points needed to win, otherwise you don't even get to use the ships on some larger maps.
5.0	My nephews loved playing with these in and out of the tub! I probably should have ordered two since they fight over who gets which animal!
5.0	fun game for my 9yr old son and huge angry bird  fan..
1.0	Apparently my sister did not do her homework on this as several of the reviews have the same issue.  She bought this for my daughter (3 years old) for Christmas.  Within two weeks, the DVD player was not working correctly and now it does not work at all.  It tells me that there is no disc or unknown disc in player.  I even went as far as to buy her a brand new DVD thinking all of her's were scratched and it was no help.  Even if I can get it fixed or receive a new one, I am sure it will be more of a headache than it is worth.  I do not recommend this product to anyone!  IT IS HORRIBLE!
1.0	This game clock (I bought two) is very user-unfriendly, but you don't have to worry about that, because they don't work for long.  I bought new batteries for each after some of the digital display characters started not to show up.  It wasn't the batteries, so I pressed the reset button in the back.  Now barely any of the characters show up on the display, making them illegible.  Now I'm the proud owner of two unusable game clocks that I tried to save money on.  Oh well....made in China, I guess I deserve it.
5.0	Perfect fit! My granddaughter loves the outfit!
5.0	While the box definitely is bigger, it's not actually blacker. But I can forgive that little lie as Cards Against Humanity is the best game out there. The small box-themed expansion that comes with this is also worth the cost.
5.0	My grand daughter loved them. She did all of the packs in one day. And we bought five different ones
1.0	I bought this for my Son.  I didn't know at the time that it was an actual model that required to be put together and painted.  This was a huge mistake. The model came as a bunch of white plastic pieces that requires to be cut free, trimmed, sanded,glued, painted.  I've own two of these models now. the first one had short spots in the plastic and broke.  With my son crying about the broken ship I had to run to town to buy another model. The second model wasn't that much better.  Some of the longer pieces were warped in both kits.  Which made parts of the ship not line up.  I did manage to get the second one together, but it's nothing worth looking at.  This was a huge mistake and if it wasn't for my son I would have just thrown it in the trash.
1.0	This sucks I had it for one day and now it doesn't even work
5.0	We love it.  They are very well made and brings hours of fun for my boys.
5.0	This hard to find fantastic game is one that has been in our family since this edition has been out!  I had to keep lending it out to my son.  Now he has his own!  It's made us both happy!  The game arrived in great condition as stated on the website.  Thank you so much for the honesty you have described in your remarks!  I will be happy to purchase again on your site for future items!!!
5.0	These hangers and shoes are just what I wanted.  I knit doll clothes and use these to accent my wardrobes.
5.0	This is a sturdy  and delightful reinvention of the old metal slinkies from the 60's. It's about three times the diameter of the early model.
5.0	We bought this for our 5-year-old son, who is a little shorter than boys his age, and it fits perfect! I have washed it a few times throwing the cape, belt, and main costume in the washer with other laundry and have air dried it.    There were many long strings that didn't get cut after sewed, so you may need to get your scissors out.    He wears it every other day and loves it!
5.0	Really cute and detailed.
5.0	Sturdy, comes with a lot of tool accessories and even sound-making pieces. We have 2 yr old twin boys who love this, and have not been able to break it yet :) our 5 yr old daughter also loves it . Seems to be very age-versatile. Great buy!
5.0	This is very well made--it takes constant use and abuse!!  It is actually pretty cute and it works just as  intended---batteries last pretty long, and the car really goes fast!  Everyone has fun with this car---kids AND adults!
1.0	Worst beyblade if all time. Doesn't work. It is supposed to be launched on its side like a wheel, which doesn't work either. Poor thing, it just sits there while we play with all the other blades.
5.0	i love this accessory, very nice upgrade, great seller.
5.0	Nice assortment for kids prizes.
5.0	cute toy, nephew loves it
5.0	Purchased this for my fiancé and I to play together, and it is great. Good quality materials, and the magnetic lid is nice to help prevent spills and losing pieces as a result. Not used to the board not having any color on it to help with quicker counting, but that's only a minor thing.
1.0	Was very excited to use the Flush kit after two days of diving. This is exactly what I need to thoroughly rinse the i3 mechanism to assure there isn't salt build up on it. Even though the title of the items is &#34;Scuba Choice Scuba Diving 14&#34; BCD BC Flush Wash Hose for Aqua Lung, Seaquest, Aeris, Oceanic&#34; it did not fit my Aqualung Axiom i3 BCD. VERY DISAPPOINTED
5.0	Absolutely love the set.
5.0	Purchased for granddaughter almost 3 years ago.  Now family has twins and this table and chairs is set up in their kitchen and gets daily use.  Very sturdy and well made product.  The chairs have been tipped over multiple times and still no sign of a crack.  Would recommend this highly.
5.0	I have been getting these miniatures for my 5 year old nephew and he LOVES them. Product was shipped quickly and the price was great. I highly recommend this seller.
5.0	All right, I recommend.
5.0	Very ingenious trick.  A little expensive, but extremely effective.  Is exactly like the demo videos on youtube.
5.0	I bought these dice because I was starting to run a D&D campaign. I already had a few sets, but a DM can always use more dice, especially in cases where your players forget to bring their own or when your higher level characters start asking for 8d6 to deal damage. Honestly, it is just useful to have a few extra dice around and this was a great deal.
1.0	I would have liked it more if Bandai did not use the Zaku model type from early 2000's...
5.0	This Keffiya is premium quality hand made out of cotton.  it is classic in design and features a nice dragon print design.    I like how multi functional these are.  I can wear it in the cold to keep me warm, and wear it in the heat to keep me cool.  A great trick I learned from an Arabic friend of mine: putting a cold wet cloth or 8 to 12 ice cubes in a small plastic bag wrapped in a small dry towel, then put the cold article in the back of the Keffiya right on the back of your neck.  You can easily wrap it to stay in place and its a great trick to regulating your body temperature in searing heat.      I havent had them for long, but this Keffiya and the Skull Pile Keffiya black/white are both made of quality fabric and in traditional Keffiya fashion.  Delivered on time even though payment was initially delayed.    I love my new Keffiya, i'm sure you will to!!
5.0	Daughter loves it. Took me about three hrs to put together. Good directions and assembly scheme. Sturdy enough for my liking.
5.0	My 11yr old stepson loves it. He says it's a great set
5.0	I've had this for several weeks now.  It is good for indoors and great for low wind outdoors.  This one takes some time to get used to.  Do your research on how to fly.  If you are experienced then it shouldn't be a problem.  There are a few adjustments you can do for indoors to tame it down a little.  Transmitter has two modes to reduce the response for indoor use and full response for outdoor.  I will be ordering more for more fun.  Spare parts can be ordered all over the internet so don't worry about breaking anything.  I have crashed it many times and it seems to take a lot of abuse.  Get extra batteries.  The charger will charge 2 batteries at once, which is nice.  I really enjoy this heli.  My next one will be a CP (collective pitch) heli so this is a good starter.  When taking off I do the following, start the blades moving as slow as possible, then bump it up to about 2 feet and hold it there.  It will pitch to the left at take off so be ready.  If you set it on a table with the left of the heli facing the edge it will slip off and you can start hovering immediately.  Lots of fun.
5.0	This figure of Antonio Cesaro is great very nicely done. Looks great with all my other figures. Great figure for fans highly recommend it.
5.0	its so big!! and i like it!!  i really don`t like some small Mahjong!! so this size is perfect!! uh!  i like it so much!
5.0	I had purchased this for my daughter and based on her feedback I bought this for my friends daughter's birthday and she liked it too.
5.0	Looked great, loved the way they looked on my display.
5.0	My son loves this toy! He started learning his ABC's at only 15mths by singing with this toy. This is also a fun toy for the car. It has a volume control which is always a plus!
5.0	Great addition to any lego collectors .... collection!!!  Nice variation of plate sizes.
5.0	Grandson looked spooky just like he wanted.  Went trick or treating feeling scary as ever.  Even scared his little broher.
5.0	Bought this cheetah print balloon along with the zebra and giraffe print for my son's safari themed birthday party. Good quality. Looked great! Would recommend!!
5.0	who wouldnt want cable to be in their collection. he is one of the best figures out there. the amount of weapons; 1 spear, massive handgun and the ever iconic rifle is simply the best. great paint apps sculpt and articulation. a must get figure.
5.0	These are wonderful little toys. My grandchildren range in age from 9 months to 7 years and they ALL play with Weebles. Weebles seem to fit perfectly in little hands.  They are sturdy and have a unique look that the children enjoy.  I have given the children the house, a merry-go-round, the playground and two cars, along with several figures. Their imagination takes over and they play for hours. My only problem with Weebles is that they have become very difficult to find and very expensive. Their prices have skyrocketed since I bought the first set two years ago.
5.0	Purchased as a gift and was very well received.
5.0	If your child likes blues room, they will love these gender neutral party plates. Great size for cake and icecream.
5.0	Exactly as described.
5.0	My daughter had been asking for modeling wax for ages , finally found some.  Great product!  Lots and lots of colors!  Great quality! My kids love it!  Highly recommend
5.0	I bought 3 heli's for the kids and 2 sets of replacement parts. One bag had more things in it than the other, but both had replacement blades and fins (which was what I was after) so far I have not had to use anything, but have them ready for when I do
5.0	We got this pack of Kinetic Sand to add to our girl's preexisting set. This product is so much fun. It keeps my child engaged for a decent amount of time, which is quite the feat. She never sits down to do anything for more than 2 minutes. Even as the parent I can't help but want to play with it myself. Its got an interesting movement and texture about it. It will form in the molds as if it were like wet sand at the beach, but also moves in such a way unlike sand when held and pulled apart. The sand has proven to be easy to clean up just like they claim and absolutely entertaining. I would suggest this product to anyone looking for a fun and exciting new toy to try with your children.
5.0	My son is five and absolutely loves this toy. It comes with about a dozen or so blocks and a little man, but the John Deere truck is so cool, and he can load and unload his mega blocks in the back and fit the guy up front. He is in heaven and loves to build things. Even though he puts together harder legos he loves these!
5.0	Amazing product highly recommend for young children. This is going to children who are fighting cancer. Thank you
5.0	This is a great puzzle for the batman fan. It is exactly as pictured. The pieces fit together perfectly and don't seem too loose like other puzzles out there. There is a lot going on in this picture and that makes it a fun challenge.
1.0	Seams like this board must work for some people but not for me, when I plug it in I see only a blank screen, I bought the usb tool to reflash it but the web site is very confusing it looks like I have installed the file but darned if I can get it to open. from what I am reading on the internet I am not the only one with these troubles. concidering the time I have put into building my first multi copter this is pretty disapointing and frustrating. Nothing just a blank screen. Oh well I guess I am only out $18 I will not be buying one of these again. Back to square one. customer support for this board is pretty much non existant BTW you tube how to vid.s from hobby king are 5 years old.
5.0	These work well as small tokens or gifts for those getting engaged and using your park for celebration or for asking for the hand in matrimony. I am sure most will use these for wedding day table favors though. Bubbles are very small and not meant to make much.
5.0	These bags worked well.  No problems and still had a few left over after the party.  I would order again if we can find other wrestlers besides Punk!
5.0	Amazing product for those who don't get offended easily.
5.0	"[[VIDEOID:744a393aa91870b90bf58854c38757b7]]My son LOVES his new ostrich ball hopper. This is his 3rd waliki toy. He started with Benny the Bull, a necessity for any mom of a toddler, and then graduated to the kangaroo hopper and now the ostrich. I can't decide between the kangaroo and the ostrich which one I like better; they're both adorable.<br /><br />This is the perfect size for my 41\\"" tall 3 year old. These balls are very durable. As you will see in my video review I had the kids demonstrate them on our street with no issues.  This is a good thing because little boys are tough on their toys.<br /><br />When you get these, the ball and the ostrich and the pump are all wrapped separately.  You pump up the ball 3/4 full and then you put the ostrich on and finish filling it up (all while an excited 3 year old is jumping up and down) and that's it.<br /><br />These are super cute, hours of fun, good exercise and best of all they don't plug in or require batteries. My giant 3 year old couldn't be happier with his new ostrich. (There's a sentence you don't hear everyday) :-)<br /><br />I received this complimentary product for my honest and unbiased review."
5.0	It's a great set of beautiful beach houses. We play and build stuff all the time using the set. Nothing is bad with this product — all is good!
5.0	Great for entertaining my 2.5 year old at home, on the go (at restaurants, when traveling, etc).  Fantastic! I will definitely purchase more of these.  This would also make a great gift!
5.0	My 7th tenyo disney puzzle.
5.0	I like LEGO sets, and I've recently started really enjoying the &#34;CREATOR&#34; line of kits.<br /><br />I bought the Forest Animals set with all intentions of building the monkey, which is the main model in the set.<br /><br />The CREATOR sets come with instructions for all three of the models that are included, so if you wanted to build the bear or the...squirrel??...you would be able to.<br /><br />I chose the monkey, and that model comes with the toucan and a banana for the monkey to hold onto.<br /><br />The instructions were easy to follow and clear, which is generally the case with LEGO sets.  You start by building the toucan, which goes together and has moving wings, tail, and feet that pivot.  It's actually a really cool little kit that I could see being sold by itself in one of the small plastic bags that LEGO sells.<br /><br />After that, you move onto the monkey itself.  Again, instructions are incredibly easy to follow and very clear.  When finished, you have a kit that has almost as much articulation and movement as an action figure!!!  The tail moves in several locations, including the spot that it hooks to the body.  The head turns from side to side.  The jaw opens and closes.  The ears move.  The eyebrows are fully poseable, tilt and up and down.  The arms move at the shoulders, the legs move at the hips.  The feet have toes that are movable, and the hands have fingers that are moveable.  It's very cool!!!<br /><br />The banana is built last, and is designed in a way that it can hook to the monkey's hand to make it look like it is carrying the banana.  It's a nice touch on the overall set.<br /><br />I found the set to be fun to build, and the end result is a really cool model that will look great in any collection, and also function well as a toy!!<br /><br />Highly recommended.
1.0	I ordered this Loving Family Kid's Bedroom set as a Christmas present for my Niece.  They shipped a different room set and now my Niece has to exchange it.  Very disappointed that the item ordered was not the item shipped to my Niece!
5.0	The best gift ever for members of my book club.  Everybody thought it was beyond clever.  One member said, &#34;It makes me want to go home and cut my finger, just so I can use one of these.&#34;  (She didn't.)  It was certainly the conversation piece of the evening.
5.0	These marvel universe Hasbro figures are top notch to begin with. These two-packs tend to have a different paint job than their single packaged counterparts. This series is mostly for collectors and not to be abused usually, but these juggernaut and colossus figures can handle a little rough play I think. I mean, I'm not gonna throw um' atta wall or something. The toys are tottly sweet. What can I say? Articulation is awesome. Highly poseable. Hasbro Hasbro Hasbro
5.0	super cute! My niece didn't want to take it off!
1.0	I have received this item on time, but missing the 8 x 10 water color markers. I was not able to give this as gift.<br />Mrs. Junko Karasuda
5.0	gotta press the plugs in hard and pull them out hard but other than that these batterys are great
5.0	all the grandchildren like these sidewalk stencil. the parents . . . . I don't know!!!!!!  I didn't ask them!!!!!!  very colorful pictures on the driveway.  easy to use.  daughter in law told me 2 people have stopped to ask where we got them.
5.0	Received quickly.  Very cute!  My little niece and nephew will love them!
5.0	just like shoots and ladders. best for young kids.
5.0	Can't express how cool these are...much better than the wire rimmed guaze wings that break and rip so quick.  Wish I would have found these 5 years ago...would have saved me some money!
5.0	exactly as described.
5.0	awesome. my grandkids just adore legos!
5.0	This is  a beautiful toy box for my baby's room. I had not trouble putting it together myself without any help from my husband!  The hinges were so easy to install and work like a charm.<br />Thank you!
5.0	This was purchased as a gift for a 7-year old and I thought it was an adorable set, sturdy and will certainly last for years to come!
5.0	The metal hooks work much better than the plastic.  The hooks grabs better than plastic.
5.0	I bought this Inchworm for my Grandson,I asked him to help me review it,he said that he has no complaints what so ever and highly recommends it,he has a collection of nano bugs,and the price on this was a lot less than we could find else where.  mickey k
5.0	Great for speech therapy. I use it on a daily basis with the kids. Good price and they last a long time
5.0	It was fun to drape this over and decorate our entire house. The rubber spiders are the best I ever saw, much better then all the cheap plastic spiders. I also liked the assortment of the creep cloth colors, It was a big hit with the grandchildren. Overall very happy!
5.0	This right here is a very good gun.It has a very good fire rate up to about 3 bullets per second for me it shot up to 70 feet.And so I got the 18 dart clips and got 144 darts in it wow it was fun!But the bad part was that it took me about 10 minutes to pick up all the bullets.
5.0	These are great for toddler hands!  If I had a complaint, some of the colors (mainly pink and yellow) appear very light unless a lot of pressure is applied which is difficult for a 2-year old.  These are great because they can't roll off the table.  Also, the tray they come in is wedged so each crayon fits nicely in its own little spot which can be a fun &#34;arranging&#34; game in itself for little ones.
5.0	Great and very funny game
5.0	very fun!  my daughter loved her bird!
5.0	My little grandson (5) had a blast with this new set of Spiderman reels. He loved them! My only other comment is that it was nearly impossible to tear the package open. This is one of those products where &#34;frustration-free&#34; packaging would have been helpful. Have a pair of scissors handy.
5.0	My granddaughter loves this car and it was her introduction to the Lalaloopsy dolls. She's 2 1/2 and this product seems appropriate for her.
5.0	cute and durable. Our grandchild loved it. Great for pool, kicking, bouncing, throwing . . well you get the idea.
5.0	This was a gift for a 1 year old on his birthday. The family loved it
5.0	Hubby loved it since he's a geologist. He actually took it out of the package the day I gave it to him, and played with it. That's saying a lot.
5.0	The designs on these dice are great! The d20 has a cog wheel instead of the number 20! Gave these as a gift and they roll great. I'm totally going to buy one for myself too.
5.0	He loves these! However now he won't take them out of the package because they are Tenchi Muyo merchandise and he wants to keep them in mint condition lol
1.0	Very poorly constructed even if it was only $30. The first one worked for only a few minutes then would not power on. I also had the pleasure of dealing with the crappy customer service people not one but twice because the second one we got made a continuous horrible screeching as soon as we trieed to put batteries in it. My son's birthday present is sitting in the spare room waiting for us to get one that works. Happy birthday right! Little Tikes may lose business from us in the future because of this and the hassle we have had to deal with.
5.0	This is the chalk you would expect. Lots of colors, kids love them. Great on sidewalk and washes away in the rain
5.0	This is a great build...looks awesome and is a great addition to any collection!!  Would totally recommend to anyone who like Star Wars or legos
5.0	My grandson loved it and had it together in no time at all but he is fast. It is one of the few he wants to keep together. Usually he quote blows them up.
5.0	to be honest this is not a review, but when my 4 year old gran daughter opened this gift she was so excited she hugged the package and then ran to the Santa doll on the hearth and kissed him . So if it makes my girl that happy its worth 5 stars .
5.0	So much fabric! It worked out well for my purposes. If you like creepy Halloween, go for it! It makes for good wall cover to add effect in an otherwise plain, non-scary room.
5.0	Definitely love this. I was a bit skeptical at first, but now that I have it, it's with me at all times. Works perfect for putting it on a bag or sash, as well as clothing.
5.0	I was a little worried with ordering a stuffed animal online, but am glad I did. Its super cute & very soft, comparible to the Animal Alley ones at Toys R Us.
5.0	My grandson loved them and your delivery service was excellent!
5.0	Got these for my sons birthday. He loves these!!!! Great learning toy
5.0	my estimated delivery date was on Dec 17 2014 and it arrived 20 days before<br />it helps me with my kids math problems i love it!!!
1.0	Only flew for a few minutes at first. After less than ten flights batteries weakened to the point where it won't even lift off on a full charge. Neat toy but should last more than a day.
5.0	Funniest raft ever!!! Great strong material.
5.0	Great toy box for a lil princesses room, a lil small but expected from reviews & dimensions given
5.0	Very nice assortment of vehicles.
5.0	Tween boy had lots of laughs sporting this on his birthday.
5.0	Love trivia and taking a long family vacation this year, so this will come in handy durign the long drive.
1.0	"We bought and watched about 10 dvd's on it and then it just stopped working. The dvd player just won't play dvd's anymore. Only had it a couple of weeks. It says \\""Loading' But never plays dvd."
1.0	I've had this for two months and now it won't work anymore. Was my son's favorite toy. Such a shame I spent so much money for it to break so easily.
5.0	these get the job done nicely.  They are sharp so be careful when you open the package. They seem to be built well.
5.0	Used these for birthday party goodie bags - there were a big hit!
1.0	these are tiny. the real &#34;original&#34; max blaster is 3 times this big and available elsewhere for less.
1.0	This helicopter was not worth the money. It comes with a cheap remote control and the electronics are substandard. I was very dissatisfied and disappointed when it arrived
5.0	"When we first got this play centre, our baby was 7 months old. She was not particularly interested in it, at least no more so than in any of her other toys. Since she has started standing with support, she absolutely ADORES it! It is the toy she goes to most often and it keeps her entertained for long periods of time (\\""long\\"" relative to her attention span). She loves the laptop, piano, phone, and story pages. She's 9 months old now, and is always holding herself up on the play centre to play.<br /><br />As other reviewers have commented, it's not particularly sturdy due to being lightweight, so we don't let her stand using it for support unless she is closely supervised. Also, although she never slammed her fingers in the laptop, we were worried she may due to other reviewer comments. So, we stuck some small felt pads to it, and voila, no more potential danger of squishing little fingers.<br /><br />All that said, this play centre is a must have for our baby!"
5.0	Exactly what i wanted
5.0	I looked around and there seemed several manufacturers that this is resold under.  I liked the color of the bag and it looked sturdier, so I went with this one.  I was really happy with the purchase.  Balls are nice weight and good quality.  Bag is pretty solid, although I saved the box so that it can generally be stored in that (inside the bag of course) to keep it in nice shape.  Highly recommend
5.0	Purchased this kit from Anana Gifts. Case is sturdy with no broken pieces or wear after more than 2 months of continuous use by a 6 year old. It comes with us everywhere - from the hospital to the pool and gets compliments everywhere. The bands that came in the case are great quality! They are strong and beautifully colored with excellent primary colors and great shades of purples and pinks. We could not be happier!
1.0	Very poor quality.  The hat closure in the back is cheap plastic.  The inside of the has has frayed edges that aren't even sewn all the way.  Not returning it because of the cost to ship it back.  The bandana is fine; just thin.  The whistle doesn't sound right.  Don't waste your money!!!!
5.0	Item was exactly as described.  Very happy.
5.0	This was exactly what I expected - good quality playing cards and great service. I will order again when the need arises.
5.0	Thought he was forced to wear his cape all the time, but with some research, I learned that he actually has a nicely sculpted, detailed body underneath. Being the only figure out so far to truly represent Halo 5 chief, I had to pick him up. I was not disappointed at all. Love the 'holding Cortana's chip hand.' Great figure!
5.0	I purchased this tractor for my Sunday School class of 2 and 3 year olds.  They love it.  It was easy to put together and seems very sturdy.  We are doing a farm themed program and this fits right in.
5.0	Our grandson loves this and his parents are able to control the speed and direction with the their handle bars.
5.0	I got this for my 5-year old as a Christmas present. She loved playing with it, and I liked it too because it doesn't need any glue, and looks sturdy. Even after my daughter finished decorating all the bangles, she could still play with the leftover gems, sticking them to pieces of papers and so forth. It is a great and inexpensive item!
5.0	Great stress reliever
1.0	Do not buy, they work but it is  constantly static. Do yourself a favor and go elsewhere for walkie talkies. Leave nerf to making footballs.
5.0	i collect yu-gi-oh cards as many as i can, just my hobby and i would like to recommend it to anyone
1.0	purchased this product, joystick did not work ,didn't even get to play the game .now I'm just hoping it's not a pain to get my money back
5.0	Great little game that can easily be played with any one of any age.<br />The only con is it may be too quick you don't have a lot of time to become vested in you little wooden pawn but it is still a fun little game
5.0	6 year old grandson loved it.  Great quality.  Very sturdy.  Pictures are bright and beautiful.
5.0	I built a deck around this card. Epic sauce.
5.0	The colors are beautiful, they were a bit smaller than I would like but they did work for me and they were shiny and pretty. Thanks also for the fast shipping :)  I should add for the price they were great.
5.0	Christmas gift for grand daughter... She's gonna love it...
1.0	I was excited to receive these wands for my little sisters and her friends, but when I received them... they were SO SMALL. I did not expect them to be that small. They are about 5 inches long. ALSO, when I received them, TWO of them were broken due to the POOR packaging. I DO NOT RECOMMEND this product. I recommend just going to party city which is definitely worth the price. Better than THIS product and it's price. Such a mistake after purchasing SIX wands. What a waste. Going to return them.
5.0	I wouldn't want to play with newer pieces. This is the game to have! Infantry, calvalry, canon. They just fit perfectly into the game of world domination
5.0	I bought this because is was Cheeper then others. When It arrived I was surprised how nice it was! My granddaughter loves it. It is a great bike for the price, has an adjustable seat and all kinds of sounds and lights.
5.0	Awesome product. Go for it.
5.0	This is a book with dots of different places around the world that you line up the dots to put together, it is challenging and fun at the same time.
5.0	This was purchased to add to an extensive set of Fisher-Price Inaginext Dinosaurs. My four-year old loved it immediately when he opened his birthday present, and quickly ran off to bring his entire collection to me so we could play...of course I did not get the raptor!
5.0	A metallic revamp of the 2010 MMPR line, but a nice addition to any PR/Sentai collection. Rare and nice looking.
1.0	We used one of these at a children's hospital and it was fantastic. worked for a long time, even when dropped. We decided to get one for our little one as he is very interested in lights. We were very disappointed to find out this one did not work at all, right out of the box. You would think it would be at least tested before packaging. We did not try to return it as it was 6$. We have since been in several toy stores where they sell some version of it and most of them don't work. Don't waste your time.
5.0	For the price, this product cannot be beat. Just don't poke it with a sharp stick (like I did)<br /><br />P.S. The repair kit works great.
5.0	This was a perfect gift for my co-worker. He is very smart guy and I wanted to get him something that matched his personality. This fit the ticket and he really enjoys it.
5.0	2 year old thinks this game is a blast! It's all about Mommy and Daddy's reaction though. He's really into it when we are.
5.0	price was great and shipping was super fast!!!
5.0	Kids loved it.  great fun opening the cards packs.  The boxes are sturdy and great for keeping your cards in order.  Wish there were more dividers.  Also no play mat, which I though it would have.  Still terrific an cheaper than I can get elsewhere.
5.0	Yes, this is a sick & twisted game; but you will laugh your face off.  We played this game over Christmas with a group of 10 people ranging in age from 20 to 85.  Some of us laughed until we cried.  It was so much fun; and oddly enough, no one objected to the gross or sick humor.  We must be open-minded people or perhaps just sick & twisted ourselves.  Enjoy.
5.0	Bought this gift for my little sister, she hugs it to bed every night. After one month it's still in good condition. Very smooth fur and an adorable expression on the face.
5.0	Great set for this price
1.0	Sorry to say the unit was ordered as a Christmas gift.  There were no batteries included (which were suppose to be).  The cash register drawer did not open.  I was very displeased with the product especially for the $50 price tag.  And, it is a hazzle to return the product -- I did not find a return slip of paper, either.
1.0	Not at all what I thought I was getting.  This is for a 2 year old at best.  I bought this form my son for his 4th bday and had to immediately buy him a new one.  Luckily our friend was having a bday for their 2 year old so it worked out but not worth buying for any child over 3.
1.0	This product looked like a lot of fun, but our foam blaster did not work.  We put new batteries in it to make sure this wasn't the problem. It could be defective.  I plan to return it at this price.  We were lucky to get one bubble out of it. I look forward to reading other reviews to see if others have a better experience.    It has been 3 days since my review.  I did notice that our bazillion gun was incomplete and did not have the proper tip.  I did not notice this at the point of purchase as all the bubble guns on the store shelf were shipped this way and lacking the needed part. Note I did not purchase this item with Amazon. I will ask the company to send the tip to the bubble gun to make it usable. Perhaps it is a fun toy after all.  In all fairness I wanted to ammend my review.
5.0	If you are over 40 years old, this is the same classic Magic 8 Ball we all grew up with.  Now, my 8 year old daughter loves asking it questions to try and predict the future.  And I have to say...the child within me still asks the Magic 8 Ball questions every now and then too.
1.0	This is not a backpack that anyone would think of. The compartment is just large enough to put in a small flip phone and nothing else. It is poorly constructed, as within 4 days of receipt the straps had alread come unsewn at the top and made it useless as a backpack. Not worth the time or efforts to order. very upsetting to a 11 y/o when it was a birthday gift. Shipping was good is all I can say.
5.0	Good product. Sturdy. Heavy ball pins didn't always stand straight. Good toy to pass time but only for 15 min.
1.0	SUCH a cute idea, right?  Photos are adorable.<br />I bought this for my son, for a Valentine's gift.  He loves growing plants and the idea<br />of cutting the little planter's &#34;hair&#34; made him really happy.<br />I wish I could post a photo of the ACTUAL item I received.<br />The paint of the &#34;shirt&#34; is all over the place.<br />The L, in &#34;Love you&#34;, looks like an I, so it reads &#34; I ove You&#34;<br />A real disappointment.  I wrote to the sellers to ask about a replacement,<br />and they never wrote back.<br />Don't waste your money.  This product is SUCH  a cute idea, and if it were<br />painted properly, would probably be worth the money.<br />As it is, I don't think the local dollar store would even agree to sell it.
5.0	I don't get the whole Doctor Who thing, but my daughter does and she loves this and it came as advertised.
5.0	Looks great. Very detailed and paint job is great for the price!
5.0	Exactly what I was looking for. Capable of running brushed or brushless motors. Easy to program with Castle link connection.
5.0	All the kids went crazy for these glow sticks.
1.0	I paid a good bit of money for this item and it quit working a little over a month after I purchased.
5.0	It gets you off to get things going
1.0	only one of the loads in the entire pack worked. we would have asked for refund had they been expensive
5.0	Built by my 7 and 9 yr old. The quality of pieces are excellent but some additional time deburring the plastic pieces before build will be time well spent. Overall an excellent kit, and a fantastic feeling when your kids take it to show and tell!
1.0	The quality of this gun is really bad. I guess we should have know with the price being so low. Took it out of the box and couldn't believe it was so light-weight. My son played with it for a day and now it's broken, won't shoot missles at all. My husband tried to take it apart and fix it but the flimsy plastic broke, so now it's in the garbage...money down the drain I guess.
5.0	well... it was a VERY cute figure (￣▽￣), AND MY FIRST AUTHENTIC ( note that i said AUTHENTIC ˊ_>ˋ... ) NENDOROID... anyways, when i first opened it, it smelled... bad (☆_☆)... AND my cherry and mini sakura flower broke, plus the head is kinda hard to open ( it maybe that or im just weak x3 ), the cherry for her back was easy to fall off, and she was VERY pricey (◎_◎;)... but i like EVERYTHING else about this nendoroid is flawless, i adore her hair, love how she has super- ultra- extra- flawless facial expressions, i really liked how she was VERY posable, FINALLY i loved her accessories sakura miku comes with, like a sakura plate ( which was smaller than i expected lol )（≧∇≦)  and how she has an extra had with a mochi she has too ☆*:.｡. o(≧▽≦)o .｡.:*☆ but that price though @.@    p.s she is an authentic ( real ) nendoroid, so no she is not a bootleg ( fake )
5.0	I was expecting it to be small - so I ordered it a size larger. It ended up being too large! These sizes are very similar to american sizes. It looks good and is very comfortable. My only complaint is that it is not pure black - it's kind of a very dark blue color in the sun, but it's hard to tell unless you're staring at it. Overall a good buy! Will buy from this shop again.
5.0	The rattle was rather pricey for what it is, but the quality is good, and that's what Mommy wanted for her little guy. His room has  mustache theme.
5.0	At first I was scared because I read some other reviews saying that the quality was low and the tokens were pretty much desfigured. That´s not true at all! Everything is super cute and in perfect condition!
5.0	Love this set!  It's well-made and super cute with lots of tiny details.  And I think it's a great way for children to learn about cleaning!
5.0	This was the first purchase in the world of LEGO friends.  Easy to use, brought much joy and lots of good play times
1.0	I bought this item,put it on my fridge and it lasted about a month.
5.0	"First, as my daughter is the resident doll expert, allow me to share her thoughts: \\""I love the colors and the way it folds up. Everything fits in the book so I can take it to my friend's house and put it away and not lose parts. The doll is really beautiful with detailed feet and hands. Her hair is a beautiful color with highlights and sparkly tinsel. Her clothes are even nicer than the ones pictured on the box and her shoes are amazing. The shoes are easy to take off so you can get her new outfits. Some of the parts are cardboard but I think that is just so they can fold easily. It's so much nicer in person than in the picture!\\""  She really does love this set. As a mom I'm thrilled to find something with such high play value. The doll is truly lovely and the colors used throughout the set are just brilliant. They add a wonderful aura of femininity to it while not being overly \\""girly\\"". The true brilliance of this, though, lies in how it functions. The bed serves as storage for the furniture parts and accessories. The doll lays on the bed and this, in turn, slides into the spine of the book. There are specially designed holders for parts that do not fit in the bottom of the bed and the whole thing folds into the approximate size of a hardcover dictionary. Very, very convenient. We did add a small plastic bag to store her jewelry as my daughter was concerned about it being lost.  I must point out that this set is not for very small children. There are tiny parts and some of the interior is card stock. I assure you that this is not a problem for older girls and does not affect the quality. My daughter is nine and it is perfect for girls in her age range and I can even see \\""tweens\\"" enjoying this.  Something else impresses me about this set. As a mother I understand that my little girl loves dolls but as a woman I'm sometimes concerned about what they do to a growing girl's self image. Not so, here. The design of this doll places her firmly in the realm of fantasy. I can't imagine anyone feeling poorly about themselves because they don't have her body shape. Another huge plus is that this series fosters the idea of being a strong, independent female without sacrificing femininity. Just fantastic.  If your child, or a child you know, asks for this, feel safe in purchasing it. The hours of imaginative play are well worth the price. We were privileged enough to try it courtesy of Mattel but I wish I would have purchased it sooner!"
5.0	The plush is well made. I bought it for my daughter for her birthday, she's a huge Kai-lan fan. She has been loving on this all month and it still looks like new. I imagine the head might get floppy after a while simply because of the size, hoping the stitching will continue to hold it though. Will update if anything changes, but as of right, it's definitely a 5 star item.
5.0	"I cannot believe how much my cats enjoy these balls.  I wish they were a little bigger so they didn't get stuck under furniture so easily, but these are the most loved and least expensive cat toys (at least according to my cats) so that's a minor inconvenience.  Also, the smaller size does allow the cats to pick up the balls in their mouths to \\""retrieve\\"" and bring back to me.  Highly entertaining!"
5.0	we love this game and play it at dinner with our 9 year old.  gave several of them as gifts to teachers and the math specialist at the school.  a fun way to practice math skills!
5.0	Bring this with on vacation, fun to play after dinner with several players. Be sure to bring extra chips with. Game is an oldie but goodie, moves fast, very social game. Need to provide more chips though, pennies do just fine. Good way to teach kids how to play cards.
5.0	Dracossack is still a very powerful monster that is hard to get over a lot of decks still can't do much to a first turn draco. And still no reprint guaranteed to come out soon still a chance with battle pack 3 coming out and even if it does it WILL BE SHORT PRINT SHATER FOIL.
5.0	I love all the Schleich horse figures, and this one is no exception.  There are many to choose from to pick your favorite breed.
5.0	My granddaughter loved it.
5.0	one of the most beautiful dolls I've ever bought for my 7 year old daughter. She's going to love it for Christmas and she's been asking for it for a long time. the packaging is beautiful enough to keep itself. She has such beautiful detailing all over it's amazing. You won't be disappointed your child will not be disappointed.
5.0	Sleights so advanced only the most dedicated should pursue.  This is masters to doctorate level card magic; something you'll seriously tackle after long years with Erdnase, Hugard & Braue, Marlo, Vernon, Ortiz, Ackerman, and others in the trade you'll come to know.  Our forefathers such as Dai Vernon and Charlie Miller would be livid knowing how easily this knowledge is passed along today.  The internet and DVDs have all but destroyed these secrets.<br /><br />Buckley's 'Card Control' is part of a trilogy; the other two titles being 'Principles & Deceptions' and 'Mental Magic'.  If you're a serious magician by all means look into these.  There's a little more card magic in 'Principles', but you've uncovered the gold mine with 'Card Control'.  I would advise you look into another book, 'Stars of Magic' and master Vernon's card work inside it.<br /><br />As you progress try not to become a guy with a wall of every card magic book ever in print . These guys often become writers of such books but never make a dvd with a live audience or perform.  I almost fell into this card hermit lifestyle.  Yes, we're out there.  Look up guys like Dan & Dave and their website.  These two guys and their handful of friends have otherworldly skills with playing cards.  There's a whole underground devoted to these guys and their skills;  It takes years if not decades to master the schizo-skills with cards.  Dan & Dave make the old masters like Buckley look like amateur choirboys.  They're all over Youtube with others with the same diabolical skills.
5.0	Sticks to the glass window with a bang!
5.0	I bought something very similar to this item. I knew that I would be pleased with this as a gift to my mother. I know it is for children but she really liked it because of the baby and mama on it. The only problem that I have with it is that even when it does not get winded it sings music. My mother has no problem with that so that is why I give it 5 stars(It may be a personal toy problem so it is not a big deal if you are going to buy it). It is soft, warm, and cuddly. The music plays as well! Get it for a baby, who knows! it will be a wonderful addition to anyone who enjoys stuffed animals Thank you,<br />  -Deborah
5.0	Awesome! This is the perfect gift for my 9 yr old brother. He loves pictionary but we were just skipping through this adult cards to find ones he could guess. This gives you both sets which should ease him through the transition.
5.0	This is a very well made product and my 4 year old enjoys it a lot. The experiments that it comes with are easy and fun too.
5.0	Students love all of the new things we implement in the classroom setting.  We love watching the students reactions as they discover new items throughout the classroom
5.0	Everything was great thank you
5.0	Why is the manufacture's age listed as 7 months - 8 years??? I hope everyone knows this is not a baby toy! These are tiny pieces!!! The listing needs to be edited to show the appropriate age.  K'nex are awesome toys for the right age group.  My boys were around 8 - 9  years old when they really started enjoying playing with them. This stike force bomber set is a great addition to a basic k'nex set.
5.0	Bought this for my daughter's science projects. Had fun making crystals.
5.0	This laser tag system is amazing!  It is so cool.  This is a must have for every child.  First the eye peice is really cool, it let's you know when your gun is locked on the target, whenyou shot someone, and when you've been shot by someone else.  The range is 250+, even outside.  The sounds can be turned on and off.  Also, the most astoundingly epic thing about this guns is that there is a LCD screen on the gun.  The screen provides real live info, such as how many sheilds you have left and so on. This gun also comes with 11 pre-programmed games.  Your child can also customize your own games, enhancing them.  Your child will never get bored of the endless features.  All i can do is hope that you buy this set, and make you child a happy one.
5.0	This is worth the money! If you have small kids it is worth the investment. Very easy to use for set-up and break down.
5.0	this toy was for my daughter. she love it. it has all the things she need to play and share.
5.0	My 3 year old love this doll. I would buy this again.
5.0	Terrordactyl is absolutely adorable! The sounds he makes when he's hungry! Very funny! And when he spits his food! Lovely toy and is sure to please.
5.0	Settlers of Catan is an excellent strategy game to be enjoyed with 3-4 people (5-6 with the expansion pack).  As a relative described, it is like a cross between Risk and Monopoly.  I've spent countless hours playing this with my friends and family and I must say Settlers of Catan is one of the best board game investments because of its unique board structure.  Built by combining a pile of hexagonal pieces, Settlers of Catan's board changes every game, creating unique opportunities and strategies each time it is played.  Moreover, the initial decisions of the players will affect the strategies available to each player for the rest of the game.  Settlers of Catan is a unique board game experience that I would recommend to anyone who likes a strategic experience and is looking for something fresh and filled with high replay value.
5.0	Even though is a novelty and star wars, it is actaully my favorite mug. I can keep my drink mixed all the time. Also, washing it is not a problem, them battery compartment is very well sealed.
5.0	My fiance loves this and I would recommend it for the ship over in your family!!!! It is made pretty well for the money.
5.0	love it love it mayne
5.0	Fantastic figure. I saw this when it was originally released and now I finally have one. Great detail and I actually received it in less than 2 weeks! Bought it from world wide Japan and they did a good job sending it. There was some damage to the box itself but aside from that, the figure was mint. Very pleased with the purchase! Also it had the sticker of authenticity so its official.
5.0	This is a high quality product, the case is very nice and durable , I could say ornamental too, but the baseline is that the topics are clever and funny, We as a family have improved our conversational skills thanks to this cards.<br /><br />so to make it short, my review says  :)
5.0	My son truly loves his Sonic Hedgehog. I am so happy that we ordered with you. The purchase went smoothly, and our merchandise was everything you said it would be. Thanks for the   smile on my son's face.
5.0	I bought this to my son for his birthday, and I was so happy helping him to assemble it and play with him. good quality<br />LEGO is LEGO :-)
5.0	Item arrived in just a few days and was in perfect condition.  I gave it to my 18 month old grandson for Halloween and he absolutely loved it.  I was so pleased that I am ordering items for Christmas.  Will definitely continue to shop on Amazon in the future.  Thank you!
5.0	Just bought five of these for the office that arrived today. Take over ensued. We're out of ammo. Send back-up.
5.0	I purchased as our crayons to keep at home for my older kids to use for projects etc. We absolutely love Crayola products. So many great colors to choose from with some awesome names. You have provided us hours of coloring fun.
5.0	Earth 2 Hawkgirl is a wonderful sculpt of this character. Detailed and of high quality. The previous issues of this line, too tight packaging and an oily smell, seem to have been addressed. The only flaw is that the wings are a bit hard to put on. The hair is removable and the accessories (gun and knife) both have slots/holsters on figure.
1.0	what i noticed right out the pack... one ear is really thin. looks cheaply made it lacks detail and overall blows...the other however is more firm (but flexible) and looks like an ear should. so basically i have 2 ears that dont match. sigh. hopefully no one will notice once i paint them...i hate buying things and not getting what i want.
5.0	Wonderful toy! We love it! I love that it has a song section and a quiz section. My little boy loves to sing along with it.
5.0	A nice go to gift for the nephews in an aunts life. Christmas morning was not a bust. we didn't know he was coming. luckily we had this nice emergency gift
5.0	Makes loosing a tooth a real event!  Doll, book & keepsake box just wonderful!  So glad I found this for my granddaughter!
5.0	I got this for my husband and he was like a kid on Christmas. He often mentioned how well the instructions were laid out, it made it fun & easy for him. This was a great model!
5.0	This is bigger and nicer than I expected. I'm very happy with this purchase.
5.0	"My wife and I do puzzles for a few hours a night a couple of times a week. Just about every puzzle we have fit on a 4' by 3' piece of 1/4\\"" MDF that I put on the dining room table, which allows me to move the puzzle into a closet without disturbing it when we're not working on it. This puzzle set up a whole new set of challenges for us. For starters, we had no board to place this puzzle on and not a single free space big enough to fit it. I had to buy two sheets of 4x8 3/4\\"" MDF, then rip one foot off one piece and attach it to the other piece to make a 8' by 5' board. There was no way we were going to move it from room to room without losing half the puzzle, so I had to set it up across two card tables in my office.<br /><br />It, like all other Ravensburger puzzles we've done, is of the highest quality... this one right down to the box, which was presentation-worthy. Includes a full color poster of the puzzle to help with assembly.<br /><br />For nearly eight months we spent a few hours a night, a couple of days a week working on this puzzle. When it was done, it was fantastic... a great sense of accomplishment.<br /><br />We're back to doing 'normal' sized puzzles, and I have my entire office back, but for anyone who likes doing puzzles, I would suggest doing one as huge as this one... it's a great experience. If you have the room, which was by far our biggest problem, I highly recommend it."
5.0	great tool, fast shipping x great. Reliable  seller.
5.0	I bought this for my Grandson and he has enjoyed this to no end.  All of my Grandkids have enjoyed this game.
5.0	Love this for my daughter she plays with it all the time and is getting to know her family even though she is across the world and hasn't seen them yet she at least can see the pic and hear their voice she already has her favorites
5.0	My eight year old loved this doll and plays with it constantly.  It's a real Barbie doll but with fairy wings that fold and open at the push of a button on the back.  When folded, they look like part of Barbie's dress.<br /><br />This Barbie is a character in the Barbie movie [[ASIN:B00L8QOXS0 Barbie and The Secret Door [DVD]]] and there's a [[ASIN:B00LPGIO0G Barbie & The Secret Door [CD]]]as well that you can get.  I find that my daughter likes to play with her Barbie Fairy doll when she's watching the movie and she loves the music as well.<br /><br />This comes in a standard packaging to it takes a bit of work to get the Barbie out.  My girl just keeps running around the house with it.  I think this one is her favorite now.
5.0	Amazing! Every balloon was filled in seconds! Greatest invention ever!
5.0	You all know that person who would throw down the Helen Keller card in Apples to Apples just to let all their friends know what kind of sick humor they have.  With this game, not only is it easy to be completely offensive, but it's practically encouraged!  Great game for any person who doesn't get offended easily.
5.0	This item was a terrific buy!  My granddaughter loves the Fisher Price Little People Play Sets!  It brings her imagination to a level that is such a joy to watch.<br />And once again Amazon's guaranteed delivery date was right on!<br />Thanks Amazon!<br /><br />Robin
1.0	Ordered this for my daughter's 11th birthday.  Inflated it yesterday for the party (10 minutes after opening it) and my daughter was the first to float in it.  By the time her friend took it turn, it was deflated and too soft.  I re-inflated it.  5 minutes later, down again.  I'm so sad that I spent almost $40 on a pool toy from which we didn't even get a day of enjoyment!  I don't expect inflatable toys to last all summer, but I expect a quality toy to last for more than 10 minutes.  It almost feels like it came with a hole in it.  VERY disappointed.  Sad daughter.  :(
5.0	Gave this to our 13 year old Grandchild. It kept her busy all afternoon with the different projects in the kit. She seemed to really enjoy it. We enjoyed that it kept her occupied, LOL.
5.0	Bought it for actual baking and it works great. Perfect for small hands, rolls well!! Some toy rolling pins i have bought in the past have been a pain to use as they don't roll just resulting in tears by little bakers. This one is a good one!
5.0	My son loves his Minecraft pig!
5.0	purchased item as a curiousity .  i like to give out gifts to friends. they were pleaaed with items. would recommend to anyone wanting to do something different..
5.0	My 12 year old granddaughter just loves the marker airbrush set. She says it's a creative way to show her art skills. She received it for her birthday and has spent hours using it creating all kinds of art work. It was her favorite gift! Her sister now wants one!
5.0	Very nice, looks very nice buuuut is warmer!! If you live in hot weather don't buy, the kids are very hot inside.<br />The size, my son is 2.6 years old I bought 3-4 years you can cut...
5.0	My wife was bothering me about this doll for some time, and she wanted it fast and now with prime 2 day shipping plus the right doll it is all good, no she wants the rest.
5.0	My son is very happy with this yo-yo. He was able to get it to spin freely for nearly seven minutes!
5.0	Dinosaur train , Diosaur Train, Great for the imagination and is a great quality hunk of plastic. Dinos must be going out of style cause we have a hard time finding them for our daughter.
5.0	I have bought several green toys from amazon and i am always pleasef with the toys. My grandson really enjoys them. They are durable and very well made
5.0	I would recommend this! Great quality. I bought it for my little cousins and they really enjoy with it. You can use them for many purposes.
5.0	This ferry boat is absolutely fantastic! It comes apart easily to be washed in the dishwasher to prevent any mold from growing in the toy. Our little guy plays with it in the bath, in the shower, and he also loves to play with it just as a toy to play with. A great bath toy!
1.0	Chick Hicks is one of the hardest cars to find but keep trying.  My nephew wanted this car for Christmas.  My sister had everyone she knew looking for this car for 3 weeks.  We finally found it at Toy R Us for $3.49 a week after Christmas.  We had managed to find all the other cars before this one.  Don't pay this price for it.  Now that Christmas is over there will be a lot more of these around.
5.0	It was the perfect gift for a guy who is a John Wayne collector.  It was swiftly delivered after a mix up with another vendor.  It made my Christmas gift giving easy and I would certainly buy from Vandor again if I need any more John Wayne products.
5.0	"While my husband did not purchase this toy from Amazon.com, we definitely felt it needed another perspective up here. We've had this toy for approximately six months and my son technically not old enough for it, and cannot shake it since it is slightly heavy.  But he nonetheless will play with all day, everyday over all his other toys.  The batteries can frequently get low with usage and then it will not go like it should. This toy does \\""eat\\"" batteries unless you use the off switch.<br /><br />But it teaches him to anticipate distance and to \\""time\\"" things. He also throws it pretty far and it's rough and tough, tumble-as-you-please, stand-up-to-anything durable!<br /><br />This is a great toy but again, my son is not and will not be 3 for some time, so his fascination with it is because this is the only over age 3 toy car we have ever bought for him (due to it's large size and I suspect because my husband loves racing it just as much as my son loves watching him shake it so it can \\""go\\"" zooming) and it was a risk we took, hoping the parts would hold up and so far,  so good.<br /><br />Also, I am positive this car can go farther than 20 feet.  That must be just an approximate."
5.0	Got it as a gift for my sister. Works beautifully from what I've seen, and she loves it.
5.0	Got this for my 3 yr old grandson and he loved it. It's sturdy and well made. He enjoyed it because he could play farm using the animals and tractors together.
5.0	Adorable item..very reasonable price. my daughter n neice loved it for their American girls.. came with pillow blanket and bed
5.0	My kids are absolutely obsessed with Play-doh. The accessory toys and gadgets are their favorites. Definitely a great buy!
5.0	"I have a \\""No!\\"" button that I took to work and my boss always asks to borrow it.  We have a laid back office environment, and are actually quite foul at times, so the WTF button is great!  I've played with it so much (I'm giving it to him on Monday for Christmas) and laugh over the voices.  As other reviewers said the F dash dash dash word is covered by sound effects which makes it all the more appropriate for use in the office.  I know he will have great fun with this!"
5.0	Spur gear for center diff
5.0	It's a Mr. Potato Head, that looks like Darth Vader.  What isn't to love?  Sturdy plastic, well constructed, looks like the picture and matches the product description.
5.0	Fits American Girl dolls great!
5.0	It is just what we wanted, the kids were so excited.
5.0	I bought two of these monkeys. One for my two year old great niece. Not sure why is has 3 year old warning. It appears safe for a 2yr old.  I had to have one for myself. It feels so good and makes me feel good. I never had a monkey before. I am afraid I won't get to keep this one...my daughter is eyeing it. Love this monkey!
5.0	Beautiful poster! It will be an engaging focal piece in my classroom. Excellent customer service from this company. I am very pleased with my purchase.
5.0	Very nice keychain.  A bit larger and heavier than I expected, but the bigger size makes it easier to find in the depths of my purse.  Perfect for this Captain America fan and my son was happy to get the bonus keychain that came with it.
1.0	Broken arm on arrival. It is a good concept - needs to be reevaluated to improve the quality and workmanship.
1.0	My kids (age 3 and 5) saw this advertised on TV and asked for it for Christmas, so we got it for them. It's a cute idea, and it might be fun - if it worked the way it's intended. The little butterflys simply do NOT blow up the trunk the way they should. There must be 3 dozen, and the directions indicate that they should all be out in about 2 minutes - after about 5 minutes, and only two butterflys, my kids got really frustrated and started crying. One would naturally suspect weak batteries, but I was using a brand new package of Energizers. I changed them anyway, just to be sure - no luck. I think the fan is underpowered, or else the butterflys are two heavy, trunk too long, etc. Basically a bad design that needed more testing before being released to market. <br />Two thumbs downs.
5.0	My son received this as a 1st birthday present recently and even though his legs are not quite long enough to &quot;drive&quot; it himself, he loves to get in and out of the car and play with the horn and the cb siren. The siren is loud enough to entertain him but not so loud that it drives mom and dad crazy! He also loves to get behind the car and push it around the house as well as being in it and getting pushed around (until he can cruise on his own). We have been very pleased with this so far and look forward to several years of use. It seems to be well made and I actually assembled this myself. A+!
5.0	Perfect for birthday party!
5.0	The model is really a good one and the package is well. Consider the price, it is really a good purchase.
5.0	This a great product. I have chopper from a different manufacturer and this replacement set was compatible with it. Very fast shipping. Thanks will buy again when needed, (I'm sure the time will come).
5.0	Ok, when you get to see your husband act like a trained dog, and then your younger sister &#34;gets to&#34; make up a Shakespearian love sonnet to same...seriously, you will be rolling! So long as there aren't any party poopers! Seriously SO. MUCH. FUN! It is now a regular at family gatherings :-)
5.0	Great product. I would buy again.
5.0	I recommend it. its very fluffy and cute. I bought it because we have a dog just like this plush.
5.0	Love it. I'm a twilight fan and this was the best thing ever and for a replica it didn't cost much.
1.0	The tires fall off the rims, the axles come off the body because they are attached very poorly with VERY thin plastic.  It is a complete rip off! Broken within 2 hours of getting out of box.
5.0	Grandson loves that he can roll the ball and it comes back to him! Great first birthday present. Would highly recommend!
5.0	Very happy with product, delivery time, and buying experience.
5.0	These crayons' colors are great! It includes the sharpener and eraser, which is a plus. The downside is that are thin and easy to break and the packaging box is very cheap. For a little kid, I suggest the melissa and dough plastic, triangular crayons.
5.0	I am not a huge girl, but I have a hard time finding costumes that fit. This is one that really impressed me. I'm 5'9&#34;, between a 14W-18W in dresses and jeans (depending on the store and brand), and a L to XL shirt (depending) and this fit wonderfully. I wore a petticoat underneath which I pulled down to add some length (since I was going to be walking around a Privateer fest in downtown Baltimore all day). I got lots of compliments and felt great. The little coin pouch was a real life saver. Big enough for my ID, some cash, and my phone! Best costume purchase I have ever made!
5.0	I'd say that this is not a toy as it contains a lot of very small parts. Besides that the quality of the pieces are excellent so it looks really great as a decorative figure rather than a toy. The product was  delivered on time taking into account it was shipped from Japan. I really recommend this product. Is a must have for vintage/manga collectors.
5.0	We use them for Church Camp. Kids love them for night time games. This is the 2nd time I have bought them and have loved them. Everyone of them worked and lasted all night.
5.0	Legos are always a good gift.  Our kids loved them, and now our grandson does, as well.  Building plates are always useful, whatever is being created.  Good quality item.  I'm pleased with my purchase.
5.0	I bought this as one of the party favors for my son's 3rd birthday party. They are very easy to use, and present very pretty colors with nice details on the skin. I don't understand why there are people saying they are hard to apply.  The tattoo is easy to apply with the correct steps:1. take the tattoo out of its individual package, 2. take the cover sticker out, 3. put the side with the dinosaur on the skin, 4. cover the whole tattoo with a damp kitchen towel, 5. within 30 seconds, you will have pretty tattoo on the skin.   All the kids at the party loved this tattoo, and everyone was covered with at least 2 dinosaur tattoos. The tattoo lasts for about 2 days. It was a great temperate toy, and we are very happy with this purchase.
5.0	My granddaughter is a huge Hello Kitty junkie so I sent this to her for her 6th birthday. She thinks I hung the moon! Cute game for little girls!
5.0	VERY NICE TRIVIA GAME, BRINGS BACK MANY MEMORIES :) I RECEIVED THIS ITEAM AT A DISCOUNTED RATE FOR MY HONEST OPINION
5.0	The Holztiger wooden toy animals never fail to please! They are sturdy and realistic. My son LOVES playing with them and they are  definitely taking a beating and still in great condition!
5.0	Great quality, kids love it.  I haven't had a problem with kids falling off of it at all as some other reviewers stated.
5.0	Just as described. Thank you!
5.0	This magician is awesome.  I do not condone showing people how magic routines are done (I appreciate the act, even if I know how it's done), however, if you have a person of magic in your realm, this DVD will be a welcome reprise as well as an instructional tool. No problem with shipping either.
5.0	It was more than i hoped for. Probably gonna wear it every day I would recommend this to any supernatural fan
5.0	Awesome action figures thanks!!
5.0	Fast shopping!! Love my mini dog!!
5.0	I bought this Puzzle to give as a Gift but I got a lot of positive response for finding and buying it.  The pieces were different shapes, (they didn't look like every other piece in the box.) which is preferable.., you can actually look at the shape of the piece not just the image.  The Puzzle pieces were sturdy and had a thickness to each piece., very nice to handle.  The image itself was a lot of fun to work with., there was always a particular part to work on, be it the World, in the night sky., or the Lions or just any of the many animals to look at.   I'm now looking for other White Mountain Puzzles to purchase, partly to be the guy that has awesome taste in choosing fun puzzles to give as gifts and to have something fun to work-on at home.  I would highly recommend this puzzle for a fun puzzle to work.!  .., Should you take my recommendation.., I do hope you enjoy the puzzle..!
5.0	it meet my needs for my two year old grandson. easy to set up and easy for him to use.
5.0	I believe that todays coins could be collected by the young individuals and placed into these coin holders. They will be the ones selling todays coins at a higher price due to protecting them now. What a way to get a hobby started.
5.0	"First, let me admit that I am a huge fan of the Master Replicas items and I own many -- both Star Wars and Trek.  I have come to expect a lot from these collectables, and this one mostly did not disappoint.<br />I have never found any of the the NextGen phasers to be particularly beautiful in design, especially when compared to the old fashioned elegance of the Classic Star Trek props.  And so, this replica is not the most beautiful or stylish, but it is done with typical excellent accuracy and quality of manufacturing.  Holding it in your hand, you can tell it is made of metal and it has a weight and balance that makes it feel the way you would imagine a \\""real\\"" phaser might feel.<br />The electronics on this item, while authentically reproducing the real electronics used in the movie prop, are quite simplistic and not particularly showy, giving this prop replica does less power to impress your friends.  One thing in its favor, though, is that the design makes it one of the more durable replicas from MR."
5.0	Great merchandise. Shipped promptly
5.0	He can't put all of the puzzle pieces back yet but he loves picking them up with the fishing pole!
5.0	I bought the game for my Grandson for Christmas.  We had fun playing the game . Yes I would recommend this card game it is fun for adults too not just for kids.
5.0	My 3yr old loves playing with this pretty cake.
5.0	Great costume and extremely reliable service!<br />I Definitely recommend buying if needed.<br />The costume is exactly what I needed and high quality.
5.0	Another great addition to my ever growing Pop! Vinyl figures collection.
1.0	broke after the kids used it 2 times. very cheap plastic.
5.0	Bought this for my grandson.  It's so cute.  It's small enough for his little hands to grasp.  Would make wonderful gifts.
5.0	Good price and fast shipping
1.0	Don't waste your time with this!!  My nephew was excited to get this for his birthday.  Well...until I told him that it didn't work.  After putting in the batteries, absolute silence!  No sign of any activity within the gun...complete DUD!
5.0	My 8 year old and his 9 year old cousin loved this electronics kit.  They have constructed dozens of the various bells, whistles, radio stations, sounds, lights, and other electronic projects listed with the kit.    This is accessible.  Any kid can safely use this, and the kids learn from doing, about electronics and about making things with their hands.    I would highly recommend this for any young child.
5.0	My colleague brought this to my office and 3-4 of us play this while during the break. Once I played with 6 people and it was really fun. I strongly recommend this game.
1.0	Our daughter opened this tonight for the 1st night of Hannukah and the roof is cracked!
1.0	How can anyone give this more than 1-2 stars, its a disaster of a toy.  It essentially goes up and down and doesn't even do that well.  There are so many other types of helo devices, buy one of them, not this.
5.0	I teach in a self-contained autism classroom and it is tough to find structured leisure activities. The design cards are a great addition to the Wedgit blocks. Exactly what I needed!! They range from very easy using only 2 Wedgit Blocks to much more complex. Perfect for all developmental levels and has built in progression of difficulty (that is labeled)!! The cards are very durable!! The only criticism I have is that the box that the cards are stored in are not durable at all and I will have to rubber band the cards together as the box has already ripped (much less durable than even a box for playing cards).
5.0	We bought this for our 3-year-old son, and he absolutely loved it. We've purchased bath / water toys before that say they swim, but they just sink. Mommy decided to put this in the water herself first to be sure there was no electrical charge or concern, and I could feel air coming out the back. It feels as if a fan blows water out the tail, allowing the air to drive the toy around. When I let it go, this thing swam circles around our tub, and our son was enraptured. He LOVED it. Spent the whole bath chasing it around and giggling, watching it jump out of the water, swim around his legs... and it's FAST too! It was like having a real fish in with him. I'm impressed (and I don't say that very often about a kids bath toy). We'll probably air dry it with the battery compartment open between baths, since I saw the other review, but so far it seems like a wonderful toy to me.
1.0	The basketball hoop has scratched the paint off of the door and does not fold up easily at all.  The boys have already broken it several times just by playing hoops.
5.0	GREAT GREAT GREAT my son loves it
5.0	A little small but fits really nice in my collection.
5.0	Got this pack from Kmart and they're so adorable. It's really hard to get dolls with perfect bangs, though. (Especially if you are ordering online you never know if they will have awful bangs, horrible make up, uneven eyes.)
5.0	The Minnie Mouse Head balloon looked exactly like it did in the picture. It was perfect for the girls at the party.
5.0	We have always had some version of this toy from Fisher-Price and keep handing them down to the next small child in the family.  The children have always enjoyed them.  They are sturdy, colorful and educational, teaching order (large to small), counting, and colors.
5.0	I certainly like this card because since it negates Spell Cards and potentially all the ones in you're opponent's deck, then that pretty much means they'll have dead weight to slow them down. It's not the greatest card to use though because it's pretty much useless if your opponent only had one of that card. Not to mention you have to discard a Spell Card of your own. Regardless, it came in great condition, and as long as you think about it then this card is fine.
5.0	This is a great game for adults and teens alike!  It is so much and is a great group or family activity!
5.0	My fianc&eacute; and I are hardcore Family Guy fans, plus we love playing Monopoly. We had to have this :)
1.0	This was not even worth a buck. This is plastic and broke very easily. Very dissatisfied with this product. Made in China the package said.
1.0	"We purchased this for my 5 year old son.  We have the original aquadoodle mat & the three kids fight over the drawing space so we thought this would be \\""his\\"".  Well, to say were were disappointed when he opened it is a big understatement.  This is a piece of paper, literally.  It is not the thick, durable original aquadoodle =(  My husband almost purchased one on here for $40, I purchased this for $15 & feel ripped off.  Do not waste your money on this, purchase the Aqua Doodle floor mats!"
5.0	My kids, ages 6-16, all enjoy this game. It is challenging and the young kids can play along with the adults.
5.0	The eternal dragon came to my house and granted my wish, it was totally awesome. My wish was for world domination.
5.0	"It's going to be a \\""Very 'Blinkie' Christmas\\"" around our house this holiday. We bought Zoe, Perrie and Skye for our three daughters, aged 6, 9 & 10. My husband Taylor and I played with each of them to make sure our children won't be disappointed. He didn't want to put his down! (There's a child in us all.) These are the cutest little toys I've seen in a long time. What I like about them is how many things they can say and do! Each one has a completely different personality. They appear well made. Read the instructions to make sure you know how to play with them.  <br /> <br />My interest is in buying toys that keep the children entertained and engaged for a good while. Most toys they get tired of sooner than later. I'm certain these Blinkies are going to have them going all through the school holiday. And for $15 each, that's not much to pay for a baby sitter. :-) <br /> <br />Merry Christmas to all!  <br /> <br />Mandy"
1.0	My daughter wanted this toy so badly for her 6th birthday.  She loves me braid her dolls hair.  It was hard to get out of the package.  When I finally got everything out and read the instrustions, I tried to set up the three little animals on the wheel.  The rabbit was missing the piece to connect it to the knob so it would not stay on the wheel.  I looked through everything and could not find the missing piece.  It is very tiny!!!!  So I had to super glue the rabbit on to the wheel.  To actually get her hair set up, you need to have three equal pieces of hair.  (She comes with two braids on each side of her head.  I took those out and started fresh.)  Then you have to clip the hair with a small clip, tuck up the end, and tie it on with a tiny ponytail. (No way my daughter could do all that, so she can't play with this toy by herself.) Then you have to snap the clips into the animals, at which point the super glue did not hold, so I had to do all over again and wait even longer for the glue to set.  Finally I had everything ready again.  My daughter excitedly twisted the handle and the braid started to braid only about half way down her hair.  Then when the tension between the animals and the doll was to tight, the braid just got knotted.  So all that for maybe two inches of braid!!!    I tried small pieces of hair and large pieces of hair, with all the same results.  It definately would not braid large amounts of hair.  The doll is very pretty and so is her dress.  She comes with shoes, but I could not get them on her.    So, I now braid her hair myself.  Just by the doll, this toy is defintely not worth the money.  It simply does not work the way it should, and my daughter cannot play with it by herself.  I love playing with my daughter, but not with a toy that has me so mad beacuse it is too time consuming and breaks!!!!
5.0	This little guy is crazy cute. He is fuzzy baby adorable.
5.0	These are great and don't impede pedaling at all!
5.0	Just amazing work. They are true art pieces. I will  buy many more cards from this dealer.
5.0	My daughter got as gift. She loves it and it stands up to toddler wear and tear. We've had this for 1 year and still looks new.
5.0	The grandkids live at the other end of the state and travel several times a year to visit.  I purchased this to give the kids something to do and pass the time during their travels.
1.0	I purchased this sewing kit for my 6-year old granddaughter.  She was very excited as I was.  The first time she threaded the needle using the needle threader, the needle threader broke. As with all the sewing supplies in this kit, such as the scissors and thimble, it was cheaply made.<br /><br />But my worst complaint concerns the directions. Completely useless. We are trying to make what is called 'Book Cover'. There are two written steps that make no sense, and the pictures shown don't help much either.  Plus the cryptic directions are in 4 different languages; what looks like what might be a lot of useful directions are really a couple sentences repeated in 4 languages.<br /><br />This kit is frustrating for my granddaughter as well as me, and I am an experience seamstress.
1.0	First of all, this gun is obnoxious.  Second, it broke right away.  Stay clear!!!
5.0	i like this product I am a collector I am a collector I am a collector  I am a collector
5.0	oks great on our bar!!
5.0	Does what it supposed to do, masks a good mask. Just remember to use two coats, when I just used one, it didn't work as well. Also , wipe off the rim before putting the lid back on to prevent sticking.
5.0	Really cute little play set. Great toy to keep in our travel bag or purse to play with while at a restaurant or on a plane. Bought for a 3 yr old and she loves it.
5.0	Best damn quad-core I ever flew
5.0	A cute little doctor who nod for our nerd shelf
5.0	Great addition to the funnest board/card game that I've ever played.. My family is hooked on this game and we play at least two nights a week. If you won bang the bullet buy this adds to the fun!
5.0	This fire truck is perfect for my 18-month-old who always wants to play with his dad's remote control car. My son isn't coordinated enough to use the controls on a regular remote control car but this one is perfect because it just has one button. He can easily run the truck without getting frustrated. The truck is also made of a durable plastic that doesn't scratch walls, cabinets or furniture. Highly recommended.
5.0	My daughter cried and was so excited because it went with her princesses and doll house. GREAT price, nice quality. Shipped fast. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!
5.0	These cups were a perfect party favor for my 3 year old fire themed birthday party.  They looked really cute on the tables so served the purpose of d&eacute;cor as well.  I would highly recommend.
5.0	Two tons of fun for grammy & grandson!
1.0	My daughter received this jump rope as a Christmas gift and loved it.  Two weeks later it stopped working.  I replaced the batteries, no luck.  I called Coolglow, they do not warranty their products and only offer replacements 2 weeks after the ship date.  I will not buy any more Coolglow products or recommend them.
5.0	Awesome. Received package a day earlier than expected.
5.0	Good articulated on this guy
5.0	Santa got one for her and it has been flying all over the place and bumping here and there and everywhere. so far so good. durable.
5.0	I got this as a Christmas present for my Granddaughter.  It will be a fun Christmas present for her and her Sister.
5.0	Ah - toh (furbys name) was the hit of Christmas! He was by far not the most expensive item but when my granddaughter went back to school they each got to tell one gift & Ah-toh was it!!
5.0	Perfect doll! thankyou!
5.0	I got these for my 22 month old twins--bought two.  I can only let them play with the three largest penguins.  The smaller ones seem like a choking hazard.  But, they love them.  They are able to take them apart and put them together without getting frustrated.  I love that they are plastic for this age.  They have a very large wooden toy, and I am afraid they will crack it and get splinters. The paint is scratched on one of the penguins, but my guys are pretty rough on toys.  They have had them for 6 weeks.
5.0	My 15 year old son loves building these things. There are lots of pieces, but he keeps everything in order
5.0	Fits just fine, just as expected.
5.0	Got it for my one year old grandson.
5.0	Kids love this game and the regular one. Bought so my preschooler could learn and practice letters and it's fantastic.
1.0	I received this in the mail today Thursday, Sept. 27. I was super excited because it looked really cute and quirky. But, after wearing for less than an hour the robot charm fell off the chain and when it went to pick it up if fell apart in my  hand. I would not suggest buying this because even though it is inexpensive I expected it to last more than an hour.
5.0	I purchased this as a gift for a child's birthday.  The outfit looks pretty and I'm sure the child will enjoy dressing her AG doll in it.
5.0	Excellent product and timely arrival.  Completely satisfied.
5.0	ATTTTTTTTT. THANKS AGAIN
5.0	While not fool-proof, the guard works well and protects the props.  Harder bumps can unseat the guard, causing the CX-10 to become slightly unbalanced.  There's also a risk of flying into items from below and striking the prop.  The copter is a little more sluggish and harder to control with the guard on, but it is well worth the performance hit to avoid the physical hits that would occur without it.
5.0	We bought these for our 2-year-old grandson. They're a bit too big, but he'll grow into them, and they keep his hands safe from rocks and other garden perils.
5.0	I purchased the Elmo Giggling Microwave for my two year old son for Christmas, and it has been played with non stop! All three kids sit and play with it, and they come up with some crazy food combinations! It lights up and the turn table actually spins like the real thing. All in all, I'm glad I got it for them and would highly reccommend it to any Elmo fan!!
5.0	My 4 and 10 year old have had a lot of fun with this tank and the joker. It goes perfectly with the Imaginext Bat Cave. It is greta fun to shoot the glove off the end.
5.0	Grandson loved these!
1.0	we were just using the boat in our pool for the first time.<br />within 10 mins of using this toy it started to sink.<br />then the rudder became jammed so that the boat just went in a circle.<br />Then the motor stopped working.<br />overall boat looked great and worked well for the first 7 minutes then just down hill from there.
5.0	gun is huge! my kids love it
5.0	I bought this Lego mini figure for my grandson that graduated from the fifth grade & he loved it ! I'm just sorry I didn't get his best friend one also!:)
5.0	My kids love the Indiana Jones didj game.  As play continues the questions and actions gets harder, keeping even us adults entertained while we play.  You get to play both Indy and Mutt using whip and sword to fight the bad guys. Five stars on this Didj game!
5.0	100% is recommended.<br /><br />The product is excellent, the device is so useful that really looks like a tablet. With expansion memory can be used as a data logger, music and videos.
5.0	Worth the money<br />Great product
5.0	it was a little late to get here but they are the cutest slippers ever.....  I am size 9 (cnd)  and they fit perfect!  The company is very fast in replying to emails as well if you have any questions :)
5.0	DOPE! If you like to party you will love this toy, especially the disco ball part!<br />Combine with the zero blaster smoke ring gun for an ultimate playtime indoors
5.0	I got these for my 5 year old daughters birthday party.  When snaking, I put these on the table with plain party hats, and markers, so they could decorate them.  It kept the kids busy when snaking and the cake was being cut.  Very fun and easy to use.
1.0	When I opened the package, sand was everywhere (inside the bag and on my floor).  I couldn't use these letters with my preschooler because it would leave sand all over my house.  I returned them.
5.0	They arrived in great shape, a bit on the smelly side, but out in the sun for a few days, and they were odor free.  I give them to little kids who love them.
5.0	My son just started getting into speed stacking and I thought it would be nice to get him something more his style that he didn't have to borrow from school. He absolutely loved these and they came so quickly. Perfect for my son.
1.0	Just dreadful. None of the instruments sound at all like the real thing and you don't even need to put the pieces in the right spot for it to play the tune. Put the xylophone in the guitar hole, it plays. Harmonica in the trumpet hole, it plays. Put your toe in the piano hole, it plays.<br />Each instrument also plays the exact same song (Old MacDonald) so within a few minutes, you want to smash it to pieces. Unfortunately, the thing is like a cockroach and just will not die (hence my 5 star rating for durability.) To add to the annoyance, it plays whenever it wants e.g: at 3 am when no-one is anywhere near it.<br />I want to punch this toy in the face.
1.0	arrived broken was a present for my son and not once ever got to play w it was a piece of junk tried. changing batteries many times cause I thought it was on my part as the say buyer beware &#34; don't ever buy from this seller
1.0	The keys on this xylophone are not tuned.  Only purchase this toy as a noisemaker, NOT as a musical instrument!!
5.0	Great puzzle.  Ravensburger are the highest quality puzzle.
5.0	My daughter loves &#34;miss kitty&#34; so much. I would buy this product all over again if given the opportunity.
5.0	I gave this to my almost two year old for Christmas.  She immediately began taking it apart and putting it back together.  I like that she can carry it around on a play and that it stays together when she drops it.  The individual pieces are very realistic looking.
5.0	This is a great puzzle.  It's pretty challenging for my 9 year old, he did need some adult encouragement and help to get it started and keep it going.  It took the two of us maybe 4 hours total over a couple days.  Nice and sturdy as you would expect from most jigsaw puzzles.  Recommend!
5.0	They came ahead of schedule and I installed 2 of them and up and flying. Vendor was great, prices great. Recommend this vendor to all my friends.
5.0	"I originally purchased E. Coli as an unusual gift for a stuffed-animal lover. Soft, funny-looking, and educational for the little kids. I guess they did learn something after all, because when I wiggled it at my son one day he yelled back \\""He's not in me!  I had turkey for lunch!\\""<br /><br />This year I bought Salmonella for my daughter who is always asking to lick the cake-mix spoon with the raw eggs in it!"
5.0	The old model seems much more durable and doesn't have the space underneath to get suck in.  I got the old model at a yard sale and saw this in the store.  I like the old one much better.  Check yard sales or friends with older kids that have outgrown it.  The old ones will last through MANY children.
5.0	They are exactly what they say they are and work great. I'm not sure what else you can say about bearing....they spin? Ha!
5.0	That was a very faqst delivery ! i love how the plush came wrapped with the plastic and the wolf plush came is a position where he cover his eyes and legs... very cool !
5.0	Great product loved it !!!!! Used it for my baby shower theme was under the sea!!!!!
1.0	I made the mistake of buying one<br />Deceptive advertising<br />No coin just a plastic holder They should be ashamed, and are crooked
1.0	Severely over priced.  Box of instruction pamplets and internet links.  Thumb provided is too small to hold anything, including my own thumb.  Deck of cards and magnetic pen cheap quality.  Save your money and look elsewhere.
5.0	Well made. My 3 yr old daughter loves it. Please note that the Hape Family Doll sets have TWO different styles. One more &#34;little people&#34; style and the other more for older children. Keep in mind when you are buying accessories and houses! She got the Hape baby and it was for the other doll set. And the baby is the same size as these little dolls! lol She doesn't seem to mind.
5.0	Great quality we've come to expect and love from Ty! It's typical beanie baby size, which is perfect for pretend play, and also fits perfectly in a purse for on-the-to play too!
5.0	It came on time, the card is in good conditions, I really like it
5.0	Great for toddlers and infants!  My two-year-old grandson loves it, and so does my five-month-old granddaughter...SO CUTE!
5.0	My two and a half year old daughter loves these blocks. I enjoy playing with her as well, so it buys dad some valuable bonding time. I would not hesitate to recommend these blocks to anyone who has a young child.
5.0	Great for decorating a Monster High fans room! I removed the happy birthday part at the top, and hung them pictures like a big poster in my little girls bedroom. Its very nice, and is lots of fun adding pops of color!
5.0	Needed additional refills for a new Lite Bright for Christmas.  Quick shipping and grandson was glad to have additional choices.  Nice to have additional pegs for when kids just want to fill the LiteBright screen w/ random designs.
5.0	Considering the price and what you get, this toy is a great value.  Voice and laser sounds are practically straight from the movie and the quality of the piece is excellent so far.  Wings pop open, helmet can be open and shut, and the blaster is a nice add to Buzz's arsenal.  My 3 year old loves it.
5.0	"We got this swing for our little boy shortly after he was born. He loves it! He always preferred to swing side to side rather than front to back. Who knows in advance what a kid will like??? He certainly enjoyed the aquarium effect-especially in a dimly lit room.<br />When he was small - under 10 pounds - it seemed to go pretty fast. Now that he's pushing 22 pounds, he's just about outgrown it and the speed has certainly slowed down trying to move double the weight. <br />Be sure to buy top of the line batteries because there's a lot going on with the swinging, the lighted \\""aquarium\\"", the rotating fishies, the music and/or the sound effects. <br />Our little guy almost always found this swing a soothing experience and a great place to take a nap. The chair has two tilt positions. <br />Overall, an attractive and very thoughtfully designed product."
5.0	We loved it!  Our daughter won &#34;best costume&#34; award at each party.  She received multiple compliments.  We completed the look with a bow & arrow set.  Thanks!
5.0	Have been buying the whole set for my Granddaughter for Christmas ,  This one is just darling. I can't wait for her to get her home and all the different rooms to put in it.  She will be 2 in Oct and I think this set will last for many many years.  Love the little kitchen, it is small but not to small. Perfect.
1.0	broke a few minutes after he got it.
5.0	This game was a gift and I have not personally used it, but I think it will be great. The product came in 2 days time from the order which is great. Everything was exactly as shown and described. Great customer service.
5.0	I have nothing but good things to say about this walker. It has such a huge array of music, words, lights, and sounds that even *I* am not bored with it, and it's been my son's favorite toy for two months. We bought it for him when he was about 10 months and comfortably pulling up and cruising, but not standing or walking. The slower wheel setting was perfect for him starting out, so he didn't just fall down. He was completely confident with it in a week or so, and we switched it to the faster wheel setting. Now he goes tearing across the living room every morning! He is still not walking on his own, but this is great practice for him. I love that the front piece can be taken off, so he might still play with it when he has outgrown the walker. Also, I am pretty sure he would have loved this toy even if we had bought it months earlier, when he could only sit and not pull up. So many buttons to push and attachments to play with, and every couple of days he discovers a new one! This is very high up on the list of the best things we ever bought our baby. Highly recommended!
5.0	Awesome variety of dice and fast shipping
1.0	Had a cut in the side of the floatie. The placement of the cut was not in place that I could have caused in anyway shape or form. They refunded All of my money including shipping though.
5.0	We supersede our Eldest Granddaughter with this cute area rug and, I have to admit.... The rug was ALOT BIGGER than we expected. We were THRILLED TO SEE  HOW MUCH THE RUG ACTUALLY COVERED :-)<br />As for our Wee Lil (4) Four year old granddaughter who me we call Ladybug ...<br />Just the sight of the Big Beautiful Smile and tiny Squeal of Excitement ... Said it all.<br />Thanks Amazon......<br />Satisfied Customer.
5.0	We got this for my son when he was 9 months old.  He wasn't intrested with it until he was about 20 months old; but now its great!!! He has played with it daily for about 6 consecutive months now. The noises are realistic and the voices very clear.  I love that there is noise level adjuster as well.
5.0	"As with everything else I've bought from Common Sense RC it is well built and exactly what they say it is.  Only real \\""issue\\"" is it's an old product that was originally designed a while ago. The pockets are too small when compared to newer high capacity LiPo packs so there are some problems getting 2 packs into an individual pocket. You can always get a second one, but it might be worth it for Common Sense to look into making a new version."
1.0	This gun was horrible. Unfortunately I bought two of them. They barely went 30 feet and not in a stream either. I'm sorry I bought them.
5.0	At about 6 weeks my grandson really started loving this.  Mom clipped it to an existing mobile, with the clip it is pretty versatile.  I would highly recomment it, especially for the price..
5.0	My granddaughter loved her Minnie. Great gift.
5.0	My son (2 and a half years old) got this for Christmas. He absolutely loves it. We had to bribe him to get him away from it to eat dinner! LOL Plus, it's not at all annoying to adults (like many children's toys are) and is very easy to put together.      I've read another mom's review here who had many problems with this product, but I'm guessing she just got a defective one because we haven't experienced any of those problems. We got our bridge together just as easily as the other pieces, my son can put together the tracks on his own and they don't come apart while he's using it, and the train doesn't derail when coming down the hill. It is a fairly slow train, but it's meant for toddlers and pre-schoolers so I think that's safer. And it's speed doesn't matter to them anyway.      I plan on buying a bunch of the accessories to this product this weekend with the money we got for Christmas, and I would recommend it to anyone. Even adults, because I'm having problems getting my husband away from it as well. LOL
5.0	Nice toy, it is very difficult to get this one in my country but here's always easy to find this action figures
5.0	"I found this is a great puzzle for both by 27 month & five year old daughters.  We play a lot of different games with it which surprised me.  I really thought they would quickly grow tired of it.  (It was given to us as a gift)    My youngest is learning names of different insects and also eye-hand coordination.  My older likes to play \\""Entomologist\\"" and catch the bugs.  We also play by asking her to catch an insect that flies, crawls, spins a web, eats green leaves, etc...  Also, I have added find the bug that starts with the letter \\""L\\"" or such... so there are surprisingly a lot of ways to play with this than just catch the bugs.      BTW, I have found the magnetic \\""net\\"" for catching the insects to by pretty sturdy.  I was afraid I might have to make a stronger one, but it has worked just fine for us."
5.0	What you would usually expect with a &#34;decent&#34; priced figure would be a  mediocore paint job and moulding, but I was really impressed with the figure. Now do not expect a Good Smile figure, but as a starting figure you can get a lot of &#34;bang&#34; for your buck.
5.0	This is a great product and a great price.  Goes great with our collection of Melissa and Doug wooden toys.
5.0	very very happy!!! I love it!!!
5.0	Good price fast shipping
1.0	This whistle looks like all the other train whistles and cost approximately the same, but the quality is not the same.  It does not sound like a train whistle at all and that is only when I can get it work.  Poorly made.
5.0	I was very pleased to recieve this item. The figures are very well made and look amazing. Love that they made them in black and white and series 2 is also very well done.
5.0	I just got these today and my son immediately said cook! They are small but sturdy. Big enough for his hands. I hope these will keep him out my kitchen! So far so good he enjoys pretending to cook. I just wish this wouldve came with some play food.
5.0	This is a fun new twist on an age old game play. Great value for money, it easy to assembly and provides hours of entertainment as kids learn  (quickly!) how to balance their fun looking pirate penguins on the Pirate ship. I have seen kinds pratice for hours to get all 16 penguins on board but the fun is when they fall off! Nice quality and great value.
5.0	if you are a marvel fan then this is definitively a must have. The detail is awesome, the figure is heavy and powerful next to smaller collectibles. It looks unstoppable and literally almost destroyed its package as if to be let loose. Buy it<br />now before you regret it for the rest of your life. Display it and pray it doesnt come to life to whip your butt!! If you don't buy then ...thats cool too.
5.0	Such a cute little chess set, yes the pieces all lost their heads in the process of digging them out, but we glued them back on. The journey of digging them out makes them look old and interesting.
1.0	My grown daughter wanted this for x-mas and unfortunately the sea monkeys never grew. She was very disappointed. Save your money'
5.0	My daughter loves this microphone!  She got it for her 4th birthday and both her and my 2 year old son like to walk around and sing with it.  She has learned to memorize the princess songs. She also uses it with her Karoke machine (which is a separate product).  Especially when she has more then one friend come over it gives them an extra microphone so they all have one to sing with.  By hitting the blue button on the bottom and holding it down you can hear yourself without playing music.  Although my son doesn't know the words to the songs he tries to hit the high notes!  lol<BR>Great musical toy for the kids which can also travel to grandma's house!!!
5.0	One of the very best expansions there is. The Ancient Ones are really tough and you have a much higher chance of getting devoured. I love the characters this expansion adds. It shakes things up from original Arkham but keeps all the things that you really love. It's an all around great big box expansion.
5.0	"This dog has replaced my child's previous \\""lovey\\"" (a bear, which we didn't have a back up for). She carries him around everywhere, and plays all sorts of games with him. He's started to look a little dingy these last few weeks, and I realized that this time we should find a back up dog for her to have while we cleaned the other. Now, I can feel safe letting her take him out of the house with us. If he gets lost, we'll have a couple of backups now."
5.0	"While this is not the most \\""educational\\"" toy, my daughter loves the angry birds plushs and even better with sound effects.  Good quality fabric and sound quality."
5.0	Great. He loved them.
5.0	my son loved it for christmas present!<br />He loves all Ninjago lego products.<br />He also got Ninjago Cole's Tread Assault.
1.0	First of all they were all dead except for two, they didn't  last long either now they are all dead for the last two weeks and pet stores sell them and we are afraid that the next batch are going to be dead also that's why I have not order more.
5.0	I was happy to find this game used on Amazon - I am sad that it doesn't appear to be sold new any more. Both my husband and I had fond memories of playing it as kids, and now we are enjoying it with our own kids. The building up of words makes this a great scrabble alternative for kids who are just barely learning how to read - you can use it to practice word families with early readers!
5.0	I like that this game goes quickly, but still has a lot of strategy.  Plus, it's comes in a tiny little package so you can take it everywhere if you want to kill 30 minutes.
5.0	This product is for my 4 grandkids who love everything Lego!!  This set has all the blocks they will need to get started and I will supplement it with Lego kits later.  As Legos are very expensive the price was right on this!!!  Legos are the best kids' toys out there so I highly recommend this to begin a collection.
5.0	love it!!!!!!!!! great price!!!!!!!!!!
5.0	Excellent item, the sculptting is outstanding.
5.0	Great float, great storage, super buy.
5.0	Great purchase!  Everything looks so real and the kids love playing with it all in their kitchen.
5.0	OMG!!! my husband bought these for Christmas for me & i was super excited these are my first good smile nendoroids<br />they look very legit and just as described.
5.0	This backpack was a good value.  Sturdy cloth materials at a good price.  Good size for a toddler.
5.0	I was so happy to find this hook in metal. I had worn that little plastic one out. You just can't find one like this perfect replacement.
5.0	This is the best Activity Table I have ever seen.  It has more activities and is so sturdy.  One-year old granddaughter climbed on top and nothing changed.  Every piece of music and sound still perfect.
5.0	Very cute item. Kids love this product. Worked perfectly with other Brio items. Great quality and child appropriate. Would order more.
5.0	I'm not a Cuber but my 17 year old son is. He was very excited to find this in his Christmas stocking. Who new something so small could bring such joy.
5.0	Good stuff, really sticks. Was able to lift the entire vehicle by the receiver after using this to mount it. not sure how it will holdup if it gets wet but I think it's be ok.
5.0	My grandson love this hammer carries it around with him every where he go now he has collected all of action figures!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1.0	Came broken... so cheap!
5.0	The Melissa & Doug Dress-Up sets are excellent alternatives to traditional paper dolls. They teach young children about getting dressed, are very durable, and are very cute to look at. I also like that they come in a nice wooden box so that you can put all of the pieces back in the box when you are finished playing with your doll.
5.0	My daughter plays with this non-stop and it's contagious. Now the rest of the family use it also. A fun and challenging game.
5.0	We turn on the seahorse every night before bed, my baby loves the music and soft glow. And now that he's getting old enough to hold on to toys, the seahorse is a great size and shape for baby to hold and cuddle with. I will be giving this as a gift at every baby shower I go to from now on!<br /><br />I've read some comments that the batteries are hard to change. The trick is that the entire inner unit comes out, you don't have to try to change them while it's still inside the seahorse. (I like this concept, in case the seahorse ever dies and baby rejects a brand new one, we can switch the new inner unit into the old seahorse shell.)
5.0	Six women dressed up as &#34;helicopter moms,&#34; and ran a relay race that lasted 6 hours topped off with these caps.  They were extremely comfortable and held up in all weather conditions.  I would highly recommend them!
1.0	The stickers are cute but impossible to come off and they won't stick to anything.  They keep ripping when I try to peel them off.
5.0	Truly a great chess set. Don't hesitate because of the lack of reviews.   the pieces are perfectly weighted, and have a classic look.  great price to boot.
5.0	Very good quality for the price!
5.0	This is a great product! I am very pleased with the promptness of the seller. The idem is exactly as described, arrived on time  and in a good package. I tested it and the stamp came out smoothly and clearly. I just love love love it! :) Thank you!!!
5.0	Hours and hours and hours of fun. My friends and I all got these a few years ago. The only downside is their lifespan. I'd say they'll last a hundred hours or so of flight before needing a replacement battery.
5.0	This is a really beautiful doll! Her hair is gorgeous! My granddaughter loves her! Her middle name is Ariel, which made it more precious!
5.0	I bought this puzzle because number one I love to do puzzles and number two my daughter loves elephants.  This puzzle was not very difficult yet still had enough challenge to keep you interested.  My daughter now has it framed and hanging in her room.
5.0	I like these coins.  They were used for vacation bible school for an Egyptian craft and I think they worked out well.  They have a nice weight and filled my expectations.
5.0	I bought this for my 4-year-old daughter and she loves it, especially the hair glitter. She keeps it in with all of her &#34;makeup.&#34; This was a big hit.
5.0	Ralph is big!<br />Ralph is cuddly!<br />My daughter LOVES this guy.<br />Worth the money.<br />Well made and soft.<br />Great item!
5.0	It came ahead of schedule. Perfect for art projects, cute and my 4 year old daughter likes wearing. It can fit kids big or small
5.0	My 3 year old granddaughter loves animals and puzzles....we spent christmas putting this together and she was sooo happy with this present
5.0	This bay is an awesome bay. It has some attack, speed, stamina, and some valence. I really recommend it because it is soooooooo cheap
5.0	My son loves the Melissa and Doug plush linking monkey .  I like that he is able to chew on some of the links but I can still keep it attatched to something.  It is quite a bit bigger than what I expected.  We have had it for about 2 months and he still plays with it.  It is one of his favorites for us to take along with us when we go places.
5.0	I teach a 3rd grade class and my students ask to play this game all the time. I bought it to use as a center activity and did not expect the students to want to play it so much. I might even have to buy another one because only 4 people can play.
5.0	This is a really good set! A challenging but fun build, all the saws really spin! Awesome net launcher and  Dynamite launcher, And even a coffee maker :-). It Has room for extra guys, and also a safe that holds radioactive diamonds.    One thing though; it isn't very educational. Rock Monsters, Though a good idea, are not possible. Anyway, couldn't the humans make an alliance with them? this one, called Geolix, (Gee-oh-lix) Throws Rocks with a lever arm and in awesome.    I don't really know exactly how tough it is, but I think the saws would break. I already dropped Geolix off a table, and nothing on him broke! The net will probably rip if you try, and the Dynamite top Will Snap.    Overall 5 stars, it has a rare net and cockpit too! The stickers glow, but need to be in light first. GET IF AFFORDABLE! 5 STARS!
5.0	This was definitely worth the cost - it came with all 3 egyptian god cards as well as the Blue Eyes, Dark Magician and Red Eyes in Limited Edition.  Although the 6 booster packs are rather old, they still had good cards, some of which I have put in my deck.  The package arrived quickly and if you are an avid lover of yugioh, I highly suggest this product!
5.0	Love this Santa house.hrs of fun and I think I enjoy the house more than my daughters:) my 2 year can't stop pressing the meowing kittens Nad the little light up tree yelling hohoho
5.0	Mickey mouse and the gang!  What a great book to have on the plane ride to Disney!  Kept everyone busy even the adults!
5.0	one of my favorite games to play
5.0	IF any of you Spawn boarders read this, just remember that patience and persistance do pay off sometimes...as long as you have a little luck, like seeing a figure go live at the exact second it's available. Thank you, snowstorm of 1/26/04
1.0	No coins and paid for same day shipping.
1.0	Simply doesn't work, unless it is intended for single use.
5.0	My son loves Scooby Doo.  He takes him everywhere.  Cute toy!  I recommend this toy!
5.0	"This is the perfect game for my 3-year-old boy. The other \\""memory\\"" type games have too many cards, and he seems to lose interest pretty quick, but the \\""cookies\\"" are so fun to put together that he likes to play this game over and over again.  I was very impressed with this game, it was cuter and more fun than I expected."
1.0	These would have been great however when the order arrived more then half the wands did not work. The quality control is seriously lacking with this product.
5.0	My little guy loves his Elmo
5.0	Since original review Vtech has added over 30 new games, books, and creativity downloads.  I am very excited to see what else they come up with.  I am glad I waited to download anything because with the new games that are coming out I want to download everything.  Fits great in a vreader case also  I am wondering if Vtech is going to add anymore downloadable games or even have any protection accessories for this system.  It does seem  so flimsy compaired to the leappad but I am just hoping that they add more.  What I really want is a game where he can trace the letters.  Right now it seems that if I want any educational value I need to add a vreader to my vsmile and just keep using my video now.  I am not sure what this product has to offer that I don't already get with those three.  Am I missing something?
5.0	These were great at a party for 9yo girls. I was happy to have extras because a few were broken early in the party. The kids were happily entertained for an hour or more. The leftover one still gets some play months later.
1.0	This doll is very poorly made.  The boots must be removed before the clothes can be changed and the boots fit very tightly.  When the child pulls the boot off, they are likely to pull the whole leg off and it doesn't go back on.  Sad girls at my house, waiting to hear from Hasbro.
5.0	Haven't played yet, but just reading the details of Harry's world and how it is converted to an RPG is great. Even if I never play, it is money well spent.
5.0	It was what I needed to complete the housing area of the layout. It fit nicely and was a good addition to the layout.
5.0	When I saw this I knew I had to get it! The Play-Doh Crazy Cuts brings back so many memories of my childhood that I had to get it for my nephew. I gave it to him last week and he's played with it almost every day. He loves making the hair grow and taking the scissors and cutting it. So glad that I bought it for him.
5.0	This game is incredibly fun for anyone with a dark sense of humor. I've played it a bunch of times since purchasing it, and it never fails to crack me up. Ordering expansion packs as soon as possible for longevity. Quality cards, convenient box, and quick delivery. Highly recommended.
1.0	My son was so sad when he got a card that he did not order for. He got a secret sect druid wid not secret sect druid dru which he wanted. My son and I were very disapointed.
5.0	This thing is cool, I bought it as a gag gift for my 21 year old but it really does glide over carpet and hard floors really well. I would recommend this toy to anyone
5.0	Perfect, made a wonderful gift!
5.0	I think these were my favorite.<br /><br />I bought them for my little brother's Naruto cards.<br /><br />The color and print are perfect and so is the fit.
5.0	This is super adorable. My daughter loves it!
5.0	We have gotten tons of compliments on these bad boys.  Lots of fun!
5.0	I bought it for my granddaughter for her 4th birthday and she was absolutely excited beyond belief.  She just turned to me and hugged me before she even tried it out.  Her family just moved into a new house that is very open so needless to say she does not walk anywhere, she rides.  I would recommend this to everyone, I will be buying a pony for my other grannddauther in August!!
5.0	"My 10 month old son received this toy as a Christmas gift 3 months ago.  Ever since he opened it, he has been a huge fan.  I was kinda bored by it when I first saw it because it is so simple.  Its got the best qualities of a classic toy with the added benefit of cute sounds and happy, non-annoying music!  My son plays with the blocks, \\""feeds\\"" the alligator, pushes the alligator, pulls the alligator and inspects the wheels.  Out of all his toys, this is THE toy he always returns to!"
5.0	Cool and interesting card add-on, makes the game even more fun to play.
1.0	They were plastic balls- not ping pong balls - would not bounce - very disappointed! I would not recommend these if you are wanting ping pong balls
5.0	Works just fine, cheap little toy that makes the grandchildren laugh because the boat &#34;toots&#34; and you know what that means to little kids.
5.0	My dd starting playing with it at 2 and honestly, she was a bit young. Now that she is 2.5, she can manipluate the stylus great and use all the features. She has Leo's classroom that came with it and Dora that we bought. She loves them both. They both have interactive books and wonderful art features with clip art and differnt ways she can add her name or change colors and pen tips.     I like the book on Leo's classroom and the different science biomes. The interactive book contains every letter of the alphabet and she can drag in differnt items that begin with each letter and the book reads itself highlighting each word as it is narrated.  The Dora software has a smaller book and a more limited science section.     I've owned it for 6 months now. She has banged it, colored on it, plugged it rapidly and done everything a toddler can do to it, and it is still working fine. : )    Right now, I want to buy another software program for it, and it appears that some retailers are charging an arm and legg for software. Buyer beware!  I got the system, Leo's classroom, and Dora for less than $50.00. I see some are charging $100 just for Leo's classroom!
5.0	Use these to create mansions, Olympic swimming pools, garages, towns, etc. Greats set of Lego bases to add to any collection.
5.0	Items received quickly and just as pictures!  Grandsons love them!
5.0	We purchased this dummy phone for our 15 month old daughter at Christmas. Because her dad has a flip phone (still!) she loves to say &#34;Hello&#34; on her phone. She loves to flip it open and closed. She loves that the buttons really depress.<br />This is a phone that you would see at the cell phone store meant to simply show the physical attributes of the phone. It does not have functioning phone parts.<br />Perfect for our baby in our current situation. I am sure when my husband switches to a smart phone, we will not be so lucky with a &#34;dummy&#34; phone for our young one.
5.0	We bought this toy for my son when he was 5 months old.   He was always interested in it, even though he couldn't get it to work on his own.   He is now 7 months old and he can get it to work on his now, but not with the rattle.   When he screams, Pooh dances, when he plays with other loud toys, Pooh dances.
5.0	Very good quality. It took me awhile to put the kitchen together, but it is worth it.
5.0	Came earlier than expected.  Was great for children's bday party
5.0	My grandson loved it.  Delivered on time.
5.0	This is a fun game! We played the 2 player version but could see it being more fun with more players there would be a lot more strategy with extra players! I would definitely recommend for those who enjoy Clue! We bought ours from Barnes and Noble.
5.0	I bought this for my oldest son when he was four...having no experience with video games this was great.  He learned to play games along with learning many preschool skills that he was reluctant to do with traditional teaching methods.  It is so simple to learn that my two and a half year old picked up on it as well.  They were able to advance the levels on the games with unlimited lives to make it more interesting.  This game can progress with your child.  For Christmas I bought the pocket v-smile which is like a gameboy sort of and all of their games still work...but do not buy the paint station as it doesn't work and is a poor design even if it did.....
5.0	She just knows Elmo but she is having fun with Super Grover 2.0 , the mini mini videos are a plus for this game since you have to pay for them in LeapFrog.<br />My daughter is almost 3 years old and it was easy for her to play the games , when she make a mistake , Elmo and friends let her know why she is wrong and try again. You have to earn stickers to make some machines (that's kind of fun) and to find them , you need to choose a tool and clean the confetti (She loves this part). With Abby you have 2 games , one for balance and one with a boat that part is fun as well , all the game is fun fun fun!!<br />I pay $6.99 for this game and SOOOO WORTH IT!! Who said that having a Leappad is expensive?? Even Innotab games run around $10.00! Amazon has the best prices even if you pay shipping!<br /><br />By the way , we are using it on Leappad 3 :)
1.0	Color was terrible and not period correct!  Tipical China rip off!!!!!
5.0	I bought these for little croc shoes.  They did not over whelm the shoe... infact I like them more than I really thought I would and have already bought more.  They are made out of rubber and well made. The colors are great and this seller is super fast with delivery.  I really like these flowers and so will my grand daughter.
5.0	Now, I mean to tell you, I am a great dragon fan. I am one of the biggest dragon fans. This dragon will get lots of love from my grandson, I'm sure of it. I know that he loves dragons too. This is so well made, I am so pleased. Well packaged and arrived on time.
5.0	THIS GAME IS THE BEST THING EVER, mind you, you have to have the base game.
5.0	My daughter is in first grade and this is helped a lot when we work on her math homework. My son who is 4 also likes making patterns and using it to count. Also you can always count on a quality product from Melissa and Doug.
5.0	My daughter is so in love with this Pony i purchased two because she puts hair products on the hair and messes it all up ...i keep one on the shelf because its such a pretty design
5.0	This was a very nice piñata.  It goes well with a general train theme.  It is flat on the sides and you really cannot tell that from the picture, so I was surprised by that.  It is cute though and holds a lot of stuff.  It is also very sturdy and well constructed...it took some strength to break it.
5.0	My 11 month old nephew loves this drum set.
5.0	I thought the owl was very realistic. I really thought it was very nice.I would recommend it to anyone. Looks better in person.
5.0	I bought this for my 2 year old when she became interested in my iPod touch...she is now about to turn 3 and I absolutely love that I know my iPod touch is safe and sound from drops while she is watching movies or playing games on it.  She got it off the counter one day while it was charging and dropped it and cracked the screen.  She has dropped it before in the case and it has always kept it safe.  It's nice that it has the handles on it so little hands can grip it without accidentally hitting the screen and it has an option when they are younger to turn it around so they can't hit the home button at the bottom and as they get older you can turn it back so they can use this button to navigate without having to take it out of the case each time.  I loved this feature because she was always hitting the home button and I constantly had to reopen a game or movie.  I think she will use this for many more years so it's not just for baby's it's for the parent's peace of mind as well!  Definitely worth every penny I paid for it!!
5.0	This is so awesome. I got so many compliments from people on Halloween. Great constume. A little hard to see through at night but, something you can get used to.
5.0	Everything works great and my 5 year old loves it. It's nice that it has a headphone jack so you don't have to hear it when you don't want to. Very educational
5.0	birthday girl loves it!
5.0	My daughters love puzzles and princesses. This one was a huge hit with my then 2.5 year old. She learned it so well in a few months that by the time she turned 3, she was putting together 48 piece puzzles without any help. I'd recommend this only for the very young ones...might be boring for anyone older than that.
1.0	Takes hours to set up game and all components, and another hour or so (depending on how much brain power you exert) to learn the novel of rules/how to's.     UGH - a big let down... I hope I can return it:(
5.0	EXCELLENT PRODUCT AND SERVICE
5.0	It just makes me happy, and my g'kids think of it as telling them they've arrived at my house, no matter where I'm living. Also very durable -- this is my second, but the first lasted through many, many seasons, summer and winter.
5.0	Bought this for my nephew for xmas so this review is way late. But he loved it and wanted to open them all at once. I will definitely buy again as a gift.
5.0	Awesome! Got some rare cards
5.0	Very nice print and thick paper.  Should hold up well for the parade.
5.0	He loves them could not find them at any toy store, they have held up great! One of his favorite bath time toys!<br />Fast shipping A+
5.0	Cool card.  Looks great... The kid approves.  Oh, and fast delivery, too.
5.0	This is a great charger.  Quality construction, easy to use menuing, and puts a very good (balanced) charge on the batteries.  The Storage mode puts them right at 50% with all cells within .01 volts.  It is great charging 4 batteries at a single time and coming back 1 hour later and ready to fly.
5.0	After reading all the reviews I was terrified to put this thing together.  When I pulled the directions out of the box I couldn't even decipher the first picture, so I Googled directions and found this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WCv-QKewe7M  I put the Dream House together in less than 10 minutes with the help of these two lovely people.  They do leave out the installation of the bathroom walls, but I was able to look at the picture on the box and figure that out.  The small bathroom sink fixtures and such are lumped together in baggies with the plastic food and clothes, but it's not rocket science to sort the stuff out and install it.  I had this thing out of the box, assembled, small parts installed, and my daughter was happily playing with it all within 20 minutes. Keep the directions in the box to see where all the stickers go.<br /><br />As a toy it is great. My 5 year old loves it and I feel it is rather sturdy.  My daughter loves to watch the toy lady videos on You Tube so when we got this she knew all the bells and whistles already.  It has been a hit and a great birthday present for our Barbie Girl! :)
5.0	my 6 month old grandbabies love this toy...
5.0	My daughter starting playing with this at a little over a year old... I just didn't give her the utensils. Now that she is 20 months... she really seems to enjoy it more. There is some minor paint chipping, but that might have something to do with the rough play she exposes it to! I would buy this again!
5.0	quija boards are the best! there are some problems though because sometimes they dont work that well and that night you can try it over and over again that night but a spirit just wont talk! on the back on the quija board it says to wait 1 to five minutes so if your not patcient then on some nights, this toy is not for you. most of the time it works well and fast! one time i talked to and indian from the 1500s! its amazing what you can learn. and if you are going to play with one then make sure you say a prayer to make sure no evil spirits come and haunt you. but if you do that then you will be fine! i promise. its a wonderful experience and im sure you will be very happy with the results you get! enjoy this amazing oracle like i have and will for as long as i live!
5.0	Got this for my 1st grader's animal project.  It is the perfect size to fit in a shoebox for a diarama scene.
5.0	Perfect toy for one year old and older. Starting hand coordination and these mega lego blocks work great. No safety issues what so ever.<br />Would definitely recommend.
1.0	3 year old grand daughter loves Doc Mcstuffin so ordered her this and she can't close or open the case, it sticks and is TOO HARD.  Why don't you have the one like Doc has on tv with the 2 handles that open in the middle.  NOT satisfied...IF it would not break her heart I would return.
5.0	Realistic, safe and sturdy and kids love making salad with it.
5.0	Beautiful. My son loved it. Will order from you again in the future.
5.0	My daughter is 16 months so I got this as a stocking stuffer. It works well and says funny little things but it doesn't teach her anything she doesn't already know. She's advanced for her age though  I would recommend this for 6-12 months. It's very sturdy and she loves playing with it still! Cute toy for a cheap price!(:
5.0	"I mentioned I was disappointed in Lagoona from the series but not here Howleen looks amazing. The wild paw print dress looks great although I admit it does seem a bit 80's like some have said but I say so what? I grew up in the 80's and yeah, we had style extreme. The beanie she wears is a nice touch and not something I thought I would like but actually do. Love how her ears poke out through it. Her lipstick and hair is done in Hot Pink and I love it. Makes me want to color my hair hot pink. She also wears knee high boots and comes with her pet \\""Cushion\\"" Clawdeen better watch out. Her little sister is definitely going to be stealing lots of attention."
5.0	Perfect and hilarious
5.0	"Pros:<br />- great quality, so far hasn't chipped or been dented by my 1 year old<br />- doesn't flip over as much as other pull toys. (we have another one that is made out of wood by Skip Hop that falls over easily)<br />- tail wags and makes clicking noises when pulled (not necessarily barks, but still holds a toddler's attention)<br />- wheels have a rubber covering, preventing it from flipping all the time<br />- colors are bold, doesn't get dirty easily since the plastic is slippery. very easy to wipe clean.<br />- the length of the string was perfect for my 31\\"" tall son. I can understand why some reviewers complain about how short the string is, but I think it's a good length. when the string is too long, a toddler can easily trip on it while pulling it. The chances of strangulation is not as high as tripping.. i think).<br />- not too heavy or too light - perfect weight for a pull toy! Some pull toys are too light (flips over too easily) and some are too heavy where the toddler might pick it up and accidentally drop it on his or her foot (some vintage pull toys maybe heavier)<br /><br />Cons:<br />- no cons so far, i think the string length is perfect for my son's height. I read the description and other reviews a few times before getting it, and nothing was a surprise when i finally did get it.<br /><br />Overall, keep in mind that:<br />1) this dog doesn't actually bark (if that is important)<br />2) take note of the string length, and see if it is suitable for your toddler's height. I can imagine if a taller toddler used this toy, he or she might not be as keen on pulling it.<br />again, my son's height is 31 inches, and has no problem pulling it with ease.<br /><br />Also, one of the reviewers were concerned whether or not this pull along toy was BPA free, I found a link online which has listed Ambi Toys as a PVC-Free manufacturer (dated 2010). I also found on other sites indicating that their new line of toys are mostly BPA free:<br />[...]<br /><br />Myson doesn't ever chew or bite on this pull along toy so far, and I always clean his toys with gentle detergents (I heard harsh detergents can bring out BPA) - so I am not as concerned weather this toy specifically is BPA free or not. I think toys that are meant for chewing or look tempting to chew on should be BPA free, personally, I feel anything that is put in in the mouth should be BPA free. However, since this looks more fun to pull than chew on, I can easily over look it."
5.0	Our son loves trains. We redecorated his room In a train theme. This has held up well to many many finger touches. Since it was laminated we hung it lower on the wall, so he could look at the trains close up. He has spent many hours counting the trains and talking about their colors, how many wheels, which ones are big and small. Since I don't know a lot about the history of trains I can not attest to the accuracy of the info provided. But for a kids train room it's a must.
5.0	My son wanted a toy ambulance for his 4th birthday. He was very specific it had to be large, with functioning doors and lights. This toy fit the bill. My husband and I both work in health care, we both got a kick out of all the extras that came with the ambulance ( the iv bag and defibrillator to name a few)!
5.0	My grandson loved this little tin. I will probably buy him another one. Very sturdy, Looks and feels like a small lunch box.
5.0	Wonderful old-fashioned learning activity for pre-schoolers
5.0	I had read reviews for this on amazon.com and I had a good idea of what the camera is like. What I didn't realize is how much my 4 year old would enjoy it.  I am a long time amateur photography, and he loves pictures and was always wanting to use my cameras. He got this toy for Christmas two days ago and this is the toy he has played with the most.  His first photos were not well composed, but with a little instruction and demonstation, he now takes pictures of people instead of parts of people.  He has learned what the buttons on the back of the camera are for and uses them.  I love the internal memory and the ability to erase. The camera is well designed for little hands. The two eye viewfinder is good for little people and I wish i had that on my cameras. We have not put any of his photos on the computer and printed them....he's too busy taking them.  Picture quality is not the greatest, but the pleasure he gets from the camera more than makes up for that. He thinks the quality is ok and that's what really counts.
5.0	The Iron Man and Captain America shield backpack clips are actually containers that hold a card game in each. The card games are rather simple but they can be a bit confusing at first. I was pleasantly surprised to find out that half the cards in both games featured my favorite Marvel villain LOKI!<br />The material feels sturdy and the lids snap shut pretty well. However, I haven't actually tried clipping it onto a bag so I can't say how well it would hold up on a child's backpack.
5.0	This was a big hit with my 6 year old grandson! The figures were well made and just right for 'little' fingers. Thanks!
5.0	My 9 year old daughter loves it
1.0	Boy I guess it sure does pay to read between the lines print..  The way the item read I thought I was getting all 8 that are in the picture. NOT JUST THREE!! Especially for the PRICE $$$$$$ WOW.. You sure did TEACH Me... Don't expect any repeat business here...    M. Ford
1.0	I have ordered three of these now. So far 2 have come with a &#34;bad&#34; motor. One flies like a champ, the other two seem to really struggle to stay up. One has already had a motor die. They are cheap but can be fun if you get one that works.
5.0	Barbie that wonder doll with everything in the in world to go with her. Bought this for my Grand daughters as well they loved it of course. I remember my daughters have a convertible for their Barbie's as well, this is a toy that all little girls would love, if they like Barbie.....the grand sons even stuff little stuffed animals in the car and drive it around!
5.0	I love this toy the first time I saw it!<br />Its sound is very nice and there are 3 variety songs if you press the head. If you would like to stop the music, simply press any one of its 8 legs.<br />Its bottom has a nice pattern and very attractive to a baby.<br />In sum, this toy is very good for its price!
5.0	Got this for my daughter as a gift. She adores it & that she can use it as both a pillow & a night light. She likes falling asleep to it lighting stars on her ceiling in different colors. A wonderful gift.
5.0	Great learning tool for your child, I know because my sister told me that when I bought it for her grandson, he started to pick it up so easy and starting learning more quickly.
5.0	beautiful dresses. my daughter loves them
5.0	It is totally worth!!! Much better than buying AA batteries every 4 to 5 days. Now my daughters charge their leappad for 1 hour and can use it for many, many, many hours without having to charge it again.
1.0	Once you get past about seven, the items are hard to count. I tried to help her count them and found the patterns confusing.  I am a college professor of Mathematics Education and this is not worth buying. You can create your own with common items. Write numbers on cards (make as fancy as you wish). Mix the cards and spread out so all are visible.  Get 20 raisins, Cheerios, M&M's or anything you like. Put out varying numbers of the item. When the child has identified the various numbers, let him/her eat the &#34;game as a treat.
5.0	My son has so much fun with this and it is perfect for his age!
5.0	been a dbz fan since it aired on cartoo networks' toonami back in the late 90s / early 2000s<br />It looks like goku jumped right out of the tv<br /><br />he wear real cloth martial come with 2 differnt hair peices one with a halo<br />and 3 different faces happy serious and Peed off and finally a display stand.<br /><br />the are making a regular base goku<br />a piccolo one coming out in april 2015<br />a vegeta and a broly one
5.0	I bought this for my granddaughter for her 3rd birthday. She really enjoys playing it. Good game to have and share those special moments..
5.0	He is fantastic! I bought this as a Christmas gift for my 15 year old who loves giraffes. She loves him! I don't see this being a great gift for small children as I think it would lose its shape with them playing on it, but for older kids, its great. It is very soft and stands perfectly! Just get ready because he will startle you everytime you see him until you get used to him being there. He's made my heart jump several times when I round the corner to go in her room.
5.0	If you have never played Fluxx but you enjoy card or board games then give it a try. They have several flavors (themes) and each can play a little different. This is the original and a great starting point if you are new to the game's mechanics.
5.0	"I bought this for my daughter's first birthday, and she's played with it every day since. Her favorite part is the star mirror, and her second favorite is the phone. It doesn't make sound or anything like that, but this is not an issue as my daughter will use anything as a \\""phone\\"". In fact, today she carried around an envelope pressed to her ear saying \\""Hi! Hi papa!\\"". One handle of the purse has come apart slightly at the seam, but it is a great toy overall, and I highly recommend it."
5.0	These are great toys for dogs-- the laughter really engages them!  Just monitor them so they don't eat the batteries when they rip it apart.
5.0	We bought these to use as decor and party favors for my son's birthday. The ones we ended up with are still totally full of air two months later, even after being played with by my little guys. (And they're anything but gentle with their toys!). Totally pleased with this product.
5.0	My daughter was very happy with this cow!
5.0	these little puppets make everyone happy<br />small enough to carry around yet big enough to be expressive<br />this cookie monster one is bigger than the others
5.0	Though the stuff you can put in it has to be rather flat, but it is still cute and it works well with the Trunki.  My daughter loves to carry it around.
5.0	OK, this is the only wagon I've ever owned but it is so good I'm willing to endorse it. My little boy loves going for rides around the neighborhood in it. When the sun is out we use the canopy and it really helps.<br /><br />We've even used this wagon to bring groceries and heavy items from are car to the house. You'll love it.
5.0	Bought it for my granddaughter's second birthday and it couldn't have been a better entertainment center. Granted it was hot in Boston but at one point there were four adults taking turns sitting n the pool!!,
5.0	Excellent lego product.  My son enjoyed this set.
5.0	This game is fun and great for a game night.  It plays quickly and is easy to learn.  I have played this game quite a bit because it is easy for me to teach it to my friends.  This is a good option to play for the first few people who show up to game night, it moves quick enough that new arrivals are not left out for long.  It is a fun little deduction game.
5.0	For the price this is a pretty good buy. There are other places where you could get a ton of used cards cheap, but they are used and these are in mint condition! If you watched the show, opening up these booster packs will give you both nostalgia and excitement.
5.0	great item for long car trips..  glad I went with the plastic rather than the cardboard version.  My son did puzzles, coloured and played with flash cards on it.  I also sat his dvd player on it...
5.0	Love the show and this talking bobblehead comes with some classic quotes from Jamie. Of course, the fact that he looks just like my hubby (down to the walrus mustache!) has nothing to do with it. ;) Love and recommend it for all Mythbuster fans!!
5.0	nice deign but too small for a 4 years old
5.0	9 year old grandson loves this - got it in October and still playing with the &#34;put together&#34; plane.
5.0	"What a fun game!  We played this while camping.  Super for all ages, kid to adult.  We didn't even need a table, we played it in our laps around the campfire.  This would make a nice gift too, for a great \\""non-electronic\\"" choice. Other things I love about this: no need to keep score, no math or reading, no board or game pieces or paper money, no complex setup or cleanup. No winners or losers, just laughs for everyone.  Throw it in your pocket or purse and you have a game on-the-go. Play it in the car.  This game is convenient and fun in so many ways!"
5.0	I love these rockers!  These are the gifts for my kids' first birthday.  Every kid needs a rocker.  When my oldest turned one and received this (his was the monkey one though, this frog one was purchased for my youngest whose birthday is in a month) he couldn't sit on it yet, but he would stand next to it and rock it back and forth while we played the songs. The songs, which can be on the bit of the annoying side (but what kids toy isn't?!) taught colors, shapes, and letters which is great and now my oldest likes to sing along! Very durable, worth the money, and cute and unique gifts for any personality considering there are a lot of designs out there, so go check them out and pick the best most cutest one for your own kid!
5.0	Bring to life the story of Easter with this 3-D View-Master reels set. This is a great way to teach from the Bible in a way children can see and understand.<br /><br />This set contains 3 reels.<br /><br />Most kids, ages 1-6 find the View-Master intriguing and fun to play with. The reels can be a bit flimsy but they're surprisingly durable.
5.0	My husband loves this!
5.0	Arrived in perfect condition
5.0	Great model! All the parts fit rather well together. Very happy.
5.0	This look as shown. Good quality, good price loads of fun!  Product was early, and packed very well.  Thank You
5.0	Despite some negative reviews I read about the sound, I did buy this for my daughter.  She LOVES it!  It has three modes (one that labels the parts, one that gives you directions for food prep, and one for songs).  Plus you can turn it off or take out the batteries if the sounds annoy you.  It even turns off automatically after a few minutes if it isn't being used.  We have very little storage space and play area in our house so any toy that is 2-in-1 is okay in my book.  To be honest, she not only uses this as a shopping cart and kitchen, but she also puts blankets in the basket and strolls around her baby dolls too.
5.0	Great quality and cute design!
5.0	Great puzzle.  My family had fun with it.  Pieces are thick and durable.  Picture is cute.  It is somewhat challenging.
5.0	These are a real hit with kids.
5.0	this is an excellent product. It makes creating 3 letter words a game, plus teaches children to sound out words, which is the key building block to being a good reader. Highly recommend this for kids 4-8 yrs old
5.0	My mother-in-law gave the aquarium to my younger son for his first Christmas (he was 6 months old then). He's almost 1 1/2 and still loves the sounds, especially the ocean waves with the lights. <br />Kevin's first few months were difficult as we thought he had colic, and then was diagnosed with reflux (making him uncomfortable laying down). I didn't think the aquarium would work, but it put him to sleep every time I used it. And he loves  to play with the buttons in the morning when he wakes up, so he can entertain  himself for quite a while. <br />The only drawback is the setting with the bubbles, lights, and sound. The mechanism that generates the bubbles is a little loud and  you have to turn the sound up to counteract that, which defeats its purpose at bedtime. But to me that is just a minor glitch.  I just leave it set on music and lights at night.
5.0	i loved it i take the thing with me everywhere its not only great looking but very soft i recommend it
5.0	Great toy. A little smaller width-wise than I expected, but still good quality.
5.0	My daughter wanted a more expensive set for her birthday.  I stumbled across this product in the reccommended section.  I am a fan of Melissa & Doug products and decided for the price, I will try this instead.  I'm glad I did becuase not only does my daughter love it, I do too! We serve sushi to her dolls at her tea party, so adorable!
5.0	They're definitely not the same color as shown.  The faces on the shells are brown, but the chicks inside are purple, blue and orange (not all brown or 70's colors like other people said).  The box is easy to open also (a lot of other reviews said it was hard to open, maybe they changed it since?).<br /><br />I bought them for my 6month old and she loves them.  They are super easy to squeek (and not loud) so she can get them to do it usually.  She brought them to daycare and even the older kids like them and ask where the eggs are if we don't bring them.  They're one of the best toys especially for the money.
5.0	I'm an adult woman and I ordered this for myself. That may sounds lame, but I enjoyed it so much. I found a lot of it tricky and don't know that children would be that good at it, but I think it's a great value.
5.0	Excellent board game. Haven't regretted my purchase
5.0	My daughter loves this pop up.  The nose makes a noise when she pushes it!  Very cute toy for little ones.
5.0	I purchased this for my 3 year old son. This little truck has some power to it and can pull office chairs (with wheels) and the like fairly easily. It's easy to use and although repetitive, it 'says' some funny stuff. The truck can push or pull objects and offers clear auditory instructions on how to use the truck.<br /> My son loves this toy, I recommend it.
5.0	This fit my son perfectly, 6 years old.  He wore this multiple times, not just for halloween but also to play.  I am surprised at how well this has held up.  Any costume that can hold up to MY boys deserves a gold medal!!!!
5.0	My 3yr old LOVES his &#34;dirtbike like daddys&#34;
5.0	Nice breadboard.  Power binding posts could be nicer quality, but they work.
5.0	My sons thought these were soooooo cool! They have really enjoyed playing with them, and brought back great memories of Sonic the Hedgehog!  They even went as Sonic one year for Halloween!  So adorable!
5.0	I haven't actually seen this thing in action but I've heard that my 1 year old and 4 year old nephews love it.
5.0	Same with Cleo too 😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃
5.0	I bought these to use in the Pre-K classroom where I work and I have found them to be very educational and very well made. If they can withstand a room of 20 3 and 4 year olds them yup.... I say they are pretty durable! There are plenty of different ways you can learn by playing with this toy including colors, sorting, math and of course pretend play. We studied what was a fruit and what was a vegetable, figured out which colors had more or less than and of course we sat up a whole farmers market in the playground and enjoyed some &#34;real&#34; food that matched our &#34;play&#34; fruits and veggies!! We have been having a ball with them. Highly recommend for the 3-4 age group.
5.0	His left leg was messed up but other then that he was fine.
5.0	ANOTHER GOOD PRODUCT FROM THE EVER-RELIABLE LEGO-HOURS OF FUN AND SO MANY WAYS TO USE THE IMAGINATION-I HAVE WATCHED THE CHILDREN PLAY WITH THEIR LEGO AND NOW I AM WATCHING THE GRANDCHILDREN GET SO MUCH PLEASURE FROM THEIRS.
5.0	So fun! Definitely a must if your trying out belly dancing or zumba, great price. Light weight fabric and lots of jingling
5.0	Everything my son wanted
5.0	"This toy is fantastic! We were originally introduced to it through \\""Toygaroo\\"" and when my son couldn't get enough of it, we ended up purchasing it once it was time to be returned.     One, you can somewhat customize the toy with the child's name, a few particuular songs, and e-mails from mom and dad (which my little guy LOVES!) The different letter settings are great, too, and I hear my son in the backseat copying, \\""S! Makes the sssss sound!\\"" Letter sounds are so much more important than letter names and I love the fact that he's learning to differentiate the two.    By far our BEST car toy. Pictures come alive on the laptop screen which is most definitely entertaining.    All in all, GREAT toy!! We have a few leapfrog products and have never been disappointed."
5.0	This was my grandsons favorite Christmas gift.  I don't think he has put it down yet. He even sleeps with it.  Seems very durable.
5.0	I loved it! Figures are colorful and detailed! Using it as a mini play set! Totally exceeded my expectations! Wow!
5.0	Wife loved this puzzle
5.0	"Our son got this as a gift when he was still too young for it, but lately it's been attracting his attention more and more.  I've always thought it was extremely clever, and his new focus made me go online just to see how it was priced.  Three quick points:  (1) Its current price, while not cheap (<$30 as of this writing), is NOT BAD AT ALL for such quality design and craftsmanship.  (2) I was disappointed to see that nobody had yet reviewed it, so I decided to start the process myself, which I've never done before on Amazon, not even for books.  (3) I was also pleasantly surprised (though in retrospect I guess I shouldn't have been) that this great \\""real world\\"" toy is made by Leap Frog, which is the same company that makes this Christmas's hottest new toy, the Leap Frog LeapPad Explorer (a sort of ruggedized \\""iPod Touch\\"" for kids), which I ALSO bought for him a few weeks ago, and which is also excellent.  Regarding the AlphabetPal itself: adorable design, great construction, high-low volume switch for frazzled parent nerves(!).  The caterpillar's 26 legs each sport a button with a letter of the alphabet, and the buttons alternate in color (red, yellow, green, blue).  A multi-setting switch changes what these buttons do:  one setting speaks the name of the letter (\\""A\\"", \\""B\\"", \\""C\\"" etc.), another setting provides the primary phonetic sound associated with each letter (\\""aaa\\"", \\""buh\\"", \\""kuh\\"" etc.), a third setting says the color of each button (RYGB), a fourth setting has each of the 26 buttons play a different well-known melody (everything from \\""Chopsticks\\"" and \\""Farmer in the Dell\\"" to \\""Yellow Rose of Texas\\"" and \\""Greensleeves\\"") - there's also an OFF setting.  Finally, it rolls, and has a sturdy tow-line attached in front.  And in another neat design flourish, the back wheels have an off-center axle (making them cams, effectively), which impart a rocking up and down wobble as Mr. Caterpillar \\""walks\\"".  Can't say enough positive things about this toy.  FYI, I'm NOT associatedin any way with the company.  I guess I'm gushing like only a (relatively) new parent can.  (Surprises even me! =D)"
5.0	My daughter was constantly getting up so early, but this clock has fixed it!  She loves watching the colors change and knows now to stay in her room until her clock turns to yellow (morning).  The music at bedtime is nice and we've also used the timeout and encouragement features... we love to race the clock to see how quickly we can clean her room, brush her teeth, etc...<br /><br />Overall, a great purchase and well worth the money!!
5.0	I have used several Mahjong sets and this is the finest of them all.  The larger tiles are perfect to grab, especially if your hands are stiff. They are also a solid color.  The tiles have smooth, rounded edges and slide easily on a table or cloth.  The symbols are inset and should last a long, long time.  Numbers and western characters are provided.  The box is beautiful.  It even comes with a wind indicator and three dice.  A perfect set.
5.0	"This version of Universal Studio's Frankenstein's monster is from the second --- and final time --- with the SHORTEST of the actors<br />playing THE monster with NO name: Bela \\""Dracula\\"" Lugosi. In the movie [[ASIN:B00005LC4K Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man]], the 6'2\\"" Lon Chaney,Jr.,<br />(as The Wolf Man)[who played Frankensteins Monster a few times himself] TOWERS over Bela in the \\""meeting\\"".<br /><br />The movie is infamous as being a second-chance for Bela to be THE monster... after turning it down in, what?, 1931. Karloff not only<br />accepted THAT non-speaking part AND the first MUMMY roll, but became a more successful actor while Lugosi was typecast as \\""Dracula\\""<br />because of his \\""familiar\\"" accent which is why while his voice contributed to the first film's VOICE of the --- now --- speaking, but BLIND,<br />monster [Bela Lugosi]. In [[ASIN:B00005LC4K Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man]] every single bit of Lugosi's dialogue was CUT because the test-audience<br />laughed, and made \\""DRACULA!\\"" comments. The monster is BLIND in this film, but you DON'T know this unless you are familiar with the<br />previous film.

5.0	This little cupcake kitchen was reasonably priced, simple to assemble, and my granddaughter absolutely loves it. I definitely recommend it!
5.0	We opened the game and both our 6 and 4 yr old grandsons were able to play this game (with just a little help). It gives the concept of the original monopoly game in ways they can understand and enjoy. It kept their interest; they really liked having their own money and using it to buy the parties/properties. It's great for reinforcing their numbers/counting.I also liked that it's not a huge time commitment to play - you can stop after 15 minutes like it says; but more realistically, we played for about 30 because we wanted them to have the chance to buy up all the party/property spaces.
5.0	Great response.  Great product.
5.0	Great variety and selection. My 6 year old is through the moon.
5.0	My daughter already had a doodler and we needed to buy one for my 2 1/2 year old. He loves it. He loves Toy Story so this was perfect, he has used it for almost a month now and he hasnt destroyed it yet, which is pretty good for me. The little writter thingy has help up and is still attached, he loves to swing it by that! It is a little small but very portable for the car and long trips. Keeps my 2 year old busy so it is good.
5.0	I bought this set of as my grandson calls them diggers . This is a great set for the little ones imagination , it has little road construction cones ,bulldozers,Simi trucks , concrete truck , road construction crew workers ,lots of street signs, dump truck, helicopter and  lots of other vehicles. I thought that the  vehicles would be all diecast , but their not. I still give a five star  because it's a cool little digger set and my  grandson loves it.
5.0	This was purchased for a Christmas gift for a 3 year old that wanted anything and everything related to Doc McStuffins.
5.0	This is my second one of these, a family favorite.
5.0	Great toy and my girls love it. I can't use it for what I need because of the poles but otherwise great product.
1.0	Bought for my boys, who asked for Candyland, and my 3 year old said, &#34;this isn't the candyland I play at school.  We don't have these girls on it.&#34;  Sure enough, this hypersexualized mini-skirt, bustier-wearing version of candyland is nothing like the one we all grew up with and loved.  Even if the sexual undertones were toned down a bit, the new layout and pictures just aren't that interesting or cool.  It looks like Bratz or Anime exploded into the game.<br />Very disappointed in you Hasbro.
5.0	"My favorite Enterprise is the Refit from the original 1979 movie and the new Enterprise from the 2009 movie has taken a while to grow on me but I do like it.    The Enterprise in review here is smaller than the other Playmates ships that were created in the past and not as sturdy. It is 14 5/8\\""long X 7\\"" wide X 3 3/4\\"" tall. And it has a clear,blue ball and socket stand with a silver painted Star Trek (badge symbol)base. The stand measures 4 1/2\\"" tall and the base is 3 3/4\\"" wide X 6 1/4\\"" long.     The color of the ship is basically gray plastic with no decals but painted on details such as some gray panels and a few windows and the NCC-1701 badge and the red Star Trek streak thats on most of the ships. The ship is not highly detailed but looks okay.    The ship does light up which I do like and it has an on/off switch on the bottom and at the very top of the saucer section is a blue,plastic,dome button that activates lights and sounds.    All lights include,blue deflector array light;blue nacelle lights at front,bottom,top and rear;blue dome light at bottom of saucer section and three little rectangular lights around dome button at top of saucer section.Also at the rear of saucer section are the red impulse engine lights.All lights also have a fade in and out effect that is cool.    When you push the action button there are four different actions that happen. One is,Kirk says,\\""arm phasers,fire everything we got!\\"" followed by three phaser blasts with lights flickering to the phaser shots. Two is,Kirk says,\\""maneuvering thrusters mister Sulu\\"" as all blue lights are steady on. Three is,Spock says,\\""capitain,engineering reports ready to launch\\"" followed by a warp explosion sound with all blue lights on and the red impulse lights at warp sound. Effect four is the \\""red alert\\"" siren with all lights strobing.The effect is cool looking.     The effect voices and sound effects are the actors and sounds from the movie but I dont think all the light effects are accurate.    The ship comes in a nice,large box with very nice photos on it.    Keep in mind,I got the item,to the house,for about 15.00. For the money you cant go wrong and you will be satisfied. I just ordered the same ship by Hot Wheels and its less than half the size and does not do anything and was about the same money(I'm talking value as of 9-14-2011)     I am putting together a Enterprise Refit model and just to light it is going to cost me about 40-50 bucks.     The 2009 Playmates USS Enterprise NCC-1701 (no collectors # on this one;stock#61931) is the best Star Trek collectable deal going right now,in my opinion."
5.0	I have a 1 year old who loved playing with these at his Dr's office. The price was a bit steep, but i took the plunge and I am so glad I did! They are big and soft so they don't hurt when he throws them at me ;-) He loves watching me build him towers and loves knocking them down. We have had them for a little over a month and he probably plays with them at least a couple times a week, its one of his favorite toys. So far the quality has held up and I don't see any of the color coming off of the vinyl. I will try to remember to update this in a couple of months to update on how they hold up.
5.0	The Street Fighter line Bishoujo is absolutely gorgeous. These statues are slightly larger than the traditional Bishoujo line. The level of detail and paint is amazing. I highly recommend.
1.0	"I was somewhat happy to get this because my sister really wanted a Gizmo. But I am very dissapointed by the seller's misleading description. They claim that the product is 4.3 x 11 x 9.3 inches ; 1 pounds. This is not true. It measures 6\\"" tall by 8\\"" wide (earspan). This is false advertising! Amazon ought to do something about this seller. Another person left the same feedback and still the seller has neglected to change the product description. This is misleading bull****, I want the product I paid for. People beware."
5.0	Wonderful quality and made in USA!  These blocks have been a big hit with our ten month old.  I'm so glad I spent extra for the pull wagon, too.  He loves it!
5.0	My son loves his monkeys!!
1.0	was very disappointed, Purchased to give as a gift. Paid full retail price and game arrived without original wrapping and it had been used.
5.0	Perfect size. Nice packaging. A+
5.0	My husband and I just finished this puzzle and could not be more impressed with its quality.  We're kindof new to doing puzzles, but we have a few other 1,000 piece puzzles and this one is by far the nicest.  It has a nice matte finish, the pieces are sturdy and the pattern they were cut out with is nonuniform, the box is solid, and the colors are vibrant.  Very impressed!!  I only with ArtPiece made even more puzzle designs  :)
5.0	given to outstanding teacher as a graduation gift. he was my daughter's &#34;anchor&#34;. he loved it almost as much as we love him!
5.0	Such a lovely friend for a little one.  Soft and cuddly.
5.0	The first anniversary couple was very happy with the gift sent; they really liked the quality and the novel idea.
5.0	Very fun game for 4+ people. Replay value is good as there are many different scenarios. I doubt I'll get to ever play all 50 as the setup is always the same, so replay value isn't infinite, but it's fun for a group and easy to teach others.
5.0	My family really enjoys playing with the Domino set.  The problem we faced with the set is we received Double 12 instead of the Double 15.  We did not contact the seller about this problem because we thought we made the mistake and opened the package before realizing the mistake.  Overall, still fun and enjoy it daily.  My sister-in-law is now debating on buying her own set.
5.0	My son loves it. Uses it every day. It is the perfect little couch for him. He thinks it is awesome!
5.0	Grandson loves it. Now other one wants one
5.0	My daughter wanted an American Baby Doll but we were not going to spend $100 on a doll.  So, we compromised and she picked this out for Santa to bring.  The doll is beautiful, well packaged with an adorable outfit.  She has slept, played and carried it around with no damages to the doll.  We are pleased with it and it's a plus to be able to go to Target for more accessories.
5.0	EASY PUZZLE TO PUT TOGETHER!  GREAT FUN, ESPECIALLY IF YOU LOVE BEAUTIFUL TEACUPS LIKE I DO.  WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE.
5.0	What's not to love about a Clambulance?
1.0	I want this short hair for cheep but it's over $60 REALLY Hasbro please BRING back the FREAKING OLD LPS and STOP the new ones
5.0	My daughter is happy with this product thank
5.0	Fantastic deal.  Very quick shipping.
5.0	Love Jurassic World:)  the game is a little for children...but I bought them for the scan codes for the game...
5.0	Very nice backpack.  Waterproof.  Big storage compartment on the front and more room in the zipper behind the picture of Caillou.
5.0	Best toy we have ever gotten our daughter. She never let's it go and lays down with it every night. Also works great for road trips when it is dark or to help our daughter sleep in the car. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
5.0	Ordered 2 sets, because I have 3 grand kids and I wanted enough pieces for each to play with.  Matched my needs perfectly, from the 17 month old to the 5 year old.
5.0	Cheaper than buying from local stores. Easy to fill up with helium.
5.0	Big winner with all how has seen it.  Fun to squeeze and watch people's expressions about the egg popping out!
1.0	I purchased two of these toys. They come with a seat attached in the bottom . The problem  with that is as the kids climb in and out the plastic seat starts tearing away which eventually  tears a hole in the  main part of the toy. It was made of heavier duty plastic than some other float toys ,that is why I bought it. I bought two cheaper float toys at the  same time. the cheaper ones lasted a lot longer.
1.0	Toy was broken when I received it and looked like it was used.
5.0	Don't use the napkins for drinks until the game is done. I think it would be more fun to customize the questions and make them more unique and funny.
5.0	Excellent construction and colors are awesome.  My grandson's adored these birds, they throw them around and have so much fun with these birds.
5.0	Bought it because it will go with everything because it is white. Long sleeve covers her arms. Just a great piece of doll clothing to have in a doll closet.
5.0	Pretend play - Our 17 month son is curious about what Momma does in the kitchen, so this gives him an opportunity to 'stir it up' like Momma does.<br />Bathtub fun - The ladle, tablespoon, and bucket provide tons of water fun... he loves emptying and filling containers.<br />Design - nice bright colors and simple designs... I hate toys that look like a hot mess because of too much graphic art. and the veggies are sort of realistic versus cartoonish, which I hope will inspire him to be more familiar with healthy foods.<br />Concept is cute - Alphabet soup!<br />Size - the size of this toy is just right for little hands.
5.0	Fast and perfect delivery.  I would recommend this product and co. to everyone.  I really hate to speak too soon about anything but, I can speak for now and for now this product is awesome and amazon gets a 10 from me for now and I hope that it stays that way.
5.0	basic set ....nice...I use with crayola easel ..I suggest buying three ..so you can spell alot of small words for the wee ones..no magnetic problems others have expierienced
5.0	The completed model kits are fairly small but they are great detailed models. The completed models are probably about 8 and a half inches tall. The instructions are all in Japanese but it's okay because the pictures are very easy to follow. The pieces are on a letter/number identification system. So A-2 goes in to B-5 sort of system. So easy a child could do it.
1.0	This took more than three months to arrive. I had to contact the seller because apparently something was wrong with the first shipment. They had to resend another, which took a while. I understand it was from China, but that's just unacceptable. As a customer, I wasn't very pleased. The Espeon is cute, and tiny. Product itself I would recommend. The delivery process was annoying, over this cheap, small plush doll. If you don't mind a potential long wait, I'd recommend it.
5.0	Not sure if he likes it or not, but I love this game.  I grew up with it.  The first one I ordered was missing one piece and Amazon immediately sent me a new one.  Great game, great company!
5.0	We just purchased this item for our 5 month old grandson.  It was fairly easy to put together and even though he is not dependable with his unassisted sitting, this trike is shapes to support his efforts when he straddles it.  He absolutely loves it!
5.0	We used these as Halloween costumes. Very durable and warm on a cool nignt. My 3yo and 5yo will be enjoying these for pretend play for years. Please note, this is a thicker material. Not like the mesh wings out there. I prefer the durability of this material.
5.0	I really like this game. I used to play with a friend of mine and decided that it was time to get a deck for my house. Silly and fun. Even got Grandma and Grandpa to play.
5.0	Well done. Closely resembles this breed.
5.0	We have over a hundred Schleich toys and this one is just as good as the rest. Very well made and lots of fun to play with.
1.0	It does not work at all and no way to make it work
1.0	The front of the box claims that it is &#34;The classic game of battlefield strategy&#34; but this game is not.  This game has 30 units a side, not 40 l8ke the real classic and is played on a smaller board.  Another change is the addition of a spotter unit.  While these changes are fine they are not the &#34;classic game&#34;.  I feel like I was lied to when I got a game that is a diluted version of the game I  played with my father.  I suggest changing the wording on box to show that this is a simplified version of real classic game.
1.0	I kinda figured this would be a waste of money but my son saw this or something similar on tv and had to have it.  I tried explaining not everything you see on tv is quality and we should not waste our money on something like that.  He wouldn't listen so I gave in to teach a lesson-Lesson learned so I guess it wasn't all wasted!
5.0	shoots hard.. left a welp on my wifes arm from 10 feet. makes the whistler darts whistle. super cool gun
5.0	Solid and sturdy, although a bit heavy but worth it. A  definite must as you will crash and you need to protect your gears and shaft... I used a small drop of Crazy Glue and they have not fallen off even after several bad accidents. Highly recommend it...
5.0	According to my husband, whom I bought this for, it is a must have for beginners, a lot of fun, and crash resistant, so after many tumbles and crashes it's still great fun! And in one piece! Unlike other more expensive ones, that died in a day.
5.0	This board game met and exceeded my expectations.  A game about growing bamboo shouldn't be this good--but it is.  I was especially pleased with how sturdy all of the game pieces were, and the game is also very appealing to the eyes.  The overall gameplay is fun, and this has easily turned into my go-to game.
5.0	My son was so excited to get these!!
5.0	The Playskool ShoCam is designed for small hands and has big buttons which is great for little hands.  We had no idea it would be this fun.  When we put the projection of images on the wall we did not know that it made sounds according to what picture was on there, like the elephant picture gave an elephant sound, the cat meows, etc.  We had hours of fun and I even took it to work.  They all want to buy one. When I projected the pictures I was expecting poor quality pictures when I print them but they are great quality, better than my personal camera. The only con that I could think of is to make the batteries rechargeable, however they have not gone dead yet so they seem to last a long time.  I would highly recommend this camera to a child I would say 4 and up, only because you have to line the images to the persons head for them to turn out right.
5.0	My grandchildren just loved it.  It was a huge success at the birthday party.
5.0	My little guy (9 mos) loves this toy!  He will sit and bang on it with his hands and other toys.  It definitely is toy that he will continue to enjoy.
5.0	I used this for my sister's baby shower and it was very cute and durable. I would recommend this to someone else!
5.0	My son loves it! The only bad part is all kids like it and if you let somone heave ride it. It bends the wheels.
5.0	The shipping time on this football was amazing.  I literally ordered this one night around 6 and It was on my porch when I got home from school the next day.  It's a great product that can survive almost anything, and it is easy to catch and has a great grip for throwing.  NOTE: It is not a full size football, but Nerf does make the same model in a bigger size, available for a bigger price.
5.0	Great for all ages.  Make up games to fit the child playing it!
5.0	As ordered. Happy to have him in my collection!
5.0	If you haven't owned a flopsie before, they are perfectly sized for small hands, they are super soft and well made. My girls have many, and they are honestly their favorite things to play with. They wash well and have stood up to lots of loving. They do have plastic eyes and noses, but Aurora uses a locking washer technique that makes them safer for young children. We have never had any loosening of eyes or nose. Our cheetah is a nice golden color, with nice black spots, much more vibrant than the pic. A little research will help you find them at retail even online, $4.99 (stuffed safari) and they are well worth that price.
5.0	Very cute, we'll made and very sturdy for the price. My 3 year old loves this crib for her baby dolls! Cons... The canopy fabric slides around a lot and the mobile is a little big for the crib and gets in the way a lot. But a great product all in all
5.0	This is an addition to my granddaughters growing collection of monster high dolls.  She likes them and plays with them a lot.
5.0	This train was a big hit with my grandkids who love horses...
5.0	Sent this as a gift, so I do not know the quality, but my nephew is happy.
5.0	This was the only thing my five year old son wanted from Santa and thank goodness he delivered!  My son has spent hours, along with his dad and his three year old sister playing on this monstrosity!  It took my husband three hours to assemble it, but he is mechanically inclined so this may not be reflective of how long it might take the average assembler.  It was next to the Christmas tree for a couple days before he wrangled it upstairs to the bonus room.  All we have to say is if you are planning on purchasing this item you better make sure you have plenty of room!  Hopefully we will not experience any difficulties with the audio as others have reported, as we think this is one of the greatest features of the item.
5.0	My granddaughter loves Minnie Mouse and so I purchased this for her 2nd birthday.  She loves playing with it, and her 4-yr old brother often joins in the fun.  It's larger than I expected, an added bonus, and it's well-made.  The various parts that come with the plane fit nicely inside. I recommend this highly.
5.0	The loom made it possible for 2 to 3 of the kids to work on bracelets at the same time.  It did not break even eith a mild tug of war. Very happy with this purchase
5.0	My daughter absolutley loves her Say Ahh to the Spa Littlest Pet Shop Style set. She recieved it from Littlest Pet Shop/Hasbro for free in exchange for giving her opinions on it.<br />  According to Kayla, her favorite parts are the fact that she can customize the set her way, and that she can play with the pets in person, or on the LPS app. She loves the customizable parts, and looking at it as a big kid I can see why. However, as a parent I don't like it so much. In this set alone there are over 35 (very small) pieces that can be used to customize the style set and pet the way your she wants. This is awesome from the customizable view, but terrible for the adult that has to help keep track of the parts. I would suggest purchasing a container to keep the small parts in. That's what I did, and between my daughter and I we haven't lost any pf the little pieces yet.<br />  As I've said in my other reviews on this product my daughter loves the fact that each pet she gets unlocks more of her virtual Littlest Pet Shop world. She looks at this as getting two toys in one. Using the LPS app she can create a virtual world where everything is exactly how she wants it to be. I don't know which one she plays with more. The LPS app is just another plus to these cute, customizable toys.<br />  She can chose the wall decorations (the wall is reversible),  the decorations (through stickers and snap in pieces), and even the look of the pet (through hair bows, stickers, ear rings, and clothes). All of this just makes my daughter love the set even more. She can't get enough of changing her pets accessories (again awesome for the child, not so much for the adult). However, what she likes just as much as the ability to customize the sets and pets is the fact that they all go together. She wants to get all of the sets so that she can make her own Littlest Pet Shop doll house. She has become obsessed with collecting all the pets and sets, and their isn't much else on her Christmas list after receiving the sets from Littlest Pet Shop/Hasbro.<br />  I would recommend these sets to anyone who has a little designer, collector, or artist in their life. My daughter fits all of those descriptions, and I don't think I could have found her a more perfect toy. Anyone who fits into these categories will simply love all the little pieces that allow them to make the set their own. They will be playing with the toys or the virtual pets for hours on end whether it's with friends, alone, with you (or in my case, trying to get her to play with me). As I said in other reviews of this product, and earlier in this review, I would suggest getting a container to keep all of the small pieces in when they aren't being used. This will make it a whole lot easier to keep together, and will help reduce the chance of crying sessions because your daughter lost her favorite piece. Just make sure you keep up on those little pieces! Plus, the price isn't bad at all!
5.0	My daughter loved all the glamour dog party supplies for her 1st Birthday Party...........she just loves dogs!!!
1.0	Liar! Whatever you sent me is not Boeing 777. Boeing 777 has 3 wheels on the landing gear, but the one you sent me only has one wheel!
5.0	This was a christmas gift for one of our grandchildren.  It was appreciated and played with for quite a while.
5.0	I got this for my 4yr old, it is laminated & has brass inserts so the thumb tacs don't rip through the corners! This poster will last! I put mine in a poster frame & it looks great!
5.0	We bought this for our two year old and she loves it. Perfect size for her and metal. Won't break as easy
5.0	Delivered on time and as described.
5.0	Perfect for 2-4 year old. Love the blue drapes. Very sturdy and built to last. Def a recommended buy! Awesome
5.0	This is a Christmas present
5.0	Very satisfied with the quality. The doll set has a high gloss and smooth finish. I'd order again.
5.0	The pajamas are beautiful and made really well. The accessories that came with it are so cute and fit my nieces personality so perfectly! I rate this outfit a 10!
1.0	It came broken I had to send it back. Horrible quality
5.0	I purchased this used.  It had some damage to the box but everything else was fine.  My daughter was playing in a local production of &#34;Grease&#34; as Cha Cha.  After making a costume to match my daughter's, I took the doll out of the box and redressed her.  Then replaced her head with a blond version.  Then Cha Cha looked like my daughter on stage.  I gave her the doll backstage at the first show.  She loved it.
1.0	Bought it at Target.  Played with it for 30 minutes on my daughter's birthday before it popped.  It didn't touch anything other than hands, air, and soft grass.  Almost made us cry because of the disappointment to our daughter.  Absolute junk
5.0	Nice solid construction for an inflatable. Held 3 cases of beer/water and Ice and 2 months later still going strong.
5.0	My daughter is loving it.
1.0	This is the worst toy for a child. It is cheaply made and not worth the money I spent.
5.0	I've been using soldering irons for 25+ years and I love this thing more than any unit I've ever had.<br />It's big, reasonably weighted, has good heat, and is great for light metal work or scrapping (make sure to use a heat sink!).
5.0	So cute. My niece loved it!
1.0	Be careful with this buyer. I order a set of 4 Corvettes. I received a set of 4 Audi's. I was so upset. I just ended up giving them away. I didn't even want to waste my time returning them. I will never buy from this seller again. I recommend that you don't either. The seller should be able to tell the difference between a Corvette and an Audi.
5.0	This was the hit of Christmas. My daughter loved the Interactive Barbie Genevieve. This doll will put a smile on any girls face.
5.0	I use these in conjunction with the time out mat and they are so helpful, My son is able to watch the sand fall to know when to get out of timeout and I like the different time options.
5.0	A most have for your T-Maxx 3.3. Wish they made the center ones for the 4907 T-Maxx 3.3 :-(
5.0	This is a fun game for the whole family.
5.0	Love this rug...perfect for the space and very attractive. The colors are true to the picture and description. Not a very heavy rug but just what we needed.
5.0	I would recommend this for any fan. It arrived to me in great condition. I cannot wait to see what it looks like put together. A great add to any collection!
1.0	I think it should be more details about this toy, Also it did not last long for my daughter, Brand new batteries and it went dead super fast. Great idea just think it needs a little bit more work
5.0	I was so pleasantly surprised by this toy cat. I bought it for my daughter because it looks like the cat in Coraline and happens to look like our cat. The picture doesn't even do it justice! When I opened it and saw it in person I was amazed at the quality. Super soft black and the paws and nose are a suede type material that is so semi-real. The eyes! are amazing and almost reflective that my daughter thinks they glow. It's the perfect size, not too big and not too small like a beanie baby. We love it. Thank you!
5.0	Exactly, as described. And my sister's boyfriend enjoys the different functions.  I would recommend this item to everyone who is looking to purchase it.
1.0	bought these rings as extras for a similar game.  These rings are very small.  Note dimensions before you order.  I threw them away.
5.0	We purchased this for a very special young man. He was so excited when he received it. Great selection for those that have not mastered pedals but still want to be able to ride.
5.0	My son absolutely loves this! I put him in it at 2 1/2 months and he was a little small - but a book or two under his feet and he was fine. He watches baby einstien videos and jumps in it for as long as I let him. It is very funny to watch too, he jumps so high his feet come off the ground. If you have an active baby you need the jumperoo. My baby Grant was trying to stand at 2 months wanted to jump on our laps all the time...this was a perfect purchase.....enjoy :)
5.0	These things are incredible quality.  Very heavy and very durable.  I almost wish I could convince my son to keep it in the box because I'm sure this will be a collector item one day
5.0	Received a Skype while my grandson was playing with his new Sir Topham Hatt.  He loves all the Thomas pieces.  Being a car rather than a train, this one is a little different but still fits on the track.
5.0	This outfit looks as great and cute as the picture. The tights, shoes and tutu fit great the American Girl doll.
5.0	It plays the song clearly and sweetly.  Easy to use and my kid likes it though she needs my help to make it play.
5.0	My 13 year old daughter was thrilled to get this for Christmas.  She followed the instructions and had it doing all kinds of things throughout the day.  It's a fun gift but also requires some math skills to program.
1.0	May the fleas of a thousand camels infest the groin of the developer of this product.  Are you a great handy man?  Great.  Then it will take you hours to assemble.  ...and at the end of the drama, it won't work properly.  Do not buy this product!!!
5.0	I chose this product because I love puzzles and birds. I had never bought from this company before but am very impressed with their selection. I was also very pleased with teh timeframe it took to get to me even though this is an overseas company. Thanks again.
1.0	neat concept but the plastic is just really thin brittle acrylic and the door lock action is pretty cheesy.  It is easy to just bypass
5.0	My daughter absolutely loved this balloon.  It added a bit of pizazz to her Sofia the First birthday party!  I would definitely recommend this product.
5.0	The car was a great value, good size and is along side the other cars my grandson collects.
5.0	My 7-year old daughter had a great time putting different characters together.  She did it all by herself and had a great time.
5.0	Cute Barney, perfect size for my 2 year old. She loves him, and his singing isn't too annoying ;)
5.0	My son absolutely loves this toy!  It is easy for him to use and fun for me too! Great 1st birthday gift!
1.0	"I purchased this product for my 5 yr old daughter at the beginning of August.  It was backordered so I didn't receive it for a few weeks.  She was just gifted this toy yesterday.  As soon as she started playing with this I knew I had to write a review.<br /><br />First of all, it is very delicate and the pieces are very, very small.  The biggest problem with this castle is that it is tall and very, very thin.  It kept falling over and then all the turrets and things would fall off and roll across the floor.  We had to use epoxy to glue all the turrets in place and glued the whole unit to part of a dry erase board we had from an easel we no longer use.  It has made all the difference!  Now she can play with it to her hearts content and I don't have to be putting it back together every 2 minutes.<br /><br />I am disappointed that I spent [...]on this and had to spend additional money and energy to make it usable at all.  I don't know how you create a castle like this and have it not cross your mind that it is top heavy and too slim.  It would have been painfully obvious if they did any kid testing on this product!  IT NEEDS TO BE MOUNTED ON A BASE!!!!  But they left that for us to take care of.<br /><br />Like I said also, the parts are very fragile and the bubbles on the tub and the blanket on the bed easily come off as well.  There is a little \\""doo dad\\"" used to put the dolls feet into that allows them to dance up top, slip into the bath and bed, and go up into the elevator.  They are small and made of clear plastic so easy to lose (and you only get 2).  They are also too hard for a little girl to get the feet into by themselves.<br /><br />Overall, this toy has turned out to be more work than anything else.  It is expensive if you ask me and poorly made for the money.  My daughter LOVES it however.  Just be prepared to spend some additional time, money and energy with this toy.  I am glad they finally did make a castle for the princess \\""Polly Pockets\\"" but just wish it was better made."
5.0	Massive halo nerd. This figure is awesome. Pose able comes with his knife and shotgun. Paint is awewome highly recommend.
5.0	My son got this cape as a gift from Mom-Mom.  It is beautifully made and will hold up with the near constant wear it will endure.  The shipping was quick and my son couldn't be happier!
5.0	I am very happy with this little quadcopter. I've owned the same one for over a year now and I have only lost a couple of propellers. Just so you know my background- I've built and flown multiple copters for over four years. I use this for fun when waiting for video to render or when i have a free minute.<br /><br />From its design to hardware- everything is made without making any compromises. So here are the pros:<br /><br />-Very stable- with the provided trim adjustment on the remote you can get this thing to stay in one place without much of users input.<br />-It's very silent- this is not one of those toys where everyone will know that your'e playing around with something. You can have fun with this totally incognito.<br />-Its very forgiving. By that I mean that you can crash it as much as you want- especially in in situations where you lose control of it... In that case you just kill the motors and let the thing drop to the floor. I explain this in greater detail in the further point.<br /><br />-The whole frame is a one-piece design. There are no joint points on the air frame, everything is strong and sturdy, yet light. You can fly it straight to a wall at maximum speed and there wont be a scratch. There's two reasons for that- firstly, that's because this thing weigh like a Gatorade bottle cap, and its also sturdy like one, so regardless of your velocity before you hit the wall- you'll know you're fine. This isn't one of those toys where before you get used to it, you already have to throw it out because it broke due to your inability to fly it.<br /><br />-Out of the box set up. Take it out, put battteries in your remote and you're good to go. The manufacturers are nice enough to give you extra propellers in case you lose one or two- and trust me, eventually you will. But no worries, you can buy extra ones here on amazon.<br /><br />-Charges quickly, takes about 30 minutes. That is really fair considering the time it flies.<br /><br />CONS<br /><br />-Theonly thing i didn't like at first was the remote. I have large hands and i can just cover the remote with only two of my fingers. But hey- this toy is only 30 dollars and it lasts forever, so you'll have enough time to get used to it ;)<br /><br />Also, be careful with propellers- after crashing they do tend to fall off and they can be hard to find, especially on carpets. So just keep that in mind!
5.0	Bought for my kid, he loves sonic and has really enjoyed playing with this toy.<br />he wont even go to bed without it.
5.0	Very cute and durable. Love it.
5.0	Purchased this as a gift for a friends child and he loves it. It's nice that you can program your childs name in and it interacts with your child. LOVE IT!!!
1.0	What a disappointment this product was.  You have to repeatedly dip the front into bubble mix.  This very expensive toy doesn't even fill with bubble solution.  You might as well just buy a big bottle of bubbles and play with them the old fashioned way.  Save your money.
1.0	Not worth the cost and poor customer service when I wanted to return it. Please don't bother.
5.0	Bought it as a gift and they love it! Very cute and adorable kitty. It's not too big or too small, the size is perfect.
5.0	Here is one of the first race cars on John Wayne that is great to own in Die cast and If you are looking for the Duke<br />on racing. Here is one item to buy to add in your collection
5.0	Arrived in excellent condition.
5.0	Great product. A fun way for the kids to be creative.
5.0	So cute!  Using them for a baby shower to float in the punch. :O)
1.0	I found this in the remote control section I was wrong it is a tiny race track car and I dont even have any idea what race track.  Now I have to send it back and it will cost almost as much as I paid for the thing.
5.0	I got both Sebastian and Ciel as a set from my fiance. These little guys are so cute. They are smaller than they appear on the site, but still live up to the cuteness. Ciel has the cutest little bow on his tail that you can't see very well in the picture. His outfit is slightly different from Sebastian's in that his head has ears and horns attached, and Sebastian's outfit featured a hood that can be lowered if you wish. I love these little guys, they are adorable!
5.0	Great brush for doll wigs! My daughter loves it and her dolls no longer have horribly knotted hair
5.0	Granddaughter loves it!
5.0	"We bought this guinea pig for my 4 year old daugher. Not only is it adorable, but it is well made. It's nice and soft. \\""Pinkie\\"" goes everywhere with her. She's even endured a few baths and looks like the day we got her. Definately a good purchase! Would highly recommend."
5.0	I wasn't sure how the quality of this would be, however, my grandson, age 3, really likes the Thomas family.<br />I was relieved when it arrived - very durable and  my grandson was thrilled to get it.
5.0	We got this for Groot! We are Groot after all.<br /><br />Seriously, my girlfriend and I enjoyed putting this kit together. It's cool that it features several different set pieces so it's kinda like getting several small kits all in one. The instructions were the standard quality LEGO instructions, mostly good, sometimes confusing.<br /><br />I'm a lifelong LEGO fan and have assembled dozens of sets in my time. This was my first set from the Marvel lineup.
5.0	I've never been a big fan of the Sontarans, particularly how they look, but the new re-image is really cool and I love these little guys.  Its one of the figures I want multiples of, and that makes sense to have more then one. The detail is good, the articulation really good, and you can have the figure hold the rifle in a couple of poses that work well.
5.0	I have four kids who are all starting to get into frisbees. The youngest two are both pretty shy of my &#34;official 175g&#34; type of frisbees, and I can't blame them. They're heavy enough to be hard to throw, and hard enough to be hard to catch.<br /><br />I got one of these for them to practice with, and they love them. No more fear of getting banged in the hand/head/etc. by the disc, and the Superdisc is stable enough that they can really start to see progress in their own throws.
1.0	I bought this from seller &#34;lovesky225&#34; and this figure is straight out crap, just lots of defects, accessories doesnt hold or stay up together and the right thigh just below the short, has this bulge and its not just right.
5.0	the clownfish is so pretty all displayed after assembled.. my teenager loves to put these little things together. keeps one busy
5.0	Loove my star wars. Good delivery. Good price
5.0	It was a birthday present for my brother, he collects globes and he was impressed!
5.0	"My daughter plays this game at school, in the library, during rainy day recesses.<br />The game has a monopoly feel to it - go around the board & either collect money, or pay the bank. You can \\""buy\\"" a lemonade stand, and collect fees every time an opponent lands on it. Or \\""deposit\\"" money in the bank & collect \\""interest\\"" every time you land on it.<br />This is a quick playing game- as in, the first person that has $20 in front of them, wins the game. So it can easily be played during a 15 or 20 minute recess. It also introduces value to certain things- like earning. $3.50 for babysitting, but walking the neighbor's dog only earns 50 cents. There are also different penalties for late library book vs. breaking a window. (all if these are different squares on the board)<br />It is fun to play, but definitely has a target audience of elementary aged children.<br />As for educational- it helps tighten concepts of dollars/cents. Counting coins & making change."
5.0	Phillip J. Fry, frozen pizza delivery boy and hapless protagonist of Futurama.<br /><br />If you're a Futurama fan, you'll know why you have to have this (along with the three other companion pieces from Funko: Bender, Leela and Devil Robot).<br /><br />If you're not a Futurama fan: you've missed out on one of the wittiest, funniest animated experiences ever.
5.0	This article is what I wanted to buy, meets my expectations.<br />Also, the service is fast and secure, well packaged and protected.
5.0	My grandchildren, a girl age 6 and a boy age 8,and their friends absolutely loved this toy.   It was such a hit, they made drawings of themselves playing with it and sent me a big thankyou note with it.   I generally get an excited phone call when they get something from me, not illustrations!
5.0	its just like the photo and much larger.my son loves it
5.0	My two grandsons unwrapped the wild west gunslinger shooting gallery target practice toy for Christmas. Both boys had a blast with their gifts!  Had a time getting them to continue un-wrapping the rest of their gifts.
5.0	Kids love it.<br /> Could have come with just a bit more play money.
1.0	Very cheaply made....I mean VERY cheaply made. This is a gift for my granddaughter and thinking I may not even give them to her.
1.0	So far this purchase has been a nightmare. After assembling this for my daughters 3rd birthday we found out the car didnt work. There is no light indicator to tell you the battery is actually charging. So I cant tell if the battery is faulty, the charger is bad, or the connection in the car is broken. So far I've received an email from amazon offering to refund me if I buy a new charger and battery. I hope this works but we will see. I'll update this review soon to tell you all what happened.
1.0	Charging 45 bucks for this deck? Not worth it. It is cheaper to go online (amazon for example) and buy each card individually. Or even better- buy yourself some hand picked kagero cards and it will run you like 20 bucks and it will be even stronger than a starter.
5.0	This was a Christmas gift for my six year old daughter, she really loves this doll :)
5.0	Really great toy no decals super fun to play with. Im 8 and I really love it.
5.0	Granddaughter loved it
5.0	Great that there is finally a GIRL ELF ON THE SHELF .....my granddaughters love her....she arrived on time....and is perfect....
5.0	I bought it for my sister and she loved it! Perfect size and really tender-looking. If it was for her, she'd made me buy dozens of this...
5.0	This is one of my 10 month old's favorite toys.  She is too little to stack or nest them, but she never tires of taking them apart, chewing on them, or just banging them around.  She got them when she was 7 months old and they were an instant hit!  I know they will be around a long time since eventually she will enjoy stacking them, too.  I also like the design and colors - slightly less garish than so many baby products out there. They are pretty colors with which to learn the color wheel!
5.0	my daughter loves this thing
5.0	Grand son loves any lego set he gets and he loves the lego movie so I can't go wrong!
5.0	Grandson loves them, Plays with them all the time
5.0	We bought this for my daughters birthday party.  The whole set of these is very cute and perfect, especially for a little girl that loves Hello Kitty. We used as games at the Birthday Party.
5.0	Truly a horrible game for horrible people.  We've never laughed so hard in our lives.  Really gets us out of our comfort zone.
5.0	My 2 year old grandson loved his Daniel Tiger Owl.  It was smaller than I expected but was actually perfect for a little man!
5.0	We bought this for my first son when he was 1, we transitioned him out of his crib shortly after and into a big boy bed. He loved this....still has it and still loves it. Uses it every night. He is now 4.5yrs old and shares a room with our second son who is 2.5 and he loves it too. In fact going to be getting another one as soon as we can find one, they are hard to find now. Shame we love ours so much, but as years go by newer items come out. Great items thought!
5.0	Awesome card for a mill deck. The only problem is if someone exiles all your opponents graveyards then this thing dies. Otherwise this card is amazing.
5.0	This Polly set is so cute!  It would be fun alone or can go along with the Pollyworld Rockin' Theme Park.  Great for any girls who enjoy the Polly Pocket collection.  This was a true bargain.  Lots of fun to be had!
5.0	Tons of Fun, I liked it so much I bought 2 + 1 Brushless. Great starter vehicle. Easily get hooked and want more.  Lotta fun for the money.  This RC on road car performs best with aftermarket batteries and a GOOD charger.  Stock up on drift Tyres.  Have fun.
5.0	Love using these in sessions! I wish the suggestions had come up with ways to make games therapeutic but I've had a great time developing my own ways!
5.0	This is an easy piece. what do you expect for 170 pieces. i bought it to add on to the Emerald Night Train as that one seemed unfinished without a caboose.<br /><br />not sure if the caboose will actually round corners as the wheels brackets don't turn, but it still looks nice.<br /><br />very little detailing. there is a chair, with a table and coffee cup. a stove with a chimney. and there is a ladder to go up on the roof. the only thing it's missing is a mini fig in coveralls
5.0	Very cute doll, moves around which is awesome-- her hair went to rats nest in a short time, but that's like every doll really because little girlies love to play with 'em.  Would buy again.  She was a great find.
1.0	Product arrived in a damaged box.  Upon opening, the product was also damaged.  Part of the tree was torn and peeling away from the wood, and the tree does not fit tight in the stand, not even a little, it leans way over.  Very disappointed.  Maybe the shipper next time could put a little packing around it in the box so it doesn't get beat up in there.
1.0	Why do I have to give this one star? What's the star for, nothing! Waste of plastic! My kid is so sad! I tried the tips from another review, still no luck. The pieces don't even fit together well. JUNK! I will never buy products from this company again!
5.0	As described, very soft, long and cute. I've seen a similar item in other stores for about $10-15 so the price is reasonable.
1.0	built like wet diaper, shipping is slower then a turtle. HUGE LET DOWN. DO NOT PURCHASE
5.0	Amazing for beginners, read all reviews for start up mode...
5.0	Really nice and fancy looking. Great for any dolly dress up occasion. Easy put on the doll, Velcros in the back, does have a ribbon that needs to be tied (so may need adult help). Shoes slip on nicely. For accessories to make this outfit complete it comes with a hair band(stays in place well) and purse, both of these are decorated with the same flower on the dress to make a really nice completed look. The dress is a little long though and covers up the shoes. Disclosure: I did receive this outfit at a discount for my review.
5.0	Cute Fish! My daughter's room is all fish. We hung many small stuffed fish like this on from the ceiling. Looks great.  This fish is sparkly and made well. Highly reccommended.
5.0	Amazing game, great art and very intense and fun to play. Because it's a deck building game, asynchronous, and expansion packs keep coming out, it feels new every time I play. Takes a while to learn to play, and is full of rules confirmations for the initial play period (be prepared for this). Recommended!
5.0	This is a great little tool set. I didn't look closely at the age guidelines though and had to put away some of the smaller pieces but the set is great and will be even better when my girl is a little older.
5.0	This should be a stock part on all traxxas RC the machine work and detail are really top notch and it add some stiffness to the frame for better control a most buy.
5.0	So So soft, my granddaughter loves it, takes it every where. she also likes to dress it up.<br />I was happy with this doll
5.0	No more cheap knockoffs for me!
5.0	My granddaughter loves Webkinz and the duck was a gift for her and she loves this one.  It is so soft and cute and she takes it and the spotted seal with her everywhere.
5.0	This set is so bright and versatile!  I love the seasonal touches.  I have a rather large wall and it helped fill the space real nicely.
5.0	This is my daughter's favorite Leap Reader book yet! She is almost 4 & really enjoys the story & her leap reader. Since her little sister (2) loves Dora, she likes to &#34;read&#34; it to her. It's great to see them sitting together reading. I think it helps both of my girls get more excited about reading when the books are characters they know. This book also does a great job of using sight words. My daughter was excited when I read the sight words aloud because they are some of her favorite words: animals, castle, unicorn, etc.  If your children like Dora, this book is perfect!<br />(We received this book for review in exchange for an honest opinion).
1.0	Used once and deflated what a waste of money!
5.0	my granddaughter loved it.
5.0	We bought this for our 2 year old for Christmas. She loves it. It sounds and 'works' just like a real microwave. It's small enough that it doesn't take up much space but authentic enough that my daughter loves it. I highly recommend this over some of the more expensive options.
5.0	Cute, fun<br />Very interactive and very fun, we love, work also can be Very worth buying You'll love Next will come back to buy
5.0	Came in a timely manner, and this is my favorite sailor scout with great quality. A little smaller than what I expected, but at least it does tell you the measurements of the doll. I can't wait to eventually collect them all. :)
5.0	Exactly what was expected.  Perfect gift!
5.0	These are very cute for little hands. This is  Making a 1st birthday party with a Sesame Street them just right
1.0	"We first came across this toy during a playdate and my son fell in love with it instantly.  I returned home and immediately ordered this fun exercise and learning toy for him.  Reviews gave the impression that assembly was easy enough for one, though a step or two \\""might\\"" require a second set of hands.  ABSOLUTELY WRONG!  I had TWO additional people helping me assemble the trampoline and together, we couldn't get past step #10 of 17.  The third bar didn't quite fit right, the mat should have been strapped on sooner, getting the spacers in the handlebar was a workout in and of itself... I could go on and on.  End result, we gave up and I disassembled it (which was no simple task, either) and sent it back much to my son's dismay.  The only way I'd recommend ordering this is if you plan on paying a handyman to assemble it for you.  This is a fantastic toy once assembled, but good luck getting that done."
5.0	She was so beautiful and my granddaughter loves her.
5.0	This game is great! Purchased many last year for x-mas gifts, this last one I bought was for my sister.<br /><br />Game play is like the game Apples to Apples-one person draws a black card and reads it and all of the other players must fill in the blank or answer the question using a white card in their hand. The person with the black card picks their favorite response after reading all aloud. The more people playing the more fun it is!<br /><br />Warning! This game is not politically correct! If you are easily offended by off color jokes, twisted humor or downright disgusting ideas, then stick to Apple's to Apple's. Of course the game only makes gross, non-pc answers possible... you and your friends/family are the ones that really show the dark side of your minds by answering the way you do!<br /><br />Overall a great buy! I have yet to find someone that does not enjoy it.
5.0	Bought it  as a X-Mass gift for for my Little niece.She loves it,and carries it every where she goes.Soft and Plush.
5.0	Great educational toy. My grandson loves it.
5.0	Fun toy! great quality!!!
5.0	If you've never tried the Aerobie Skylighter you should. It's like a glow in the dark frisbee except it is illuminated with LEDs and durable too.
5.0	Beautiful fully detailed miniature, excellent and highly recommended.
5.0	Takes some skill to get used to playing well.  All ages can play.  Is fairly basic, so not sure how old son will continue to play
1.0	I received a stuffed carrot (with Haba name) and not a wooden play carrot.  And the stuffed carrot I received somehow reeks of something similar to gasoline.  I just don't understand why.  I've never had a Haba toy off-gass fumes before.  The seller must be storing this items in a warehouse with a petroleum product of some sort.  My order was fulfilled by &#34;The BT Group&#34; storefront.  I notice now when I click on this item that it is being fulfilled by another seller.  Though another reviewer is saying the same thing about their order (getting a stuffed carrot, not wooden).  Buyer beware when purchasing this product...  You may NOT get a wooden toy.  I paid three dollar and some change for this so I'm not sending it back.  I'll wash it and hope the smell goes away.  I wish I had the wooden one though since the rest of our play food is wooden.
5.0	This doll is an absolute winner!  Nice quality construction - 100% soft (no heavy plastic).  Just remember that Jewel is only 10 inches tall - get out your ruler and see how rather smallish that is.  This doll is adorable and something treasured in my household
5.0	I have a 1980 Sliver Shadow and have been looking for a model for about 7 years.  Silver Shadows were made from 65-80 with very litte difference during the 16 year run.  It is a timeless design and I am very happy with this scale model.
5.0	My 8 year old granddaughter is a journal writer.  She loved this for Christmas.
5.0	Daughter loves being able to color it and hide in there with her dolls!
5.0	Fiddly but gorgeous, these little veritechs can be used as special additions to your core choice squadrons. The box comes with two of each mode and a full set of transfers. It also contains the much-maligned assembly instructions, which could be better, but _will_ get you through it.
5.0	The texture is interesting, they have a good weight for throwing and they even are nice to use as a stress ball.
5.0	we've bought a few of these for bday gifts after receiving for a Christmas gift.  always a kid favorite but make sure you have plenty of AA and AAA batteries.
5.0	A necessary addition if you have the Milano spaceship and want the matching uniform for Rocket. Nice little minifigure and you get a lot of stickers to customize your ship with battle damage.
5.0	Mom loves it she is soooo into fifty shades.  So she really like this key chain she likes to show it off but no one knows what it is,.
5.0	"I first saw the Duck on a Trike at a friend's house.  His assistant had given it to him and said, \\""Because nothing says 'Christmas' like a duck riding a trike.\\""  I had to have one.<br /><br />My wife and I enjoyed it so much, we gave them to friends and family with children and they just went nuts.  The safety message is no joke as these toys are just stamped steel and they do have a spinning propeller.  That said, with a bit of adult supervision, my six-year-old cousin can operate it safely.  There are different quality levels out there but all seem to function at least fairly well on smooth surfaces.  The Duck is a hoot at Christmas and is good fun in an electronic toy world."
5.0	My daughter loved this!
5.0	Our 2 year old grandson loves it
5.0	I love all the Ravensburger Puzzles.  The have Top quality construction and crisp clean colors. These puzzles can be used over and over for many years.
5.0	My grandbaby loves this wagon. It's sturdy and was easy to put together. I love how the handle folds under the wagon so it's out of the way. She loves to crawl in and out of the wagon when it's not moving. There are seatbelts so little ones will not fall out or climb out when the wagon is in motion.
5.0	"We ordered this costume for my daughter and we weren't' disappointed.  The costume required no alterations on our part and was played with long after Halloween (and to this day).<br />The costume it self is made out of cheap fabric and the adornments are made of a \\""less cheap\\"" plastic.  It didn't matter since our daughter loves it and we didn't spend an arm and a leg on a one-time dress up outfit.<br /><br />It was an excellent custom for Halloween, even though I don't think it could stand much \\""playtime\\"", but that's not what it's meant for."
5.0	This game is the bomb. It's so good I play it by myself. I collect Axis and Allies games and I must say this is probably my favorite (outside of the ultra-massive combined 1940 version). It doesn't take all weekend to play but still causes a lot of gear-grinding in the head, second-guessing strategies and counterpunching your opponent. I will say that the instructions could stand to be written a little clearer, as there are a couple of set-up conditions that are very easily missed. But if you're into wargaming AT ALL, pick this baby up.
5.0	Very awesome. It really looks like Loki of Avengers. Great accessories too. Worth the money as one of the collection.  Congrats Hot Toys. Keep it up.
5.0	Worked great for paintball law rockets.
5.0	"Badass. That's Axor in one word. For a toy that was born out of Transformers Animated Lockdown via Revenge of The Fallen Movie Lockdown painted as a tribute to G1 Axer, he is one heck of an awesome repaint/retool. This is a deception car done right. Silvery gray paint job, crimson vent detailing, covered in blue spikes. Axor's vehicle mode is a mix of best of late 60s to early 80s American muscle cars; Sloping rear ending in a spoiler, sexy curvy fenders, wedge front, low and sleek, looks fast just sitting in park. A bounty huntin' muscle machine!    His transformation is fairly easy as he basically just unfolds out from under himself, just a bit fiddly when it gets to his arms and shoulder pads. But he's chock full of articulation (3 joints in his neck alone must set a Transformer record) Axor is TALL. Tall as or taller than as most voyager class figures. The detailing on him is just awesome, a piston gimmick in his axe arm and turning camshafts in his legs. The piecemeal asymmetry in his upper body really adds to the rough and tumble bounty hunter characterization. And awesomely, the air-scoop/engine that mounts on his arm can also be interchanged with RoTF Movie Deluxe Ratchet's \\""EMP blast missile launcher\\"" in an homage to the same characters/toys of Transformers Animated. (the weapon's peg is even the same shape of TfA Ratchet's war wound) Sadly though it seems most of the run had issues where the engine doesn't mount on Axor's own arm snugly, or at all. His axe hand, regular hand and other pointy bits are soft rubber so nobody's gonna lose and eye. His malevolent red eye piping glows with a spectacular wickedness. Look out Boba Fett there's a real bounty hunter in town now!    If you liked the either version of Lockdown you owe it to yourself to pick this one up. Durable enough for kids and a great showpiece for adult collectors. He's a toy worth picking up, entirely a deal for the 10-15 bucks he's generally going for. Now, has anybody seen an Autobot medic around here lately...      And remember parents: If you don't like challenging your children, BUY AGE APPROPRIATE."
5.0	3 yr. old having a blast in her dress up capes! I purchase a mask and power bands to go with it. She loves them!
5.0	Good delivery and package. It is stiff and good looking. Everything I wanted has been met.
5.0	I couldnt find a big enough Bo Peep for my daughter who really wanted the Bo peep from Toy Story.  This doll is beautiful and worked out perfect!
5.0	My 2 years old has enjoyed this shopping cart since the minute she saw it! it is really sturdy and durable.  Perfect size!
5.0	This puzzle is durable and fun, the colors are vibrant and so many hidden things you do not even see at first.
5.0	My son loves this, we bought it as an Easter gift last year. Wish they still made this I know it would sell and I hate how sites like this raise the price to over double what it sold for.
5.0	Good quality and good size for the price. Bought for a birthday present. My grandson loves it. Prompt delivery, too.
5.0	I bought these for a craft at Vacation Bible School.  The kids loved them, they are bright and shine in different colors.  There were a few in the box that did not shine as bright, so if you are sure that you need more than 80 I would buy another set.  I was pleased with my purchase.
5.0	Christmas gift for my son. He loves Disney's Jake and the Neverland Pirates. At first he was a little scared of it cuz of its size. It really is a decent size. But now he loves it. Perfect purchase.
5.0	Adorable, perfect accessory for my desk, so much fun!
5.0	mr. good and evil is one of the most detailed, eye-catching minifigures in the entirety of the collectible minifigures! I would recommend having this one!!<br /><br />However, try to buy these from sellers who have their items fulfilled by Amazon and not just the lowest relative price. *sellers like footballpioneer79 send mangled series 9 packages, damaging the collectibility of the product and are reluctant to make the experience a positive one. Beware! some sellers are better at selling other items and not very good at the minifigure thing.
5.0	My 7 year old loved this so much. I bought it for her as a plane ride surprise and it kept her busy for over 2 hours! I wouldn't recommend it for younger than 4 though.
5.0	This was my first experience with the Jellycat company and it most certainly won't be my last.  This is a wonderful rabbit.  I plan to give a Jellycat friend as a gift at every Baby Shower from henceforth to the end of time.  Suitable for All Ages.  He is a real darling and the pictures on amazon do not give this guy justice.<br /><br />I have had both small children, teenagers, and even adults inquire about where I found such a wonderful toy. He captures whimsy and fun in every age.
5.0	It is everything that I expectant and then some. Fast shipping too. Works fine on those small places that are hard to oil.
1.0	UPDATE 06/03/2015  I got a replacement BL Kit and a new PCB under warranty. The new BL Kit worked for 5 flights and then the ESC of the BL kit fried too. The PCB still seems fine. I give up on the BL nonsense, going back to the standard motor and just ordered one. Shame about the 45 Euros that I paid for the BL Kit but I'm done with this &#34;upgrade&#34; and dealing with support.  UPDATE 13/10/2014  HH Germany referred me back to the dealer. So I'm back to where I started a week ago. Contacting the dealer again.  UPDATE 10/10/2014  I was referred to HH support in Germany. I am awaiting a reply. Depending on the outcome, I will return to modify my 'review' accordingly.  UPDATE 09/10/2014  HH got back to me but basically referred me to support in my country(Holland) via text template. Classy. But yeah, there is no local support in Holland so there goes my 230 dollar investment. Be damned before I throw another 50 dollars at this product to fix it myself. Will also sell my 450X and nQX before I have warranty issues with those that I can't claim. ________  Connected this kit to a month old nCPX as described in the official tutorial video. I don't think there is any way to connect this kit incorrectly. Connected the original battery, it played the tune as seen in the vid but then when I upped the throttle stick slightly, a component on the PCB popped.  Paid 50 dollars for this + another 15 for a new canopy. Add that to the 150 dollars for the month old nCPX and 15 dollars for batteries, then I basically paid 115 dollars per flight hour. 115 dollars is quite steep for 1 hours worth of fun.  Opened a ticket, sent receipts and photos. No answer yet :-(
5.0	What is more fun than a t-rex pinata?  A t-rex pinata stuffed with candy and mini dinosaurs.  More people actually went after the dinosaurs before they went for candy.
5.0	He is the lord of all penguins and has been my friend through many dangers.
5.0	Very good toy. Its very durable, and great for gifts for young children. The shipping of the toy was very fast, the toy itself is a cute toy for young children or anyone in general to have. It made a great gift for my niece's birthday. I highly recommend this item for any gift.
5.0	love the detail on this figure.  my roller derby team mates love her too! recieved product very quickly.  she s a picture perfect jammer
5.0	These crepe rubber puzzles are an absolute favorite for our two year old grand daughter. She takes them apart and puts them together over and over again. The colors are bright. The shapes are good clues for her to identify. A wonderful toy with good play value as well as learning value. The kind of toy we like.
5.0	For bubbles these can be quite expensive, but they are very well worth the money. These blow nice big strong bubbles. They are very thick, you can see it in a liquid. They are not thin and runny like the cheap bubbles you get at the store.
5.0	I don't know what everyone else was talking about, I found no chunks of horn in my can.  I really felt fancy eating glittery meat.
5.0	My 2 year old loves Dora and already has a Dora and Friend figurine by FP. These little characters are great additions and she loves them!!! We re-inact the Dora videos using these and create our own stories. Now we need Benny and Big Red Chicken!!!
5.0	My grandsons loved the Schleigh knights I gave them on their birthdays and requested more for other occasions.  This set was a Christmas gift and provided immediate play and admiration.  I have found Schleigh figures to be very durable and realistic surviving some very rough play.  The boys, ages 7, 10, and 11, are looking forward the expansion of their collection.
5.0	Very well done also you need to get ani's pod if you get this both are great.  Sebulba doesn't fit because his feet/hands don't fit they are to far apart.
5.0	What a great puzzle!  The surprise of all the hidden pictures in the puzzle made it challenging and exciting to put together.  It was great to find a puzzle that had all Wisconsin significant pictures....it was fun to share all the details of this puzzle as we put it together with the kids.<br />While putting the puzzle together we had a little mishap with a couple pieces of the puzzle due to our 8 year old.  I contacted the company and asked if there was anyway we could get replacement pieces and I received a response immediately.  They were willing to help us and sent us detailed directions on what info they needed to replace the pieces.  They were great to work with and they responded quickly and we had the pieces for the puzzle within a week.  What an amazing company that stands by their product and is willing to help out their customers.  I will definitely be buying from this company again!  Great product and amazing puzzle!
5.0	I love these dolls. I bought all of them so I can give them to my daughter when she'll be five.
5.0	Everything in the right place wonderful for my kid that loves sharks!!!
5.0	It's a good bucket. Ponyo fit right in .
5.0	It's a ball, it's cute and it bounces. Good product. Plus the design is darn cute. It does smell a little, but don't all kickballs?
5.0	&#34;just like daddy's&#34;  grandchild loved his wallet.
5.0	I got this for my Grandson and it's very cute.
1.0	Didnt even get a secret ulti and ultra. When i buy from troll and toad i do receive and secret an ulti 2 ultras 5 supers. I bought it here because it was cheaper but in the end if you spend a little more money you will receive
5.0	Two of my favorite things combined!
1.0	start falling apart here and there after few days used, they not full metal, the top casing is totally plastic, gun part is metal, over all from 1-10 I would give it at 4. NO MATTER WHAT IT IS LOW QUALITY MADE FROM CHINA
5.0	He loved it.  It was exactly what he wanted, and it has a neat stacking/carrying tool so the stacking cups won't get lost.
5.0	I bought this for my 3 year old cousin for Christmas and she loved it. She played with it for days and days, and never got tired of it. This learning game is one of the best!
5.0	Growing up, I remember clay bits stuck everywhere, making clean-up a chore. I'm a huge fan of Crayola's Model Magic clay - you can air-dry or re-use by putting them back into the foil package. Clean-up is super easy, though might stain certain surfaces (we use a flattened cardboard box). Highly recommend - non-toxic and made in the USA. We were gifted the Play-Doh clay several years ago and kid had an allergic skin reaction to it. So far, we're good with Crayola's Model Magic clay!
5.0	Very cute, detailed desserts...exactly as pictured. Included the pink tray.
5.0	Great product! Exactly as pictured! Plus, fast shipping.
5.0	I first saw these in Walgreens & was about to walk past them with my 3 y/o, then we picked one up! We squeezed them all & my son & I laughed & laughed all throughout the store all the while playing with them! The best part is their little round mouth with a couple of teeth - the way it moves when squeezed it soooo funny! I bough two for my children's stocking stuffers for Christmas...<br />And when I brought them home, I showed my husband & both of us got a good kick out of them too! :) Will they eventually end up at the bottom of our kid's toy box? Yeah, sure...as everything seems to...and when that happens just pass them along to another family with children! :)
5.0	I used these balloons for my son's 1st birthday and they were just as cute as the picture shows! Very happy with this purchase.
5.0	So glad I found this gem. My son is obsessed with big brown trucks and loves our UPS man. He carries this truck often and I have found it in his bed on occasion!
5.0	I bought this toy to complete the Gabba gang for my 3 year old and she was so thrilled to see Toodee join the rest of her friends, the toy is very sturdy and well  made. Worthwhile purchase.
5.0	MY GRANDSONS HAVE HAD SO MANY HOURS OF FUN WITH THIS SO I BOUGHT IT FOR MY NEPHEW.  IT WAS NOT EASY TO FIND IT FOR PURCHASE BUT AMAZON CAME THROUGH.
5.0	purchased for my grandson and he plays with the figures everyday.  really cute and sturdy for little boys to have fun with.
1.0	Didn't come with real earring backs and then the needle broke when I tried to put one in my ear. These were cheap for a reason and I would not rec.
5.0	Kids love it, I already reviewed the green one.  The only downside is it will damage carpet or any fabric really.  The colors are so bright that they are left behind even if you can get the goo out.
5.0	This is the second replica I pre-ordered from NECA toys; last year was the Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device (or Portal gun) replica, which was also amazing. I knew NECA was going to create another quality product and they did not disappoint.<br /><br />From the handles (the side one gets attached very quickly and easily) to the claws at the end, this replica is an exact recreation of the Zero-Point Energy Field Manipulator (or Gravity Gun) from Half-Life 2. The build is sturdy, the look is worn just like the in-game model, and it even comes with a fresh strip of duct tape to attach on the side. It has an on/off switch for the lights and sounds (both from the central portion and on each of the claws) and a button on each handle to make the holding and firing sounds. There are also conveniently hidden kickstands for displaying the replica.<br /><br />The only real downsides I've found are that there is no insert as the outside of the box claims (so you have to kind of do the best you can to position the duct tape over the meter, which is only a bummer from the standpoint of a fan who wants it to be an exactly accurate placement) and it seems that the sound effect for pulling is nonexistent, just the sound effects of holding an object and firing it. But that's hardly something to really detract from the incredibly detailed recreation of the tool/weapon from one of the greatest games of all time.<br /><br />Overall, any fan of Half-Life 2 who wants a very cool, very accurate prop replica from one of the two most iconic weapons of the game should get this.
5.0	My boyfriend is obsessed with Portal and we needed a new shower curtain.<br /><br />Popped it up without telling him one night and he came out of the bathroom smiling.<br /><br />Both the shower curtain and the printing are high quality and I've had it for about 6 months now with no issues.
5.0	The dice included with this game are pretty much useless. That said, the game itself is loads of fun if you've already got some decent dice on hand. The game is also perfect for any number of players, you don't need to buy more cards.<br /><br />I'm giving the game five stars because it's great fun and value at the asking price for the cards alone. If you've already got dice this is an awesome value. If you don't already have dice, spend a few bucks and pick some up and this game should provide plenty of fun for any number of players.
5.0	After having flown and trained folks for 5 years back in the mid 80's, I picked this up to get back into RC planes with my 8 yr old son. I bought this along with a 150 mah LiP battery. It has been a blast. Fun to fly with maximum reward. My son went from zero to cruising around around his schoolyard in about 10 minutes. The 150 battery lasted at least 30 minutes. We had light wind which made it more fun flying into it and actually being able to fly backwards.<br /><br />Yes it is delicate but light weight means less mass when hitting the ground so it seems damage is unlikely unless you rip the wing. And the LED lights at evening are so neat. I say evening because even though there are three white lights across the front, it is real easy to lose track of it in total darkness.<br /><br />This is a plane that will trim and fly in circles with zero input. It is fantastic. And given the ability to bind your Tx with other BNF kits, its a no brainer.<br /><br />This is the way to start RC for newbies. And for veterans, it is a relaxing blast.
5.0	These worked out great for our rock n bowl party.<br />The girls really liked the peace signs and bright colors.
5.0	If you are looking for a gift for a 5 or 6 year old boy, look no further!  This ball was a HUGE hit for my son's 6th birthday... not only with him, but even with his older siblings (although it's easier for them).  It took my son about 30 minutes to figure it all out and put it together, and he keeps going back to it and wanting to build it again. So it's definitely a hit in our house of many kids!<br /><br />The puzzle was easy enough for him to figure out on his own with no frustration, the pieces are high quality, and the built in frame for it was well-used by him as well. The vehicles and trucks were an added bonus to my son!  Highly recommend it!
5.0	I love Haba. This game is great fun for children that like to play with marbles. The best part is the marbles are controlled because of the net underneath. The game is fairly simple, try to get your marble to the pyramid and avoid crocidles (losing your marble in a big hole). My 4 year old can play the game to a certain extent. Usually, when we play this game we start out following the rules and then it turns more into pretend play where we move the marbles around or make them race. That's what is so great about Haba games for the preschool set is that the are creative and open ended enough that you can have fun, even if you don't follow the rules exactly.
5.0	My daughter in 1st grade is so addicted to this one . This is such a great gift for little kinders and 1st graders !
5.0	Great for playing with the kids, making walls from bricks made of sand.
5.0	My Daughter Loved It!
5.0	This bed is awesome... very well made!  Definitely great for my four year old!!! Melissa and Doug products are usually awesome.
5.0	This is pretty cool. Great addition to any collection. Comes in a hard plastic case. Love it!
5.0	it is a awsome car for the money
5.0	My daughter loves the grammy and poppy.  We don't see her real grandparents much.  So, she enjoys pretending with them.
5.0	It was great but I could have got it at toys r us $20.00 dollars cheaper.
5.0	This is a terrific game for the whole family.  My four and five-year-old boys have so much fun with it, and are learning to think creatively. It really sparks their imagination and ability to put a story together. AND, it is great for Mom or Dad when you need a break from all the running around activity. Sit on the couch and let them line up the cards across the carpet as you each take a turn telling part of the story.
1.0	The flybar is not exactly same as the original that came with the v911. It made my v911 very unstable. I then replaced it with  another  flybar and heli went back to hovering normally
5.0	Wanted some construction toy that I could play with my 3 year old. I built the forklift and the crane and he absolutely loves them. The parts hold together better than erector sets, and are not as miniature as lego sets.  Ordered more superstructs to play with gears and more models.
5.0	I got this as a gift for my sister, it's pretty cool looking, especially with the coffin case. Great for anyone that loves The Nightmare Before Christmas!
5.0	This product was a big hit with our granddaughter!  It is well made and worth the cost.
5.0	Have bought for many years. Always happy with product.
5.0	We ordered these for my sister's bachelorette party and they are so much fun!
5.0	This set is a must have. It's one of my daughters favorites. The color and pattern is so beautiful and the vanity is so cute.
5.0	Great candles at a great price!
5.0	i purchased one set locally and was lucky enough to find these...great colors and perfect size
5.0	The lid fits well, with average rain it has remained clean and relatively dry inside.
5.0	My 10 year old daughter LOVES this doll. She plays with her all the time. I got it for her for Christmas, and since then, she has played with her consistently. She has already named the doll, and she has incorporated her into her Barbie collection. The accessories are beautiful, the clothes are very nice --- this doll is durable, too, as my 10 y.o. is quite rough on dolls, especially with hair! But this doll here ... is holding up to the test. :-)
5.0	Granddaughter loved as a gift.
5.0	to go with the Crayola product/thank you
5.0	My son is a dinosaur nut and he has tons of dinosaurs from schleich, papo, safari and others but I think this Giganotsaurus may be the best one he has. Generally, I think Papo is a bit better in quality and detail than Schleich but Schleich really nailed this one. Everything about this piece is first rate, anatomy, painting, size, it is just a great piece and any child dinosaur nut would love to have it.
5.0	i love this toy its so cute and no marks
1.0	I purchased two Meeps and these things are horrible. First of all they are slow, they do not play Netflix or any video for that matter, due to incompatibility with flash player which apparently is an Android problem.  I did find instructions on how to download flash player from someones comment on facebook. I downloaded flash player, but was unable to open flash player. The system is to confusing and I figured I would buy a kindle fire instead. The Meep parental site, was also slow or unable to get into site all Christmas day.  Games are boring and battery does not last long, camera quality is cheap. The one thing I liked was the texting ability for my kids, but a feature I would not use often.  I spent many hours researching ways to download systems and try to improve this product with no luck. Parents spend your money elsewhere.
5.0	I bought these to use with my class. I really like that the container has a spot for each letter because just by looking at the container it is easy to spot if one is missing. I noticed that for some kids that need OT the stamps can be hard to pinch out of the box. However, it is good practice for their fine motor.
5.0	Gotta get these. Carnor Jax is a beast! He took down a Decimator from Range 3 without getting hit (thank you, Stealth Device and Autothrusters) while holding the flankers at bay without their tokens. It was glorious.<br /><br />Also, the paint scheme means that the Baron Fel gets to fly in his proper ship and not the stock painted Interceptor. That makes me happy.
5.0	Very realistic sounds of short and long horns and bells. Locomotive details are excellent. DCC controls are easy. However longer twisty tracks could be lot more fun for kids. Tracks can be bought separate.
5.0	Everyday my Aunt posts how much her coworkers absolutely annoy her with all their bulls***. So I figured this would go over very well on her desk!
1.0	This product is a SCAM! Not a real caterpillar tractor, not even a quarter of the size of the real thing! Wholly incapable of maneuvering large quantities of cement or industrial waste, indiscriminately plowing down bucolic forests, or smashing asbestos filled warehouses.
5.0	This rick is very accurate and seems to be heavily based on the large version of rick. It's perfect and comes with the famous Python Revolver of course, as well as a Glock with a flashlight as a silencer from the TV show. Even though it is silly it is faithful to the show. He also comes with his trusty machete, although it doesn't have a red handle as it does in the show.
5.0	This is a fun little chart. It looks very well made. The animals are also finger puppets.
1.0	This product only resembles vidal sassoon's rotating AIR brush, but it is NOT. As such it's usefulness is VERY limited... You would still need to use a second device in your hand to style your hair, which is very inconvenient.
5.0	Better than expected!
5.0	When I bought the amiibo I was alittle skeptical at first. I thought I was getting scammed but I did receive Meta knight! The amiibo came sooner than estimated and the paint is amazing. Very good.
5.0	The WASGIJ puzzles are difficult because the picture on the box is not what the finished scene looks like.  These puzzles take more time, patience, some guesswork and imagination. Very challenging but rewarding in the end.  I've done several and I like them but my husband doesn't want to do them any more.
5.0	Super sticky, and the kids LOVED them!
5.0	"My little boy loves this thing!  We actually bought this size so he could grow in to it.  The description says \\""not for children under 3\\"", but mine is 21 months, and it's still perfect size for him with room to grow.  The only real choking hazard are the bolts that are required for assembly, but once you tighten those down, they're not coming out.  Only downfall is the handle is covered with a foam that can be easily torn off (with teeth or fingers).  But, the quickfix for that is to just wrap a dish towel around it and tape it.<br /><br />Overall, great toy!"
5.0	Love playing this game with family&friends
5.0	I gave this to the little girl next door and she absolutely loves it.  Even wanted to take it to school with her and took it to bed with her.
5.0	Great brainteaser, but it is on the easier side, so I would say it is better for a child.  To me, these are great to have around for entertainment purposes if you have guests, or to keep a kid busy while waiting in a doctor's office.  Great stocking stuffer.  If it starts to get old/boring, create a new interest by seeing who can solve it the quickest.
5.0	What can I say PERFECT , Super Fast Shipping A+++++ Recommend to all
5.0	Hess makes quality toy vehicles.  Great for collectors and sturdy and fun for kids to play with!  Great Christmas presents!
1.0	Not a good product . It only works if it can see the other.
5.0	I purchased this as a Christmas gift so we have yet to open it, but we love the other LEGO Friends products so I'm pretty sure my daughter will love it.  It was on sale, so even better for me.
1.0	Thought these were going to be much bigger than what they are :( I was going to use them as decoration for my centerpieces at my wedding and now I don't know what to do with them as they are to small to use not to happy but I guess that is my own fault.
5.0	I looked long and hard for an easel for my 19 month old twin boys.  My husband will tell you I looked too long and hard.  I finally decided on this one after being torn over the 50/50 reviews of the Melissa and Doug Easel.  I am soo glad I went with this one.  It is very sturdy and sized well enough for toddlers to reach but still have enough growth in it for several more years.  The clips to hold the paper are sturdy however probably not tight enough to hold a single sheet of paper.  The magnetic white board was perfect for use with the Melissa and Doug magnetic letters, numbers, and animals they also received at Christmas.  The chalk board did not work especially well at first however after repeated drawing and erasing it now seems fine.  I bought mine elsewhere for significantly cheaper though.  Sorry Amazon!
5.0	This game is so fun.  My young nephews love it and so do I!<br />The shipping on it was so quick.<br />Great price!
5.0	My bff is moving so I'm getting her and me to split it and she loves it
5.0	After reading all the reviews I purchased the hydro rush from Amazon. It was my grandsons 7th birthday party. We had 12 kids ride the slide & play all day non-stop. WOW it was a big hit. Put it up in about 15 min. Worked great all day. Very happy with it. It seems to be built very well. Looking forward to using it the rest of the season & many more. Dried it out real good & then used my leaf blower to completely dry it. It folded up real tight, even fit back in the bag that came with it.  Deek
5.0	I am an adult collecter of plush toys, and I got this on a whim and he's been lots of fun. Well made, very soft and cuddly. My friends and I especially enjoy the bedtime music feature. The sound quality is very good, and not too loud or too quiet.     There are so many names available online, I didn't like how he pronounces my name so I had him say a nickname instead, but still spell my name. :)    My one issue is that he can only be surface washed, which is understandable with the electronics involved, but I can see it being a problem if he becomes a child's very favorite toy.      Scout or Violet is well worth the $20 price tag, if you know a little one go for it, you won't be disappointed.
5.0	If you've played Cards Against Humanity you know that it is about showing your real humanity, and the expansion pack just helps you along.
5.0	This is a awesome pack of rubber bands! Great colors and so many of them! My kids really love it!
1.0	We got the girl version of this castle (in pink, instead of gray) and it didn't even last a month. After the plastic/vinyl cloth got the tiniest rip in it, it continued to rip and the entire structure fell apart (ok, so that was a little dramatic, the ribbing was no longer contained and that is why it feel apart). Surprised this toy hasn't been recalled as a safety and/or suffocation risk.  Not to mention, it was IMPOSSIBLE to put together.  My sister in law cursed my name for weeks over this toy.<br /><br />Like every other Discovery Kids toy I've ever come in contact with, this toy isn't worth the cost of the cardboard box it comes in. Seriously, not sure how this company is even still in business.
5.0	First off, what I really love about this gift is that it gets my son out of the house, away from the TV and out in the fresh air.  The copter was super easy to get started and easy to read the directions and controls, even for a smart 9 year old.  My son had the chopper in the air and flying in a matter of minutes, easily hovering and flying around the park that sits next to our house.  AFter a couple of crashes, the chopper was back up in the air in no time.  It did have to adjusted after a few crashes so that the remote control could manage a little more accurately and not drift off to one side .  But once the controls were fine tuned, it was so simple to fly.  I even took a few turns at the controls, dive bombing a few dogs that got to close to us at the park!!! LOL.  Overall, I am wholeheartedly happy with my purchase and my son is ecstatic.  I recommend it to any father who wants his kid pried away from the TV and out into the fresh air and park or field to fly their new copter that is worth every penny!!!
5.0	Love this game, it is great for the family as well.
1.0	These broke almost immediately after I took them out of the package and was trying to set them up.
5.0	Bought this for the sake of nostalgia, from The Gaming Broker.  It arrived sooner than expected, in the condition described, with a plastic protective sleeve.  Shipping was in a bubble-wrap envelope.<br /><br />This card is one of the main storyline showpieces for the second series anime (the one with which most English-speaking Yu-Gi-Oh fans will be familiar).  Decent monster, if you play the TCG, although its value as a play card is decreasing as Konami publishes increasingly powerful cards.  Mostly, it looks cool, and it's kind of fun just to have one.
5.0	Ok call me crazy but I bought this for my 10 year old Chow Chow who loves to float in the pool with my husband and I<br /> It is big enough for him and I if he will shift up to the top I have room to join in the relaxation.  Greatest money I have<br />ever spent on a raft
5.0	My boyfriend loves it
1.0	This item came 3 months late and was all broken when we got it.....it didn't even grow don't even waste your money....
5.0	perfect gift for my grandaughter
5.0	Safari's new Edmontosaurus looks great.  It has a great look to it and is posed in such a way that it can stand right next to the new Tyrannosaurus rex they have made.  The dinosaur has great coloring and good muscle structure.  A must have for any dinosaur fan.
5.0	I bought this gift for 6 kids in my family they each got one all rangeing for ages 7 to 12 They all LOVED them and so did the adults
5.0	My grandson lives in this - soo cute
5.0	I bought this set for my boyfriend for a Birthday gift...He loves them.  :)
5.0	Never experienced anything quite like it.  Can't put it down.  In fact I have quit my job to allow me to play with this toy full-time.  Now that I have purchased this toy, my job has become superfluous.  It is now apparent that the only reason I (or anyone) had a job was to purchase this toy.    The only part of the transaction I'm not happy with is that I forgot to enter the code to save $10.  Stupid!  How could I be so stupid?
5.0	Crayola Crayons are the best and always will be the best crayons on the market!  I remember as a kid getting the &#34;big box of crayons&#34; like this and now I am able to get them for my boys, too.  Thank you!
1.0	I am sorry I purchased the Tile Lock Scrabble game.  The differences between the original game board and this one are:  the board is a lot smaller, the letters are plastic, the letter holders are plastic and if you have medium to large fingers you will have difficulty placing the letters onto the board.  Not only did I pay for the game, I also paid S & H.  Shame on me.  I am glad I still have my original game.  I will not return the product since I would have to pay the S & H again.  Janet
5.0	One of my favorite board games. Takes longer when you play the first time but once you get the hang of it loads of fun.
5.0	Awesome Lego set. Super fun to build!
1.0	The item I received is the new version of Monopoly, not the one pictured here. I was specifically looking to buy the older version. This is deceptive advertising.
5.0	"We use this with our JrHi and SrHi Youth on fun nights.  It is entertaining for everyone, especially the adults!  Not as combersome as scrabble and have the right to yell \\""Peel!\\""  So glad our new ministers brought this to us!!"
5.0	This was a gift for my 8 year old. She really likes it. I was surprised to find that the Skipper doll is made really nice. It also comes with a cute pet and outfit. Not a ton of stuff but it is straight to the point. If you are looking for a Skipper doll, then this is a nice one.
5.0	I just received the candles today they are so nice cant wait to put them on the cake!!!!!!
5.0	Humm.....surprised at the bad reviews.  Great that it doesn't dry out since gets left out (have had to throw away playdoh because starting to dry out)!  It can be crumbly but all you have to do is press it into a ball shape and it stays in the shape (or whatever shape you want).  When we clean it up I just squeeze it all together and it stays and when we make the puppy and food items it holds the shapes so that my 3 yr old can play with the puppies (i.e. have them eat their food :)).  Though afterwards does like to sometimes smash them ;).  We do get some of the moondough on the floor but vacuums up fine.<br /><br />You do have to make sure you press down the moon dough well into the dog mold to get all it's features but was able to show my son how pretty easily.  He can also turn the crank himself and then there is a puppy in the dog house :)!
5.0	I collect everything HQ. This toy is the basic HQ that Funko makes - there is one with a mallet, a glow in the dark one, one in a different uniform, etc. etc. They are all pretty cute and well made. I just have them in a display case -- they DO fall down often because they are top heavy :D
1.0	This boat will burn up if you run 6s stock on it. It needs a dual rudder, water outlet and aluminum jacket to run cool and not die. That's another $100.00 if you want good looking good stuff It's also plastic. Don' get me wrong if you get it setup properly it's fun. Traxxas has horrible warranty service and customer support. Nothing like Horizon Hobby . We are talking about night and day.  If you are going to buy a boat I understand this looks cool and everything but you are simply going to be buying it for that factor until you add all the extra's.  Do yourself a favor and choose a Proboat. If something happens Horizon will help you no question to ask. Traxxas will charge you again. I have had this boat and all other proboats and I will never choose a spartan again after having fiberglass and true 6 pole system.  You have been warned!
5.0	Our Granddaughter loved it!
5.0	My son plays with them often.. they are great.
5.0	Over all I'm pretty impressed with these drive shafts.  I did find one problem with them.  To get them to fit on my Axial Wraith, I had to drill the holes out a bit deeper so that the grub screw holes would line up.  I countersunk them about 1/16 of an inch and that fixed them right up.  So just a heads up when buying these.<br /><br />I had a spare set of these laying around and thought I would try them out on my Axial SCX10 Honcho and they worked sweet too.  Still had to countersink them like I said with the Wraith, but they work great with the SCX10.<br /><br />They are worth having on most of your axial products.  Thats my two cents.  Hope it helps.
5.0	Perfect replacement of the previous loom our daughter had.
5.0	With all the game options out there, I wanted to make sure and introduce my granddaughter to a classic game like Yahtzee.  I loved this game as a child, and, sure enough, she loves it too.  So many skills are used for this game to help kids....counting, decision-making (how many dice should I roll again?), writing/tallying (keeping score on your card), taking turns, and even learning to spell a fun word like &#34;Yahtzee!&#34;  As others have stated, it would be nice to have the leather cup back again...the sound of rattling the dice inside that cup is different than any other sound!...but that's no biggie.  This really is a game that every family should have!
5.0	Its gr8 m8 if i could i would r8 8/8. This changed my life. I shrekt so many people with the useless swamp holy crap.
1.0	We used these as decorations and party favors for our sons party. These were a pain in the rear to put together and they were constantly falling apart. Not all of the pieces fit together very well so you'll have to glue them together if you want them to stand up or use as a display. I know they were cheap but I didn't expect for me to put them together stand them up and then have them fall right apart.
5.0	These blocks are great!  They're larger than most blocks out there (easy grip for little hands), brightly colored, intricate designs (to keep a child's attention), and durable.  The paint and raised designs are going to last, especially when compared to simple painted blocks you see at places like WalMart.  My parents have had a set like this for years (for the grandkids visiting), and they're still like new--only their set came from Vermont Country Store and was more expensive.  I was very happy to find an exact set for a cheaper price here on Amazon.  My almost 1 year old plays with these daily; he's already stacking them, sometimes 3-4 blocks high.  Excellent skill-building toy, hours of fun!  You won't be disappointed.
1.0	We bought two of these ponies for our horse-crazy granddaughters. Within just 2 weeks, both ponies had broken legs...the exact same leg, at the same place. Let's just say both the granddaughters and we were very disappointed.
5.0	I recieve the beautiful pink castle for my niece .my niece love it she feels like she's a princess on a castle .It is very easy to attach easy to set up and take down.its light weight so it's easy to carry from one room to the other.the design was lovely the style was eye catching color was perfect foe little girl . The castle is exactly like the picture shown. The price is reasonable also so much better than the other play tents castles out there. I highly recommend it. I purchase this under promotional item with my Honest review and own opinion
5.0	Always a big hit in my classroom. Note some items may contain latex.
5.0	This is a very beautiful puzzle. I am going to frame it.
5.0	Lovely doll.  Well made, lots of bits to keep my daughter happy.  Body shape not too developed, so great for a child/ young girl ( as opposed to barbie).
5.0	Perfect for school ID.
5.0	I gave this set along with the Food Groups set to my grand daughter for her 3rd birthday. It was the hit gift!
5.0	These are great for additional crayons for the Crayola Dry Erase Light-up Board I purchased for my daughter as a gift!
5.0	These are great to take along when we are traveling when they are more easily lost.  The price and quality are great.
5.0	This is a really good value. I was a little concerned because other reviewers implied that the horse's fur was shabby or cheap-looking, but I was very pleased to find that it is soft and plush. The legs are sturdy and the size is substantial, without being so large that my 3YO could be injured from a fall. The head is stationary, so get ready to make a lot of left turns...maybe your kid will go on to be a barrel racer.
5.0	Keeps the little one entertained on road trips
1.0	Two pieces are missing from the pewter color and one knight in gold was broken.  Did not open the box until after Christmas and now the return policy has expired.  Extremely disappointed due to the cost.
5.0	Huge hit with the 18 month old who always wants to play with my laptop!  The price was right too.
5.0	My daughter is a big fan of the Doc McStuffins show so for her 2nd birthday I got her this kit along with a set of 4 of Doc's stuffed animal friends.The toys have stood up to the not so delicate handling of a 2 year old and she has a blast giving Lambie, Stuffy, Chilly and Hallie check ups (along with all her other toys and the members of her human family). =)
1.0	I also purchased this item online from toys r'us and saw no disclaimer that it required a $30 battery pack to work!  This sort of information should be red flagged on the description!!  This was for my son for Christmas and I am online now looking to find the specific battery to make it work.  My son was disappointed he had to wait to try it, but we'll give it a go - it just better be worth all the effort!
5.0	We're big board gamers in my house, as are all our friends. We've played a few games of this and had a blast every time. It's easy to learn, it's cooperative, it's got great art and sturdy construction.
5.0	This is a fun game for our basement, we get a lot of compliments on it from our guests. At the price, you absolutely cannot beat the value. You will not find a better quality upright game for less I gaurantee. The only drawback to it is that it is shorter than the ones at the arcade or the bar, my husband being tall has to bend a little more, but that's it!
5.0	The model is available from a number of sources.  It's a nice kit of the Spruce Goose.  I'm mainly commenting on the service, which was first rate.  The model arrived promptly and was undamaged.  The price was good, too.
5.0	My four year old loves it. He loves that he can build with his Legos Santa brought him without them sliding away from him.
5.0	I purchased these in all the rainbow colors and gave a set to my nieces. They love the translucent dice and how you can use them for any game using dice, from Yahtzee to Greedy and beyond. I'm such a cool aunt.
5.0	Perfect pants for our beach wedding bought the shirt last year that matches cut outfit. Matches all the groom/ groomsmen
5.0	The glasses arrived on time. The frames are very bright, seem sturdy and do not have any black lettering or anything on them. The lenses are so cool and bright, unlike anything 've seen before. My friends and I are wearing these to the Life In Color concert and should have a lot of fun. Very very satisfied with these!
5.0	These toys are so cute and great for sand and imaginary play.  My favorite thing in the set is the dinosaur feet. The set comes with a bucket and 12 pieces. The pieces include a rake, 2 shovels,  a crab,  octopus,  castle,  2 fish,  pair of dinosaur feet, duck and a starfish.  The colors are very vibrant and will keep your child's attention.  My two year old loves to play with them and it keeps him busy. I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review and all opinions are mine.
5.0	Larger than I thought it would be which is what I was hoping. The latch is easy to manage for little fingers. I bought this for my 3 year old granddaughter.
5.0	Love these, they are really good sized and high quality, with just a few mold seams. My son can have epic dino battles between the huge t-rex and bronto.
5.0	Quick and what my child wanted. Thanks.
5.0	Seems fairly sturdy-made of nylon-shouldn't tear easily. Kids seemed to love it, and played inside. Easily accommodates several kids.  Could be put up and down easily if need be.
5.0	good educational game
5.0	This is a very cute rocking horse.  I expected it to be a little bigger (taller) than it is, but I intend to use it for generations in my family.  I love the softness of the horse.  I do really love that its very safe for my 2yr old to get on/off it easily and I don't worry about her falling off of it in the process.  Great product so far!
5.0	These Picasso Tiles are a great investment for your toddler or even older. These provide hours of fun! They are just the same and as amazing as the magnatiles!
5.0	"If you want a wonderful video review of the product you can check here:    [...]    I cannot stress enough that it is required viewing if you are interested in this toy.    This is a beautiful toy. It looks amazing, due to the attention to detail and the painting being very clean; I also have the Robot Damashii (Robot Spirits Figure) Arbalest ARX-7 figure, and both are top quality. This is a line that Bandai, the company that has these toys produced, seems very proud of maintaining high quality for. In fact, I also have a cheap $10 rubber Godzilla modeled after the original 1954 film that looks great as well. I also have Bandai's release of Cowboy Bebop the anime and it's also fantastic quality. Way to go Bandai!    This toy comes with some great accessories. Extra hands to switch between punching, gripping the swords, or gripping the guns. It comes with two distinct guns, two identical swords that look very cool when being held; don't be afraid to push the sword down through the hands set up to grip them: the hands are malleable enough. There are sheaths for the swords, but they're decorative only, and while they can be put on the back of toy, you can't fit the swords into them. It comes with two smaller knife-like items, but since I don't follow the anime, I don't know exactly what they're called. They look cool though. There are four spear-like weapons, on the end of bendable wires that attach to the forearms and thighs. They remind me of Scorpion's weapon from Mortal Kombat, when he screams \\""Get over here!\\"" And they are all great quality as well.    If I had the money, I'd buy more of them. But it's expensive to build the worlds smallest giant robot army when they have to be imported from Japan on such a small scale."
5.0	My boys love these. Some reviews said they broke if you threw them so I just told my boys to not throw them. They still work fine.
5.0	I used this to replace damaged solder pads on a high dollar tablets usb charge port.  Worked perfectly!
5.0	He runs pretty quick & my 3yr old nephew loved him & played with him for hours. Would definitely recommend
5.0	Son and husband love.
5.0	My grandkids always ask for mega blocks or legos.  This set was a big hit. I would recommend it. I got this one for my 7 year old
5.0	My daughter loves this doll !!
5.0	This was a gift for a 7 year old boy who is hugely into legos right now. He loved it and the price was great! Makes this the perfect gift!
5.0	Made our &#34;Harry Potter&#34; look authentic
5.0	My daughter equates ironing to sewing, because that's when she sees me iron.  Santa surprised her with her own ironing board, iron, and fabrics so she could iron fabrics like me!  I was worried it wouldn't be a hit, but boy was I wrong.  She loves it!  It's in my sewing room and gives her something to do while I sew at times.  I did purchase a separate iron that looks like a miniature version of mine.  Very realistic and I think that helped a lot.  The iron it comes with is really cute, but doesn't look like a real iron.  This doesn't fold up once you set it up unless you unscrew a specific part so it's made to stay out.
5.0	GOTTA GET A GUND!!! Brilliantly soft :)
5.0	This key chain is really cute and durable. I've had it for a few months and it looks as if it were new. It has Edward's portrait, the Cullen family symbol of the lion, and the heart that he gives to Bella in Eclipse.
5.0	Is a huge hit with my almost 5 year old. Kept her busy for much of a 12 hr car ride!
5.0	I was very happy with this purchase...but I do not recommend it for anyone who just wants a quick fix. I choose this because I liked the idea of giving my niece something to discover rather than just open a box. She loves it and has already decided that she will have a Spa Day party for her birthday in April:)
5.0	This is well made with higher emittance of light.  Likely because the whole BMO mold glows!!! Collect all three variations: glow in the dark, metallic and regular.
5.0	I bought a Thomas the train Brio set 13 years ago when my son was small.  Now that I have grandchildren, we pulled out the old set and realized we needed some new pieces to really complete the set.  I needed curves  and bridge supports.  My concern was that over the years the design might have changed but these pieces fit perfectly and my 15 year old put his old set together and it was fantastic!  Bring on the grand babies!
5.0	Loved putting this puzzle together as a couple. It took us a couple of weeks, but it was a rewarding endeavor.
5.0	I would definitely recommend this product to others with small children/grandchildren.  My little one is having a ball with it.  She stays at the desk to color now instead of wandering around and coloring on walls and furniture.
5.0	these onsies are just great. Very good quality and nicely made. My grandaughter loves them.
5.0	yes i would recommended
1.0	We all learned an awful lesson from this kit: the ants are NOT nice and friendly when they are accidentally released from their enclosure. I heard screaming downstairs and ran down to find ants everywhere and my kids running around hysterically crying and trying to beat the biting ants off them. They'd each been bitten at least once and had huge, angry welts that stung for quite awhile afterward. And then my son discovered one more in his shirt. Oh, the screams and frantic chaos... Luckily, the ants were mostly scattered on the couch and contained neatly in the cover that I could pull off. If is wasn't for my husband, I think I would have burned the whole bundle, just to be sure they were dead... And in case you were considering buying an ant farm for your kids: just don't. Those things are not kid friendly.
5.0	These binoculars are so cute and look like they will be sturdy enough for our 3 year old great grandchild. He will have fun being on big boy safari.
5.0	I bought this with the idea of using it as a girl scout project.  My daughter and I made the blanket and it was simple and easy.  I bought one for my mother who is bedridden to have something to do and she enjoyed making the blanket as well.  The blanket comes out very nicely and is LARGE.  Makes for a great picnic blanket.  The tote can be decorated and carry all your stuff to the beach.  My family had fun with this project and also got some useful picnic gear.
1.0	Too short and not work the money I paid for it.
5.0	This was a great find for me and it came early on top of every thing else! The picture is somewhat brighter than the actual product, but there's no discoloration so far with it. It's pretty durable as well, so I'm definitely recommending this to all my Sailor Moon fan friends!
5.0	My kids are happy and enjoying their gift.
5.0	I ordered these for Easter for the babies in the nursery and they LOVED them!!! If you have young children and are looking for a good item for the goody bag that's not candy....This is a great item! :) I would order these again in a heart beat!
5.0	Bought this for my grandson who is 11 years old.  He enjoyed it after assembling it himself....without help from Grandpa or Dad.  His friends also became quite interested.  I also bought him &#34;Basic Machines and How They Work&#34; which is an excellent complement to this robot.
5.0	This grandkids had soooooo much fun! The adults tried them too. Held up pretty well!<br />Must buy two!
5.0	Love our Kermit the<br />Frog Puppet.  Marion Matson
1.0	The taste was terrible even for a 12 year old boy
5.0	Our cats love these- they bounce and roll erratically and the cats just love that!  Only problem is they keep losing them in the house and I probably vacuum them up by accident!  :)  Great fun toys, small enough for them to carry around.
5.0	Great Hat. Great price
5.0	This charm is the best. I finally have something to put on my cell phone! I love death note and now I can have something to remind me of a good television series
5.0	Pretty cool gift for someone you love. Took a couple hours to get put together for me. Try doing it without the instructions!
5.0	You can buy replacement glitter at barbie.com under mattel them replacement parts under barbie then the item number i just bought some it is 3.00, have seen this complaint alot so i thought i would add this for anyone who is looking at the doll.
5.0	My daughter absolutely loves this playset. It's fairly small compared the 'normal' sized playset and comes with different mini-ponies (depending on where you buy it). The mini-ponies are about the size of the littlest pet shop figures, without the bobbling heads. The accessories however are TINY, and I wouldn't recommend this set around any child younger than 4. The mini-ponies themselves are fairly sturdy and solid.  <br /> <br />There's a lot of attention to detail to the playset. The are also lots of cute accessory sets that can be purchased for under $10. I like the fact you can buy packs of the mini-ponies for around the same price as a regular sized pony. This is a great way to have a good sized pony collection for your child, without having to give up lots of room. All in all, I think this Ponyville theme line of mini-ponies from Hasbro is a keeper and a nice addition to the My Little Pony world.
5.0	I like this. You can find out how dark you get with it on.  I would recommend this product.
5.0	I am not a jigsaw person myself. But when I stared doing a puzzle I enjoyed a lot.   I highly recommend this product.
1.0	Not only was this clock made of terrible plastic, the hour hand was broken.  Also, the Cuckoo bird that came out made a horribel noise.  It did not sound like a bird but more like a recording with a lot of static.  If I could give this clock negative stars I would.
5.0	We love imaginext ! These came so quick and in condition as stated. Cant wait for my son to see them Christmas morning =)
5.0	This is a very cute, soft, and cuddly panda bear. My child loves it dearly, and I am sure that yours will too. Great product at a great price!
5.0	Just a fun toy to play with. Take him apart and slap him back together with limbs in the wrong place. What's not to love?
1.0	Buyer beware,<br />The bow is so small that the only costume that it would make any sense using it for, would be a 2 year old huntsman. It seriously cannot be more than 18 inches long. The frustrating part is that the seller must know this. Yet there is no attempt to publish the dimensions of the product on the items page, as they know it would stop selling immediately.<br /><br />If your child has graduated from diapers, do not buy this for their costume.
5.0	very nice color no problems with seller
1.0	This was such a disappointment, The table and chairs are so flimsy. It has small pieces. Don't waste your money.
5.0	NEW FURBY IS AWESOME! The app is fun we feed it bacon egg and cheeses. One of the personalities is mean. You can pull its tail
5.0	Pumba,<br />Product was as described, my Granddaughter just loves it. Ever sense she saw the movie, she fell in love with Pumba
5.0	Great gift for granddaughter, putts along on the wood floor in the house with ease.
5.0	I chose this rating because I love the empire state and its amazing how as was done this structure with puzzle pieces and lights give a special touch. I love it!
5.0	Parcel arrived here quickly and everything was excellent.
5.0	I am a product of lego in the early 80's. And while I was more into the cowboys and horses, my daughter actually played quite a bit with these larger legos. Well done, lego.
5.0	Good for Family quality time.
5.0	I liked the work of this seller.<br />All done quickly and with good quality.<br />I will continue to work with him and seek advise.
5.0	My daughter loves her little couch!!!!! So cute, very lightweight, easily wiped down, don't believe it can be really washed.
1.0	Description says and we wanted series 1 but received series 3...very disappointed!!
5.0	This figure really needs to be seen and felt to be believed. It's huge, and heavy, very sturdy. I don't have any fear about it falling apart. But he also has a really good center of gravity, which makes it easy to pose in a variety of positions, including running. The head is actually deep within the helmet, which is awesome and gives it a sense of 3d reality. Amazing for photography.
5.0	The invitations were great quality and very cute.  Got compliments on the theme.    Love that the inside said 1st birthday party.
5.0	My expectations were high and they were met. I am very pleased with the process and the product.
5.0	I got this for my 4 year on his birthday.  He loves the open design and uses the castle as a base for other toys.  There are a lot of small parts that are not suitable for a 4 year old but it was easy to put those away until later.  Playmobi has only pictures for assembly instructions but the main parts are not small.  We are now looking for the add-on parts for Christmas.
5.0	I have bought near 15 package of this.  They come in diferent colors and they don't break easely.  I recomend it.
5.0	BOUGHT THIS FOR GRANDAUGHTER SHE LOVES WEBKINZ<br />AN LOVES TO BUY CLOTHES FOR THEM. VERY WELL MADE<br />AN CUTE.<br />LOVED IT.
5.0	Our niece Morgan will adore her Panda necklace with her Panda earrings!<br />We predict she will tuck both in the unique Panda case and treasure them.
5.0	I got this Senbonzakura Miku figure from another site for a fairly low price & I would advise shopping around as amazon sellers seem to be selling her for really high end prices at the time of this posting. That said this review & star rating is primarily geared at the figure itself & not amazon prices as I did not get her from Amazon.<br /><br />How to begin, This figure is just amazing & I don't think most of the pictures out there do it full justice. Miku's hat can go on and off as it just sits on her head. I had fun placing the hat on my Kirby amiibo and letting them hang out as a team. This Miku figure is also highly detailed and easily competes with some of my best amiibo's in the detail department. However, I will add that she is much taller then amiibos and could easily stand at about the height of 2 of them stack on top of each other.<br /><br />This Miku does not pose, so if your into placing your figure in multiple poses then look elsewhere but if you want a nice figure to just sit on your shelf she is just plain adorable. I also would not get her for small children as she is kind of frail and is obviously meant just for looks. She would not last long under rough handling.<br /><br />I also learned not long after getting Senbonzakura Miku that this figure must be popular as there currently (at the time of this posting) about to release both Len & Rin Senbonzakura figures designed specifically to go with this figure. I so want them but I will have to wait until sometime after they are released to the public before I can get them to go with her.<br /><br />This really is a great figure & most any Vocaloid fan would love her. I would not be surprised if this is one of, if not the best looking Miku figures out there. I just love her.
5.0	This monkey is a kids favorite
5.0	Needed a toy for a birthday for a 1 year old and found this fit the bill.
5.0	Oh wow! I just got this in the mail for my little sister and its bigger than I thought it would be! Its so cute! I got it for for her Christmas so I have to find a place to hide it but I can't wait to see the look on her face when she gets it. Its perfect for hugging and sleeping with. I ordered this Friday and it was here Monday night when I got home! I was amazed! Its soft and looks cuddly.<br />I hope this review helped in making your own choice! :D
5.0	My niece loves it.  The chest really opens.  She has the animal set, but the one complaint is when my niece spins the head, it comes off!
5.0	My 9 months old daughter loves to play with her new minnie mouse toy. Its super cute and she is fascinated my the spinning minnie inside.
5.0	she only wants wear this for sleep
1.0	Very dissappointing. Letters too small and magnets not strong enough for an upright magnetic marker board.  Have to buy different brand.. So mad at myself for not reading the reviews first.
5.0	Perfect size for inside use. Our 21 month loves it! I can also fit comfortably to play too. Vibrant colors, quality construction and very easy to set up. You also don't have to attach the tunnel if you don't feel like it. Our little guy can see out the through the top screens in the tent when standing so we placed it by the window so he can see outside when he's playing if he wants. Also easier to check on him through those screens too. Great buy, great price compared to other tents we checked out.
5.0	We bought this Fire Truck for our 2 year old for Christmas 2011. He's now 3 and is still p[laying and enjoying the truck. It's very strong and durable. He does sit on it so it would be nice if it was just a little bit bigger. But so far it's taken a 3 year old boys 'beating' and shows no sign of breaking.
5.0	Contrary to other reviews, I bought this for Xmas 2013 and did not detect any odor whatsoever. Granddaughter loved it .
5.0	We have used this walking rope with our toddlers during an evacuation drill.  It worked great!  They all held on and the spacing was perfect so they were not tripping over each other.
5.0	bought this with my boy in mind who likes to be prepared. only wish they made a double bandolier! oh well.
5.0	Just to let you know where I'm coming from: I'm a long time H.P. Lovecraft fan/Cthulhu mythos enthusiast, and RPG/boardgame fan. Haven't gotten into any CCG's or FF's LCG's...Yet.   The quality is excellent, as I expected of a Fantasy Flight product. If you've wanted to try Arkham Horror, but were a little intimidated by its mechanics, options, and slew of expansions, this is a GREAT game to get. It's a lot like AH, but has simpler rules, faster play times, and all the same Lovecraftian thematics. My wife and I love it. The rules are written succinctly, and simple enough, yet allow for a lot of variation in play experience  and table-rulings. The art and design is awesome. The replayability is great as well.    My only problem is that some of the heavy cardboard chits (the life, sanity, and investigator tokens, specifically) are really way too small. (Think 1cm^2). We've remedied that by using red and blue d8s to represent sanity and health (your abilities' maxes are never higher than 7), and using actual miniatures for our investigators (easier to see, and pick up).  I really hope they make expansions, I'll buy them. It does come with a nice stack of adventure cards, but the item, magic tome, etc. card stacks are thin.  Anyway, if you like HPL, FF games, and want a faster, lighter play experience than many of Fantasy Flight's other offerings, pick this up.  Peace.
5.0	Great job and would recommend it to others.
5.0	Excellent product.  We like it so well, I am ordering one more for a friend.  Good quality.  The carry case is a great convenience.  Thank you
5.0	"What a cute doll this is. Her sweet little voice cycles through various phrases during play/use.<br /><br />I was surprised that the walking function actually works as well as it does. We only had a few falls, but that was on thick, plush carpet. She will walk best on hard surfaces, or low carpet.<br /><br />She is just the cutest thing! She is not a doll that will be cuddled with so much though because she is hard bodied. Her arms are light weight & hollow plastic, giving a somewhat \\""cheap\\"" feel, but if they were heavier, she probably wouldn't walk so well.<br /><br />This is a toy that you can count on it performing like it should. Alot of times, companies come out with these advanced toys with tons of features and they just don't work as advertised - this is not one of them. She walks and talks just like the commercials show and she will not disappoint your child with constantly falling over or otherwise malfunctioning.<br /><br />It is nice for toddlers to be able to interact with the doll and use some imagination, instinct, coordination, etc. Baby will ask for \\""Mommy\\"" and the child can interact and give the help that is needed, fostering care and nurture.<br /><br />She also seems pretty durable. My neice dropped her on a natural stone floor and she didn't break or malfunction in any way, although it did seem like she hit the ground pretty hard.<br /><br />I'd say this is a toy that is orth the cost. She does what is advertised and seems like she will hold up well to normal use."
5.0	Great product, I love having a mount ready and waiting for my camera.<br /><br />The adhesive works great.  It was easy to apply.  Dirt and dust do have the ability to gather on top where there are two small exposed areas of the adhesive from underneath, but this doesn't affect the way it works.<br /><br />Would recommend this product.
5.0	I am somewhat new to this so bear with me.  <br /> <br />This model kit is an excellent example of Bandai engineering.  <br /> <br />     It has numerous parts, each one meticulously detailed and molded in its final color. No paint is necessary for the completion of this model, although I recommend painting the eyes. It gives a better feel for the original anime mobile suit. <br />     The detail of the inner skeletal mechanism of the arms and legs is fantastic. It even includes screws for stabilization of the joints. This kit features unique removable armor pieces, meaning the pieces are designed to fit over the skeletal structure, eliminating the hard to hide seams common with the lower grade model kits. <br />     This kit features seperate pieces for customization if one desires to do so. The model includes a set of colored stickers for the eyes, and a set of rub on decals for the shoulder and shield. This includes the leader stripe for Shiro Amada's suit, along with the numbers for each team seen in the original anime Mobile Suit Gundam:8th MS Team. Also included are decals for the individual pilots of the 8th MS Team, for further customization. <br />CAUTION: The rub on stickers are very delicate. Be very careful when removing them from the protective backing.The set I had stuck to it so I had to improvise. <br /> <br />This set does come with a variety of accesories seen in the anime as well, including various weapons. <br /> <br />This kit is meant for advanced modelers. I would recommend that unskilled modelers try the basic and High grade kits first before jumping in at this one.  <br />Overall it is an awesome kit with excellent detail and a great bargain.
5.0	This is one of the best games Ive ever played, the whole duration of play is filled with laughter and snark. At the end of the game you might offend most but no worries all will be forgiven with 3 or 4 rounds of gameplay. Not recommended for those under 18.
5.0	this adds a lot of crazy funny cards to the already hilarious game.  Must buy if you like the normal Cards against humanity game.
5.0	My daughter received this upon turning two. This basketball set, which resides in our living room, has been played with daily for the past 4 months. The blue/red color combination looks better than what I was able to find locally. Great return on investment considering the hours of play it has generated. Lots of family participation with this toy as well. Everyone who comes over wants to play too. If desired, you may weight the base with sand. While such may be necessary if used outside, we have not needed to do this for indoor play.
5.0	I got this as a gift for my 12 year old.  She has had her friends over to play it several times and it seems like it is lots of fun!
5.0	I bought these for my 3 year old granddaughter and she loves them.  They are sturdy and beautifully painted.  They're also easy for her to take apart and put back together.
5.0	Awesome & what a perfect size.
5.0	Went great with my Lego Duplo base plates, and for a great price!
5.0	everything as stated.
5.0	Great soft bumpers to help protect my little ones while they enjoy their wagon.
5.0	Soft safe and utterly adorable. Favorite gift at the baby shower! Mom to be and guests raved about it for the whole shower!
5.0	My GD is all things Frozen this year and I decided to see if there were dolls (wow--who knew??!!)  I purchased both sisters (Anna and Elsa).  She's not quite 4 and went wild.<br />Her review:  Yaaaaaay!!  Yaaaaay!!  Yaaaaay!!<br />My review:  They are lovely dolls and well made and the clothese are sturdy and well-made.  The aren't overtly &#34;Feminized&#34; like &#34;some dolls&#34; and they have given her day-after-day of imaginative play.<br />Result:  Yaaaaaay!!
5.0	Love these bins for my grandsons. Great to keep toys all together and neat. Have many of these and they are stackable. Makes a great easter basket.
5.0	my sons math teacher recommended it to have fun and help with his math skills, he is in 6th grade. I don't actually know if it helps yet or not.
5.0	My daughter loved it!
1.0	They arrive broken not all but like 7 rings
5.0	It is a very fun toy for little kids. It was a so good choice for a birthday day gift
5.0	The price was very reasonable
5.0	Parents will find it gross...kids love it. Great shock value.
5.0	I selected this puzzle based on reviews and my guess that it would not be too difficult for my two young children (8 and 10).  The pieces are cut in the standard shapes which allows you to sort them by type (as opposed to some of the more challenging puzzles designed for older children and adults).  The colorful birds gave my kids a good starting point, but the more uniformly colored areas above and below the birds were fairly challenging.  My kids and I worked on it over about 4 days on and off during the winter holidays.  It's nice enough I almost considered framing it (as some puzzlers are known to do).  I look forward to remaking it again next year!
5.0	Got this for my little grandaughter who pronounces it opotus. She's a doll.
5.0	"The Pros:<br /><br />  * Speed: To give you an idea of the speed we're talking about, it was twice as fast as an energetic four year old running full tilt. Try as he might, my son simply couldn't keep up with the Ricochet.<br />  * Durability: To test it's durability we ran it into a tree several times, ramming it again and again, flipping it over the roots and running it 2 feet up before it would fall down again. We also took a few hard runs at a telephone pole- it bounced off harmlessly. The only thing we did notice is that with hard cornering, the rubber tires needed to be re-seated on the rim. A minor detail for the beating that it took.<br />  * Range: The range was impressive, running about 50 yards before it became unresponsive. A 50 yard straightaway is plenty of room to run wild, especially with little kids chasing it.<br />  * Power: We ran the Ricochet over both grass and blacktop- it obviously ran better on the asphalt, but running in the uneven grassy park made it bounce and jump.<br /><br />It's also worth noting that this was an excellent way to torment my parent's yorkie- he wasn't sure whether to attack it or fear it. By the time the battery wore down, the poor dog was trembling with adrenaline and trying to chew the wheels off.<br /><br />The Cons:<br /><br />  * Battery Life: Speaking of battery life, a full charge will give you 15 minutes- that's it. It warns you on the instruction book, but that still doesn't soften the disappointment when it starts to slow. Keep in mind this is using one of those rechargeable 8-pack-of-AA-Batteries-taped-together battery packs. You trade power and speed for battery life, but it's mostly worth it.<br />  * Battery Cover: If you're making a toy with a 15 minute battery life, you better have a darn good battery-replacement mechanism. Instead, they have 2 very tiny screws that are recessed in the lid- within a month I'll have at least one (if not both) stripped. Take a page out of the Leapfrog Explorer, which has a giant slotted, spring-loaded screw- you can open it with a butter knife if you needed.<br />  * Turtle Syndrome: The cool thing about the ricochet is it can flip 180 degrees and drive upside down. What it can't do is get off it's side if it lands \\""edge on\\"" on the wheels. It justs sits and squirms until you kick it onto all 4 wheels.<br /><br />The Meh:<br />  * The record feature: The remove included 3 buttons- 2 green bumpers on the top and one big green button in the center. It wasn't until I read the instruction manual that I found out that the buttons (when used in combination with a 4-slot slider) could record movement macros that you could play back later.  This may sound great on paper, but the implementation was buggy-you had to press and hold the play button to get it to run, half the time you weren't sure if it was actually playing or recording, etc. I'd rather have seen those buttons go towards tricks.<br />  * Educational value:  This is not an educational toy- Don't kid yourself. You could argue that there are lessons to be learned about velocity and momentum, but don't. It's an RC car- an incredibly fun *toy*. Just be content with that.<br /><br />Verdict:<br />My son was incredibly upset that he couldn't play with it. I promised him after then next charge it would be his turn. Or perhaps the charge after that...<br /><br />If you have kids, get one and make up excuses about how you have to test it before they can play with it- once they get the control, you won't get it away from them.h a butter knife if you needed.    * Turtle Syndrome: The cool thing about the ricochet is it can flip 180 degrees and drive upside down.

5.0	This game is so addicting and so much fun!
5.0	We got this for my brother in law's Christmas gift, and it was definitely a hit!<br />It was easy to assemble and he loved it!
5.0	I bought from this seller's website a few months back and item came exactly as described! I got Charizard Lv.X and 2 rares and 2 shiny cards! Good buy and fast shipping! Son was very happy with these cards!
5.0	Nice cabinet.  Was a gift for a mom who I bought a drawing set and 9x12 sketchpad for her daughter.  First comment is it will be nice to display a special piece at a time in the frame instead of filling up the refrigerator with everything.
5.0	Cause it was in very excellent condition. It was for my gf and she loved it . she was very pleased
1.0	I have used this toy in a daycare setting and found it to be unsafe.  It was constantly tipping over when the rider would rock back and forth.
5.0	When you live on the other side side of the world and have to buy gifts and beat the exhorbitant postage charges, I go to Amazon.  Here I found for my 3 year old grandson this great toy.  My son video'd him playing with it.  The look of intensity, purpose and satisfaction on his face as he used his drill to reassemble his toy was brilliant.  My family tells me he loves it.  Takes it apart, puts it back together, takes it apart.......    What a great toy.  They tell me its durable, perfectly sized for little hands, and challenging without being defeating.  I'm so glad.    The biggest problem seems to be keeping his 5 year old sister from taking it over!
5.0	Feels and looks good, keeps you warm too. Lightweight and vibrant colors. Highly recommended even if you aren't a fan of the anime, no fussing with long scarves ever again
5.0	My daughter won't put it down
1.0	Was in pieces when received. The whole album was not put together the glue was apart, wouldn't recommend it, very cheap and flimsy. I glued it myself but I kept falling apart. Pay more and get something worth it
5.0	This is a game for horrible people as stated... lol  It's just an adult Apples to Apples but with some horrible words.  So much fun though.
5.0	Fun toy at a very reasonable price.  My 4 year old son plays with it for hours.
5.0	Here is a dragon for the boy's to train. This is a beautiful well styled dragon.The coloring is great with nice shading of blue and white. His skin is designed well to show bumps under his chin and different sized horns on his head and body. The rider has blond hair and holds a spy-glass in one hand and a sword in the other. A very great addition to any dragon collection.
5.0	This game is really fun. Plus, you can learn a lot of really good strategies from it, so that's why I gave the education a four. It's pretty durable, and it doesn't really get boring at all.
5.0	My kids love everything about these beads, and they especially love using the scoop that came with.  They are somewhat small, so be sure to watch them around younger children.
5.0	Granddaughter loves these for some strange reason.
5.0	I have to say this mask is absolutely beautiful.  My 11 year old wanted to wear a mask and ball gown this year for Halloween and chose this one.  I was a little nervous purchasing it online because it may have entailed a return if it didn't fit or look right.  Well, we opened the box and behold, an extradorinary piece of art that is actually on display in our home.  Worth the price.  Worth the smiles.  Now, that whole ball gown thing.......
5.0	I bought 2 of these for my grand daughters for Christmas. I was pleased with their quality and sturdy feel. Now to see if they withstand the test of time but I really do not expect any problems.
5.0	This is one amazing car I bought from target 2 months ago.. I've been a fan of Mario for so long. I also have a Mario one and I enjoy letting my student and other people use them to race. And let me just say, kids will so much fun playing with these. They go quite fast and are durable and very easy to use. Control distance is good, was able to be over 40 ft away and still have control of yoshi. Mine took a lot of bumps and still functions perfectly. Every time I drive it on a nice day out or on the streets, people will be so amazed at seeing these kind of toys because of how cool  The turning was a little tough when you start off but as you get to how yoshi drives. It'll be easier to understand how to control him. I so would recommend this toy to anyone. You will not be disappointed
5.0	cuter than expected will make an excellent gift-for the manatee lover! I cant wait to give it!
5.0	Bought for a gift and she loved it.
5.0	This was a really fun gift for baby and she loved it so much! I would buy another in a minute! Safe and cute!
5.0	Bought one for each of my 2 & 4 yr old granddaughters.  They haven't seen them yet but they'll be thrilled since they love their Angelina DVDs.  Impressed with all the detail inside and out...front door opens, frig opens, and cute furniture.  Agree the bed is much too big but probably won't be an issue.
5.0	My son absolutely loves this. He will play with it forever, molding cars and parts. He loves molding the wheels to go on the cars. The car molds turn into working cars, lots of fun.
5.0	Hey it's Hot Wheels and Flintstones. 'nuff said :-)
1.0	"We love and have many Melissa & Doug sets, but this one doesn't \\""take the cake\\"". First and the biggest complaint is the permanent markers. The ink doesn't come off clothes nor the cupcake themselves.  Not smart thinking when dealing with a product for young kids.  We've taken the markers away and just had her play with the other pieces.  #2, The paper cupcake holders are just that, paper.  They didn't last very long.  And last, the candles don't velcro very well to stand completely upright; they are just too heavy for the velcro to hold them up, so they flop over some.  Stick with the cookies, cake or pizza.. those are great!"
5.0	Great new cards to add to my current CAH deck.
5.0	Truly is one of the most creative building systems around! Never gets boring. Pieces are beyond sturdy and will not break. 5 stars :)
5.0	Beautiful representation of a brave and heroic little dog who survived the abuse of Michael Vick and company.....please don't forget what he did...I purchased 3 from different sites, kept one and gave the other 2 as gifts....we all love Jonny !!!!!!!!
5.0	Fun game.  It's hard to find Scooby-Doo items in the stores, so I was happy to find this!  My child loves it!
1.0	I don't recommend this to anyone, I got this for Christmas present for my 11 year son, he was excited he try to build it and he said that the pieces don't fit together, then my husband try too he said the same thing, I just ship it back and hopefully I get my refund soon.
5.0	Love that its machine washable!
5.0	Absolutely adorable...my granddaughter loved it!
5.0	I got it for someone as a Christmas gift.  they absolutely loved it.  they  couldn't be happier this year  with anything else
5.0	Feels solid<br />Easy to use<br />I am not an expert but wanted to practice using a slingshot.<br />I think this would be a good one to start with.
5.0	So cute and she recognises each item and what to do with them. She's 22 months old and does very well playing with these.
1.0	This is a horrible product. i bought one months before at a hobby lobby and built it,having it hard to attach the feet. it broke, i gave up. I just bought a new one, for i was more experienced. when i folded the first piece, the head, to its proper position, it broke of its this fold. I tried gluing it, and it wouldn't stay. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!
5.0	My daughter loves it!!!
5.0	I myself have absolutely no idea what this toy is all about. It was on my great-grandson's wish list for Christmas. It was brought to my attention around Dec. 20th. or so that he &#34;Really REALLY&#34; wanted it so I put in my order. It was here in no time at all and turns out it matched the rest of his set he received for Christmas perfectly. Like I said, just fine.
5.0	Great made -in -the USA option for baby toys. It arrived on time and was as described.  Great gift for baby
5.0	My 9 yrs old is into dinosaurs and fossils and this did the trick. The only bad thing was he went right into it and he uncovered it in about an hour.  He does play with the t-rex after putting it together.
5.0	To shred the skies you need some juice!  this pack give you that juice I was mentioning just a second ago.  A full juice will last you about 10 minutes, then you're out of that juice I keep mentioning.
5.0	This is a cute addition to my grandson's (2 years old) Thomas the Tank train set.  He loves the bells and lights and spends much of his time directing traffic across the railroad at this gate.  Recommended.
5.0	My daughter carries her doll everywhere!
5.0	For my grandson for Christmas, he should like it very much.
5.0	This is a great stroller trike.  It's great for the price because it can be used as my nephew gets older.  He has a ball on it.
5.0	I bought this for my 3 year old son who was crying one day because his 8 year old sister would not let him play her DS.  It's been a real hit with them both. It was very age appropriate, he could most games on the first try. He has played the game that comes with the MobiGo as well as the Dora and Toy Story 3 games.  He likes them all and I think it's fun and educational, and I like the way the educational aspect is intergrated into the game play.  Unlike my DD's old leapster or DIDJ where you're playing then have to answer a math question, the learning is part of the game.  I give it high marks for durability, as my son dropped it down the stairs already and it kept working like a champ.  It's easy to hold, the screen is very bright and clear and I am happy that this is targeted to pre-schoolers.  This is a great toy!
5.0	Hpi did there work on this savage considering that my savage around 6-7 gallons of nitro through the stock engine. The only thing that has broke on this monster is:1 plastic spur gear,1 upper a-arm and thats about it. Right out of the box it does 45mph and you can add upgrades (that amazon has) to the monster truck it self and make it go faster if wanted.The only things you should do before running is use medium stregth loctite on all screws and watch the video the Hpi proudly gave you with you purchase.:) ALSO GREAT FOR BEGINERS.
5.0	This little set of beads was a perfect way to get my daughter interested in making her own jewelry, and jewelry for gifts for friends and family. The carrier is not flimsy by any means, and as long as you TEACH you child how to open it correctly, the beads dont spill everywhere.
5.0	We have lost the instructions and would love to have a copy so we can play it correctly thank you
5.0	The card was in perfect condition. Mailed in a plastic cover to protect integrity. Got it earlier than expected. Strongly recommend.
5.0	It was worth my money and it came very nicely packaged and the playmats are very nice again this is a good product
5.0	This toy is great for kids that can follow directions well. My son made some awesome things out of it. It's educational AND fun! Win for parents and kids!
5.0	This Leela is a great addition to an already existing funko pop collection, a starting one, or someone who just loved futurama when it was on the air. It is currently one of four in the collection and supposedly there will be exclusive variants in the works. It's a very cool decoration piece if nothing else and I highly recommend it. Sometimes, like other skinny Funko pops, she might have a tendency to tip over but it's not a major issue thus far.
5.0	This is a card game which moves quickly and teaches kids (and adults!) how to use some strategy and their memory.  Great family fun!
5.0	My 5 year old grandson loved this!  He quickly built everything on the cards....very much fun for him!  More! More!
1.0	I got Very very bad service. the set i got had only 21 pieces instead of the listed 22. Highly disappointed to get an incomplete set with missing piece....i am not buying from this seller ever.....
5.0	When you order Melissa and Doug you know you are getting a superior toy for your child. I have four grandchildren and I buy the majority of their toys and plush animals from this company. My granddaughter stopped opening her birthday present so she could put her mirror together. You can't go wrong when you order from Melissa and Doug.
5.0	Our granddaughter's lovey!! Had to get a 2nd one &#34;just in case&#34;!
5.0	Bought these for my son's 5th birthday party. They were a huge hit, very easy and fun for the kids to make. And very reasonably priced!
5.0	Awesome this toy is! Ha, ha, ha. That's how Yoda speaks. This toy rules, I'll tell you. Turn the upper part of the base and Yoda will levitate in the air. Base has a detachable edge that Yoda can use to levitate with his blue force power. He's got a cane but doesn't fit well in his hand, though. And he's got a dinky lightsaber with a removable blade. This toy goes well with Count Dooku, since he and the old Jedi fight each other on Geonosis. And the funny part is how Yoda keeps jumping up and down over Dooku.
5.0	These are such cute centerpieces! I got them for my dads surprise party and they will definitely help the decor out!
5.0	I can't believe what a wonderful learning experience this has been.  We basically started with six short words.  From that we progress to four or five words a day.  She is also printing the words as we work.  Each time we work, we review all of the words.  This has been the best thing I have ever gotten her.
1.0	Never worked.  Charged everything, Changed batteries in sending unit.  Got the rear rotor to turn once or twice.  Waste of money.
5.0	My 2 year old daughter loves it!
5.0	Daisy loves her float she cruises with me in the pool and at the lake.
1.0	Very cheap quality product.
5.0	I have been looking for an action figure of Robin Hood for a long time. This is just what I wanted. It will be part of this years Halloween costume for work.
5.0	This is a fun little toy for your little worker! It can be a bit loud at times but hey that's most toys, lol the mallet is actually really well built and kids have a blast trying to whack those pegs down for more to pop up
5.0	Gave as a gift for a friend for her birthday, she loved it and it's of a really good quality.
5.0	The guitar case is well made and has enough room for head phones and the stand in the side pocket.
5.0	My daughter loved this.
5.0	I have not seen him use it, but it has gotten rave reviews from my grandson in St. Paul.
5.0	This is such a fun toy for little ones just learning to walk (or even for more experienced walkers). Fisher-Price recommends it for babies 9+ months, but even younger tots can enjoy the sounds the elephant makes and don't necessarily have to use the toy for to walk. I do recommend that supervision is always used as new walkers definitely trip and stumble quite a bit and this toy doesn't always have a perfectly smooth ride. It's easy to push along, but with a baby's stride not always perfect (and other things getting in the way), there were a few trips.<br /><br />I wasn't aware that I would have to assemble part of the toy, but it ended up being super easy (just make sure you have a screwdriver on hand). I was also pleasantly surprised that it came with batteries included. The sound and music aren't *too* annoying and they can actually be turned off (phew!). It will be interesting to see how long the little ones stay engaged with this toy before getting bored by it. The good thing is, it's very easy to clean and so, can likely live handed down through many years. And let's be honest, a blue elephant never really goes out of style!
5.0	I wish I bought this beginning of summer! I'm 5'7&#34; and 140 pounds and works great. Happy I found it!
5.0	6 yo nephew absolutely loved this version of Toothless and it's travelled with him everywhere for the last month.  The blue &#34;dragon breath &#34;  was a little tricky to figure out at first ( how to load the water to make it fog), but we eventually got it down and it's been a hit !
1.0	I purchased a box of these because there is a yellow(!) marker and a REAL green marker, and they are so hard to find!  Boy, was I disappointed when I found out that these won't erase at all unless I get out the spray-on cleaner.  Standard erasers just won't do it.  I don't have time to waste on markers that won't come off.  After using them once, I decided I never would again even if they do come in great colors.
5.0	Radio Flyer has always had good toys for kids and this one is right up there with the best! Little boys and girls will love it.
5.0	I love this cage, however one of the previous reviewers was correct...you need to trim the INSIDE of the front pads otherwise they would/will dig into the body of the truck.
5.0	I take pride in always getting my husband an awesome gift for his birthday and Christmas. He was beyond happy when he opened this!
5.0	I bought this for my three year old niece. It is a great little kit for the little artists. Lots of fun so they can experience texture and shapes. It shipped very fast and I have no complaints.
1.0	The lock on this diary won't open for us.  We are so disappointed with the quality.  My 8 year old daughter has been waiting for it to arrive and it is beautiful, but she is so upset she can't use it.
5.0	This was a family gift to a 70 year old brother who once broke one of these. It brought back many fun memories.
5.0	With the actual books disappearing from our markets this is the closest to a regular book and interesting enough for a kid to combine technology and old fashion lecture. great toy, lots of fun.
5.0	I used this chest in a old version, is amazing because is possible play in any place alone, use in learning mode and get different game levels.<br />Now I going to buy this new version to practice to my next tournament competition.
5.0	My daughters love these...they look just like the cartoons and they play with them in the bathtub nightly!
5.0	I love my plane, 1st I would dab a little epoxy on the bottom dragg area lower tail - it wears down to quick when landing.  You have to make sure the prop is fully snapped on.  Never fly it with the medium or long string outside with any wind period.  Recommend flying indoor or a double garage.  Make sure you are not in advance mode - this is done when pressing the right toggle inward - plane will fly twice as fast and elevators will make it do a flip.  Do not try a flip with the small lenght or medium length string, it will crash head first into the ground and break the engine mount.  I reglued my engine mount by seperating the two halves with a razor blade.  Epoxy the mount and then elmers glue the styrofoam back together.  Rubberband the nose till next day - works perfect.  Still flying - great for practicing control and landing.
5.0	We are enjoying the game immensely thank you
5.0	This is a great puzzle. The pieces are thicker than a lot of puzzle pieces. It has very unique shaped pieces so I find myself enjoying them and lose focus on the puzzle! Anyway, great puzzle, still have not finished mine. It is hard.
5.0	We got Melissa & Doug Chef Costume set for our 4 year old for his birthday. It was a big hit. I was worried it might be too girly, or as others have said, that the hat is no good, but I think the whole thing was perfect. The hat and accessories come stitched to the jacket. The utensils have a loop stitched around them to keep everything in place in the packaging. You will need to cut the thread. The hat is Velcro and very cute. It fit my sons head great, with enough room to adjust as he grows. I was impressed with the quality. I have been unsure about buying Melissa & Doug, because their prices seemed a little steep for a costume that I figured would be Halloween costume quality and only last a few months. I was wrong! Great quality, thick material, worth the price!
5.0	We are very happy with this purchase. It had the tag and was sealed in a plastic bag. No mistaking that it was new unlike another purchase I made with another seller.
5.0	Well made- great price. My son loves it!
5.0	How can you not love a dumptruck  named Patrick.  Thomas the Train wooden cars are just the BEST and will last for ions.
5.0	If you are looking for a fun deck builder game, this one is right up there. Defiantly recommend this to fans of zombies, werewolves, or vampires.
5.0	This was a real hit with my boys ages 8, 6 and 3.  They really looked forward to seeing what parts were going to be added each day leading up to Christmas.  I did cover the front before giving it to them so that it would be more of a surprise.  I will be getting this again next year.
5.0	I got this for my 8 year old nephew for Christmas.  He loves games and likes this a lot.  He can get a little distracted, so we'll see how long he likes it for.  I'm happy with my purchase though and I feel good knowing I got him a game that is educational (though he doesn't need to know that part).
5.0	Bought it for my 30 year old son for Christmas and we played that night.  You have to have a sick sense of humour to enjoy this game.  Every time we have a family get-together we make sure that he brings it with him - we all look forward to playing this game and my children have seen a new side of me!
5.0	Came in great condition, awesome card
5.0	As you Guys all know, flying a drone is a new experience and takes a lot of practice to get use too. during my trial and errors I was going though a lot of parts that originally came with the drone, so I was in need of more spare parts, came on amazon.com and order with Coolplay spare parts and the shipment arrived at my front door in no time. Thanks Coolplay for keeping me flying, I'm just about a master of my flying!!
5.0	Santa made a very wise decision this year and ordered this power loader for my son for Christmas.  From the moment he opened it he has played with it constantly.  He is a year and half and every morning as soon as he wakes up he runs over and sits on it.  When the weather gets nicer it will be moved outside but right now, it is running my living room.<br /><br />Santa's elf, my hubby, who is excellent mechanically took a little over an hour to put this toy together.  There are both picture and written instructions on two different pages in the manual.  However, the written instructions don't correspond to the picture instructions so it can get pretty confusing.  One written instruction may cover up to five picture instructions.
5.0	It's cute, my son loves robots. Big enough for folder, lunchbox , and change of clothes. Good quality
5.0	I take my little girl to daycare each day - 30 minutes one way.  I put all kinds of toys in her lap to keep her entertained.  She seems to like this toy more than most.  I can see what she is doing since I picked up one of those headrest mirrors that let you see your child in a backward facing car seat from your rear view mirror (also from amazon).<br /><br />It's been dropped plenty.  Keeps on ticking, not overly annoying for everyone else (like many toys) and keeps my little girl entertained.
5.0	Grandson loved this present.  Walks around with Sully in one hand and the blanket in the other.  Product exactly as described; fast delivery.
5.0	Love these. We used these for a birthday party and hung them in my sons playroom after. Its a LARGE set.
5.0	I keep these in a ziploc bag inside the diaper bag and they only come out when we go out to eat.  That is usually about 3 times a week.  My toddler acts crazy until I pull these out and she gets focused.  She loves making animal sounds as she pulls them out one by one and hands them to her family.  And we all have mini puppet shows while we wait on the food.  Lots of people have asked where I found them.  My only issue is that a few of the little black dots for eyes have fallen off.  It could be from overuse because it's been about 4 months now!
5.0	"I bought this cruise boat for my daughter as a 3 Kings gift and she loves it! It as been very durable and of all the Barbie accessories she seems to always go back to this one. We have bought the plane, car and other items and they are all the same, plastic, decals and some \\""fold out\\"" options. Just remember you are buying plastic. That being said it has been durable!"
5.0	so far it works charging battery
5.0	These three lego building plates are awesome, my son creates all kinds of building creations and displays them. I would reccomend these building plates for any child who likes to create with legos.
5.0	This item is adorable and perfect for my lil' girl's nursery!  When considering buying it, note that it does NOT come with an arm to hang it from, nor any music box.  Easily enough obtained whether through clearance baby mobiles or just shopping for the parts, though.  Minor assembly required (places the wings into the dragons) but it gives you the freedom to mix & match colors.
5.0	I got a ultra rare blue-eyes and a dark magician!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I love this you should buy it! It comes fast,easy and good.
5.0	My sons second favorite Xmas present. Flipped s*** when he seen everything this toy can do. Great quality. So many things it can haul and do. Interchangeable parts. Great shipping. 5 Stars hands down.
5.0	I'm glad that I got this for my DBZ pop funko.
5.0	product arrived on time and was as expected. thank you
5.0	Just got this for my daughters 8th birthday and we now have a singer at home. Its a great product to have for kids who love to sing, or to get kids into singing as well. My daughter sings with this everyday since she got it. We have a superstar right in our home!
5.0	my 4 year old son has been fasinated with road signs, I was printing them off and going through lots of signs. This saves paper and ink and my son can make as many signs as he'd like. The only issue I am having is all the orange construction signs say ONSTRUCTION and are missing the C.  Isn't a big deal for us as he doesn't know any different but anyone who needs these for a project will just want a heads up.
5.0	Just as pictured and it holds 5 decks with ease.
5.0	Very cute! 5 yr old granddaughter wanted this for Christmas. She was so surprised to get it. She puts all kinds of things in it and sleeps with it, too.
5.0	Grandson loves this add on to his hot wheels track.
5.0	Loved this musical toy, so gorgeous!<br />Well made and the toddler boy loved it.<br />Kind of old fashioned but modern and strong.
5.0	This is advertised to have an upgraded radio remote control and, hence, seems to be $3 over regular red/yellow/blue S107s. Not so... although I did get a white one, it's just the same as the red one - equipped with an infrared remote control. I'm not sending this back because of $3 difference, BUT did they send me the wrong item or is this deceiving advertising....you be the judge.
5.0	Love it.  The likeness to the movie is pretty good.  A must have for any fan of Labyrinth.  I hope they decide to make the other door knocker (the one with the ring in his mouth) to complete the set.  It's not really a toy that you play with though.  It's really just decorative.  Great for a Labyrinth themed party.
1.0	The screws for the handles on our set did not fit.  They were far too big for the metal posts, and poked all the way through the opposite sides of the plastic handles. We had several people check the directions, and all determined they included the wrong screws!  After about an hour of taking it all apart again and trying all possible screws, we gave up.  Other reviewers noted easy assembly, so I can only assume we got a bad box, suggesting poor quality control.  Looked fun, but this one is going back.
5.0	Nice big dots to see ... everyone had a great time playing Human Marbles.
5.0	Very cute! It's smaller than you might think but I didn't read the dimensions. Works perfectly and is very adorable.
5.0	Love these for my son
5.0	Wss gift for grandson snd he likes it s lot hope vthst is s goog answer s review should be 5 words
1.0	This toy is impossible to clean, and my 5 year old son has a very hard time turning the icecream dispenser handles.  I was so unhappy with it that I donated it.
5.0	I bought the horse for my son, a three year old, to help him know the different kinds of horses. I like it for a number of reasons:<br /><br />- The paint job on the horse is well executed. Different shades blended nicely to depict the muscles.<br />- It's durable, obviously surviving a three-year old for over six months without a scratch.<br />- Each piece of the Schleich horse presents a different breed in different stance.<br /><br />One thing you may note is the legs of this horse are stretched to different lengths to make sure it stands. Not a big deal, but be mindful if you want to use the horse as a model for drawing..
5.0	I ordered 2 pairs since they were so inexpensive.<br /><br />Both of my pairs came before the delivery date, and both were in perfect condition. No scratches, and each in an individual fitted snap shut bag surrounded by bubble wrap if I remember correctly.<br /><br />These are BIGGER shades as described and exactly what I wanted.<br />No comment on durability besides mine have been fine for daily use for at least a week and a half.<br /><br />Slick shades. Would order from this seller again.
5.0	Perfect for that 3- or 4-year-old who loves garbage trucks. Hours have been spent tearing up paper and dumping it into the opening and then turning the crank to move it into the main compartment. This truck is well-made, too. It's big but not too big. It was a huge hit.
5.0	My friend owned a real car like the model. He couldn't believe one could get this model. He was a happy camper.
5.0	Like with all party decor themed items it tied in nicely. It is really long in comparison to other birthday banners I have used so you may need to cut it if you are working in small areas.
5.0	We have bought several of the v-smile games for my daughter and so far this one and The Little mermaid are her favorites.The best thing about this game is that one of the activities is a lot like a video game.It will tell you to find all of the same color objects such as:find all of the white flowers and you walk gathering that color.You have to jump over obstacles or crawl under them and it is a lot like a regular video game.So it is educational but of all the v-smile games we have this is the one is the closest to a nintendo or playstation game.The care bear game is my daughters least favorite,she is 4 1/2 yrs.old,and I think it is better suited for younger children.
5.0	It's a shame the Star Wars Action Fleet series is no longer made. These were the best star wars vehicles you could ever hope to get. They are a good deal larger than your standard Mico-Machines toy while being a good deal smaller than the vehicles build for the Kenner action figures. Perfect size if you enjoy ships but can't store the full sized ones for the figures. At the same time the level of detail on the toys rivals those of the full size toys.<br /><br />The X-Wing fighter had to be the most popular and most sought after of the bunch, as it was the Star War's universe's version of a powerful multi-role fighter jet, and considered the most well rounded star fighter. The details on the toy are impressive with the entire scale of the ship much more true to the actual size of them on the film in comparison to the pilot. The engine detail is great, as well as all the cursory details of the deflector shields and other mechanics. Even the cockpit shows controls all around it similar to the film. The four lasers on the end of the wings look really good too aside from the barrel &#34;muzzle&#34; being filled in rather than having that radar dish look (understandable for a toy this size not to go the fragile route). The only glaring omission I noticed were the proton torpedo launchers aren't really evident. A bit disappointed considering how they picked up on everything else.<br /><br />The wings do indeed open to the classic X-Foil position and back and the mechanism for this seems solid, and won't degrade and loosen easily. I should know. I have had mine for almost 20 years. The &#34;X&#34; position doesn't seem to open quite a wide as you see in the movies, but the difference is minimal. When the wings are open you see the additional engine detail like you do with the full size toys. The X-wing also has fully functional landing gear positioned just as they are in the movies. The landing gear is very close to looking authentic, and compliment the toy rather than distract from it. The only other moving part is the cockpit for inserting and removing the pilot.<br /><br />It seems each Action Fleet vehicles comes with two figures. On this one you get an X-Wing pilot and astromech droid. The droid in the one I got is shaped like R2-D2 but is colored black instead of blue, similar to the droid R2 was standing next to during that mission briefing on the first movie. The droid is surprisingly detailed for its tiny size. Same goes for the pilot. Everything from the controls on his chest plate to the various straps and tubing on the suit to the graphic designs on the helmet is there. One thing Micro Machines excels at is fine details on tiny objects. The fighter pilot fits snugly enough in the cockpit to not shift around when &#34;flying&#34;, and the droid sits on a mounting peg that keeps him sitting tight.<br /><br />All in all this is an excellent toy with a size that makes it easy to collect more of them and enough articulation for your kids to have a load of fun with them. If you are a Star Wars fan or has a child who is you would do well to search this one out and get it.
1.0	Nothing about this add and all available info led me to believe that this would be silver colored dollar store putty, wrapped around a magnet.  Very disappointing especially regarding the cost!
5.0	Beautiful costume m y daughter love it.
5.0	Hands down best toy at a great price
1.0	This toy was a terrible value, but the only one we didn't have in the Doc characters. My son would not let me send it back because of that.
1.0	This small picture came with teency tiny numbered areas and a short brush with a large bristle head. Even with a single filament and a magnifying glass, filling in the spaces smaller than fairy tears would present quite a challenge. This pbn also requires mixing colors. These are moot issues however, as all the paint had completely dried into rubber balls. The pulpy cardboard was also unevenly cut. Still, when given lemons make lemonade. I give this 1 star instead of 0 because I did end up using my own paint and brushes and transforming this into a painting of 2 cats from outer space, one blue and one magenta, doing important work: the blue cat stands in front of a portal while the magenta cat deejays providing the NECESSARY soundtrack to their adventure. I also gave the blue cat only one eye, so you can tell she is the captain.
5.0	I was introduced to this game with the print-your-own version by my sister during a shared family beach vacation.  If you are the kind of person who is going to be offended by gross humor, or sexual humor than leave this alone.  But if you can get a laugh out of the off-beat then you will love this.  And yes it is worth buying a set because the cards are larger and higher quality than the ones you can make at home.  Makes an excellent gift for that young adult you know who is heading back to college.
1.0	"I bought this product for my children, ages 2 1/2 and 1. They used it maybe 3 times. We deflated it, to put it away for company coming. When we got it back out and went to inflate it, it ripped along one of the seams...about 10 inches, so much bigger than the \\""patch\\"" that was provided. Since it had been longer than 30 days, it was not covered by the warranty. I do not recommend anyone purchasing this."
5.0	This is amazingly realistic animal.  Very well done!  the legs are pose-able so it can freely stand!
1.0	My son and daughter love Duplo blocks. However, the Duplo blocks that arrived were obviously previously opened. The box containing the blocks arrived with: the tape that was supposed to close the box already cut, the box tops were loosely folded together to close it, the individual bags of blocks had also been opened and loose blocks were everywhere. This was not a matter of something coming loose in transit. This was obvious, intentional, and impossible to not notice. It was most definitely someone else's returned item with no attempt to repackage. I did not pay full price to receive a refurbished item.
1.0	This toy/sled is the biggest piece of garbage!  It has been hyped on U-tube and it's really not worth a crap for anything!  To start with I'm a father of 2 active and sports oriented kids, a son who's 10 and a daughter who's 9.  To get an idea of our outside frame of mind we snow sled, ski, snowboard every year and they both play hockey, baseball and basketball and we live in a middle class suburb of Chicago.  This year we went to upper MI were my kids and their friends stay outside for hours going down hills on saucer sleds (which from our testing of all the other sleds are the absolute best).  All of the 6 kids with us, ages 7-10, tried these for about 2 minutes and said they suck!  The spooner's would go about 4 feet and then just stop and the kids said they tilted to the side and they couldn't stay on.  As for using these during the summer if you've got a bike, basketball court, baseball field or a park field around you why waste any time tooling around on this thing?  In the summer my son and daughter ride a ripstick waveboard and skateboards and these are infinitely more fun than this spooner piece of crap.  As a final note what a piece of garbage this thing is: Since Christmas when my kids and their friends got these they have been sitting in a pile outside my garage and have not been touched once, the kids have absolutely no interest in these.
5.0	It's simple. It's fun as hell. People always have a great time playing it. And some of the things written on these cards are pretty horrible. A must buy.
5.0	Got it for my kid's Halloween Costume, this item is WAY BETTER than expected.  Build Quality is great, optics are real and clear, the case is well built and functional.  Overall you cannot go wrong if you looking for a mini telescope. Im not sure if its a light metal or a high grade plastic, but its durable enough where the kids drop it and thrown it (had it for a month now) and its still in &#34;like new&#34; condition.
5.0	This case holds many many squinkies and my granddaughter loves putting them in it.  Easy to open and close.  Good buy!
5.0	I bought this for my Grandson for Christmas. He loved it very much. He hasen't played with it very much.
5.0	Perfect, just what I wanted
5.0	Great strong bands...nice color assortment!
5.0	Wi love this bag so much I take it evey where I would like to order another one for back up. It holds up so well only problem is that if it gets a tiny bit wet.. it starts to smell.
5.0	a gift, kids love it.
1.0	Title makes you think you're getting the game and it's just the cards that you can get anywhere for $10-$15. These are WAY, WAY overpriced. My sister should have read these other reviews prior to placing this order. It was a gift and I think our brother opened them so we can't even return them and now he has a $50 deck of cards and no game to use them with!! What a rip! First purchase I've ever been really disappointed through Amazon.
5.0	I have wanted this issue for some time & I am very pleased...Fast delivery was a plus & no damage to the box..Now to find someone to play it with me...
1.0	Tore after 2 days. Was bigger than expected.
5.0	"I had another brand's coax heli for a month or two. So naturally like most I wanted a FP; I don't think CP is for me. If you are that type, read on. I settled for this and happy with it. As long as the parts are available, I think this is the one for me (outdoors). Probably get an mSR X for indoors. My original heli is destined to be a remote controlled fan shade controller!<br /><br />Construction is great, things are going to break when you have a faster moving, heavier object crashing than those featherweight, indestructible ultra micros. This heli is designed to avoid damage (like fin that pops off) and a cheaper canopy to \\""take the bullet\\"" in order to save the insides in a crash.<br /><br />Just like EVERYONE advises, get the training kit! Sure you can learn without, but you're gonna crash. Things start bending and guess what? You are trying to learn a new heli but with each flight, the flight characteristics change due to something bending (flybar maybe?) in a crash makes learning much harder! Get the training wheels, avoiding crashing, then take them off when you have confidence in your new undamaged heli!<br /><br />With my initial order, I got an extra tail rotor (of course I lost the bearing eventually in a crash), main rotor, main gear, 3 different makes of lipos, lipo bag, linkage set. Already trashed one tail rotor. Right now ordering more parts, ones in caps I need NOW: tail rotor, boom, CANOPY, BODY MOUNTS, fin (come off easily), flybar, BATTERY MOUNT, TRAINING KIT! I suggest you try out all 4(?) mfg's of the battery 500, 550, 600 and in 15C or 25C. Have yet to fly it enough in between crashing to think about which battery gives more lift. And is there a point where the stock motor just can't use all that power? Looking at custom/precision parts to replace the plastic in the SR 120, but not right now. Higher cap lipos. If you don't order the training kit, might want to include parts I have listed in your initial order too! Happy flying! Just rememberyou can build it better, faster, stronger!"
5.0	My child has been building with superstructs for 2 years.... he is 5 now.  He doesn't usually<br />use their guides... he designs and builds his own amazing objects! We have 3 maybe 4 sets we are going for the 5th set now...<br />so far we haven't found a better all around building set than this one... he also enjoys legos and<br />zoobs but from superstructs he gets his craziest, largest and most expansive creations!
5.0	My daughter (10 yrs) is an avid rock collector so we bought her this for her birthday! She loves it! She does not mind the long process at all, in fact she finds it very interesting!
5.0	The Tonka truck was for my grandson for his birthday.  His first Tonka Truck.  He loved it.  Couldn't even wait to get it out of the box.  He turned one yrs. old and he started trying to sit on the top and he did and it held up.  Good going Tonka.
5.0	I found Garbage Pail Kids cards in Rite Aid one day, leaving me feel nostalgic. Then I came on Amazon to see what I can find and jumped at the chance of ordering original cards. I was quite pleased when they arrived. The packaging was perfect and inside, the wrapper and the cards themselves- perfect. I was, however, somewhat disappointed. Based on the product picture, I was expecting 2 packs to arrive. So this is a word of warning to others - you do NOT receive two packs. Do not go by the picture. You receive ONE pack only.
5.0	Have had a blast with this since Christmas.
1.0	I thought I was getting certain cards . Specifically the ones that were shown in the pictures but they were random cards
5.0	My son had one which broke, and this is much more durable and sounds terrific - I can actually enjoy him playing it!  There are a lot of preset songs on the guitar, and it speaks to you.  My son is 5, and he absolutely loves it!
5.0	I bought this table top easel for my son quite awhile ago and he loved it. I used it until he outgrew it and then passed it on to family who are still using it. It is durable and will last. I recently purchased another one for the little boys I babysit for Christmas and I am sure they will get tons of use out of it as well. It's great because it has the clips up top to hold paper and the tray on the bottom to hold paints and markers etc... It's nice because it doesn't take up a lot of space like floor easels and you can sit at a table and paint. It also has the dry erase board and the chalk board for added fun. I highly recommend this product and I would purchase it again for any other child. This is by far the best table top easel you can get and the price is good as well.
5.0	Great ATLAS product.  Very good flex track.
1.0	Was fun at first and was going to use it for many different events but the thing quit working after about a month and too late to return it.
5.0	This is the funniest game ever created.
5.0	Exactly what I needed! Great price and would buy again!
5.0	Madame Alexander dolls are always good quality. I really like Hugable Huggums because it is a doll that can be played with and not just put in a curio. Of course, you can do that too. This arrived in perfect condition.
1.0	The case these markers come in is great!  However, the markers themselves are of very poor quality, they dried out within a couple of weeks, and my daughters kept the caps on them.
5.0	Quality bag. It was a real hit with my little traveler.
1.0	"I am pretty sure that Superman is \\""the\\"" biggest pop-icon of our era.  <br />That being said here's my next point: <br /> <br />You would think that toy companies (especially ones as long-lived as Mattel) would have plastic molding down to a precise science or at least tolerable art.  <br />Well, they don't.  <br /> <br />Saying that this whole line of Superman Returns action figures is sub-par is being nice. What is with Supe's head? The purpose of a comic-book-chiseled-chin is to define the strength of the one's posture and a sense of confidence. Superman Returns action figures appear as though Clark Kent's only real super power is super-constipation and an acute case of kryptonian-scoliosis.  <br /> <br />The Spiderman fully-poseable figure from the first movie was amazing; articulate, well-matted, and nearly perfectly painted. Moreover, the Superman and other figure molds coming out of DC Direct are artistic and produced beautifully. <br />Can you try a little harder? <br />  <br />Action Figures are as collectable as antiques and shrunken heads. The market for Superman toys seems to be growing and the originality of these figures seems to be holding strong. <br /> <br />I collect Superman Action Figures. However, I am particular. I admit, I'm a dork. But I think my collection is beautiful. I was hoping to extend my compendium with a proper representation of the newest installment into the Superman Universe with the new movie's release. I only hope the Superman Returns \\""Ultra\\"" Series is better than these 5\\"" plastic punch lines."
5.0	Wonderful blocks, bright colors and great gift for our Grandpa who is originally from Germany.
5.0	Iz is pure magic out of the box. I can't believe how cool this toy is. It does so much. You can play games with him, use him to mix a ton of different sound effects and music he has included PLUS you can connect him to an ipod or any outside music source to have him play your favorite music. While your music is playing Iz will add his own personal style to it. What a great toy.
5.0	This tricycle is great for growing kids and my son enjoys it alot.
5.0	This came on time and my 6 year old grandson loved this gift.
5.0	This doll is a wonderful addition to the rest of our family dolls.  My daughter loves her and takes good care of her.  She has withstood a year and a half of regular play and clothes changes.  She has a very pretty face. Her hair is a bit messy, but she usually wears a bonnet or baby beanie.  I have sewed, knitted and crocheted plenty of clothes for her, using the same patterns I use for the real life babies in our family.  She also wore hand-me-downs from the baby, but a new baby is on the way, so she will have to wait for the new baby to out grow her or his clothes.  We haven't used batteries or the moving feature with her, because of small children in the family.
5.0	Gorgeous doll. Simply stunning. She is so beautiful I decided not to give it to my daughter last Christmas and instead wait until she is older. Since she is 3, I decided to collect these signature dolls for a few years and present them all to her when she is 10-12 years old.
5.0	This accessory is great so you don't spent lots of $ on batteries! I wish they would include this with eau leap pad! This is a must have!
5.0	I got this for my 3 year old after a plastic piano with mic purchase that was broken when we got it. She loves this thing. It's lightweight, durable and even my 11 year old likes to play with it. The voice changing is the most fun part and it seems to work great even with the extra spit that a toddler generates when sticking the mic all the way up to their lips while they shout!
1.0	I was not impressed with this toy. I agree with many of the other reviewers, it is not age appropriate and not interactive. I even propped my 3 month old son up on a Boppy so he could reach the globe and other activities but there really isn't too much for him to do with it. The songs are good and I liked the music but it doesn't offer much more than that. I'm going to try to introduce it to him again when he gets older and hope for a better response.
5.0	This game is about as easy to learn as you can get.  Line up the lines and move pieces to the end.  If you fall off the board you lose.  This said, strategically it can be challenging, which is especially true if you are playing with 6 people like we were doing over the weekend.<br /><br />The game is great with 2 people, but even more challenging with 6 people all trying to figure out how to survive at the same time.  I would recommend this to anyone as a great game.
5.0	grand kids love them very good for 48 year old kids to
1.0	Just a mess. We carefully followed the instructions and when we were lucky we we would get a nice spray from the nozzle. Otherwise it dripped, shot out jets of colour and was generally just messy. Luckily we started with the washable crayons. I can't recommend this product.
5.0	I recently ordered these slippers for my fiance who loves Angry Birds! I did the 2 day shipping and it arrived very fast. The packaging was very neat and well kept as well and the slippers were in good new shape. I already wrapped them up and cannot wait to give them to my fiance! Thanks so much I greatly appreciate the fast shipping and everything! Highly recommend!!!!
5.0	I have given a Lissi doll to each of my grand daughters.  She is pretty and my grand daughter loves her.
5.0	Everybody loved this hat! I got tons of compliments on it.
5.0	My son is REALLY into Halo, so we decided to make it a Halo Christmas for 2013.  These figures are great.  We purchased several Spartans, but needed a few Covenant/Bad Guys for them to battle.  The Elite Ranger fit the bill nicely.<br /><br />Nice detail and craftsmanship and larger than I expected.  The helmet is actually removable, but I think they look better with the helmet on.
1.0	EXTREMELY UPSET:  It arrived with a broken handle and the entire mug broke before my wife could ever use it... it was a gift... some gift...
5.0	Still learning to fly but lots of fun.  First try ended up in tree (my bad).  Getting better.  7 yr old daughter loves it.
5.0	This is the old style, not made any longer, plus it is my favorite.  I am still using it today a few years later.  thank you
5.0	Although this has no educational value it is so cute and fun. I purchased for a friend and it sit an her desk at work and everyone loves it!
5.0	Another successful Lego purchase-this lighthouse actually lights up. It is so very cool and my 11 year old totally loved putting it together!
5.0	"We got this for our 5 month old son during his first Christmas.  It was one of the toys he really loved.  My son is now 2 years old and he still loves to play with this toy every once and a while. He truly still enjoys this toy.    Educationally it's a wonderful toy.  I read one of the reviewers claim that the only thing it does is count to 10 (as you insert the coins).  Sure, if the child is always alone playing with it, that may be all he/she gets out of it.  But, we like to play with our child when we have the time.  And, with a little effort you can teach your child many things with this toy, and reinforce this learning the more you play.  My son not only recieved reinforced learning on counting to 10--as many of his toys have this concept of learning to count.  But, together we learned the colors of the coins.  \\""Which is the red coin?\\"" I ask him.  And, they do learn.  They remember.  With the Piggy's door my son learned the concept of \\""open\\"" and \\""closed.\\""  \\""Big\\"" or \\""small\\"" with the coins.  Heck, he even learned the word \\""coin.\\""  And, guess what, he knew that word when I showed him a REAL coin.  Ultimately, there are many things that can be educational about this toy Piggy Bank with some parental effort--which we try to do with all my son's learning toys.    I highly recommend this toy.  And, judging by how much my son has used it, so does he."
5.0	My 3 yrs old loves it!!! And the fact that it lights up around the eyes...oh, we cannot ask for anything else!
5.0	These dolls came today, well boxed and worth the money.  They are just the right gift for the preteen who is interested in these type of dolls.
5.0	I love this and more importantly...my son LOVES it. He is 9 months and wanting to walk. He gets a hold of this and cruises around like a rockstar. I love that it has a &#34;slow&#34; mode for him right now. He hasn't tipped it or had any issues that have been mentioned in other reviews, and he is 20+ lbs. I recommend for anyone to buy for their little walkers:)
5.0	We played for the first time and had about the best game night ever!  It is best with 8 players (the more guesses the better).  I'm thrilled we have a new game to play and enjoy.
5.0	I bought this for a friend who was looking really hard for this particular card, and honestly for how cheap it is and how effective it is, it's a buy.
5.0	My son loved them :) easy to assemble held up good and super cute! :) definately would recommend for a Thomas party
5.0	I would like it if someone could email me the cheap shipping site for the pink lid toy chest.  My email is Atkinsonms@aol.com
5.0	Looks great in my man cave and it fits perfectly on the shelf that I put it on.  Great Addition.
5.0	These are perfect for my 5 year old
1.0	I only received the 10 pcs Velvet Animals and I never got my 6pcs Soft Plush Family Bonus.
5.0	Good value + timely delivery + quality product = satisfied customer.
5.0	"My daughter received this doll at her first birthday party since she was really getting into the other babies at the daycare.  Well 10 months later this is still the one thing that she must have with her all the time!  She plays with it, it goes to bed with her and it spends quite a bit of time covered with a blanket sitting in her old baby swing.  Great doll and she is a great \\""Little Mommy\\"", this doll is awesome!"
5.0	I bought this on a whim as I needed a small gift to round out my father's Christmas present.  My parents own MANY games, some which may only be touched once every 5 years!  This quickly became a regular contender.  The pros, that make it one of our &#34;go to's&#34; are that it a) is compact b) is easy to set up c) has no difficult rules and d) is truly challenging.  With trivia games you eventually get through all the cards, with complex board games no one can ever remember all the rules, but with Set you can sit down and have fun without the hassle.
5.0	My little one loves it.
5.0	I purchased this for my 10 month old twin grand babies and they just love them.  Cuddly and soft and well made
5.0	We love these blocks!  Great quality and smooth edges.  I like the box it comes in.  We turn the box upside down to use as a base on carpet for building castles and other creations.  We bought these almost a year ago for our son who plays with them often.  It's a toy he will play with for years to come.  My husband enjoys creating with our son as well.
5.0	Love it great gift for a baby.
5.0	This toy is fun for the young and old.  Laying in bed in the dark with your family and putting a laser show on the ceiling is a fun way to share quality nighttime fun.  It works well, the patterns are interesting but not overly sophisticated.  The wow factor isn't necessarily in how fantastically original the patterns are, but how the toy can bring joy and fun to family time. 20-30mins of quality time at the end of the day is a good night cap.  Should sustain interest a few nights a week.
1.0	Some shapes just look like a blob...if you want detail then DON&#34;T buy!
5.0	This is a beautiful yarn - blends with every color and It's easy to keep the gauge with this yarn.  I often use it an a border
5.0	the kids really liked this one.
5.0	This is one of my favorite dolls for the year 2013, the outfit is an amazing fun dress.  I love the hair and the make up on this doll, I bought two so I could debox one of them.
5.0	Who would think that they are purchasing a full size radio truck for $32?  I have learned over the years to read the description and search the web, and review images to confirm the product that I propose to purchase.  They could have included an actual picture of the clear plastic shell (the actual item does not photograph well, thus the finished product.  Also please note that that you must know the measurements of your chassis, or you will end up with a very large body shell like I did.
1.0	My mother purchased this toy for my son on his second birthday.  The pieces did not fit together correctly!  We assumed that it was just a manufacturing error, and returned it to the store for a replacement.  The replacement did not assemble correctly, either!  We had such an awful time trying to put the thing together that we didn't enjoy the birthday party.
5.0	Simple to learn, fun game play, neat concept and illustrations.
5.0	Looks very realistic and is a large puppet!
5.0	I searched everywhere for a mickey backpack...even the disney store...couldnt find one large enough for my first grader! this one is the perfect size to fit my sons school folder. I love that the lunch box is attached and my son can take it off and put it on by himself!!! such a great deal!! my son is a very happy camper!!!<br /><br />Shipping was super fast too!!!
5.0	Great quality. Perfect for my kids 1st bday fiesta!
5.0	We bought this playset for our children (ages 4 and 2)  - so far it has been a great buy - it was pretty easy to put together - you will need at least two people - it is not so high off of the ground that i even feel comfortable with my 2 year old climbing it, yet it is challenging enough for my 4 year old - it easily holds 3-4 small children  - the sandbox is terrific and the climbing rope is durable enough for a 4-6 year old to climb - it took about 2 half days to put it together -  this is a great product!
5.0	Quality is excellent. The toy is very very bright and vibrant, the picture really doesnt reflect the deep vibrant shades of red and pink that this toy has. My baby is not here yet so i can not comment on the entertainment factor, but I think this is a well made, long lasting, quality toy.
1.0	Bottom filled with water broke in one day, now water is in the entire bag and it does not stand up. Not worth the little amount of money it cost.
5.0	great for decoden. i always use itttt for decoden and using it for clay. awesome and kawaii, thank you! love love love it!
5.0	For grandson...he loved it
5.0	Love it, I bought it for my sons 2nd birthday party arrived on time and its a perfect size....
5.0	large - nice - 5 year old LOVES it !
5.0	Great puzzle. Better than expected. Thick sturdy pieces.
5.0	My thanks to the seller for prompt delivery, and the condition of the product was new as said in the discription.  Good work and thank you.
5.0	I bought the roller and grader for my 3.5 year old son and he loved them both.  If your son is into construction machines, these are a must.  They seem to be really well made.  Definitely recommend.
5.0	Jessie dolls are non-existent now, and my granddaughter has wanted one for over a year now. Jessie arrived in the perfect condition advertised, and made the perfect gift. I was happy to have found her. I would buy from this vendor again.
1.0	"This slip-n-slide was a complete disappointment.  It has the words \\""cheap\\"" written all over it.  By the time we even got it fully set up, it had two holes in it.  My kids never even got a chance to use it.  I boxed it back up and an returning it (I didn't buy it from Amazon).  I have been searching for a good old fashioned slip-n-slide that I didn't have to replace every year, but this one is NOT it."
5.0	My son loves it, so it gets 5 stars. It's spacious enough to hold a nerf gun, cars, an angry bird stuffed animal, bristle blocks, and loads of other necessities. Also it has a huge, fluffy bird version of Chewbacca on the front, so really, what's not to like?
5.0	This toy is so much fun and is best when played with friends and family at a get together or gathering . It is really worth the money.
5.0	7 month old grandson loves this. Mostly chews on it right now but hopefully down the road he will enjoy its other features.
5.0	It was fun and easy to understand pics.
5.0	The colors were vibrant and you could lighten by adding more water. The book was helpful with ideas for a novice. The paint lasted all day and it was easy to wash off. We used a baby wipe and got it off.
5.0	My 13 year old Whovian granddaughter loves it, and it looks great on her bookcase. Her room is mostly Doctor Who stuff (posters, jewelry, action figures, sonic screwdriver, hand painted wall mural, etc...), and this adds a nice touch.
1.0	When i recieve this, its two rear view mirrors are both broken off.
5.0	Bought for grandchild, he got right on that project and started building right after he finished LEGO Creator Highway Speedster 31006  , he is eight years old.
5.0	Have only used two days but works great and takes crashes nice.  A lot of fun.  Camera works good also. Used many hours.
5.0	"This is my solution to my friend's daughter who is allergic to dogs! She's been asking for a puppy for as long as I can remember and now that she's almost five, I figured this would be perfect for her! Well, I was going to wait and give it to her for her birthday, but when it arrived UPS and I could hear the little barking noises, I couldn't wait! We made a lunch date and had her test it out!<br /><br />When you first open the shipper box and get to the actual box that the toy is in, GoGo is very excited to see your little one! She's barking, her little tail's wagging, she's panting and her legs are going! That made the adults happy because we knew that meant one fantastic thing - batteries! If GoGo runs out, she takes 4 C replacement batteries.  You can register her as your very on [...], you can name her, put in your name and print our your certificate.  This is a child friendly site that has games and activities as well for your little one to do!  My friend's daughter was just as excited as GoGo was! She took it out and put it on the floor and immediately began playing with her. GoGo is very easy to operate and there is nothing to set up! It's a toy you can play with right out of the box!<br /><br />GoGo is called a \\""she\\"" in the booklet that comes with her, but you can name her whatever you'd like on the [...] site. She's much different from her predecessor in several different ways. We found out that the sensors in it's head and on both of it's side so it does act like a real dog.  If you pet it's head, it tilts it's head to the side your petting and will make 18 different noises.  The only downfall I can find to GoGo is that she looks so lovable and most little girls will want to cuddle it.  Unfortunately, GoGo isn't very cuddly or plush at all.  She's a mechanical toy and she does exactly what she's advertised to do. Someone else referred to her as a remote control car for girls.  That's pretty much what she is, just cuter!<br /><br />If you go to the site I recommend above that's on the box, it tells you what type of terrain is good for your new pet and which is not.  GoGo has a hard plastic type body under her fur and wheels on the legs so that once you attach her leash she can walk with you! The leash is long enough for an adult to stand without hunching over so it gives you plenty of room to decide which way the dog will walk.  There are three buttons on her leash which looks exactly like the real retractable leashes except it just doesn't retract. It goes left, right and forward and it can do a half turn as well. That's the only one of her tricks that's a little harder and would require you to be the suggested age range.  GoGo's leash is made of a very silky cord and you can remove it when she's not being walked, but her collar stays on at all times.<br /><br />I've been told that this is THE BEST Birthday Present EVER and I believe I've been moved up to FAVORITE \\""AUNT\\"" status! Was it worth it? ABSOLUTELY! I highly recommend \\""Furreal GoGo My Walking Pup\\"" to any child that wants a \\""real puppy\\"" of their very own! My friend says she couldn't be more pleased because there is no clean up, no food to buy and most of all she doesn't have to worry about he child's allergies! She's also thanked me about a thousand times!

5.0	I bought this for my niece, as she's big into both princesses and horses, and she LOVED it!  The horse's mane is very sparkly and pretty, and she couldn't wait to comb it and stick the little jewels on it.    For little girls who love princess dolls and ponies, this totally fits the bill!
5.0	I purchased this toy for my three year girl last week.  I can't stop playing with it myself. My husband & I just know she will love it.  She sings all the time and everytime we go to the toy store she finds a piano.  However, most are too expensive for our budget.  This is a great toy for an exceptional price.  The rythums are a little unrealistic but she doesn't care.  The volume control is great. Cute and very age appropriate.
5.0	Grandkids love Hyenna's
5.0	This game is absolutely precious. My 3 year old loves the colorful bees and gets really excited when I pull this game out.
5.0	I bought this for my 2yr old grandson. We have cats and dogs (currently or in the past) that fit the appearance of most of the animals in this puzzle. My grandson quickly learned the names of several that he had just called &#34;dog&#34; or &#34;nee&#34; (kitty) so far. The puzzle is sturdy - which is good, since my grandson has put this together and taken it apart 3 or 4 times a day or more for the last month.
5.0	Set was given as a gift by a friend of mine. I put it together fairly quickly and the car was functional. It rolled across the table well and could fit any normal LEGO figure in the seat. Makes a nice addition to the other sets I own. I am 26 and will never grow out of LEGOs!
5.0	Great little gift for kids for any occasion. Can't beat the price.
1.0	I bought this wig for my daughter to wear for Halloween. Once it arrived it was way to small for her head. I ended up just throwing it in her dress up clothes. Needless to say I was not very happy with this product. I also had found it at Wal-Mart a week later for cheaper.
5.0	Nice idea for little bffs! Soft cord necklace.
5.0	My great grandson really liked the cards and had received none of them previously.
5.0	I got this for my grandson for his birthday.  He just turned 1 and it was a little overwhelming for him but he loved watching the train run.  I will be purchasing more sets for him to add to it.
1.0	the wand falls off the axel or whatever it's called after a few rotations.
1.0	I did not order this, but it was ordered by some one other then me, I know one of our cards were used by someone that hacked into harbor freight, and now I think I know which one it was.  I tried by responding right away when I saw the next day but all I got was how to return it, I know by the time I got it it could have been stopped, so this does not happen again, I will not leave number on file.  It was too much of hazel to return it, so will use it for Christmas somewhere, I hope they like it.<br />I think it is dumb item.
5.0	cute little toy. our kid loves it
1.0	Didn't work even once. It would only emit a timid squeak. Returning.
5.0	this was a great toy when my daughter was a toddler and it is still a great toy for my grandchild
5.0	One of my favorite features about this tube is the valve that is large so you can quickly inflate and deflate the tube. I have the inflator/deflator for your car that I also purchased from amazon. This is actually the 2 tube I have bought. It makes any creek a blast!
5.0	My nephew just got this drum for Christmas, and my son had a fit for it!  It was all we could do to hide it from both of them because they both wanted to play with it so much.  I'm ordering it for my son now...we absolutely MUST have this drum!!! PS-My son is nearly 2 and my nephew is 3 1/2...it was the perfect size for them and they loved it around their neck.
5.0	I bought this for my two-year-old nephew for his birthday and he loves it. We all like to hang out outside in our chairs and now he has one just his size. It is a good size for kids ages 1-5 I'd say. My son has one also and he still fits in his but he is a very small 8-year-old. The chair also has a cup holder which fits sippy cups and juice boxes perfectly!
5.0	Granddaughter loved it lots of good times ahead
5.0	Perfect for what I needed. Thank you!
5.0	Will look great when the nursery is ready for decoration.
5.0	Absolutely Fantastic!
5.0	Me and my grandson are having good time with them. They are so cute and make us so comfortable.<br />We appreciate your company.<br />We are going to buy more buddies to present to our friends.<br />We expect your company to produce lovely and sweet female baby dogs.
1.0	I don't know why the previous reviewer liked this toy. It takes a Phillips head screwdriver to remove it from the packaging. Yes, it has wheels and my 19-month-old likes to push it around, but when you push the button, it makes an annoying noise and does nothing but jiggle from side to side. It's flimsy; the &#34;excavator&#34; part won't stay up and this is a complete waste of money. Even though it took some effort on my part, I returned it. My toddler tried to play with it, got frustrated, and went onto another toy.
5.0	Excellent hard to find item
5.0	A little old version but it was great.
5.0	Such a sweet item, we love her.
1.0	The puzzle doesn't fit together in certain places and I didn't find it fun to put together more difficult and irritating.
5.0	My daughter is in love with this table.  She will crawl up to it, push the buttons, dance and giggle.  She loves to pretent play phone, open and close the laptop, and push th emouse up and down.  I love the different options given for the table so you don't get sick of the same thing over and over.  Highly recommend.
5.0	I got this for my 6 year old's birthday.  It is good for teaching math skills and family fun.  He and his 8 yr old sister have really enjoyed it.
5.0	Chessex has been and probably will always be one of my favorite companies who make dice. This does not disappoint.. its a lot more than you really think is gonna be there and all you will need for your Tabletop needs!<br /><br />You can never have enough dice!
5.0	I bought this for my 21-month-old (who just turned 2). When she first got it, she was still a little short to get into the chairs without my assistance, but she loved sitting at the table for snacks and activities.  She now can sit in the chairs with ease and still uses it every day.<br /><br />It wipes off easily. We've had crayons and washable markers all over the table top, but it cleans up nicely, sometimes with just soap and water. I would buy this again. I'm actually looking for a similar product to put out on my patio for when the weather gets nicer.
5.0	i bought this for my boyfriends birthday in may and I swear when it arrived (shipping was very quick and was packaged very securely) I had to refrain really hard from not opening up the case because it is so cool! the tiny, yet so amazingly stunning details on this figurine are ones that set it apart from the rest of his collection, by far. and he has some nice figures!.. it's the perfect size, very high quality, not flimsy or dainty in the slightest and just so many beautiful details, you get lost in them! I absolutely recommend this, it's definitely worth the price
5.0	Does exactly what you expect
1.0	Snake Eyes was not the action figure We Received, the packaging said Snake Eyes but was not the snake eyes character that was inside the packaging my child is not happy.
5.0	A Very Bright, Lumnious set of Glow N' the dark stars.  The Stickers glow really well, as the hard shapes do.  I got them to glow really bright without the need of it being dark.  Pretty cool!
5.0	Work just as you would expect them to.  Nothing wrong with this product!
5.0	This is adorable and not too big.  Gave it to my 3 year old daughter and she won't leave the house without it!
1.0	Was not HO scale as advertised.  Not happy with this product.  Returned it.  Was for birthday prsent, then had none.
5.0	This dinosaur is very durable. It has lasted through being thrown and driven through the sand. It is also fun for all ages, my six-year-old and friend's five-year-old and three-year-old all love to play with them.
1.0	Horrible.  Paint was all dried up and hard.
5.0	I bought this for a set of brothers.  They love it.  Their favorite part is that the drivers are ejected out of their crafts when they crash.
5.0	Built tough and fun for my little player.
5.0	I use this car for chasing rabbits and squirrels out of my garden. It does have trouble in grass, but on a firm surface this thing is so fast it can be a little hard to keep control of. My dog enjoys chasing it around the drive way, but doesn't like it in the house- lol  Great fun!
5.0	too much fun putting together
5.0	Gave it as a Christmas gift, my daughter loved it.....It was on her Christmas wish list....
5.0	I bought the race along chuck for my 2 yr old grandsons Birthday and it is one of his favorite toys!  He played with it for hours chasing it around the house, waiting to see what chuck would do next.  It seems to be very well made, and is a tough little truck, along with being really cute and amusing, He talks, Laughs, races, spins and pops wheelies and much more.  I would Highly recommend this toy for ANY little boy or girl  (my 4 yr old granddaughter loved it too!)
1.0	This is the WORST gift I have ever bought.  It was bought for my 9 year old...We followed all instructions down to the last letter and notheing, I mean nothing grew.  He cried for days.  I do all My shopping here, and have always been pleased.  But not with this one.  You should be ashamed for even having this one on your shopping page for sale. And I didn't even want to rate it...................
5.0	These are super fun. They were really easy to put in my daughters hair. Out of the whole pack only two were defective. One just wouldn't ever turn off after we turned it on. The other became defective because as I was trying to put it in my hair I dropped it on the tile and it wouldn't ever turn on after that. These are really bright and a  lot of fun for the kids.
5.0	My 4 year old thought it was real.  LOL!
5.0	This is the second expansion that I added to my Thunderstone Advance Worlds Collide set, after Into the Abyss. It adds lots more cards for not a lot of money, and more variety to all aspects of the game---more enemies, more weapons, more heroes, more goodness! Additionally, you get a new game feature in the treasure cards, especially powerful items that are occasionally winnable by defeating enemies that carry them.<br /><br />Same great quality from AEG. I guess I'd say I like this expansion slightly better than Into the Abyss in terms of theme, and because it adds the &#34;treasure&#34; aspect.<br /><br />If you like TA, I recommend Caverns of Bane without reservation. t's SUPER EXPANDY!
5.0	I love this book that holds webkinz trading cards.  I have been looking for this book for a long time & I finally was able to buy it on Amazon.  I not only bought 1 but a total of 3.  It keeps the cards in place & I always know where they are.  I am thrilled w/ the book.
5.0	Game has to be assembled but it is easy. Fun game for kids 3+.
5.0	My grandson loved it.  This is a great gift for young kids.
5.0	"I purchased this with the larger (but not life-size) \\""Boo\\"" for my 14 yo daughter.  Both are adorable.  The Bitty Boo is tiny, but has the same detail as the larger dog.  Very soft and well made.  It is available in several different outfits.  Very sweet gift for anyone who loves animals."
5.0	My son absolutely loves his new ''motorcycle''!  He jumped right on and proceeded to make vroom-vroom noises as he drove it around the yard. The bike itself seems to be well built and to be honest, just about the coolest trike i have came across!<br />Highly recommend this bike for any of your little daredevils in the making.
5.0	I am a huge Sinatra freak and just had to get this, now if I could just find a bank that would accept a few of them! haha<br />They are fun to hand out when you hear someone say &#34; I wish I had a million bucks&#34;
5.0	Love My Melody plush.
5.0	Fantastic, great product. Does the job.
5.0	Needs to roll kind of far to get really good sound out of it. Granddaughter loves it. Her laughter is like music to hear and anything I can get that she will enjoy is worth it.
5.0	This was a gift for my nephew, who really enjoyed putting it together and racing the cars.  He loved it!
1.0	I have not purchased this but have never been one accused of biting my tongue.  Are you seriously selling the replacement partd for MORE than the actual game.  You got to be kidding me!!!!!
5.0	Classic family game. My only complaint is the sleeve to help set up the game is awfully flimsy.
5.0	My kids love this bll pit. I bought it for Christmas in 2010 and it's still holding up great. My kids are very rough when they play in it, and we did buy extra balls (probably have about 1000 balls now). I did buy a small tunnel to attach to it to help keep the balls inside when the kids get in and out of it, but other than that, we haven't done anything special. We pull it out frequently and it always makes the kids happy. We haven't had any rips or damage to it in the almost four years that have owned it.
5.0	LOVE THIS PACK.  SUGGESTED BY MY DAUGHTER'S ART TEACHER AND CAN'T BELIEVE ALL THE EXTRA COLORS.  MAKES A HUGE DIFFERENCE WITH ALL THE COLORS TO CHOOSE FROM.
5.0	Great quite time item for the kids. The Little ones play with the on the dishwasher and refer besides the tin.
5.0	Santa sent this to a very special little friend of mine, she loves it and I didn't mind helping Santa out by paying for it :D
5.0	is very nice in the begging is work but now all what i do the levitron dont stay in the air .I send a mail to levitron but then not anwer
5.0	My son loves his little drum set!  They are petite, yes, but my son cannot walk so everything close to the floor is more interesting for him.  The drumheads sound authentic.  The cymbal's not my favorite sound but it doesn't seem to be my son's, either.  Unusual construction with rubberized bands holding the drumheads to the frame.  The drumheads actually bend down if you hit them even moderately hard, but that's part of the fun.  Another Plan Toys success!
5.0	My husband enjoyed this kit. The piece stay in place and all of the pieces were there.  Well made.
1.0	I find this Mega-bloks toy (halo) very poor at best and the company knows of it's poorly built Halo Truck, but continues to sell this piece of junk to the public.  I called and e-mailed... the bottom line is they don't care. Don't waste your money unless you want a very unhappy child in your house.
5.0	What a beautiful puzzle! The pieces are thick and snap together. I can't wait to see it together! Spend the extra and buy ravensburger.
5.0	This was a gift from friends when our son was 6 months old. It took a few weeks until he started to be interested in it but then it was his No.1 book/toy and he would look at it until he would fall asleep. A book they can bite and drool on and it won't break!
5.0	Really helps keep the train track together. Highly recommend for those with toddlers or any age really. Glad we got them.
5.0	great introductory purchase to shopkins
1.0	This is the worst toy I have ever come across. It falls apart at the slightest touch! Some of the stickers don't stay more than a few minutes after you put them on! It's a big waste of money!
5.0	Brought this for my boy and he took to it straight away, do be careful though as this thing can move ! ! ! It's really comes in to it's own when flown outside on a calm day , we few it up to a footballs field lengh away and only turned back 'cos we couldn't really see the hele in the distance. I have a hele that is simular and over twice the price and does't even come close to the power of this thing.  Like I said for the price this kicks ass , my only regret was that I ordered one instead of two !
1.0	The boy's metal speedster version of this toy was well-reviewed so I purchased one for my toddler grandson and this toy for my toddler granddaughter. That was 2 months ago. The toy stays at my house and she has barely played with it. Last night I noticed something peeling off of the silver hood ornament and cut myself twice trying to remove it.     The paint-like silver metal substance or lacquer on the ornament peels and is hazardous. It is also possible that a small child could ingest this paint.
5.0	My mom bought this for my 9 month old son and there hasn't been a day when he hasn't played with it.  He has had some older friends over (11 month old girl and 2 year old boy) who also were happy to play with it for some time.  From this we can deduce that it will entertain him even as he gets bigger.  There are some things he couldn't do when he began playing with it, but he has learned how.  It's wonderful to see his mind working!<br />The only drawback is that he tries to pull himself up, or hold himself up, on the toy and it is not that stable.  I solved the problem by making sure there is something sturdy behind the toy -- like a wall or an end table.
1.0	Do I need to say more? I know it says assorted in the item description, but come on.  3 sets of duplicates really is no bueno and, as my headline says, no stegosaurus.
5.0	This lovely cartoon children's play tent arrived quickly and packaged nicely. What you get is a very handy portable carrying bag with the folding tent inside.<br /> Opening the bag up, there are two folded items inside.<br />1. The actual tent, in which you take out and it easily pops up by itself into the main prism tent<br />2. The folded striped covering which is the de/attachable roof of the play tent<br />Features:<br />The two sides of the tent is white breathable netted material to see through. The flip up door to children to enter and leave. And the one side window. The tent is an enclosed bottom, able to let children play and sit inside comfortably. A suggestion on the bag was to fill the tent with those colorful plastic balls for a fun effect.<br /><br />This tent is easily portable, simply folding the tent up and placing it inside the included storage red zipper bag. It's lightweight great for traveling also. This play tent is great for both outdoors and indoors although I would say indoor is the best option in my opinion.<br />In conclusion, this play tent is very enjoyable for kids as the tent pops up ready by itself and assemble in seconds.<br />A great play house!
5.0	These lights make playing with Poi just that much more fun!  You have to see to enjoy.
5.0	Exactly what I ordered! Love it!
5.0	Great! Wonderful articulation and just beautiful.
1.0	Extremely pricy for what it was. plus shipping. Extremely small
5.0	This is a great buy for both big and small kids, good for my 8y son to learn about the world and get to know his friends from  different countries, and for the 3y little one, it's durable and fun to play with.
5.0	Real cool product perfect fit for controller. Light and durable seems like it will last. Bla bla bla bla bla. Why do I have to use a certain amount of words if its good its good
5.0	My daughter loves these but they are pricey!
5.0	A simple toy but quite a lot of fun.  Inexpensive -- for the price of less than two movie tickets you have a game you can play anywhere and with anyone 9 and up.
1.0	I rarely complain to any company, but this one made me furious! My daughter loves Polly dolls and toys and was so excited to get this one as a gift, but when we got home it took hours for her two educated, skilled parents to even somewhat get this thing together. The slides never fit on! They didn't seem to match up and never stayed on at all!  Hard to use the toy without the main features! My daughter now just plays with the pool and I have boxed up the rest of the mess to someday send back to the company (when I get around to it...). This was a disaster! I am only glad I didn't pay a penny for it, as it was a gift. Don't waste your time! If I could have given this toy no stars I would have!
5.0	These worked great! I bought them to give as favors, but they are so cute, I used them as party decorations instead---I put up a fish net party accessory and stuck these in it!
5.0	Theses toys were awesome and in great condition! So glad I bought them! I love the walking dead and these were the perfect thing to add to my collection!
5.0	Bought this for a 1st birthday, thinking it would help steady while learning to walk.  We didn't have any of the issues others have mentioned with the seat in the cart.  I just flipped it over backwards and it fell into place.  The wheels are kind of hollow, but works fine for what this is.  It's sturdy, looks and feels like the real thing except the wheels.  There is one I contemplated getting because it was $30 more (and wanted to get the best)...and am not sorry in the least that I chose this one.  If you're buying for similar reasons, make sure the groceries to fill the cart fit in little hands.  I wasn't thinking when I bought &#34;canned&#34; items, but fortunately rounded it out with other staples.
5.0	Awesome adult version of Apples to Apples. Tons of fun to play with friends or maybe even family and it's a great drinking game!
5.0	The product comes good, complete, arrive the 3, with all of their pieces, in really good state, was a good buy
5.0	It's your typical play phone. My son loved it. No complaints at all from him or me. He enjoys playing with it and taking pretend pictures
5.0	OMG I love it!! It is so cute and large. I bought this for my 1 year old grand daughter. I also bought the blue and green for my 2 year old grand son and one for my 4 year old grand son. I just fell in love with them. Would recommend this product to anyone.
5.0	Great toy.  My son and his friends enjpoyed it for hours.  However, making the crayons is fun but they are too short to use.  Crayola must be worried to make them full size
5.0	I am sure granddaughter will love it.
5.0	We gave this to our granddaughter for her second birthday,  She loves it and seems to prefer the stroller but still uses the pram part as a baby crib.  It was not very difficult to put together either.  It seems pretty sturdy so far and she has a 4 year old brother who can be very rough at times.  Guess what!  He loves it too.  It shipped on time. It was perfect!
5.0	Gave this as present and my brother-in-Law loved it very articulate and he loved the busy enough to put it as a centerpiece in their house.
5.0	My daughter loved this
5.0	Great price for all of these.Wish it would have had Battersby- thats the first thing my daughter noticed &#34;Wheres Pufferty wheres Battersby?&#34; Later I did buy the clockhouse train station just so she could have the Pufferty dog. They stand on little cogs so they wont topple over. Pretty good price overall.
1.0	Very poor quality they fall apart
5.0	I love these erasers they came in individual packages with no duplicates and they actually erase well.These erasers are also so adorable. You won't be disappointed.
5.0	I searched high and low for a vanity for my 3 1/2 year old daughter.  She SCREAMED when she saw the vanity.  She LOVED LOVED it.  It is so sweet and the detailing is wonderful.  I was most surprised with the quality.  I'm going to order more from the set.  Really fit for a princess!
5.0	You can't break them and it good healthy outdoor fun.Always get played with, truly a classic toy. It actually stay attached to the car, hard to imagine. Nice to see a pink version with trailer so my princess keeps up her image.
5.0	I keep one of these in each car and my airplane as well and have never crashed. I'd attribute it to the unabashed power of BC himself!! Can' go wrong with a little extra power to keep you safe
5.0	I got this Deck Box because i wanted something durable and easy to use. This box is a little wider then your cards even with card cases but over all its and awesome case.
1.0	"- What's in the (brown corrugated paper) box: One plastic bag, with a \\""MADE IN CHINA\\"" sticker containing a fabric pouch.  Inside this pouch is another plastic bag with multicolored flat beads.  There's a wooden, hinged playing board stamped \\""MADE in U.S.A.\\"" There is no protective sleeve or other packing for the board.  Lastly, one photocopied instruction sheet completes the contents.  There isn't any bright outer packaging as shown in the description.<br />- First Impressions: While I'm a fan of minimalist packaging for disposal reasons, this product has less fanfare than a box of small assembly parts for a do-it-yourself project.  Instead of a nicely printed set of instructions, you are greeted with a xerox-of-a-xerox-of-a-xerox sheet of paper with a copy defect running the length of the page; grammar issues plague said instructions.  There are no age recommendations or small parts warnings on the instructions.  The strangely tinted (like no maple I've ever seen) wooden box does not have a smooth satin finish as pictured; the pits are rough to the touch. The hinge is very poorly fastened with brass-colored screws sunk to various depths.<br />- Conclusions:  I would not give this as a gift (the purpose of my purchase).  The quality and workmanship are poor and shoddy.  The country of origin claim is very misleading and, well, just deceptive.  As for the Sustainable Forestry Initiative certification, I have to question this claim also since the required labeling/documentation per the SFI organization is absent."
5.0	Excellent, in perfect condition. I loved them .
5.0	Love them. Looks just like the picture.  Great price and size. Satisfied customer
5.0	My 4 year old got this for Christmas and loves it!! It's hours of fun!!!! I like it all fits in together for easy storage!!
5.0	These dudes were hilarious!  I got them for a zombie apocalypse party as gift bag favors--arrived in plenty of time--thank you!
5.0	Exceeded my  expectations.  My product arrived earlier than the posted date.  Very happy.
5.0	My boy loves these crayons. Easy to use, don't need sharpened. They break off easily if they are twisted out too much.
5.0	Very good toy.  The quality is very good and should last for many bath time adventures.
5.0	One of the Maracas counts to 10, tells the colors of the rainbow, and makes songs in both English & Spanish while lighting up in the appropriate colors. When you shake the other maraca it makes sounds like beans are shaking around inside of it.
5.0	Great have for my college anatomy class
5.0	Fast shipping. You can't go wrong with a webkinz
5.0	I purchased this set to introduce chess to my 5 year old.  After a few games she understands the basic concepts of piece placement and movement and now we're getting into strategy.  I will admit that teaching strategy is mostly left up to the more experienced player as the cards and instructions will not teach that.  It's great how you can make the game as simple or challenging as you like using the cards.  The quality of the board and pieces are fine for the price and the intent of this set; not professional grade but certainly on par with other board game sets out there.  Highly recommend.
5.0	I just got my mcfarlane dragon today. It fit together beautifully.Nothing was broken the wing is a little bit off alignment but its staying in. I love this dragon. No paint is chipped he stands on his base right very sturdy and the size(if anybody is curious) wingspan about 19 inches and the body from head to tail is exactly 1 foot hope this review helps for future buyers!                             P.S THIS DRAGON IS AWESOME :)
5.0	Exactly as described.
1.0	"$214.99 for a Millenium Falcon?  Why paying that money if you can pay $169.99 for a newer, bigger and better Falcon?<br /><br />This is a Vintage Millenium Falcon, which basically is the same old Millenium Falcon toy that many people knew when they were kids in the 1980s.  However, as a toy it delivers less value than the Legacy Collection Millenium Falcon (listed at Amazon as \\""Star Wars 2.5' New Millennium Falcon\\"") which is bigger and better.  Why better?  Star Wars 2.5' New Millennium Falcon is more movie accurate, it has plenty of sounds and lights and the engine actually is lighted, it has an auto-opening ramp and even a medic bay.  It has many other features that I will not describe here, as reviews of the other falcon describe.<br /><br />This Star Wars E3 OTC MILLENNIUM FALCON is a piece of junk, compared to the Star Wars 2.5' New Millennium Falcon.  It is only good for nostalgia, but if you want value and playability you better do NOT buy E3 OTC MILLENNIUM FALCON.<br /><br />Also, the price, $214.99, suggests this one is made of gold while it is not."
5.0	It is not meant to be an educational toy, so that is a bonus in my book! Really, I bought it for the novelty and because I love all things Japanese...and cats
5.0	Just what I expected. How could I go wrong with prompt delivery on a classic board game?  I made a good choice.
1.0	The drain plug came broken twice on this pool. I'm very disappointed as my 16 month old enjoys this pool
5.0	I bought this toy for my son, who is currently into shrunken heads. The included head is Is GREAT--good size, weight, and detail. It is as good as some other reproductions ( man made materials only) that he has.  He is not interested in the Jack Sparrow figure yet. I have it on my desk because I happen to love Jack. The figure has good detail and articulates. However, the face leaves a little to be desired. Not so good. In fairness, I imagine any face would be difficult to reproduce in such miniature.
5.0	Awesome addition to my collection, packaging was superb!
1.0	cheap only lasted a few hours then the air started leaking out through the blow up hole.
5.0	I bought this for my 5 year olds (turning 6) birthday. She put it together with minimal help from me, and loved the glitter pieces, will keep this one forever.
5.0	Bought this for a little girls' Christmas.  We both played &#34;dress up&#34; with these durable clothes.  Her little hands had no trouble changing outfits and or putting together the appropriate details.  This toy even sparked her imagination as to the stories she could tell and she could include the doll's outfit to express that.  Better that the paper dolls we had as kids, and more fun.
5.0	These card holders arrived early, well packed and are actually much better than   advertised. I have only good things to say about this supplier and this product.
5.0	Good quality and got shipped on time as promised.
5.0	This is a diary of an imaginary Christian Louboutin and Barbie trip to Paris. It's full of tongue in cheek pictures and comments, along with pictures of all of the Barbie' Louboutin shoes. If you're a fan of Christian Louboutin and/or his shoes, this is a must have.
5.0	This is my husband's favorite all time game.  He loved having it for our family game night on Christmas to play.  Our kids love board games too so this was a big hit!
5.0	My daughter fell in love with this toy at the toy store so we had to buy it. She loves it and dances along with Elmo. She is only one and she already knows how to push his foot and make him dance. I think he is funny too and find myself singing along.
5.0	Miss American Chole! Chole has hip new look that will make the bratz boyz smile. Chole is gettin in the 4th spirit. With her red white and blue purse tottaly makes her look cool. If Chole was really in highschool. Cameron, Dylan, Etian, kolby and cade would want her. If you like her then you'll love her friends. Trust me I have all the bratz ever made. (So far). I gave her 5 stars forr fun because she is the coolest ever. 3 stars for educatioal because what is educantiaul about her? And 5 stars for duarable because I had her ever since last year and she never broke. Unlike someone I know who had pulled chole's head off. I think the toy shouuld be for children 3 and up. I hope this was helpful to you.
1.0	It took over a hour to assemble with two adults and one older child helping - it has SO MANY little pieces that will become lost within hours of play - AVOID IT!
1.0	Their products are misrepresented and then they do not make good when you called him
5.0	I just love Camden Rose products.  They are a bit pricey but well worth the extra penny.  They are probably heirloom quality and I love what the company does for women in Peru.  Ill be buying more from them.  This was made very well!
5.0	This puzzle was a HUGE hit for my 18 month old grandson.  He loves Mickey and he loves the magnet.
5.0	While this puzzle may be slightly smaller than a Melissa & Doug puzzle, I think it is way better made. The image is printed right on to the wood verses being printed on paper and then glued on to wood like all of the other wood puzzles I've seen and bought before. The pieces are nice and thick, a little thicker than Melissa & Doug brand wood puzzles. I wish there was more variety of puzzle images to choose from in this line because there is are four images in this size puzzle available on Amazon at the time of this review. All Beleduc/Hape toys are well made and should last years with normal usage. I think this product is a great value!
5.0	"I remember loving the Fisher-Price Garage as a child.  I didn't have one, but I played with it non-stop at the home of anyone who had one!  I loved the ramps, the gas station, and the way I felt like I was transported into a different world.  When I had a son of my own, after purchasing the farm and the dollhouse for my daughters, I looked forward to buying the Garage!<br /><br />I am really glad Fisher-Price has finally come up with an updated design that is fun and sparks imagination, as well as not being too big.  Previous versions have gigantic, and the one we bought secondhand before purchasing this one was not fun at all.  It had ramps that went down like trapdoors, and nowhere else for the cars to go except the elevator and a lame little garage you could hardly fit your hand or car through.  My son would watch the cars tumble down the funny ramps for a short while, and then lose interest.<br /><br />This version of the Garage has so much for him to do!  He loves \\""filling up\\"" the car and tow truck at the gas station, stopping at the snack and magazine stand, going down the ramps, taking the car through the car wash, and pretending to \\""tow\\"" the car to the repair shop to \\""fix\\"" the car (the tow truck can really tow the car and unload it at the repair bay).  The sounds are fun, too--the gas pump dings and \\""glugs\\"" like the car is filling up, the cars can run over a button that makes car noises, the repair shop has realistic noises.  The elevator is fun, too, although if my son isn't careful, his cars tend to slide out before it reaches the top.  (I think that flaw needs to be remedied!)  But he loves the toy, and my 5- and 8-year-old daughters will also play with the toy for a while.  I think it's closer to the old favorite than any of the other versions I've seen.  I recommend this toy for a good, imagination-sparking, classic purchase!"
5.0	Bought these as a gag gift for my fiancee.  I picked this set because they were super cheap, but they are very good quality!
5.0	This was a gift for college students and they love it. I have heard many hours of laughter because of this game.
5.0	I did not buy this toy at Amazon, where I buy most things.  However, it is one of my grandson's favorite toys.  He is almost six months old and he LOVES the mirror.  He also enjoys the flashing lights, loves to bite on it, and pushes it to make it play music.  I'm so happy I purchased this toy.  It was a hit!
5.0	I love the thickness of the blocks. . .  I love that all sides are occupy wit something for her to do... My sister saw these blocks  and planned and buying 1 for her daughter as well...
1.0	Our boys each got this toy for Christmas.  Very excited we put it together right away.  Basically you could blow on this toy and the parts would fall to the floor.  Our kids tried to play with this toy and make it work, but it does not stay together.  The parts do not fit together well and once you do get them together you might as well put it on a shelf if you want it to stay together.  We were very disappointed. It says BTR on on the side for built to rule.  Should be more like BTFA - built to fall apart.
5.0	My first helicopter great for indoors very durable to crashing and doesn't hurt to bad when you get clipped by the blades.  Only downside is infer red controlled, remotes and other helicopters interfere easily with it. Theres only too settings for  the controls and its hard to get them to not run the same. I bought 5 of these for family and it was a nightmare trying to run them we had to do 2 at a time of course but any time we switched we had to mess with them a while to get them on different freqs and simply switching the button on the controller didn't work.
1.0	This product should never have made it to market.  The smell the chemicals emit is noxious. Kids that are old enough to pour wet sand from one tiny orifice to another without spilling it everywhere would be far too old to have any interest in it. All but one of the colors glow in the dark at all. This product is a complete FAIL!!!  Don't disappoint your kids or anyone else's.
5.0	My son is in love! Its perfect
5.0	Fit well and the break down by year of coin release is another little extra that makes it worth the cost.  Should be interesting to see how well it gets put up on the wall.
5.0	This bike and helmet set thrilled my six year old granddaughter. It's well made and thevhelmet fits and functions well.
5.0	Perfectly inappropriate addition!
5.0	Got 3 of these superheros for my 2 year old grandson.  The size seems perfect.  I think he'll love them.
5.0	Great party favor bags.  Really large.  They hold a lot of little items or a few large items.
5.0	Excellent playing cards....of course, they are Bicycle.
5.0	My daughter loved this Doodle Bug. It's fun to watch the bug drawing. The music is fun too. Everybody can enjoy it.
5.0	Perfect for what my daughter was asking me for! Inexpensive and adorable!!
5.0	This thing is awesome, looks very funny and cool, and gets a lot of attention.  Definitely a great gift for Star wars fans
5.0	I bought this to play with at the office. My partner got one and releasing they come with two channels I got mine and we fly them around in our video studio (a big room) at the same time. Good thing to have when the work day gets too hectic.
5.0	I chose this product because we have a son named Bruce.  It is a fun family game and I recommend it.  Bruce's kids especially love playing it.
1.0	Deflated need 2 buy batteries
5.0	I bought this for my son's 3rd birthday party and it was a hit! Our theme was Curious George and this monkey looked better and was a better price than the Curious George piñata I found. It arrived on time in a big box with tons of packing. It held probably 6 pounds of candy and came open perfectly (on the last string if you can believe it!). We had kids ages 3 to 12 and they each had fun with the pull string. Definitely a good purchase.
5.0	Toy is soft, grand-daughter seemed to like, easy for her to hold on to. Kept going back to it rather than opening other Christmas presents
5.0	allows for creativity and fun with this fun set
1.0	This is one of the dumbest toy you can buy for the price. It looks good and interactive but is not. Also the ramps are too compact, not much distance between them for the child to watch the cars move. My 2 year old son loves the interactive toys from vTech and I thought this may be good for him, but so far haven't been able to get my child play with it. He completely ignores this toy and ignores me when I try to play with the toy to get him interested. Dont know why a lot of toys have the provision for batteries when all they do is produce some random sounds. My point of view, in this day and age kids love playing with interactive toys rather than play with the dumb toys which this one is. No wonder children from a year old onwards nowadays want to play on their parents phone rather than their own toys, they find these toys dumb and don't have even a semblance of  interaction which the games on phones offer oodles of. Waiting for toy manufacturers to take the cue and make interactive toys rather than keep making these dumb toys, Regret buying it. Update: Now even the dumb sounds don't work. This is a poorly designed toy with cheap components, never buying a Fisher-Price product again. Will stick to vTech for now.
5.0	This puzzle is fantastic to begin with and within an hour of using it I had smashed my previous 5x5 record by almost two minutes. The one thing it did need, though, was some lube. And after I lubed it, it was even more amazing than before and I smashed my record yet again. All in all it's much better than a V-Cube and I highly recommend it.
5.0	love it. hard to find, so happy to get it on amazon . com. completed set! i cant say any more!
1.0	This is an illegal bootleg copy of a Korean BJD.  Buyer beware, you are being scammed.
5.0	Our grandson loves riding this trike!  It has numerous sounds & he just loves to push all of the buttons!
5.0	Daughter collects these little buggars and this one is particularly cute. We never see him out in stores so he was a great find.
5.0	This was the best idea ever for my child's fifth birthday party! All of the kids were so excited to get to wear a cape, and then take them home as a present. Best ever.
5.0	My son loves to read his Bugsby books in the bathroom.  It's a great way to keep him entertained and have him learn all at the same time.  It saves me from having to sit uncomfortably in the bathroom to read to him, because with Bugsby, he can read to himself!  He loves Bugsby and the Magical Museum!
5.0	I gave it as a Christmas gift to one of my good friend's son.  He is just graduating high school so he is at that age where you have to be careful and not get them something nerdy or something where you are trying to be cool.  This was right on the button.  I put some money in it which made him immediately interested.  He was talking and showing his friends on facebook as he was trying to open it.
5.0	I bought these for my 1 year old as part of an addition to her noah's ark set. They're cute, easy to clean, and easy to carry around in a diaper bag. The perfect toy!
5.0	Bought this for my 2 year old daughter's birthday.  She got to taste cake for the first time - and even though she loved it, she was so distracted by the Dora and Diego figurines that she didn't even eat much of her cake.  She just played around with the figurines, dancing them around the table and singing happy birthday to them.  2 weeks later, they are still a part of her daily playtime routine!  The little cake int he center is very cute - it wobbles, making it a fun accessory to play with too.  The two animals are made of a somewhat thin plastic - too bad they aren't figurines as well, but my daughter still enjoys playing with them too.  The only problem is they don't stand up unless they are poked into something, like a cake.  But overall, awesome cake topper and fantastic toy afterwards!
1.0	Item received was not the item ordered. I received the wrong puzzle.
5.0	love anything ben 10 we can get it is hard to find here overseas so anything we can find that is ben 10 is great.
5.0	My 4 year old niece loves it!! Great purchase
5.0	Love it he rides it all the time
1.0	I was very disappointed in this item. It is made of cheap, non durable plastic.. actually worse than anything I've seen off drug store shelves at Halloween!    It was broken within an hour. The high cost of this item suggested it was a decent product, in fact it is nothing but Junk Junk Junk!    I would not recommend the product or use this vendor again. the misrepresentation of the item says they have no integrity.
5.0	"To start - this toy seems to have been greatly improved since earlier comments.  There are no longer any choking hazards and all items fit easily back into the case.<br /><br />Our 20 mth old toddler loves \\""helping\\"" out with DIY.  This toy is pretty perfect.  It's well made with a quality feel and the size is right - alot of the time with these toys everything seems smaller than the photo.<br /><br />Inside the case you have a screwdriver, spanner, hammer and drill, 5 screws inside the case which CANNOT be removed and 2 nails which can be alternately hammered in.  There is a shape sorter with 4 shapes, a voice says the name of the shape when the child pushes it in.<br /><br />Finally there are some static cogs which make music when turned.  Alot of entertainment in one toy.<br /><br />Both the case and the drill take batteries.  There are no small parts or choking hazards.  Everything fits easily back into the case.<br /><br />My only areas for improvement to this toy would be that the case comes with batteries fitted while the drill doesn't.  Also the drill, which takes 2 AA batteries only makes a noise when the button is pushed.  I would have expected the drill bit to turn.  Our toddler did too!"
5.0	The cars are alright, especially the Green Cougar.
1.0	This doll is just plain boring (and that bow on her shirt is so asinine!). Who is coming up with the fashions for the my scene dolls? Who ever they are they need to get real. The real fashion dolls are the Bratz... thier clothes are MUCH more trendy.<br /><br />~Kazami Ami
5.0	We bought this as a present for our 7-year-old's birthday. He loves it. He keeps it in bed to read or hangs it on the wall.<br /><br />It's minecraft brought to life - what's not to love.
5.0	So fun.  My grandsons love it!!
5.0	These are very nice however I already had them I really needed the pushers! Thank you for making the return so effortless!!!
5.0	My daughter loves cutting up the fruit.
5.0	I'm not a rock expert but these Geode's were a hit in my Earth Science Classroom.  We started using a big chisel and hammer and quickly changed strategies, laying the Geodes on the flat side of a large hammer and striking with a smaller hammer. We did this on piece of wood of course.  One of the 12 was a beautiful white Geode with really nice layers inside.  Everyone took 1/2 home. I'll be back next year.
5.0	Great product made a well loved gift in a timely manner. Would recommend highly!!!
1.0	looks fake ,lame, dose not really give a jolt more of a buzz.. Broke with in the first week . save your real quarters.
5.0	The toy keeps our child entertained for hours. They are learning from the toy. How to make cookies. Make sure the oven is on, coookie sheet to hot to touch after it comes out of oven. Put milk away and eggs away in the Frig. after they are done with it. Hope this works for the real world.
5.0	10 year old boy loved it....I don't get it but it doesn't matter.  Expensive.
5.0	I've noticed that all the other reviews on  this product are from non-Halo fans so I decided to type a review from a Halo fan. I bought this Halo Mega Bloks  set today and it took me around 4 hours to build. After completing the set, I decided to play with the falcon a bit and I said to myself. &#34;I love this but it could use an O.N.I. logo instead of the U.N.S.C. logo.&#34; (did not put on U.N.S.C. stickers)<br /><br />overall a great buy worth the money<br />great for halo fans but not so much for people who haven't played the game same with any Halo mega blok set<br /><br />the rotors are a tad to large and the seats were really hard to put in.
5.0	My son loves this skateboard, it is very sturdy and it is just right for my 6 years old.
5.0	Bought for my son's Mad Scientist Birthday Party.
5.0	My girls and I love it! It's cute and durable! It's perfect for all those small toys (play food, littlest pet shop animals, small blocks). The circles on the side and the dry erase shapes are all stickers. I used the circles but left of the shapes for each individual bucket. I think it looks better. Very pleased with it!
5.0	Very well made doll! She was worth every penny!
5.0	Pretty awesome toy!  My daughter loves it!  Makes a cool whistling noise as the arrow soars through the air!
1.0	Do not buy this product. I put this together yesterday. The directions say the tunnel is bigger than the opening for a snug fit. Not true. In fact the only way to attach the tunnel was to use the toggle from the tunnel and put it in the little loop on the tent. The problem with that besides the tunnel being really loose was that the toggle on the opposite side of the tunnel was sitting in the floor of the opening which is a potential for knee injury or worse if the toggle fell off and was swallowed. I put a towel over it. This is not at all what it seems and I would return it if I could.
5.0	"Got these for my son's first birthday present. Tossed them in the pack n play and let him have a ball! He loves them. They are kind of squishy and have some \\""give\\"", which is nice, because I don't want him hurting himself when stepping on them. I'm ordering more, because 100 doesn't quite cover the bottom of my pack n play. They shipped quickly, despite me using the super saver route. Overall, very pleased with my purchase."
5.0	Ok this is a really nice Groot specially to marvel funko collectors out there but the fact the scalper try to ripped off collectors is it not right or fair the pop doesnt have to suffer for that i am giving it 5 out 5 stars. Collectors and future buyers dont give this scalpers the benifit of the dought be patien.
1.0	My 9 year old daughter bought this with her own money.Despite gentle play,it didn't last a day.We changed the batteries,replacing them with the extra batteries that came with the car & it's still dead.  Needless to say I have a very disappointed little girl.  Buyer beware:this product is not worth the expense.
5.0	I'm used to the original Super Mario Bros. one (all black) but this'll do.
5.0	I may be 20, but I couldn't pass up this adorable little backpack. It's perfect if I only need to carry a few items. My only complaint is that sometimes little clumps of hair come out it, but it isn't a noticeable on the bear. I didn't have any troubles with the zipper or eyes. If you're child (even adult children lol) loves pandas, you should totally get them this fun gift!
5.0	Good quality - we are a bi-racial family so I got the white family and the black family to mix and match.  My daughter loved it.
1.0	I would give this 0 stars if possible.  It is a very poorly made and designed product.  My children cannot begin to put this together themselves.  It took an adult several hours to build.  The pieces are all on plastic sheets and must be cut out from them.  This leaves behind little nubs of plastic which then interfere with the moving parts.  The pieces also do not fit together well and so even if you get the little plastic nubs off, your robot may not work properly.  The instructions are challenging to read.  There are inumerable little tiny plastic pieces that are not individually labelled once cut free from the plastic sheets. I doubt that we could dissasemble our current robot and actually identify the correct parts to reassemble our robot differently.  A complete waste of time an money.  There are better solar toys.
5.0	This item was a gift for someone else.  It went over very well.  I would definitely consider this item again.
5.0	Love White Mountain puzzles.
5.0	They are able to sit on top of the guns! There is a special place for them.
5.0	this was a Christmas present for my 1 of my grandkids and was a great hit.  It will be enjoyed for years to come.
5.0	Received my order early within the posted time...my kids love the different pictures
5.0	We've tried a lot of different board games and nothing has come close to the fun we've had with Ticket to Ride.  Everyone loves it.  It's simple enough for my 6 year old to play along - with a little bit of assistance - yet complex enough for my wife and me to deploy totally different strategies to try to win.<br /><br />At first it felt a little overwhelming, but after watching a quick video on Youtube we got right into it.<br /><br />A must have for family game night!
5.0	Shipping was fast for how far they traveled. My daughter loves them and I think for what I paid (under $2) with free shipping they were well worth the price and super cute!
5.0	Bought this last year and this year. Currently have 450.  Son had just turned 7 when he first got this.  He's now 8+.  Who knew something so simple as a plank of wood would be such an awesome gift. Many planks of wood are like the greatest gift ever!  For over a year, this is the &#34;let's go up to bed early, I'll read while you build with your contraptions.&#34;  It transformed our nightly routine (for the better).  I read chapter books (1/2 - 1 hour a night), this gives him (and sometimes his dad) time to create something new, or start on it.  What he doesn't complete in 1 evening, he'll work on the next.  It's always out on his bedroom floor.  Love this!
1.0	Rockets are relatively easy to construct for kids 8+ but they are way to heavy to fly. The small puff of air that comes out of these flimsy straws is not enough to even move the rocket off the straw let alone make them fly. But the rockets themselves as a craft are cute.
5.0	saving for Easter Bunny basket
1.0	I bought this as part of a birthday gift.  Little did I know it would arrive in a baggie rather than in its original packaging.<br /><br />Not at all happy!
5.0	Absolutely adorable! My 2 year old granddaughter got right on & was very excited! (although she asked where the pink petals were.. ) :)
5.0	Fits great. Lightweight.
5.0	My little cousin loved it, and it's cute. She is bilingual and I liked that it had both English and Spanish.
5.0	My son loves this kitchen.  It was a great choice from all the kitchen choices out there.  I do wish that they had hooks behind the stove but it is easy to put some on it.
5.0	Cute set; perfect for little ones!  It's great that it comes with more than 1 animal/character.
1.0	Do not buy this.  There is a design flaw - baking soda spills out.  Don't waste your $$.  I contacted customer service provided with the toy - I won't give the name but JM are the initials in case the company is looking - they replied back, told me they would send a new one and never did.  I followed up with no reply.  I suspect b/c the product in general is flawed.
5.0	Great game ,my son and I play every night
5.0	My granddaughter loves tea sets so this was perfect. Came with own basket as well. She spends hours playing with it.
5.0	My son absolutely lived these plush of I is favorite characters.  One arrived clearly With the face applied upside down but son was still satisfied with his collection.
5.0	They are shining and bright colors and I love them they hold so much liquid and are tall cups so worth it
5.0	This is so cute! I know my daughter will love it because I let her play a little with it before I put it up for Christmas. She's 17 months so it's a little big but she will grow into it. She loved it while it was out!
5.0	Who would have ever thought that adding and subtracting would be a fun game?? We got this after reading the reviews and my 5 year old daughter loves it. Somehow she always seems to beat me in the game.
5.0	I love these puzzles I've already put so many together. My husband told me that I'm running out of room for them. But I'm addicted I'm gonna order more.
5.0	Fantastic chess set. Never in a million years did I think I would find the perfect set of Hospitallers vs. Templars. The pieces are very well-painted and detailed, and the packaging was pristine. The designs of the pieces are even historically accurate, which was surprising as these things tend to be more on the fantasy side. Definitely would recommend to any medieval enthusiast.
5.0	My cute little home schooled daughter adores this microscope. I'm so glad I bought if for her. She is 6 years old. After a little help from me, she has mastered being able to use it.
5.0	Cool to use on SCX10s as axle bearing replacements for ease of service. Also to use on a stampede vxl 4x4 that we made for water crossing.
1.0	I wanted to get a stand for my daughter so we can have stand to play with. This is nothing more than a prop for displaying. Absolutely overly priced and a rip off! This stand is nothing more than $10 if that.
1.0	very poor quality. the tutu is damage. very sad
5.0	WE love it!  The kids play this game all the time and it is fun for all ages.  You could start playing this game at age 2.  Great Fun!!
5.0	I looked at the Geotrax, Kidkraft and the Thomas the Train set before deciding on this one. I'm not opposed to spending $200-300 for a good quality train set but not $600 (cost for a table and Thomas the train set that contains as many pieces). The quality of this set is great and the motorized Thomas the trains I bought separately fits on the tracks. My 2 yo. spent hours playing this the first day we had it assembled. He loved it, esp. the parts of the tracks that makes noises and or lights up (bridge and tunnel). I don't know what the other complaints area about the quality of the table but my husband assembled it in under 2 hours and had no problem whatsoever. Highly recommended!
5.0	This doll is very cute! My daughter is seven years old and loves these dolls! She really love the dolls style
5.0	Loved this. Everyone at the party wanted a turn wearing it. We saved it for the official birthday tiara for all the girl birthdays.
5.0	My granddaughters love them.
5.0	Exactly what my daughter wanted. After a little &#34;charge&#34; in the direct sun, they glowed very nicely.
5.0	Thank you for the puzzle, shipped and delivered very quickly! Great experience!
5.0	for 9.99 these were a nice gift for my 1 yr old nephew who loves cars/trucks.<br />he opened a present just before mine and got an identicle but very small truck, so when he got to my present, it was very impressive to get TWO nice big trucks.<br />i also got a set for my daughter (11months) I want her to have a wide range of gender neutral toys. She Loves them! she plays with her cars/trucks a lot more than her lifeless dolls.<br />kids her age just seem to want toys that roll, move, and have bendable parts.
5.0	I was very happy with this product. It was fairly priced and in perfect condition. I even recieved it sooner than expected. For Christmas my youngest son has asked for everything spiderman related, but not the usual spiderman. They were all characters from other dimensions or out of his comic books. Anyhow I was able to find what he wanted on Amazon and I can't wait to see his face on Christmas morning :D
5.0	Great value! Bought for my son for Christmas and he's still using!
5.0	Very creative and high quality product.  Thought of the little things when constructing it.  Worth the higher cost.  definately recommend.
5.0	I will purchase more for gifts-that should explain how pleased i am. can even wash in the machine-i did it!!
5.0	Love it! Very fun for 2-4 year olds. Looked everywhere for a rocker and this was the best one I've seen. Big enough for 2 bigger kids or 3 small ones.
5.0	awesome heli,very impressive,lil money wow
5.0	This game was made for our group of friends!  We love it!  Sure some of the answers are a bit &#34;sensitive&#34;, but hey...so is life!
5.0	This was a very special gift for a very special person and it was just what I was looking for perfect in everyway
5.0	It was so much fun on the river  when we did the bullhead regatta . I lived the cooler in the middle
5.0	"Having instigated a \\""desk mascot\\"" competition, I was very proud to show off the legendary Naked Snake.  His level of detail quickly impressed an avid fan like myself, as well as my former US Army co-worker, who recognized the M1911 model of Snake's pistol almost immediately.  He was impressed with the accuracy of the uniform, as I am with it's accuracy to the game. Posed perfectly to represent Snake's experience and skill, it is slightly awkward in terms of balance. It will stand on its own, just be logical about where you place it.  He's a figure, not an action figure, meaning he cannot be reposed but the pay off is worth the extra detail (real-looking joints).  This product is an excellent buy for collectors and fans alike, and commands notice where ever he's placed; as long as he doesn't blend in. ^-^"
5.0	Our whole team loves this ball. Very bright used with a team of 12 year olds has held up perfectly
5.0	Came as said described and mint condition, goin to edited to match Mariks deck in the finals, now to buy more characters decks.
5.0	Great buy for any Alabama fan!
5.0	This puzzle has held my daycare baby's attention very well. She enjoys taking the large pieces out, studying each one and putting it back together again. We are able to talk about the shape as she manipulates it, and this puzzle helps with introducing colors. We love it!
5.0	Great, bright colors & is holding up well being used constantly by a 4 year old. Well worth the price.
5.0	This playground-type ball is just the right size for rolling back and forth in floor games with our baby, but sturdy enough for rougher play if our older child takes off with it.  We love the bright pictures all over it as well.  Kids have tried to go home with it twice after play dates.
5.0	bought this for a 5 year old and he absolutely loves it-takes it to bed with him and puts<br />it under his pillow for protection
5.0	I purchased the swing for my granddaughter (12 months) and we love it!  She feels very safe in it and it was easy to put up, it is easy to clean and quite easy to get in and out of.   You do have to be careful putting your child in the swing or they could end up sliding out if you don't hang onto both as you buckle them in.  It is open enough for them to see out and enjoy the ride and yet gives the sense of being enclosed so they feel safe.   --- More, More is what we hear! Soon it will be higher, higher.
5.0	this was a gift  i wanted to buy it for someone because it was adorable.  My grandaughter (1) has one and she loves it.  nice quality and nice price
5.0	Came on time. It is very nicely made and prices right. Nice display item. Recommend it to all blue whale lovers.
5.0	This set is really awesome!!! You get all the houses and a general Hogwarts crest patch----- this is a GREAT buy!! So far the patches are holding up really well and we get lots of compliments.
5.0	My granddaughter luvs Her. Bought it for her for Xmas but pampers n good are too expensive
5.0	I bought this for a Robbin hood costume and I freakin love it. You can tell it's hand carved and it doesn't look like a child's bow and arrow. It can really go along well with a costume.<br /><br />The only thing I wish was different is the size of the bow so that it can go over my body as a way to carry it. Instead I'll have to be creative.
5.0	We purchase one of the giant numbers each year for our twins birthday.  This one, like all the others before it, worked wonderfully.  Stayed inflated for weeks after our party!  I finally had to poke a hole in it because our dog wouldn't stop barking at it!
5.0	Not only was this an awesome card for a decent price, but it arrived fairly quickly and there were no problems with shipping! Recommended.
1.0	We absolutely LOVE Bill Nye the Science Guy and are huge environmentalists so I thought this would be a great gift for the kids!!!  We bought this at WalMart for around $10 so the price on Amazon right now seems a bit jacked up.  The first thing I noticed was that it is MADE IN CHINA!  The next problem is that the instructions and plastic parts (aka junk) are confusing.  We used telephone book paper and soaked it forever (like overnight) and it still took a TON of cranking on the blender before it looked workable.  The entire rest of the process is perplexing when trying to read the instructions.  We ended up just screening the paper in the tray, sponging it off, and then trying to tap it off gently without having it fall apart.  All you really need is an old baking pan tray and a screen you could make yourself (bigger would be better anyway).  We are truly disappointed in this item.  The concept is great and it got us thinking of ways we want to make the process better, but this 'toy' is junk.  Bill Nye should NOT have his name on this!!!
5.0	Rowdy's trash crash is an awesome addition to your Chuck and Friends set. This piece is much smaller than the stunt park, but still every bit as fun. I also love that Chuck and Friends toys come with a book. The book is every bit as precious as the toy, my 3 year old asks us to read the books over and over (and over and over).    The only downside I can think of is that the trash cans are not connected to the brown piece, which means more clutter and the potential to lose them. Other than that, my son loves the toy. As I mentioned in a different review, this does not come with batteries so if purchasing as a gift, you may want to add 2 AA batteries.
5.0	Great item. My lil guy loves him!!
5.0	This doll is so cute and made the same as American girl.  Comes with extra outfit and accessories.  My 4 1/2 yo doesn't quite know the difference yet. Shes more interested in changing the clothes.  So we could purchase more clothing and accessories even another doll for  her to play with for the same price as american girl.  And if by chance she gets a little too used, messed up, or dirtied we wont stress it.  Moms try this doll first!
5.0	Very well made.  The colors look really well and seems really sturdy.  I know it has the weight and dimensions listed, but you kind of don't realize it till you get it.  It is a little heavy and kind of big, but I still love it.
5.0	This is the cutest bear I've ever purchased. Four sayings, arms move up and down to hide and reveal...cutest thing ever
1.0	First the child must press very hard on the keys which is totally inconsistent with other tablets, and activities are very repetitive.  I bought two--one for each of my grandchildren.  They each got bored with the tablet after the first few minutes and never went back to play with it.
1.0	"I purchased this complete set of (advertised as \\""new\\"") trading cards to give as a special birthday gift.  I expected cards to be packaged in their original packages and box, but they were not.  I was very disappointed, because they obviously were not \\""new\\""."
5.0	Looked good. I gave it away as a gift.
5.0	got this for my granddaughter for sixth birthday, she loves it
5.0	Our 8 year old son loves this. He can do it by himself. Sometimes he has a hard time snapping them together but we like that because it doesn't fall apart easily when you are playin with it. Would buy it again!
1.0	Came with a hole in a belly :(
5.0	Works great. Quick delivery.  Very satisfied.
5.0	Such a beautifully detailed puzzle. I gave this as a gift to a fellow cat-lover, and she was thrilled! I highly recommend this fanciful puzzle for any cat-lover! It's just adorable!
5.0	My husband had barrowed one from a friend and really enjoyed playing it.<br />I was looking for something different for his Christmas present and this fit the bill.<br />I looked for weeks everywhere for it when I finally found it here on Amazon.<br />Thank you it was just what I wanted.
5.0	Item was exactly as described and shipped promptly.  Thank you!
5.0	We used these Cinderella slippers to hold candy for my daughter's Princess Party.  They were a huge hit and my daughter plays with them long after the party.<br /><br />Cute addition to your Princess decor.
5.0	Excellent just what I purchased
5.0	As expected, the detailing of Revell models is excellent. For those buyers who need to know if the landing struts come out, they don't. That being said many modelers just make their own. The decal sheet is extensive, but there are two decals missing, the escape pod launch doors. There are two on the primary hull located on both the starboard and port sides of the aft torpedo launchers. But I took care of that by doing some precision painting. Everything else is perfect, once completed this model is stunning and ready to set course for home, or the display shelf.
1.0	piece of cardboard disappointed
5.0	These are quite hard to find in good condition and i was pleasantly surprised to see that it was in excellent condition and was reasonably priced. Overall great product!
5.0	Got these for our grandson's birthday snd he just loved them. He and his brother play outside with them all the time.
5.0	I got this all these games for my grand children for their Christmas. Jenga, Let's go fishing, Clue, and Connect 4.<br />I'm sure that they will enjoy them because they love to play games. Thank you for having them so I could get them<br />for my grand children.
5.0	We received this over a year ago as a present for my sons 3rd birthday.   It was a winner all around.  He liked it and so did all his cousins (and all of the adults.)  He received this one and the t-rex. Now my younger son who just turned 2 LOVES these- he roars with them and imitates them plus it is one of his favorite toys to take along on trips.  Overall a big hit at my house!
5.0	I bought one for each of my 2 younger children (8&10). they love being creative and play with this a lot.
5.0	These are awesome! They are comparable to Legos without the really high price. My 7 year old is able to follow the directions and assemble. Great buy.
5.0	I bought my nephews two board games for Christmas:  Funky Monkey and Pokemon. Funky Monkey was definitely the game of choice and both boys are avid Pokemon fans. My younger nephew, 5, really enjoyed it and won most of  the time. My older nephew, 7, also enjoyed playing . . . even though little  brother kept winning! Every time I talk to them they tell me that they have  played the game and about how much fun they have with it.
5.0	My Grand Daughter loves it
5.0	Very easy to setup, a lot of fun and great heli to practice 3D because so light and durable and cheap to buy parts for it.
5.0	Overpriced, as all Lego is, but for the four pieces it is a good deal compared to getting them separately.  And my son was really happy to get it!
5.0	I bought this doll house for my granddaughter's 4th birthday. She loves it. I did take me 5 hours to put it together but it was a labor of love. The furniture that came with it was really well constructed. It was well worth the money. I'm totally satisfied. I was really glad the company included the Allen wrench but I also had to use my battery-powered screwdriver for some parts.
5.0	Exactly what I expected it to be. The figure is very flexible and the details are very intricate. Worth the money!
5.0	This is a great set for your little one.  We started my little girl on these a little after her 1st birthday and for more than a year now this set provides quality daddy/daughter play time!  She brings me the box and says &#34;dada open open&#34; and she insists on &#34;caliou help&#34; and I hold her stuffed animals and we 'help her' build something... its wonderful.
5.0	definitely too small and real looking for any kids under 3yrs old.  my 4 yr old daughter loves these, but must keep away from one yr old brother!
5.0	We really like playing this game. I like the fact that you work together as a team to get to the castle before time runs out. My year old granddaughter loves to play.
5.0	ordered this for my little girls bday and it was shipped quick all together with the other parts.  very happy with the service
1.0	The whole reason we bought this was my son needed a chariot for a school diorama. Picture shows and the descriptions states 2 Chariots. Title of the pack is &#34;Caesar knights and chariots&#34;, there wasn't a chariot in the pack!
5.0	Dressed my grandson's Christmas bear in this outfit with the cute black boots also found on Amazon. It was a BIG HIT with my sweet boy!
5.0	My two year old cousin loves this toy. His dad and little brother like it, too. I bought it as a birthday gift so he could take Thomas to his grandparents' house easily when he goes to visit. I also like that it is compatible with other sets--gives me easy options for additional gives while he is still interested in Thomas.
5.0	my grandson loves hockey.  and he explained to me how to play on your knees it s a good game for indoors on a rainy day.  Not many toys available for hockey fans.
5.0	Grandson loves the magnetic aspect of the marbles.  Great gift!  Purchased as a birthday gift and everyone was delighted.with the uniqueness of the marbles.
5.0	It's cute! It's light! Packaging is compact too, so bye bye to bulky cutlery pack. I was pleasantly surprised at the quality and its not hard for my 5 and 4 year old to open.
5.0	It's perfect.  I really hate this having to fill in so many words just to pay a review.  It's perfect nough said.
5.0	We are still, as a family, putting the puzzle together.  It is fun, especially when we usually begin at the margins.  With this, you have to begin inside because what you think are the margins, are not.  We love a challenge, and this is IT!!!
5.0	I use to play Don't Spill the Beans as a child and loved it! So I bought the game for my 3 year old daughter. It's a classic game and still fun today.
5.0	My husband loves the magnets. We are big FMA fans
5.0	I HAD BEEN SEARCHING FOR THESE CHOPSTIX FOR QUITE AWHILE.  THEY WERE ON AN EPISODE OF JON & KATE PLUS 8.  I RECEIVED THEM TODAY AND THEY ARE JUST ADORABLE.  I ORDERED THRU ANOTHER COMPANY BUT SHOULD HAVE WENT THRU AMAZON AS THEY WERE LESS $.  I ALSO THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BE A HUGE SET AS PICTURED NOT EVEN NOTICING THAT IT SAID 1 (ONE).  IN ANY CASE THEY ARE EXCELLENT AND MY 3 YR OLD LOVES THEM...AND SO DO I!!!   I AM GOING TO ORDER EXTRAS AS PARTY FAVORS FOR MY SONS 4TH BIRTHDAY PARTY.
1.0	I just received this ball. There were no written instructions in package except on the ball.  It said to moisten needle & insert to inflate.  What needle???  So I am unable to inflate this ball because I have no clue what they mean by using a needle.
5.0	One good thing about the prequels is that let us appreciate a gamut of Jedi as never before.  However, it was with Ahsoka that  I started to realize how impressive are the female Jedi in the Star Wars universe.  Barris Offee is the second female Jedi in my collect.<br /><br />This figure is from The Vintage Collection; Barris Offee as seen in the film Attack of the Clones. The face has a good resemblance to the character in the film and the body is very detailed, particularly the clothing which includes fabric from the waist down.  However, the skirt doesn't quite match the color of her dress as it should.<br /><br />Out of the box, this figure wears a plastic hood and a fabric cloak. All these are removable. It also includes a lightsaber and an unlit lightsaber with a peg to hang it from her belt.<br /><br />This figure has:<br />- a ball-jointed head,<br />- ball-hinged shoulders, elbows, knees and ankles, and<br />- swivel writs, waist and hips.<br /><br />Overall, this figure offers great likeness and posability.
5.0	These bunny slippers are adorable.  My granddaughter wanted them for Christmas for her American Girl doll.  She loves them and so do I!
5.0	You'll laugh so hard you'll have tears!!! Great party game!
5.0	easy to assemble and a great gift for boys
5.0	Never disappointed my grandsons yet.  They carry them around with them every day.
5.0	I love this chess set. I bought it to play with my Grandkids and it is great. I like the fact that it will hold all the pieces inside when folded. The magnetic latch holds it closed very well. It would be nice if the pieces were heavier, but still good for the price.
1.0	I was kind of excited to play with this thing, but the sale price unfortunately reflects quality. The helicopter broke after its first session, and it wasn't like I abused it. You get what you pay for in this situation.
5.0	My son absolutely loved it!!! It was a great price for the large size!  Feel like I got a good deal!  Thanks so much!!!
5.0	Great toy my 4 year old son loved it dose exactly what is said in the vendors description
5.0	My granddaughter loved it was easy to put together needs to be next to the wall but hours of fun every day. She loves the light up and sounds burner.
5.0	Just as described. Perfect.
5.0	Amazing set. Mega Bloks have knocked this one out of the park. Ignoring the weapons that come with the figures, this is a hell of a space station. Some parts of the build are repetitive due to the circular design of the space station but that's inevitable with anything circular and symmetrical. The details they've fit into the Space Station really make this feel like a 'Premium&#34; build.<br /><br />The clear stands help to create the illusion the mini figures are floating in space. The figures were hard to put together, the knees in particular, but the sculpt and detail on each is a pleasure.<br /><br />Cannot recommend this enough.
5.0	the 10 year old loved it
5.0	Purchased for my 2 yr old granddaughter for Christmas. She has enjoyed the Lincoln Logs so much. It keeps her busy.
5.0	This is a great toy for a child who just started school or is alrady in school and it is also alot of fun games to play very educational and fun at the same time. Sold out everywhere ,Im glad I bought mine way in advance. Paid alot less than what they are going for on Line right now because you cannot find them in the stores they are sold out.
5.0	Upon receiving, I have to say I was disappointed. It was flat and seemed small. But after opening, fluffing, it was so cute. My Granddaughter loved it.
5.0	A bit pricey, but the lamb which was a gift for one of our relatives kids was everything and more that we were hoping for. Not only did it recite several nursery rhymes very clearly, but the mouth actually moved to provide a very real sense that it is indeed speaking. A very unique gift.
5.0	Best glide ratio of all the 2 meter gliders I've had.<br />Plug in wings take 8 seconds to assemble.<br />Ailerons not needed due to the curved wing design.
5.0	My girl loves the musical instruments…. we just play music and join in…. the size is perfect for my 18 month old.
5.0	Good quality product which was a nice addition to our 59th anniversary celebration. The packaging and shipping was done well and on time. We sprinkled these on the tables at a banquet dinner.  2 bags did 4 large round tables of 8 plus some.
5.0	The fish is to be used as a prop in a film I'm hoping to make. The service was fast. The fish arrived in good condition. It looks great.
5.0	My older kids are using this around the house although I actually bought it for my little ones. Two of my munchkins can fit on this at a time, and the big kids have been pushing the little ones around on it, so it has been lots of fun for all of them. I only wish it could roll outside, but I still think it deserves 5 stars.
5.0	My granddaughter loved it.  It completed her Queen Elsa Ball Gown!
5.0	I have my own kids and I do daycare. This is always a big hit when I take it out! You will get the most out of it if you use it one on one, or a very small group (2 or 3 max). I love that it grows with my kids. They start off easy and become progressively difficult as you move through the levels. One of my favorite  features is that it allows kids to self-correct. They can see what they got wrong and fix it. Discovery Toys are some of the best toys on the market, and once again they have outdone themselves! I highly recommend this product to anybody with kids 3-5.
5.0	"I am not sure why so many people seemed to have a problem putting this toy together.  It took me ten minutes, tops.  Not only was it easy to put together, but it was a big hit with my son, who got it for his second birthday, along with my two nephews.  They were fighting over who got to ride it, and the sound effects are great!  The bike is very sturdy - it is a cross between a bike, a tricycle, and a big wheel.  Right now my son \\""walks\\"" it around, but he is already figuring out how to work the pedals.  I highly recommend this toy (my mother-in-law is buying my nephew one)!"
5.0	Because I dearly love cats I buy one of these every year.
5.0	I love this little toy.  I bought it for my 3 year old daughter and she's been playing with it for a very short time but, she seems to like it.  I've been sitting with her and I can tell that eventually she'll be able to play and learn all by herself fairly soon.  I would highly recommend this toy.
5.0	Great game. Great packaging. It's awesome. It's an RPG without all the roleplaying. Start a character or a party and adventure for loot and experience. Expansions add more adventures, characters, items, and villains.
5.0	My daughter loved these! These blocks are soft, colorful, and some of them make noise. These are great for development! I love how they are machine washable and they do not get ruined. My daughter has not gotten bored with these and plays with them every day. I'm so glad I purchased these blocks.
5.0	Grand daughter loves it
5.0	it is perfect it is a great gift and super cute and cuddly I just love it so much! GO BEANIE BOOS!
5.0	"I first played this game with some friends on a camping trip.  I was hooked immediately!  Reminds me of playing gin rummy with my grandparents when I was little.  I purchased this game a few weeks ago before traveling to see my in-laws.  We all spent hours over the course of a few days playing this game.  The attache version is a great choice... It travels easily and packs well.  It doesn't take too much space, and there's a place for everything (timer, bag for chips, chip holders).  It isn't exactly \\""travel size\\"", but it depends on how much room you have and how small you can tolerate the pieces being.  This is a good compromise.  The numbers are easy to read and the colors (mostly) are very distinct.  My only \\""complaint\\"" (if you call it that) is that on a few pieces the orange color is very dark and almost looks like red.  But with good lighting this isn't really a problem."
5.0	"I bought this toy for my son when he was about 6 months old.... He is now 6 YEARS old! We all used to have fun playing and singing the little \\""I am a lion, I roar all day\\"" song with him but then when he outgrew it we put it away for if we had another baby. I found it in the attic when my daughter was about 3 months old and decided to see if it would still work. I was surprised and pleased to find that, after a fresh set of batteries, it works perfectly... and now we are all singing the little songs again!<br />She is 10 months old and loves to spin the tummy. She never really pushes the little heart, but that's probably because it doesn't do much on and she gets such a bigger response from spinning. I think it has helped with some motor development because she used to just flop her hand over it to spin it and now she carefully points her little index finger out to spin it.<br />It looks like they have improved the 'cuteness' of the lion, ours is a lot plainer than the one pictured on Amazon, but you can't beat a baby toy that is still going strong after more than 6 years!"
5.0	My kids LOVE this game. It is now my go to gift for birthday parties.
1.0	I bought this toy to give my grandson for his birthday. It was ordered in October for his December birthday. I decided to open it before I mailed it to see how it worked. Well, it did not work at all. I opened the mouth and some of the time the teeth all pop up but most of the time 6 to 8 stay down. When they all popped up, then I thought it should work as described. It did not. I have never gotten the mouth to close when I pushed a tooth down. It is a piece of junk! Since I did not check it out until after Thanksgiving, I can not return it for the full price. By the time I pay for postage I would loose even more so I'll just trash it! What a BIG DISAPPOINTMENT!!!!!
5.0	I recently had a summer kick-off party at my house and a friend of my suggested we play this game. I was a little hesitant in buying it because for one, I never heard of the game and two, it was a little expensive for a card game. BUT, I really did want to try it out after reading the reviews. I ordered it on a Tuesday and to my surprise, it was at my door by Wednesday! Thanks Amazon! ;) Anyways, this game is everything and more. My friends and I were laughing playing CAH throughout the night! There were some questions that were really random and questions that we can't believe were part of a card game! (Be careful when playing this game in front of children). In the game, you can also make up your own rules (or use the ones they have). One rule we made up is that if you want to get rid of a card (some cards were either hard to understand or not funny), you would have to take a shot of tequila to get rid of it and pick a new card out of the deck. And by the end of the night, some of my guests were undeniably drunk. So buy this game if you have trouble being a host and want to break the ice among your friends! It's worth it. I'll be buying the expansion packs ASAP!
5.0	Great buy for my daughter
5.0	This is one of the best purchases I've ever made. It's not only a perfect display stand for my S.H. Figuarts collection, it's insanely customizable and tons of fun to put together. I'd buy another one in a heartbeat.
5.0	My four year old just got this for Christmas and she loves it!  It is very tall and big all around, so measuring might be a good idea.  The best part for me - putting it together was EASY as can be.
5.0	This was the best gift I purchased for Christmas.  She loved it and uses it all the time.
5.0	Awesome toy!! Easy to put together for mommy. Comes with 2 characters. Fun sounds and hours of play. :) Thanks!
5.0	I am impressed with this Minature. It proves to be a tank in the game. I would recommend everyone get this minature if you play this game or are interested in playing this game. A must have for Rebel players.
5.0	The card came in a nice proctive case and was in very good shape.  this ais a 5 start rating
5.0	I have been playing this game for many years with my family when we get together for birthdays, Mother's Day, etc. I decided it would be fun to play it with my grandchildren as well. The item arrived quickly and we played it right away. Great quality, easy to read dominoes. Everyone enjoyed the game.
5.0	I bought three of these action figures about three months ago for my three young boys, and they are all still alive (heads, legs, and arms). Most action figures are headless in a few days and are missing an arm or leg in about two weeks.
5.0	Got this for my grandson that is autistic.  He loves it.  A lot of &#34;toys&#34; do not hold his attention, but he loves playing his train and changing the track
5.0	initially received one tank. They promptly sent the second tank upon learning of their mistake. Great looking tanks. Great fun!
5.0	My little girl loves it.
1.0	We bought this at Toys R Us.  When we brought it home and found it didn't work at all, I decided to see what Amazon customers were saying about it.  Had I checked here first (my daughter fell in love with it at the store) I would have known better than to waste our time on it.  Ah well...Live and learn.
5.0	It's a silly little bath toy. My friend loves octopie and she really got a kick out of this. It was kind of a gag gift, but she loved it.
5.0	Perfect for my son (2 1/2 years old) to play with. Everything is made out of sturdy quality materials. He really enjoys putting the fishing vest on and pretending to go fishing. I like that the fish have magnetic mouths so it makes it much easier for him to &#34;hook&#34; a fish.
5.0	My lil one usually plays with a new toy only for few hours max and then goes to another one. However, she liked this one a lot, and even after a month , she still likes it and this keeps her interested. Happy about the purchase
5.0	Perfect - kids loved it! Bright colors and soft!
5.0	Just what grand daughter wanted
1.0	it doesnt stand, defective and the return date was too close. missed it
5.0	Very cool...love this.  Bought it for our daughter, (3 years old) and just loved the slides you can buy.  Sun, moon, planets, milky way.  Way cool.  Highly recommend.  Very bright and clear.  Well made...slides rotate or can keep still.
5.0	Just exactly what they look like, colored pencils.  I have to go on for more words, so I'm doing it, but these are fine, quality pencils
5.0	a good game where you are city building. it has an interesting turn mechanic that gets away from the clockwise routine based on which character you choose that round.
5.0	Sorry, a reliable standard. Everyone loves to play games and Sorry is fun, easy to play and usually a quick game, if you don't have a lot of time.
1.0	Sorry to write a negative review.  It really should be the highlight of my children's toys, but my 11 month old and my 2 1/2 year old are not interested!  I'm really surprised, but I have this toy in the middle of my living room and they haven't touched it in days!  I have had it for about 2 weeks and my 2 1/2 year old showed some interest the first few days.  He is tall, so the zebra is low for him.  He liked sitting on it and having me spin it around fast for him.  Other than that, he sat on it to watch TV a few times.  My 11 month old is cruising along furniture and could reach the handles on the zebra, but only touched the handles a few times.  I tried really hard to get her interested, but with no luck.  I sat her on the zebra a few times, but she still seems disinterested.  The orange lights inside the handle bar spinning toy are soooo bright that I think they annoy my kids.    It's in the middle of my living room where we play everyday and I don't think I could give it a more fair try than that.      The toy both of my children LOVE is the Galt trampoline.  It has even helped my younger one to practice standing and cruising.  She has figured out how to sit and bounce on it and has fallen a few times, but has not gotten hurt.  I have a foam mat underneath the trampoline.  The other toy that's been a longtime favorite is the Playskool Busy Ball Popper.  It eats D batteries, but has kept them busy for hours.
5.0	works beautifully, Grandson loves it
5.0	Figures are bigger then what I expected.  Rubbery material which I was looking for.. Great to teach animals.
1.0	I purchased this for my son's birthday party- it came in weeks after<br />not only did I have to purchase this ballon- but the replacement as well<br />will not buy from this seller again
5.0	All is good here.No issues.Fast shipping.Packs really well.What more can I ask more.AAAAAAAAAA
5.0	I used the sound bites in a murder mystery play as if we were on radio.  The sound bites where hilarious.
5.0	This is my fourth Castle Creation ESC and brushless motor.  They are all reliable, easy to install and maintain, and durable.  I have two in bashers and two in Tamiya road / touring cars, and all are great fun.
5.0	My niece is in that whole &#34;Frozen, Let it Go!&#34; craze - so naturally she loved this coloring book!
1.0	Popped within minutes of inflating it.  Waste of money.
5.0	I purchased this for my 4 yr old grand son for Christmas and he loved it. Now I have another grand son wanting the same one. lol.
5.0	This is a great creative Barbie.  I find that it's very easy to use and my girls love making their own fashion for her.  I do recommend this as a gift my daughter's want to play it as soon as they get from school and they love putting on modeling shows to show of their creations! Big winner in my book!
5.0	Seems like more than a few Lego sets are designed to look good but not stand up to a kid playing with it.  This one does both.  It is a great looking set and my 6 year old son has played with it hard...and it is still intact (I can't say as much about the recent Xwing fighter purchase though).
5.0	We had planned on getting my daughter a big kitchen she could grow into for her first birthday.  However, I couldn't find one I loved, so we decided to go with this one and keep looking for a big one.  This is perfect for her right now.  She plays with it every day, and it has been two months since her first birthday.  She loves to pretend stir and put the skillet and bowl in and out of the microwave or oven.  She also likes the ice cube dispenser; although, I don't like it that any shape will fit in the holes.  We have plenty of other shape fitting toys though.  My three year old also likes to play this with his sister.  I know she will grow out of it, but for right now it is perfect.
5.0	My grand son 5 yrs. old is wild about Imaginext and anything space related. We bought this along with the Police station Robot, and he received the Space Station for Christmas from Santa as well. This is a cool toy as it does crawl for about 12 inches on the floor (hardwood.) Along with his 3 1/2 yr old sister they switch playing  good guy/ bad guy and have good imaginary fun. This toy is pretty sturdy and the little figures are movable. The kids are very happy with this line of Fisher Price toys.
5.0	I bought this for my grown daughter because it reminded me of one she had as a child. She loves it. It is cuter in person and soft and huggable. Very cute!
5.0	Thank you - product was great and shipping was fast!
5.0	My 2 1/2 year old son loves this garbage truck. I had purchased a different kind and returned it and bought him this one. He really likes that there is a big storage area inside to put all his garbage items, which is usually our non-gargabe valuables from around the house (car key, cell phones, hair scrunchies...). The garbage man driver is also a nice bonus. This tuck rolls very well and fast across wood and carpet. It can also take a fall off a high surface (high chair table, kitchen counter) and have no visible effects. I'll probably buy him a other truck from this line because they're priced fair and are well worth every penny.
1.0	Just recieved my item and the box for the Funko is in horrible condition. I was planning to take it to have Kristin Bauer sign but the box for it is torn and damaged all the way around. Definitely not in collectors codition.
5.0	My little granddaughter is fascinated with mini golf.
5.0	My baby likes playing with her Activity Garden Playset.
5.0	Well put together. Doesn't have bits and pieces falling off all the time. Came with plenty of mini-figs. Worth the Amazon price prolly not retail price. I generally only buy the ones that look unique and challenging to put together. This took about 1 1/12 - 2 hours to put together while in no hurry.
5.0	Great game ! This game really makes game night with family and friends really fun. I got it for a great price on Amazon and they shipped it very quickly.
5.0	Very sparkly which is the most important thing to my daughter. My daughter loves it. Her new favorite thing.
5.0	Every thing I thought it was
5.0	My 10 year old son loves this wand. The lighting effects are very cool. He loves the way he can &#34;magically&#34; make the light come on with just a snap. You do have to be careful when storing it to make sure the light is off!
5.0	G-kids love this bundle of figures.  It was a super great value.  I would recommend it to others for the grandkids of children of all ages.
5.0	I have Darth Vader's Ep 5 lightsaber, Obi-Wan's, and Mace Windu's.  The Darth Maul lightsaber is probably one of the easier ones to wield.  At least one review of the dual saber (it's not so much a dual saber as two individual sabers, an individual box will come with an adapter to attach two sabers together) complained about too many knobs on the Darth Maul that would make it difficult to hold.  While this might hold true with regards to the saber staff or dual saber, individually it is not a problem.  I find this one easier to hold and turn off and on with one hand due to a lack of superfluous grips and non working knobs and things.  Compared to the switches on the Vader or Obi Wan versions anyway.<br /><br />A really great saber, as are all the Master Replica versions I have.  Maybe this one might be a little lighter in comparison than the others, but that could be because it's designed to go with another one in a staff and they wanted to make it light enough so a person could use two.<br /><br />Highly reccomended for collectors.
5.0	Fast shipping just as described
5.0	Exactly as described.  Plushie is nice and very soft as well.  Everyone I bought these for just loved them all.
5.0	Bought this for my daughter for Christmas and of course she loved it. Cute twist to Monopoly and the playing pieces are soo cute. This would be a good one for toddlers/younger children too, just learning to play Monopoly.
5.0	Great game at a great price
5.0	Nice for a toddler to drag, use as a pull-along companion.
5.0	I ordered this for my 12 year old son for Christmas 2009.  He is a huge Star Wars fan and requested this as one of his gifts.  I thought it would be a waist of money and be a toy that he would lose interest in after a few days.  I was so wrong.  It was his favorite gift.  We were all amazed by this little robot.  It is important to read the instructions and commands.  My son has mastered the commands and we all have a blast with R2D2.  It is really funny when R2D2 is stubborn and shakes his head no.  If there is a lot of background noise he has trouble hearing the commands, but we have not found that to be a big problem.
5.0	I was surprised to find these, but happy I did.  I purchased these for my three Grandchildren for Christmas!  They were thrilled.  I was happy with the fast service I received and the items were in perfect condition!
5.0	It's a really cute game and the kids love it
5.0	I purchased this as a gift for my nephew. In all the years I have given him gifts, this was the best. He opened it jumped up and kissed me and my husband. My nephew is a teenager. I am very pleased with the purchase. It met and exceeded my expectations.<br />Aunt B
5.0	Kept the grandkids happy, so I love them
1.0	cheap and not durable for any level of flyers..
5.0	This box is even nicer than how it looks in the pic.  It's a solid, well built box that just happens to have a good feel and look as well.  I roll my own cigs and it holds about 30 cigs.  A tip for storing cigs in dry weather or conditions:  cut a panty liner to fit in the lid and moisten it with water.  Keeps the cigs at a perfect moisture for a good smoke.
5.0	My daughter wore this for Halloween and got a lot of compliments!
5.0	Gave it to our son for the first birthday, he loves it! It's so soft and wonderful. It's also very large, and just great for the price. Great buy!
5.0	My son loves it and he wears it with his superman and batman cape crew socks.
5.0	my wife and i lookeed all over through allot of game stores and couldnt find it. got on line and bam there it was , so bought it.
5.0	This was my first time trying not only a 3-D puzzle, but a sphere. Te pieces fit well together, just a little hard to keep the curves going. Overall I like the challenge and creativeness of this concept.
5.0	Very soft, great condition teddy. Kids or Pokemon fans will love this! Can't wait for my friends son to see it
5.0	Sure shot everytime!! Very dependable weapon, perfect for indoor office warfare. Delivery was right on time.
5.0	I bought this for my Grandson's 10 birthday and what a hit! He got some other pretty cool gifts but this was the one he and all the other kids want to play with. The only negative thing I would say is it doesn't adjust as much as it could for different size kids. Other than that..perfect!
1.0	it takes hours to build.  It's not fun at all to build so daddy has to build it.  it's way to complicated for a child.  Then once it's built it does it's thing and the kids quickly get bored with it.  IT can't be built any other way so there is no learning.  Buy another marble run or legos
5.0	Would the Pilot have to stand to fire the machine gun? The Model Maker did an excellent job! These Planes have many parts Very Difficult! I'm Happy!
5.0	I bought this for my 5 yr old son, it looked like something he would like......he loves this game. I just gave it to him last night and I can't tell you how many times we have played it so far! Easy to understand instructions.
5.0	I liked this toy, because it´s very interesting to learn from baby  that technology. They will be very glad to play with it.
5.0	This is perfect for my 2 1/2 yr-old granddaughter.  She loves Bubble Guppies and coloring with the Color Wonder markers saves my furniture!  We color together and have a great time.
5.0	This is a toy that I purchased to go along with one of the dolls that I have created.  He is such a cutie!
5.0	My granddaughter absolutely loves the Pencil case. She said, all her friends wanted to know where she got it. Keeps all her pencils in one place. No more digging to the bottom of the backpack. Had gotten one for my other granddaughter for Christmas and she is still raving about it. Delivery was very fast and the product is of  great quality. Would recommend this for any school aged child.
5.0	My kids love this helicopter. Even know they didn't know how to fly at first. It was very user friendly. They were great at it only a hour or so after opening the box it came in. I wish we had these kind of cool toys when I was a young boy. I'm just amazed at how hight you can take this helicopter. I guess some people get the wrong idea about this toy, but for us we loved it. I love how it has a headlight so when the kids are asleep I can take it out at night and fly. I only wish it had a longer battery life.
5.0	Everything you need to fly RC nitro planes or nitro helis in one kit. You have to assemble the box but the instructions are really detailed and it was a snap to build. All the components are good quality and should last. It arrived on time and I will use this seller in the future. Great product.
5.0	Really good for practice. I've learned a lot of good ways to play and perform this yoyo to my friends.
5.0	This was a most treasured birthday gift.  There are a lot of pieces so a bag is necessary to keep it in.
5.0	This is a very well made toy, small and easy for my 2yr old to handle. Nice big handles for small hands to grasp.
5.0	A good staple for green white populate decks.<br />Arrived earlier than expected too! Thanks for the great product very helpful.
5.0	high quality product. very fast delivery
5.0	Keeps my over energized 3-year old still. Great church quiet toy
1.0	I got this toy for my 3 year old, and he loved it while it lasted. But that was one day. After about 30 min. of use it quit working, changing batteries, reassembling, nothing worked. I would have chose to return it for a functioning toy except for one fact: IT ONLY OPERATES ON BATTERIES!!!!! I do not know what madman at Fisher-Price made this a design choice, but they must be getting kick-backs from the battery industry. It was a nice toy for the age group, but the expense of maintaining battery power is crazy, they should have at least an option of a power adapter. Stop and think about it. Who would be able to get a X-Box, a Playstation, Wii, or even a computer if your only power option for it was D-cell batteries?
5.0	Yes, I have about 12 of these 1/700 subs and U boats. Great for a collection and conversations.
5.0	The pure white color is clean to work with.  I really like them!
1.0	The microphone did not amplify your voice at all.I expected to be able to hear my grandson's voice. I could not.
5.0	Love this coin.  Husband did his basic training in San Diego.
5.0	Great car! I love it!!! Very fast and very strong!
5.0	My grandson loves this.  Very educational.
1.0	They are very cute. I actually spray painted them to match the party decor. BUT they actually are not heavy enough to hold down one 9-inch balloon. It took three of them to hold down ONE balloon. So just be aware that you will need a cluster of them to hold down a set of three or five balloons. I don't think that is at all functional. They should be a bit heavier.
5.0	I love this dragon, will fit so well on my son birthday cake. I will buy more LTD thanks for a great piece.
1.0	This is the worst product to suck money from our children that I have ever encounterd.  first off 90 percent of reviews on non Mattel related sites is terrible.  The software is slow, or doesnt work at all.  As soon as you install the software it wants to do a 558 meg download, the exact size of the software on the disk.  The servers that support this doll are not functioning properly.  You can access the web site, but not the servers to play with the doll.  Tech support has been no help what so ever.  Three calls later and the doll does not work.  Thier only solution is to turn off all antivirus software, disable all firewalls, open your computer completly to the internet, and the doll should work, but it doesnt.      I have been in Computer design, networking and hardware for over 10 years.  This POS doll should not require the population to open thier computers to viruses and hackers just to make the doll function.    More thought should have been put into the connection of this toy before disappointing millions of children on Christmas.  Shame on you Mattel.  You have ruined millions of little girls christmas' for the sake of a dollar.  I will never purchase another Mattel toy as long as my 5 children are interested in toys.
5.0	Would have preferred last Friday but it did arrive in the time frame specified.
5.0	I bought this boat for my 3 year old... Big mistake!!  It is a really awesome ship, but even though my son LOVES it he takes it apart constantly and there a ton of little pieces to search for.  If you buy it, buy it for a kid that is not so immature and can handle all of the small pieces.  And if you want more than just one figurine you have to buy more separately which it states right on the box!  Overall its a really neat ship, just not for little kids.
5.0	Kelly the Crane...my son wanted to have entire building crew of Sodor, so we got him Kelly...it's probably the most fun of all the Thomas items, looks even more fun than some of the locomotives...my son was excited that it has spare wheel and magnetic extendable hook...it can drive on and off the tracks...very detailed and cool little toy...mostly plastic.
5.0	perfect color and strength. I did not use the center screw hole so the kids won't tear clothes. looks good and is kid approved.
1.0	Shield ripped within 5 mins of handling by adult and completely tore by 4yr old. had to cut shield off to not be a total loss. Looks are more of space invader than astronaut
5.0	This action figure is tough & looks just like the real Lando.  My 6 year old just finished reading the Star Wars junior novels & watching all the movies & loves his new Lando.  He likes it so much that he doesn't think he will even let his little sister play with it.
5.0	Excellent Christmas gift.  Just what my five year old granddaughter wanted for her dolls.  Looks just like a real one.
5.0	We love this mower!  The bubbles worked for us, as soon as we put them on the mower.  It is true, that you do have to get the mower moving pretty quickly to get the bubbles to blow.  Our son doesn't care as much about the bubbles as he does about the mower itself, so we just took them off.<br /><br />The sound it makes is great, and no batteries, which we really like.  Not overly loud, so on rainy days, you could use this indoors.<br /><br />I would purchase this product again.
1.0	My 20 month old had this for two weeks before it fell apart.  He would occasionly move the piano around by using the top as a handle (how else is a toddler supposed to move this?)  Today the top fell off (it appears cheap glue was used in assembly).  When the top comes off the yellow board above the keys comes off and that yellow board is what holds all the keys in place.  And that's the end of this piano.  I know it's a toy, but because it's not an inexpensive toy I wouldn't expect it to be so cheaply made.  Fortunately my son doesn't seem to really care that it's broke.
1.0	I bought this camera bundle for my daughter's 6th birthday based on the great reviews. I wish I had seen the reviews for the camera alone, because they are not so great, and for good reason. This camera is junk. The screen is very small, it requires that you film in very bright light just to see anything on the screen, but the deal-breaker is there is no sound on video playback! My daughter loves to use my camera to make funny videos, which is why I bought this for her, but she hardly ever downloads them to watch on the computer, she just watches them right on the camera. So with a tiny screen and no sound on playback, where is the fun? She was thrilled when she opened the gift but within a minute of using it she had no interest in it, it was a complete disappointment. I called the manufacturer and after 2 different people and several minutes on hold, the person I spoke with tried to tell me that it wasn't supposed to have sound, that it has a microphone but no speaker and you only hear the sound when you download it. I told him that it does have a speaker and it makes sound affects, just no audio on the video playback. He insisted that it wasn't supposed to play audio and I should download the video to the computer and if there was still no sound I should call back. I called Amazon instead so I can return this piece of junk. If anybody knows of a good, reasonably priced, durable video camera for a kid, please let me know!
5.0	parents can count on quality.  durable for the rough handling of kids.  other products i have purchased are of the same good quality
5.0	many such blocks to choose from.  I have a 9 month old grandson who absolutely LIVES for knocking down towers of blocks.  The look of glee on his face and the giggles he sends out when he notices a tower being built....so adorable!  That being said, the art on these blocks makes it fun for grandma to look at all the different sides, and the construction is sturdy but light enough not to cause trauma when it lands on the little one's noggin.
5.0	I bought this for my daughter's best friend who is obsessed with sloths. She loves it. It does shed a little, but is very soft and cuddly.
5.0	I am very satisfied!! Thanks!!
5.0	So much fun! Well put together. Great customer service! Thank you for such a high quality product!
5.0	I took this bingo set to a family reunion, and everyone had a great time!  Some of the kids thought it was really cool how it rotated and a ball popped out on its' own.  I would recommend this to any family who wants to have some fun!
5.0	This fur real baby is absolutely adorable. This toy is very interactive when played with. My granddaughter has a great time when she plays with this toy. Will definitely add to this collection in the future.
5.0	I normally don't leave reviews for products simply because it takes a heck of a lot to drive me to the point of praise or condemnation. So when I say that these dice are great you can safely assume that they are above and beyond satisfactory. I received 15 complete sets of dice in excellent condition and all at a great value with a free bag to top it off. For those that are interested the bag I received was the red lined one and the dice were 6 sets of translucent dice, 4 sets of solid colored dice, and 5 sets of marbled dice. None of the sets of dice had repeat colors but some colors did show up across the different types of sets; i.e there was a solid purple set as well as a translucent purple set. I would definitely recommend this dice set if you're looking to expand your collection.
5.0	This is a thick patch - almost 3 dimensional, and also large enough for mid-back, or either side of the front of a jacket by itself. It would dwarf most other 3 inch patches in its vicinity.<br /><br />Nice job. I am more than pleased.
5.0	"My late husband became obsessed with golf & met great new friends who all played in tournaments every Thursday. I got the dammit golf doll for Greg's best friend who is a very good golfer, but Greg used to talk about some \\""weird\\"" shots he had made when it really counted.  Greg used to tell him that maybe if he screamed & cussed it would help. So I got the doll to maybe help his game a little more.<br />Great idea. May have to get other dolls dolls for others"
5.0	I bought this for my son's 1st birthday and absolutely loves it! :) Its super cute and really easy to put together...really easy to manuever and turn too! Highly recommend to all little tots!
5.0	This toy looks like something that we bought for much less money.  But this is much higher quality than most bath toys, and the little motor actually works.  This made me happy, because there are always tears when a toy doesn't work like it is supposed to.
5.0	Can't really call these Pastis creations cute (well, maybe Pig), but actually they are charming in an odd way.
5.0	This game is awesome and travel size. The score cards have TINY print on them so I just use a sticky note to keep score.
5.0	THis product is exactly what I expected.  The handle on the jar is a nice touch and will make carrying it around easier for my child.
5.0	The Mary Meyer Marshmallow stuffed animals are so soft and snuggly.  I have bought one for each of my kids and bought several for gifts as well.  Toddlers up to my almost 7 year old love them.  I will continue to buy more as gifts in the future.  The elephant is my personal favorite, but they are all cute.
1.0	Only holds small people
5.0	Such a cute item for our little one over the holiday. The chocolates were of very nice quality and the verses were lovely.
5.0	I got it  . Love it,IT WAS IN MAIL BOX NOT DELIVERED TO FRONT DOOR
5.0	Leogs are always a big hit with all of our grandchildren. We do wish that they were not so pricey, but they are well made and last forever if the kids don't lose them. We still have the Legos that we bought for the fathers of our grands.
5.0	Kids loved it and so did the adults! Fast delivery and sturdy built well. Came with string and super easy to assemble. Glad I made this purchase
5.0	Came very quickly and perfect size. Thank you.
5.0	Beautiful well-made model.
5.0	My Nephew was begging me to buy the Pixos kit for his birthday...I gave it to him and ended up holding my rank as his favorite Uncle.    During the election he made an American flag (There is a great website for downloading templates [.....]   (USA flag: [......]    In the age of video games it was great to have a different activity I could do together with him.    This is a great product to get kids away from the TV.
5.0	"My son was so excited when this arrived in the mail today. He tried it on as soon as we stepped inside.. and we are pretty happy with it. The size is perfect... although if he were even slightly bigger, it would be too small .. especially the mask/helmet. He is 5, and size 6 is still a little big on him, so I would say the sizing is not perfectly accurate. Also, the material is very thin.. very cheaply made. Aesthetically, it is fine.. it looks much nicer than it actually is.. which is sufficient since it will only be needed for one night, and maybe as an occasional \\""dress-up\\"" item. A side note.. it does NOT come with a shield as depicted in the picture, thanks to another reviewer we were aware of this ahead of time, but I would have been disappointed if I had not known ahead of time. Overall.. we are satisfied with the product for the price, so thanks!"
5.0	it actually glows, LOL! okay, by far this is the best of the novi stars so far, her outift allows her to sit a lot better than some of the others, her hair lights up when her antenna is pressed, she's cute. Sun themed.
5.0	3 1/2 year old loves puzzles and this one being Paw Patrol.  Couldn't go wrong on this gift!  Thanks!
5.0	My son was very happy christmas morning
5.0	Super durable exactly what I was expecting!
1.0	I purchased this toy for my sons birthday, we've had it out of the box 5 days and we've attempted to play with it only twice.  My first impression, once out of the box was aweful, with the 25+ pieces I had to put together, which took about an hour, only for the end result to be about 5 minutes of play time before it started coming apart!  The pieces of the track don't stay together from the jump start, most of his hot wheel cars won't work with it, the slime is completely aweful, messy and a pain to clean up.  After each use you have to clean up the mess in order to preserve the slime.  Tonight after 2 additional minutes of play time, I've decided to take my lost and throw it away entirely...except my son wants to keep the slime!  $49 dollars for slime makes me want to gag.  If there is a lemon law for toys, this one by mattel wins hands down!!!
5.0	The product came exactly as described and in excellent condition. We love playing this game with the entire family, including the kids.
5.0	hello every one  my name is ariel pretty much like the mermaid .  this i think you should by for your daughters and grandaughters because i think every one should get .to live there dream and this product  is great i think :) :)
5.0	Daughter loves it. Very nice.
1.0	The car showed in the picture is not the one delivered. My son wanted the Chick and got Mario Andreti.
5.0	It was fun to see my dogs chase the weasel.  Good buy.
5.0	It's amazing. My husband loved it when I gave it to him.
5.0	I love my collection of Alice in Wonderland plush. Funko toys are so cute! They look great on my dresser.
5.0	We got the sturdy dome and mailed in for our larva.  the kids are so excited waiting for the day the Lady bugs appear.  So am I.  This is similar  to the butterfly habitat we bought a few years ago.  Try that one too!! Mail the voucher in for the larva at a time when it will be warm enough to release the beautiful butterflies it produced. Make sure weather will be warm enough to release the Lady bugs too.<br />Fun , exciting and educational gift.<br />I just ordered one each of the Lady bug and Butterfly ones to give my grandson for his birthday.
5.0	My grandson's favorite car is the Mustang. I was so delighted to see this great model available so I picked it up right away. I wasn't sure if I could put it together or not, but had no problems. Extremely fast shipping!!! Will update after I give this to my Grandson for his birthday.
5.0	is as advertised fast shipping great product I would highly recommend this seller
1.0	Actually the 1 star is for the seller, the product is 5 star classic.  I got this a year or two ago for about $10 and now someone bought them all up to sell for $100?  People please don't encourage this on the internet- make these people get a real job for a living...
5.0	Great collectors item for a fan of The Walking Dead.
5.0	I got this board yesterday and i LOVE it! Its so much fun to ride around and kind of unusual. Its a little hard to get used to at first but once ur used to it its great fun!!!
1.0	Item arrived dirty and in a broken box. Item I received is completely different that what is pictured....item I received contained junk beads....GROSS! Very disappointed!
5.0	This figurine is absolutely beautifully done. The detailing in both the unicorn and the elf are immaculate and these durable toys will last for years to come entertaining all of my daughters. I can always buy Schleich figurines were confidence as they do not produce anything except top quality items. I'm tempted to start in with the dragons if I can get my girls into them. First we need to completely our collection of the Bayala figures to round out our unicorn and elf fantasy land.
5.0	This was an awesome Lego set for an awesome price. The shipping was fast and easy. Highly recommend this set for someone who loves Legos and Star Wars.
5.0	I was looking for slash rims in silver and found these which have been great and very durable.
1.0	The Plastic pieces broke off within 10 minutes. Will have to buy one that does not break as easily. Save your money.
5.0	My nephew loved the Mickey Mouse piggy bank. Now he has some fun place to put his money and he loves Mickey.
1.0	It sucked the battery was dead so was gutted, I forget to check it, gave it as a present - what a let down :(
5.0	Looked everywhere for Red Minnie Mouse decorations, so excited to find them for my baby's birthday. :)
5.0	Really like the product.
5.0	very sturdy and and easy installation.
5.0	Super cute play set for in the bath tub. It is simply packaged which I love! There was more effort put into the toy which is excellent in my opinion as kids typically discard the wrapping and focus on the toy anyway. I can't wait to light up a little boy's face with this this christmas!
5.0	My son is an avid RC car enthusiast.....and needs replacement parts frequently.  They always arrive quickly and are a quick fix for whatever problem you have.
1.0	We purchased this playard because we heard good things about it and liked the style.  My husband didn't like the other frilly playards.  He said this was more manly.  Well, it takes 4 men to set it up and a take it down.  It took 4 very capable adults nearly an hour to set it up and just as long to break it down.  Inevitably we would get 3 of the 4 sides up and the last one just would not lock. This is not fun after a long trip when all you want to do is put the babies down so you can sleep.  I was afraid we weren't going to get it set up at all and my twins would have nowhere to sleep.  <br />It was even more difficult to collapse.Getting the sides to release was nearly an impossible task.  The buttons are impossible to push in. <br />I do like the the full bassinet.  My 3 month olds fit in together and are very comfortable sleeping in it.  The changing tray is also a bonus.  I haven't used it outside or as a play pen yet.   <br />All in all I am pretty disappointed.  Although my husband won't admit it, I think he would agree.  Its just too problematic.
5.0	I gave it as a gift for Christmas she lived everything about this thank you!
5.0	This is a really easy project to put together with great results. Took me three hours to assemble the house completely. The house is sturdy and looks good with prepasted floors and walls. The scale is nice and fits miniature dolls and furniture perfectly. The furniture must be purchased separately. Much better than unfinished dollhouse kits which require putting the shingles on one at a time and painting!!
5.0	I have the other monsters who go to this guy, although he is really tough to summon him. When you get him on the field, you are surely promised victory.
5.0	My daughter and son love the itty bitty boo. It is for my daughter but my son needs his own. My daughter takes him everywhere. She sleeps with him too. It is the most adorable little toy ever.
5.0	This toys beside being so small that you can take them anywhere they are very educational and great for entertaining babies
5.0	Bought for an 80s themed party.
5.0	It's a very nice custom.<br />The size fit very well. I was worried to buy it after a read some reviews,but it is worth it. the price is fair too.<br />The glove a little short but it fit my son hands. The jumpsuit is not thick and so thin it's fine for a custom. My son wear it on top of under cloth.
5.0	Great Card, saved the day on a number of occasions!
1.0	We ordered this about five weeks ago but had not used it till this Saturday.  We put it in a friend's pool and within 25 minutes it had deflated.  It's fortunate that we weren't a float trip.  We would have had to walk back carrying a deflated tube.  We did inflate it again and look for the leak with no success.  Amazon has a 30 day return policy and the last day to return this was Sunday July 26th.  If it hadn't leaked I would have given it a much higher rating.  In other respects it appears to be well made and functional.
5.0	arrived earlier than expected and is adorable!! it is as pictured and came in great condition, my daughter loves toothless and this will be the perfect gift for her..
5.0	This is a great tunnel - has several sounds it makes - adds a special touch to my grandson's train set!
5.0	This baby chick puppet is a precious ball of fluff! Just what we were looking for, and the kids loved it!
5.0	Settlers of Catan is an EXCELLENT board game! It's an adventure. It's interactive. It makes you use your brain. It's fun- even addictive!
5.0	He got a train table from Santa and this was the perfect accessory.  He runs his trains with his hat and whistle yelling &#34;all aboard!  Choo choo!&#34;  Very well constructed and the whistle isn't horribly loud.
5.0	&#34;Noise cricket&#34;
5.0	Very detailed and beautiful house , my daughter loves it.thanks amazon for the great price
5.0	I am happy with the board.. was expecting the bigger one. but it is the small one.. good for travel..
5.0	My granddaughter loved this; it was one of her Christmas presents last year.
5.0	Great puzzle.  Excellent quality.
5.0	She loves it!!! My 6yr old wears it all the time. She just had a sleepover and all there girls were sharing it running around!
5.0	This small fridge was the perfect size for our NYC apartment.  While putting it together, my husband commented that it was the most nicely constructed toy he had put together for our son.  The ice maker is a HUGE hit.  Our only complaint is that the small wooden piece that holds the ice cubes in is able to be removed.  Our 2 yr old son loves to pull this out, but without it, the cubes do not stay stacked in the door.  We'll likely glue it in place, but I'm not sure why it was made to be removable.  It's a small annoyance in an otherwise fabulous toy.
5.0	This thing was much larger than I thought. My daughter immediatly began playing with it and loves the different doorbell sounds. not too loud either. adorable!
5.0	I bought this for my 10 yr old son for Christmas.  He and all his friends are having a blast with it.  They have been bouncing on it every day since then and it seems to be holding up well!  I would recommend this.
5.0	The puzzle keeper looks great and seems very durable.  It has been a life saver for keeping all of my son's puzzles together.
1.0	Bought this for my grandson for Christmas. When I opened the box the sword was broke in two pieces. Went to have the item replaced and was told they could not replace it. Not very happy especially being a PRIME customer.
5.0	This is the coolest robot! I bought it for my 5 year old who wanted a &#34;real robot&#34;. It met whatever expectations she had. I have a blast playing with this robot with my iPhone!
5.0	Finally a mancala board large enough to hold enough stones with ease. Very nice wood, dosn't look really cheap like the other boards. The pits are large enough to count stones easily, or add more to the game if you want to make it more challenging.
5.0	ilove it very much  Beautiful doll and its size good<br /><br />thank you  for this lovely etims ..<br /><br />My daughter love it
5.0	Nice shopping cart, very sturdy. My grandson loves it. Well worth the price.
5.0	This is something my son enjoys a lo. it is a fun way of learning about balancing and science things
5.0	Fits my daughter great she loves it she can't wait for Halloween
5.0	Well made, worked great for a 7 month old.
5.0	Our twin really love this and at 17months they are able to put them correctly.  The knob make easy for them to hold on to it.
5.0	She likes to play dress up and is just now starting to have friends over to spend the night. This has been a fun project for her and she seems to have enjoyed it very much - Thanks!
5.0	Again I'm saying this is a rare animal model. He is very beautiful and well painted. His features are very well made and show how his face is made.
5.0	So many colors and the built in sharpener is awesome as well. Very portable and easy to keep organized.
5.0	Received this item promptly. It's exactly what I wanted.
5.0	Is nice to find a Barbie that look like real girls.<br />I mean the color of the hair. My niece is in the wedding  stage and I also get her the groom.
5.0	Its just like the description. Soft and cute. He looks nice where I placed him. Sits upright well. If your are looking for a small cute little guy, he is a great deal.
5.0	Grand daughter loved this!  Took some time and reading of directions to put together but it was worth it!  The end result was great!  Fast shipping, excellent product!
5.0	Love him. And hes a bit spooky just like the character.
5.0	My daughter love the plates and work perfect for her Lego friends. She plays hours with them.
5.0	OK, I love these lights!  I have monkeylectric lights, and those, of course, are sort of the top-of-the-line wheel lights. Let's face it, they are expensive, but they are a breeze to install and they work great. BUT, so do these! I think I paid about $8 a wheel (so under $20 with shipping) and it took me about, 10-20 minutes to get these on my spokes. I have a small beach cruiser (see picture) and the lights were a little longer than the tire - meaning at one point I actually went all the way around the circumference of the tire, then ended up doubling up for a few inches. I probably could have been more OCD about putting each light on each spoke but, meh, it looks fine. You don't NEED zip-ties for these to stay put, but I recommend using them, just so things stay in place over time and in a variety of conditions.  These are REALLY nice and BRIGHT and have a few settings, too, which I don't know if the advertisement mentions (they blink, etc.).  I can't believe what a deal these were. I really love them and they are FUNCTIONAL. If you can't spring for Monkeylectric lights (which I have on my other bike), then these are the way to go. :)
5.0	Item as described, excellent communication
5.0	Excelente producto lo recomiendo ampliamente, muy buen material y diseño. I love it I like it and more yes yes
1.0	out of all 30 packs I only got 2 holo card. No ex cards or anything there was different tape and the box was messed with and its stupid that you are such a low life to pull the good packs out after you wiegh them.
5.0	"I've purchased several of these kits from JoAnn's and my kids and their friends have had a blast with them. It's a very basic kit containing several sheets (unfortunatly I can't remember how many and the package doesn't say) of plain plastic sheets measuring 5\\""X8\\"". The price is pretty decent for the amount of fun we've had with them. One side is rough (the side you draw or stamp) your image on, the other side is smooth and is quite glossy after they are shrunk. There are clear instructions with several ideas included in the kit. A few tips I'd like to mention: be very aware when cutting out your image, long thin areas will break off easily so don't cut away too much of the plastic around these areas, but overall these aren't very durable for use for say, a backpack zipper pull. Also be careful when drawing on them w/ markers because the ink will smudge easily and takes a several seconds to dry. Also if you want an area to be white, you'll need to color it white because the plastic is somewhat clear after shinking (ie. the whites of eyes). One final tip, watch them carefully when shrinking them, sometimes when they are curling up they'll stick to themselves and you have to 'unstick' them while still hot, but they can be corrected if done while they are still very hot (be careful not to burn yourself!)"
5.0	Super cute!! Daughter loves them, She wanted a Elf that she could play with so her elf on the shelf brought her these
5.0	My almost 9yo son had a blast wearing this costume. We bought a size medium (8-10) and it fit great, with room to grow. It should be noted my son is just starting to wear a typical boys size 8 in normal clothes. There's a lot of pieces to this costume and it looks very detailed on. The material is very soft which is a requirement from my son. Overall we loved this costume and he had a blast wearing it Halloween night.
5.0	Great gift for my Great-granddaughter
5.0	Very fun and awesome toys, ideal for kids to get into the Marvel world. Very enjoyable. You don't miss it
5.0	I just received and put together my daughters slide, so I can't say much for how it lasts over time but so far it seems like a great slide for $40. It was pretty easy to put together. I used a phillips screw driver and took me about 30mins (would have gone faster had I actually used directions closely). My daughter is 14months and she does well with this slide as long as she has supervision, won't be long and she'll have it down. I would recommend for ages 1-3. I plan on putting this on my deck for the summer. I am happy with my purchase!
5.0	This product worked as expected. I had no allergy issues and the color  lasted all day. It was also easy to remove
1.0	it doesn't fly well it's pretty bad for me i didn't like it
1.0	NOT child friendly and horribly deceptive.<br />Sena Family
5.0	i haven't gotten it, but some of my friends have this cube. i plan on buying it, but it is amazing.
5.0	That's a great present for kids.
5.0	This was a gift for someone. I was very excited to see how large it is in person and it looks like a great product. He plans to use it as a collectible, so I'm sure he won't remove it from the box, but it looks good in the box at least. :)
5.0	Excellent, good quality abacus. Smooth wood finish and the beads slide easily. I'd purchase this item again but I don't think I will need to. It seems indestructible.
5.0	I bought this from another seller but I felt that  I absolutely have to write a review for this figure. The articulation is amazing, the accessories are ballet and there are sweet effects plus it looks badass.  This figma is my absolute favorite. Trust me, it's so worth it.
5.0	We purchased this bike for our 2 1/2 year old as an alternative for a bike with training wheels. It involves more leg work but she's been on it a few times and has gotten the hang of balancing it. And it's super cute and sturdy!
5.0	I love all the Batman POP heroes. They are inexpensive and look awesome all on display together. Definitely a great product.
5.0	I was pleased with these connectors. They seem rather hard to find online, but these shipped quickly and arrived in just a few days. They are well made, with relatively thick, flexible wires that have silicon insulation on them. The connectors hold firmly, but can be teased apart if needed.
5.0	Our family has played this game for years.  We enjoy it very much, we play it so much I need to replace the cards often.
5.0	The magnetic fishing toy and bug catching toys are sweet. Nice for eye hand coordination. Great toys for children's gifts.
5.0	IMPRESSED WITH THE QUALITY AND THE SMOOTH OPERATION, WELL RUGGED BUILT, GREAT PRICE. OTHER THAN TRACK PINS BEING A LITTLE FRAIL THIS A GREAT TRAIN SET
1.0	My daughter likes the pony, but the Dora doll does not sit well on the pony and this is a major source of frustration for my daughter. Had I know that she does not sit on the horse, I would not have bought the toy.
5.0	This was a birthday present for a friend who is crazy about bacon, and she was as thrilled with it as she was surprised!
5.0	Bought this for a friend who was suffering bladder issues, she loved it. It's a fun little item with guaranteed smiles.
5.0	perfect! good price and great shipping!
5.0	We received The Farm and loved it, ordered this straightaway! This set is SO COOL!
5.0	I bought this product for my Grand daughter's Christmas present.<br />I haven't seen it, as i live in Spain. But my Daughter tells me that it looks good. I will know more after Christmas.
5.0	My Granddaughter is going to love this doll she is into the Monster High thing
5.0	The Fisher-Price brand has always had a good name, and this toy lives up to that reputation. It is wonderful for ages 6 months to 3 years.<br /><br />First, the toy and its components are made of durable, bright colored plastic that has no sharp edges and is easy to clean. It is shaped like an old-fashioned cookie jar with a happy face on the front. When the top is pressed, the toy starts to sing, talk, and play music. It has over 25 sign-along songs, musical tunes, and phrases. On the sides of the toy are holes for shaped and colorful blocks. The shapes are circle, square, heart, and triangle - each a different color with different designs. As the child puts a shape into the correct hole, the toy announces the name of the shape for the child. There is also a large hole in the center front, and if the child places a shape block in this area, the toy also responds.<br /><br />Overall, when used alone by a child, this toy will give feedback and responses that will help the child with self-play and independent learning. When used under supervision, the learning is improved through adult confirmation of shapes, colors, and singing of songs.<br /><br />The toy requires three AA batteries, and comes with some already installed. There is no on-off switch; however, the toy stops its musical or verbal interactions within a few seconds after usage is stopped.<br /><br /> Overall, this is an excellent toy for young and pre-school age children.
5.0	Got this for my Granddaughter & we have had a ball w/ this game!!!  It's quick, easy & fun...who could ask for anything more!!!  We've even made up our own games using the cards.  One of which is the ESP game.  Trying to guess the shape, color or number of the items on the card the other is looking at.  Blink is a game u can play when u have a limited amount of time...but still have fun & enjoy ur time 2gether!  We've often played a quick game when we knew Mommy was on the way to pick up my Granddaughter .  I would definitely recommend this game to others... fun for young & old alike!
5.0	My granddaughter Chloe loves to imagine and create. This fashion sketch portfolio was a great outlet for her creativity.
5.0	This is an awesome set. I used parts of it on top of a cake for my 4 year old birthday, and decorated with the rest. When the party was over, these monster fire trucks were the very first thing he wanted me to take down so he could play with them. They've been a hit ever since. I will mention that one of the doors that open on the firehouse building front has since broken off, but my son is rough with toys. It could even have been my 13 month old daughter who accidentally broke it, but I still think this set is awesome. I might even buy another one to have more monster fire trucks for my son:) Definitely recommend! Comes with a plastic fire station building 'front' that includes double doors and a garage door that both open, 6 monster fire trucks, and a handful of red plastic firemen figurines, plus a couple hazard blockade-type pieces and I think a fire hydrant piece as well. Also comes with a plastic play mat (this is the only piece we haven't really used, but that's just us.) Great for imaginative play!
5.0	My 3 year old granddaughter loves this toy.  After some years the first one quit working and I ordered a new one.  When it arrived only one dancer danced.  After communicating with the company by email, they sent a new one that works just fine.  The company was very easy to work with and did a good job replacing the defective product.
5.0	I'm using these as part of my mardi gras throws.  They are the perfect size and weight for party favors or giveaways.  Good quality.
5.0	Item delivered on time, was as described
5.0	If your child is a fan of Tayo, he/she will love this toy! Great addition to our collection!
5.0	Small but perfect for a small goodie bag. The kids loved playing with them at the party. I would recommend them to everyone.
5.0	love the new series, my granddaughter will love them too!
5.0	Very Happy With Purchase, My Little One Loves It!! Exactly As Described!!
5.0	got a duplicate gift had to return
5.0	It doesn't take a lot to be able to play this game, and yet it is great fun. My son in-law's family has been playing it for years, once we played it we had to have the game, no limit to how many people can play, and your not out until the game is over.
5.0	Granddaughter loved it!
5.0	Super fun and Color-----
5.0	This set of playdoh is great for group activities or just having around for one creative child.  It offers a variety of colors which is always nice for children who want to take the time to sculpt something multi-colored and complex.  You just can't beat playdoh for fun!  These also make a great idea for children's parties.  Give all the kids a container and let them go to town!
5.0	My daughter keeps her My Little Ponies in this.  She probably has 30 of them in there with some accessories.  It also comes with a couple cheap little horses.  She doesnt really play with it unzipped but its a good carrying case.  We take it with us when we travel.
1.0	Son wanted it but hardly plays with it. He loves the other Octonaut Toys but not this one.
5.0	I absolutely love these crayons the write so good and the colors r great
5.0	This is so cute, and great quality. Pleasantly surprised!
5.0	I was looking for this cat everywhere!  My daughter wanted the SAME cat as her older sister.  So yes, this is perfect.  It is very durable, because the original is still going and it is over 7 years old.
5.0	The most fun raunchy no holds barred game I've ever played.  Not for the taint of heart.  Rated R.
5.0	great item and fast service. would do business with this comp anytime. car worked great and kids are so happy
5.0	It arrived on time, well packaged, and as described. Two of the were extremely curved, about half were the shiny black and the other half were the plain looking rock ones. It was a good mix and they look nice.
5.0	"My friend's grandson is 5 years old. I bought him one Lightning McQueen Puzzle Mat for his birthday & oh my!  You would have thought I had bought him his very own baseball stadium! He absolutely loves his mat & now refuses to sleep in his bed... he sleeps on his \\""ligtnen\\"" every night!  His mom bought one for his sister & now that they have pieces of two puzzles to play with. They play for hours on end, before falling asleep on their mats. This item keeps the children occupied - in that sense, the adults love it, too! The childrens' description of the product: \\""AWESOME\\""!!"
5.0	Prays in english and spanish and it's so soft! My daughter loves it!
5.0	This was also a gift given to my niece.  This doll is awesome.  She repeats everything you say.  My niece is going crazy with this doll.  All her friends wants to know where she got it from, so there mommy can purchase it.  Of course I inform them to get it from Amazon.com.  You guys are the greatest.
1.0	Made very cheaply. Styrofoam fairy. Looks like it could break very easily
1.0	I purchase this as a gift for an older friend who love word search, she can not see the screen no matter what she does it is to hard to see...I am returning it!
5.0	The teeth work great! I didn't use the make-up.
5.0	grand niece loves it  plus you can get new books that she can pick out. make sure you keep up with the pen
5.0	My Grandson Thought It Was The Greatest Tractor Ever . Thank You  For Doing What You promised , It's hard To Find A Great Company like This one Any More .
5.0	Excellent quality and really nice door that won't slam shut! I love this and will be going back to purchase other items that match. The assembly was easy and quick.
5.0	My almost 4-year old son loves this puzzle and the pieces are very handy. Thick card board, nicely cut without sharp edges at all! So perfect for little hands. He always starts with the T-rex of course and finishes it in about 20 minutes. It has the colors and motives nicely spread out which makes it logic to put together compared so other puzzles where 2/3 is blue. I definitely recommend this puzzle!
5.0	This was so easy to put together and it is very good quality, very sturdy.  The pillow is really not a pillow, just a flat piece of fabric but by taking it apart and adding some &#34;stuffing&#34; it is fine.
5.0	I did a lot of searching for the right  basketball hoop for my above ground pool. I'm glad I chose this one. It comes with basketball and volleyball set ups, including the balls, and needles.  I didn't want to drill holes in my pool siding, so I mounted it to a  board and clamped it to the pool, it's easier to remove for weather, or when I shut it down for the winter.
1.0	Bill Was very worn and wrinkled...very disappointed
5.0	really pretty marbles.
5.0	This looks like a great toy for my 2 1/2 year-old grandson who loves both Toy Story and Mr. potato Head. With all the interchangeable parts he should have lots of fun with this.
5.0	I ordered these for goodie bags for my grandsons  year old birthday party. They were a huge hit! Even the bigger kids loved them! They are so adorable!
5.0	You get both bears. They were in great condition .
5.0	Great product delivered on time and description.  Thank you!
5.0	This was the best costume! Great quality! My son looked very handsome in it, and I was so proud.
5.0	I bought this and another spinner for a gift and it was well received! Shipped quickly and item is just as described and pictured!
5.0	These games are so fun and engaging.  My kids ages 2-8 love playing with these. This one is a bit hard for the 6 year old but he still does ok with it.
5.0	The balloons were bigger than I thought! Kids loved them!
5.0	"This toy(pokemon)came from the game:\\""Pokemon XD Gale of Darkness\\"".this toy is perfect to add to your colection!"
5.0	Except for when it sings. She doesn't mind the galloping and neighing but is afraid of it when it sings.
5.0	I am a big fan of Lovecraft. I enjoy his work, and feel sympathy for him as I read. He was dealt a rough hand in life, and I think it really shows in his work. Melancholy, sometimes depressing, with little hope or cheer; but exciting and thoughtful, as well. I buy some of the merchandise (games, plush, etc.), but sometimes feel that the spirit of his work gets lost. I do not feel that this is the really the case with this Fluxx game though.<br /><br />As with all Fluxx games, the rules constantly change. You may be doing great then BAM! You're way behind everyone else. There is really no strategy, mainly just luck and trying your best. The cards are different in this version, darker of course. One card I got made everyone tell a fear they had, for example. It's pretty fun, and the game can last just a few minutes (seriously, we had a three player game once that ended in about 2 minutes), or it can go on for quite awhile (well over an hour). I think it's fun in any size group, and the price amazon has it for is really good. I wouldn't recommend this for smaller children, as there is reading, they might not enjoy the artwork, and depending on the length of the game they get bored. Great for Lovecraft fans though!
5.0	Perfect Christmas gift for granddaughter after having gone to a performance of the Nutcracker for the first time.
5.0	Love this all in 1 toy which gives a child a variety of experiences.  Nice big chuncky buttons for their little hands, colorful, and robust.  It is the perfect height and very stable.  This is better than a big saucer because they learn to stand and balance with this device.  My child spent several years playing with this toy as it grows with them as they discover how to actually make it work versus just hitting it e.g. making music or creating  story with the book.  Great gift for a new parent.
5.0	These chopsticks are great.  They look good and are functional.  I can't wait for the ones that light up to become available.
5.0	This is a very fast shipping company!!!!!!! I donate stuff each year to the school my kids attend & I can say I am very happy with everything!!!!!!!
5.0	as described, strong blades, quick shipping, great contact, and I would buy from these folks again. they don't fit on handles very well. you need to force them on, and it's easy to cut yourself.
1.0	Received headband that does not look like the picture. Not as nice as the picture either.
5.0	Strong! Used it for my son's pirate ship for a sail. It is heavy duty and holds up in Texas storms.
5.0	Everything came in great and was packed good
5.0	This is my 9 year old's second Click-A-Brick set. The first set was Feather Friends which she loved!! When the Animal Kingdom set came in the mail she was jumping up and down. She could not wait to start building. She already has her eyes on the many other fun sets available. I asked my daughter why she likes Click-A-Brick so much she said, &#34;My two most favorite things are building stuff and playing with animals. These building sets let me do both of those things at the same time.&#34; Then, like most kiddos, she said, &#34;Mom I have to have all of the sets.&#34; I guess you could say that my daughter is hooked on Click-A-Brick.<br /><br />http://homeschoolingwith.blogspot.com/2015/08/click-brick-animal-kingdom.html
5.0	We have been using batch color change tablets for a while now for my three year old. He loves these in particular and I am all for it. The colors are very vibrant in the water. The tablets come in two sizes and he is learning to mix his colors and create different shades using different combos. The price makes me very happy. We have used the Alex and the Crayola brand, both are significantly more expensive and not as good as the Color My Bath Color Changing Bath Tablets.
5.0	There is nothing bad I can say about Green Toys!  Every product is worth it.  They survive bumps, throws, and everything in between.  My son is 3.5 and still enjoys playing with this.  With this helicopter he liked the propellers.  He thought it had nice color too.
5.0	First the good.  My girls are enthralled with Frozen and anything related.  This is no exception. The characters that come with it are nice.<br /><br />The bad.  This is cheaply made and falls apart very easily. The quality is very similar to the Brave playset we also have.<br /><br />The kids really like it, but I am constantly having to put the doors back on.
5.0	This has been a very fun toy for my young daughter. We got it for her when she was just over one year old, and she is now four. The recommended age for this item is spot-on: 12 months is about the youngest I can imagine a child being able to use this. It is a pretty small and compact little car compared to other Power Wheels vehicles. It assembled in about 45 minutes (by one person), and came with clear instructions. The decals come on a separate sheet so if you didn't want to use all the hearts and character-themed stickers you don't need to. It has held up very well to three years of wear. This comes with the battery and charger, which is all you should need to keep this running well.<br /><br />A few things to be aware of - this is one of the smaller Power Wheels; it only seats one child and you'll probably be ready to upgrade to a larger ride-on when they are four, if not before. Also, as this is aimed a pretty young set, it moves slowly (I believe the max speed is 2 or 2.5 mph). This lack of power means it really only operates well on pavement or packed gravel, not on grass.
5.0	We haven't opened these yet (stocking stuffers) but we've bought them and others like them before. To be clear, you're buying one figure in a little package. The photo is a little misleading - looks like you get a bunch. But you get just one. They're inexpensive and fun because they are a surprise. You don't know what you're getting until you open it. In my experience, they're somewhat cheaply made, but they only cost a couple of dollars and the fun my kids have with them makes them worth the money. If I discover anything new about these after they're opened, I'll add to this!
1.0	We purchased this item 2 times.  The first time, it did not lift off the ground but would flip over.  We returned it.  After a month, my son really wanted this item so we ordered it again.  The same thing happened.
5.0	These are great. My 2 year old loves them and it helps distract her a little while I'm cooking!
5.0	My brother loved it , since I don't know anything about this cards I can't say anything much. I gave it  5 star for I made my bothers day very nice.
5.0	My grandson loved it!!!!!
5.0	my boots and me. they help me swing from tree to tree,i get real happy with them on my feet i love my boots ya my boots and me..lol so many dora episodes they wont stop..
5.0	The baby loves it, and it's not scary!
1.0	Didn't sling very well and the pig sound  was way off.  I was too embarrassed  to give to  the person I ordered it for.
5.0	This is a fun build for a kid or Porsche fanatic
5.0	I love Jellycat stuffed animals! They are our favorite. They are so soft and the animals have such personality. Plus, they wash well and just get more character with age.
5.0	So much fun!! These are so fun and my daughter (4) loves making new jewlery etc.  love that you just pop them apart and can make something new, unlike regular beads where I have hundreds of necklaces floating around the house!
5.0	Very cute and it made such a big impression. Really cute and sturdy, washed up and can be used again, very glad I found this
5.0	I have dozens of superhero statues and busts, and I can honestly say this is the most beautiful in my collection. Even though this isn't cold cast resin or porcelain (it's hard rubber), the detail in it is amazing. The colors are perfect, and the way his cape flows around him makes it look like you're staring at Batman caught in a moment in time as he is about to deliver a pounding to the Joker or something.<br /><br />To me, I don't see the material of this as a bad thing. The cape is so detailed and flowing that it would be far too fragile if it were anything else. And in honesty, you can't tell what it's made of until you touch it. The statue is heavy and comes with a black stand to mount it on. This definitely looks as good as anything Bowen or Diamond Select has ever put out (if not better). I highly recommend getting one while you can.
5.0	This item was shipped on time and placed under the Christmas tree for my grandson to discover.  He requested this Leggo game and, fortunaatly I could get it for him from Amazon
5.0	Make no doubt about it this is not Monopoly or Risk. Settlers of Catan is a very engaging game and while it is turn based everyone needs to pay attention to every turn and often participates which keeps the attention from wandering.<br /><br />There are all kinds of expansions which add new twists but the basic 4 player game is still my favorite. The expansion to make it playable by 5-6 is nice too but the play definitely changes and requires a different strategy.
5.0	Our grandson loves this toy!
5.0	I ordered this one in blue for my 3 yr old son and the Medium My First Teddy  in Pink for my 4 yr old daughter. My daughter steals her brothers to cuddle since its softer.
5.0	Not made in China! Doesn't roll off the table. Will break with enough force but not soft like cheap crayons. My son likes to scrape crayons with his fingernails and these don't scrape off that easy. Very pleased.
5.0	Kids love it!  It is a very solid product and seems to be very sturdy.
5.0	Got this little guy for my grandson.  He has the attic as his playroom, Camelot, and needed a dragon to protect it.  Found this at walmart, but, expensive, here, not so much.<br /><br />I LOVE the little guys rowr!  My grandson and I laugh and laugh when we push the door bell.  My grandson named the dragon kilgharrah,<br /><br />He loves it as does grandma.
5.0	Product arrived quickly, great quality, no issues what-so-ever!  Will use them again if available over competition.  They are very committed to helping w/ communication.
1.0	like the other person said... you get only one... not all of the ones in the picture... and...it's random... you don't get to pick... and it seems that all the other ones are hard to find... so they send you the same one that's at walmart ... which you can get for 6.99 ... so very over priced for the one you can get... you can't get snow white or belle anywhere... this person needs to read these reviews and change the title or picture to ... 1 Random Doll
5.0	These have actually held up.  I got them as a gag gift for my wine drinking wife, and they still work!!!!
5.0	A wonderful gift for a new baby.  Soft, sweet and did I mention soft?  Just the thing to become a friend for a long time.
1.0	I bought these last Christmas for my son since he loves to pretend talk on phones.   This looked like such a great toy, but I have to agree with the other reviewers--what a bust!  I don't think these EVER worked right. This was so suprising, with the great track record Little Tikes has...I love most of their products.  [...]
5.0	Pretty much kinda prolly LOVE this guy!!<br />L is my favorite anime character by far, and I finally broke down and bought his adorable nendoroid. I made sure I bought the one than said Good Smile in the description because I was terrified that I'd wind up with a bootleg. Dx I purchased from the TLS Hobbies storefront, and I'm so glad that I did :D
5.0	I have had this heli since Christmas 2013. Took about two weeks of flying a few minutes a day, and then it 'clicked'. And once that happens, it becomes a fantastic flying machine. This little thing is incredible.  There is no comparison to the Syma 107G type birds. Although the Syma is a great beginner chopper, this one is the next step up. Control response is really good, there is plenty of power for how small it is. Once you get comfortable flying it, you can fly in up to about 5 mph winds. Not sustained winds, mind you. If you do an arcing dive left or right, you can take on bigger winds. With the 2.5 ghz radio, range seems to be over 300 feet. Any more and you wouldn't even be able to see it, let alone fly it. I lose sight of its direction of travel at about 200 feet. When you hit mode two it changes the rates, it becomes about twice as sensitive on the controls. It completely changes the bird! Its like having an entirely new bird, once you are ready to move up, its awesome. I fly mode two indoors to give me quicker responses etc. But flying it is so much fun, the gyros help immensely to keep it stable automatically.<br />Batteries: You might get five minutes flying time from the supplied 120 mah batteries. One of mine arrived a dud. But no worries I ordered the 5 pack of 200 mah batts. Much longer flight times. The design of the batteries is really bad, however. If you dont put a piece of scotch tape to hold it in, sometimes the battery will fall out during flight. The charger is really cheap, and sometimes will not charge a battery because it still registers as 'full', when its not. You have to run that battery all the way down in the chopper, and then the charger will recognize it. Also, somewhere I read that you can only charge the batteries from the charger twice before you have to replace them. I bought a usb port that plugs into the ac outlet, for three dollars, and charge them with that.<br />I have crashed this heli from over a hundred feet onto pavement, and it didnt hurt it at all. Crashed a hundred times or more. Flies the same as it did when new. Also, ordered another board for ten bucks, am going to use the servos etc for another indoor flyer. For ten bucks you get a board that has two servos built in, is 2.4 ghz, has a speed controller for motor etc. Overall fantastic helicopter, thanks!
5.0	We love this game. It is fun for the whole family. Children ages 15, 11, 7 & 4. The 4 year old teams up with me normally. It is a two to four player game. A very entertaining game even for adults. It is a pretty level playing field. Some planning does give you an advatage but since the maze changes with every players turn you never know what it will look like on your turn. Easy to follow directions. It gets played often in our home.
5.0	I purchased this for my 5 year old God son and he absolutely loves it! It goes great with his imaginext castle.
5.0	Durable, and grandchild loved them.
5.0	Couldn't find our Aggravation game after our move and was disappointed that not even Toys R Us carried it anymore. So glad to find this old family favorite on Amazon!
5.0	Bought for daughter,She loves it,hangs on nightstand,stays put.
1.0	Bought this a long time ago(more then a year ago) and I never received it nor got any notice about it.
5.0	Tamiya quality is first rate, classic kit for the experienced model builder.  I am using them as Bolt Action squad members and they look great on the tabletop.  Wish there were more 1/48 scale options available.
1.0	Bought 4 of these in NYC after seeing the demonstration. Terrible product. We actually went back to return them and the sales clerk couldn't figure out how to get it to work either.
1.0	Did not work from the first time it was taken out of the box.  Horrible waste of money.  Don't buy.
5.0	This is a very interesting Barbie doll. Her hair in front is both thickly straightened in front (as with mud decoration) and then loose in back.  She wears a canvas type of top and then a loin cloth of woven material (which adds to the quality of this doll that it isn't just a painted on pattern on the fabric).  The loincloth flap is held in place by an intricate weaving of leather like material.  She has very detailed tattoos on her arms and legs and real feathers in her head dress.  Finishing the doll are 3 strands of different types of beads.<br /><br />Note that her legs don't bend - she's a beautiful display but not a play doll.  But in all, beautiful quality and originality for the price.  Highly recommended.
5.0	Great for the NY puzzler in your life..great detail.
5.0	Really great alternative stands for 6&#34; figures: Marvel Legends, DC Universe or Neca. I really like the clear acrylic and can be used to to display with any bookcase or shelf. Each box comes with 3 of everything! Depending on the size of the action figure, I was able to display 2 Marvel Legends figures on one base. I love these over the default pegged stands. And nowadays stands are no longer included with figures!!! These Bandai stands allow you to pose your figure in dynamic action shots. The only slight issue I can think of sharing is the glossy base tends to make the feet of the figures slide over time. So make sure you secure the waistline good otherwise they can move if your shelf/bookcase is bumped. OVERALL: I love these stands and plan on purchasing more! But now looking for a good flight stand :) The prices online have been really expensive. These stands are retail: $16.99
5.0	I bought this for my grandsons for Christmas.  They were very pleased with this and play with it all the time.
5.0	Great quality,  I bought it for my crush because she loves turtles. She was thrilled by this and I highly recommend it.
5.0	My son loves this toy. It took him a little while to get the hang of it. First we showed him how. Then he started doing it, but with the crank on the top, now does it right side up. Its great for getting them to grasp at the small handle, and to have patience to keep cranking until the horse pops out.
5.0	Fit right in no probs and back in business,also at fair price but in future buying metal gears
5.0	I recommend this product for children and their parents looking for a game to help with education of geography of the United States.
5.0	The train works great and it was easy to put together. All the pieces were there and it connected right to the exsisting train set we already had.
5.0	I've looked at this puzzle so many times and just couldn't get what the deal was. How could it be so difficult? Until I finally broke down and purchased it and then I got it.<br /><br />Each row has a variety of starting heights and each color has a variety of heights. So the object is to find the right combination of colored pegs so that there are no duplicate colors in any row. Seems simple enough until you realize that the possible combinations are almost endless. We've tried it from a number of angles, one color at a time, one row at a time, random placement with exchanges... and the best we've reached so far is 32 right out of 36 (two duplicate colors in two rows - maybe that makes it 34 right.) My 7 year old has enjoyed working on it as has my 12 year old. I think it appeals to anyone with a bit of an analytical mind (which is why my husband doesn't have a fingerprint on it anywhere.)<br /><br />The best part is that although the goal is to get them all in the right place, it is fun just trying and seeing how close you can get.
1.0	Dead on arrival. Does not work with the batteries included or a new set. Going in the trash.
5.0	I had one as a kid and I bought one for my son and his X-Wing fighter
5.0	Art , Terry and Terri are made well. They are brightly colored. They hold up well to ruff play. Yea !
5.0	"I bought this for my daughter's first birthday. When she first attempted to \\""ride\\"" the zebra, I was worried that there was a fall waiting to happen. But she picked up pretty quickly, the idea of getting on and off the zebra. I really think this has helped her coordination with respect climbing onto and over things. This toy only keeps her attention for a few minutes at a time, but it is a lot of fun."
5.0	Great series on TMNT Classics! I'm VERY happy they came out with a version of these guys from the original 1990 movie!<br />The paint, sculpt & packaging, along with it's artwork are top notch! Highly recommended! A+
5.0	"We bought this for our daughter for Christmas and she was so excited, she couldn't contain herself.  It's the largest Barbie House I have ever seen and has lots of neat features.  My husband put it together and didn't seem to complain too much but it was well worth the time.  My daughter has spent hours with it playing \\""house\\"" with her Barbies.  I wish they had one of these when I was a little kid!  Great product, would highly recomment."
5.0	A gift for a friend and she loves this game.  It's for adults and a lot of fun.
5.0	Bought these to play a dart board game at my wedding.  Wedding is still to happen, but played a round with friends to try them out last week, and they are great.  Fly true, sharp tips, very happy with my purchase.
5.0	Fits the Ultra perfect.  The Ultra with the shockproof also fits in the zippered case that I purchased.  All buttons, stylus etc are accessible. My son (4 yrs) is able to turn on/off and adjust volume through the shockproof case.  The case feels very durable with thick corners.  I found a youtube video that compares this with the gel case.  The gel case seems very light.  In the video, as the person is handling the gel case, I could see his hand through the gel case.  Personally, I would also recommend a screen protector.  The pet app has a pet washing game.  One of the tasks is to &#34;scrub&#34; back and forth.  The screen protector has marks from my son &#34;scrubbing&#34; back and forth.  I'm glad the one I purchased came with 3 screen protectors.  I purchased on Amazon, here is a link  https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00OBZDWC8/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_0<br />It's (3 Pack) Dmax Armor - Leapfrog LeapPad Ultra 7&#34;
5.0	These are great for anyone. My niece and I do them together, and we both have lots of fun! I also doodle on them when watching movies or TV, they are great for just expressing myself when I feel like I need to draw but don't want to pull out papers and pens and pencils and erasers and such.
5.0	Perfect for our 13 month old to practice fine motor skills and have fun.
5.0	Purchased for my niece and 2 nephews for Christmas13. My niece had the original leap pad and loved it.<br /><br />They all three love the new ultra leap pad
5.0	My daughter is 5 months and at first she only needed diapers, wipes, and a bottle, so my husband and I purchased a backpack diaperbag... while it worked for a little while, we found we needed something more convenient for storing food, toys, my things, etc. and I came across this bag.  Now, I'm a young mom so I wanted something more stylish and that my husband wouldn't cringe at the fact of carrying it around sometimes, we just fell in love with this one! It has a lot of space, many convenient pockets and holders, and everything is within reach... which is what the backpack lacked, I had to pull everything out to get the stuff on the bottom!  I also love the fact that it can just hang over the handle of my stroller or shopping cart!  Plus, it doesn't even look like a diaperbag, so I just take it with me even when my daughter stays at home with her daddy!  I completely reccomend this bag to every mother AND father looking for a great diaperbag!!
5.0	Low price but very high quality!...was adorable!...made a great gift!...arrived early and in perfect condition!
5.0	My grandson is a huge star wars fan and this was the perfect gift for his birthday. No problems so far.
5.0	A lot of fun was bigger then I thought. It took me 2 days to build and I have it on display with other love it
5.0	Comes with everything you need to play including helpful instructions which are nice to have as a reference. Great value.
5.0	I absolutely love it, it looks just like the picture in every way possible and I can't stop looking at it :3<br /><br />If you're thinking about getting it, GET IT and stop thinking about it X3
5.0	The puzzle was a gift sent directly to my great nephew. I saw them at a local store for more money. Nice heavy, good quality puzzle pieces. The box shape is clever. My gift was a hit!
5.0	This is a toy that my grandson goes to over and over. I didn't realize it was as big as it was but he loves it.
5.0	This is an excellent toy, my grandson loves it. It arrived earlier than promised and was well packaged and in perfect condition. The set is very sturdy and should last for years.
5.0	Love this game, this model.  Would not have been happy with Super Big Boggle from what I read, by comparison.  Delivery was only two days later vs. the 1- 2 weeks I was quoted.
5.0	First of all, the seller was extremely nice and curteous.  Checked my product for defects prior to shipping and when thry found a small defect, offered to substitute with a higher priced item (same thing, but with colored drawers).  Shipped very quickly and in perfect condition!<br /><br />I use this unit to store a Barbie Castle.  It's perfect height for my 5 year old and we store all barbies and accessories in the bins below.  The bins are perfect size to fit many things, including arts and crafts, girls' accessories, small and medium toys as well as clothing items (socks, underwear, hats, etc).<br /><br />I highly recommend this unit and the seller I bought from (Gate way baby)! Here's their profile: &lt;...>
5.0	My 9 year old daughter absolutely loves this!!  The pack comes with many blank faces that you can put make-up on.  The possibilities are endless.  We buy this as gifts for birthdays.  It is great for any girl between 6-15 years old.  5 Stars!!
5.0	I was impressed with the durability of this product. It's not flimsy like many of them. Also, it plugs in instead of requiring batteries. Great buy!
5.0	These sculpting tools all come in handy when I need to shape modeling putty IE; Green Stuff.  Three more words.
5.0	Bzzagent helped me to get to try this game for free and my entire family had a great time playing this game. I have a 14 yr old boy and a 9 yr old girl and this game is good for all ages and allows for competition. Set up is easy and the rules are simple. The balls can be a bit to keep up with at first and more pattern cards would enhance the fun. However, my family had a great time playing this game several times over the last week. Easy to learn and clean up is minimal which is always a bonus for me.
5.0	We bought this for our 9 year old son for Christmas.  I can easily say it is his favorite gift!  And it has been enjoyed by the whole family as well.  I even get into it!  Would definitely purchase again.
5.0	Awesome bear for the price! My nephew loved it!!
5.0	It's so cool sticks on wall easily and u can remove easy so cool u should totally buy this item
5.0	These stencils are wonderful! It would be nice to have something to hold them in place while doing it but that is with every stencil! Great item, so well made and as always Melissa and Doug products don't disappoint! Love them and affordable! Which is a huge bonus to a good product! Shipping was fast and service great! Will buy again!
5.0	Very pretty and unique Elsa dress.. it held up nicely while my little one was running around the neighborhood on Halloween! My daughter is a size 4 in Gap this dress fit her well.snug fit with bodysuit underneath. Love it
5.0	exactly as described.Received quickly, and made my son the happiest. Highly reccommend ordering from you and will be ordering from you soon!!!
5.0	My 2 yr old is now on his second set. Loves these blocks, plays with them all the time.   Because they are cardboard, they start showing wear and tear fairly quickly, but the kiddos don't mind.
5.0	This bear was a bonus for my order with amazon.  My grandkids love it.  It looks to be well made and durable (for all the hugs).
1.0	Unfortunately, the color doesn't match the description or the image. The bear is pink and the color is nowhere close to the description.
5.0	We purchased for our daughter since she wasn't a fan of us holding her hands while she was toddling.  This makes her very independent.  We also like that she can sit and move or walk behind the racer.  She loves the little compartment behind the seat for holding her toys.
5.0	Awesome my daughter has had hers for over a year now
5.0	My daughter loves it thank you
5.0	We love it . Great service
5.0	My 5 year old loves playing on her laptop. There are lots of games with a decent color screen that is an upgrade from our oldest daughtes first toy laptop. It was delivered on time and in good condition.
5.0	All three of my kids from the 7 yr old to the baby want to play with this toy! All these Octonauts toys are durable and easy for kids of all ages to play with. While the Gup-X isn't a bath toy it is like having 3 toys in one since it has an Octo-ski and the front comes off to turn into another vehicle. We've had it over a month now and it is solid and sturdy. Whom ever is in charge of selling Octonauts toys need to get it that WE WANT MORE! More movies too.
5.0	Our 10-year-old granddaughter loved it for xmas. She still uses it a lot whenever she visits. What more can I say?
5.0	It is great!!  Just exactly what I was looking for as the other memory games for children are cartoons and<br />these are real photos.
5.0	"This Nemo set is so much fun !!  Our granddaughter loved it so much we bought the larger set of Nemo movie figurines to add to this set.  They are colorful and fun to play with.  The figurines are large enough that the kids are not tempted to put them in their mouth.  The perfect size to take in a small<br />backpack and play with in the car.  The fish disconnect from the \\""rock\\"" perches."
1.0	The watch worked for one day & died. My son was devastated but the silver lining was that Amazon refunded money immediately
5.0	Purchased along with the other 2 zhu zhu's for the neice and nephew's Christmas toys. The 3 siblings had a lot of fun racing each other across grandma's kitchen floor.
5.0	I ordered three of them for gifts. The were perfect with a nicely hinged cribbage board and metal pegs. The bag's quality was a nice surprise; I had expected that to be cheaply made and planned on making my own but it was made out of sturdy material and large enough for everything to fit into it without a struggle.
5.0	great to. smaller than expected though
5.0	I bought this for my home office and love it. It is very cute and only several pieces to put together. The great thing about this is once my four year old grandson saw it he attached himself to it. Of course it went with him home. When his three older siblings play Star Wars, he always asks to be Darth Vader. Now he can be Darth TATER.
5.0	I bought this costume for my 5 year old for Halloween this year, and overall I'm impressed with it. It feels well made and looks nice. I will say, I ordered the large size (4-6 for little girls) because others were saying the costume ran big and I figured my daughter would  be able to wear this for dress up play beyond Halloween. I kind of wish I would have ordered the next size up. While the 4-6 size fits my daughter ok now I'm thinking it won't be long before it's too tight/short. The fins aren't quite touching the ground and the top was slightly tight through the shoulder area. My daughter just started wearing a size 6 in most brands. So I'd say this costume fits more true to size instead of running big. Either way, my daughter loves this costume, and can't wait until Halloween when the little mermaid gets to show her costume off and receive a bunch of candy!
5.0	"The Kotobukiya Yoda (Spirit of the Force) 2007 which is clear or translucent one has to assemble and place by a Brown tree branch that the wise Jedi Master rests upon.

5.0	Cute for wedding favors!
5.0	Great set, my son really loves the plane and helicopter.  A piece of the fire truck already broke, but my kids 2 1/2 so that was to be expected.
5.0	cute and soft as expected
5.0	The rainbow hue is lovely and makes me happy to watch in action.  The stretchy strings quickly break, though, and waaaaay too short.  I replaced them with a sturdy crafting string that is also clear.  Now they're perfect :p)
5.0	My son loves these! They are the perfect sizes for his little 1.5 year old hands! We use these mostly as sand toys, but he often has a death grip on the digger we leave the park and ends up bringing it inside.
5.0	I've always had Giro helmets and only upgrade because my last one was 4 years old. This is the first sized helmet I've owned and am very happy with the fit and level of comfort.  My only complaint is that when riding sweat tends to accumulate in the front padding and occasionally trickle down into my eyes- no bid deal though.
5.0	love the dollhouse. the assembly is fairly simple and directions are concise. the delivery was perfect. it arrived well within the timeframe stated
5.0	I actually bought this for my friend. Just to be nice. If you or someone else like armadillo's this gift is perfect.
1.0	I would like to give 5 star for the toy. But the toy sent to me was scratches all over in front and look very old. I am definitely not impressed with this seller.
5.0	Our little fireman in training is 2 and he loves fire trucks! He loves his new bed! It is much stronger than I thought it would be. I sit on the side of it with him to tuck him in. He likes to walk on his own to get in bed. We also bought the matching night stand and step stool. At first I was worried about his fingers getting pinched but they are perfect. He sits his drink on his night stand and it got water on the surface. The water wiped off without leaving a mark. Great quality, durable, and fun for my little guy. I feel good about him sleeping in this bed. I highly recommend it!
5.0	I'm reviewing Wits & Wagers Family, a simplified, family-friendly version of Wits & Wagers. My wife and I like the standard edition of Wits & Wagers quite a bit. It is a simple and fun trivia game that you don't really need to know trivia to play. The way this works is that each player (or team of players) has a card, a wet-erase marker and a pile of poker chips. A question is read aloud, to which the answer is a number. Each player or team writes down their guess on their card, and then all the cards are arranged from high to low on a felt play mat. Position in relation to the median bet detemines the odds and the payout for a correct answer. And then everyone bets on what they believe to be the correct answer with their poker chips. Then the answer is read, the correct guesser is given a small payout, and then correct betters are paid out according to the odds. There are seven rounds, and all but the last round have betting limits. Pretty simple, right?<br /><br />The standard version of Wits & Wagers is fairly simple for adults, and, as per the box, can accomodate up to 21 people (assuming seven teams of three, since there are only materials for seven). As with any betting game, it favors those who play the odds and are somewhat savvy to those kinds of systems. It is a great game for adults. We can get non-gamer friends to play this and enjoy it every time. But it isn't the best for kids.<br /><br />Wits & Wagers assumes an understanding of risks versus payouts that most people of age ten and above are likely to have acquired, but not younger kids. Also, when you bet chips and guess wrong, you lose them. In a trivia-based game, kids are already at a bit of a disadvantage for not having the breadth of knowledge an adult does... so losing your cool stuff on top of that can seem mean to the younger ones. Those reasons, as well as the nature of the trivia questions themselves, make the standard version somewhat inaccessible to kids. Enter the family version.<br /><br />Wits & Wagers Family streamlines this. The questions are things children are more likely to have encountered, but still challenging to them and adults. Betting is simplified to using meeples. Each player has a large meeple and a small meeple, and there is no odds track with different payouts. The game plays as above, but you score one point for a correct answer, one point for betting on the correct answer with your small meeple and two for  your big meeple. So you will score 0-4 points in a turn. The score is tallied on a score track, and the game ends when a person gets to fifteen points. Much simpler.<br /><br />My family favors the family version of Wits & Wagers over the standard version. It is far more accessible to children, and we have succcessfully played it three times already with our five year old daughter. She has had a blast, and was able to be competitive. The questions are still challenging, and there will still be a range of answers each question. Quick to learn, quick to play, easy to enjoy. As an owner of 500+ games and a blogger about games (see my profile for link), I give this game the highest possible recommendation. You won't regret having this game in your collection.lines this.

5.0	Awesome!  Perfect for days stuck indoors!  Both 3 year old and 1 year old (the size of a 2 year old) love it climbing, sliding, and hiding under it.<br />I read in reviews that the handles don't stay in, but haven't had any trouble with mine.  Just need to make sure they click in all the way.
5.0	This is one of the greatest things I could have every bought my 8 mo. old. Not sure if he loves it yet, but I do. It's so sweet the way he says my kids name and the songs are very catchy!  We're buying the female one for my nieces for Christmas.
5.0	My four old loves these.  They make bath time so much fun.  the color goes a long way!
5.0	This is a great way to help your children understand the place values of thousands, hundreds, tens, and ones.  It is a great way to breakaway from simple worksheets and let kids create their own problems, randomly.  There is something fundamentally fun about a handful of dice.
5.0	I bought this for my kids. Wow was I amazed by the quality that was put into this. When we opened and used it for the first time. my kids jaws dropped and excitement came across their faces when they saw the first set of bubbles. We played until the sun went down. I have told everyone in a ten mile radius about these bubble wands. Thank you so much we will have plenty of fun with this.
5.0	This is a Christmas present for a dear friend.  She love tea in a china cup and loves puzzles.  At a 1000 pieces this should keep her entertained and loving that afternoon tea!  Arrived speedily and well packaged.
1.0	Don't buy the packs online you could go to a wal mart and buy them for 4 and a few pennies.
5.0	This Zoid is the most detailed zoid I have ever built, not only is it detailed, it is customizable. It is my 35th zoid I've assembled and probably the most awesome. If you add the cp unit 10 (HIGHLY recommended) it will make it look better and stronger. It also has two walking modes battle mode (Godzilla), and pursuit mode (T-Rex).<BR>FUN-This toy is great, and one of my favorites for fun.<BR>EDUCATIONAL-Any zoid could help you in education, it helps on your reading and following instructions, and best of all, you can customize it  and redesign it anyway you like.<BR>DURABLE-This zoid is the most durable zoid I've ever built besides Iron Kong.
5.0	Lots of fun to play with young kids.
5.0	Got these as Christmas gifts for &#34;puzzle nuts.&#34;  They were quite pleased with them, and the kids had a great time trying to find the hidden items.
5.0	My great niece loved to wear this at the Frozen party
5.0	I'm an avid couponer and purchased these for printed coupons and rainchecks. These are the perfect size I need!
1.0	i rate this car very poor. my grandson broke this very easily.it did not hold up at all.  it is now garbage. actually the remote to control the car was crappy. we have the car now but the control is a goner.
5.0	[[ASIN:B003B1TI58 Scrabble Flash Cubes]]  My wife and I play regular scrabble three times a day when she is home. I purchased the Scrabble Flash and found it quite challenging to play by yourself. It's very helpful in figuring words out rapidly.Several of my younger friends 10 to 15 years old also enjoyed it.It is an excellent learning tool for learning and practising spelling.
5.0	Great throw i would recommend it to any one nice to add to the collection and it isnt extremely expensive
5.0	What a great lab coat! My daughter uses it at school for her science section and feels very special wearing it. It is well made.
5.0	My 3yr old got this gift for Christmas and he loves it!  I love it because it's durable for a 3 yr old to drop ans carry around, there are tons of free games on Vtech's website, and it's VERY easy use.  within minutes, my 3yr old had it figured out and was playing with the paint features.  I love the interactive story book apps, and the art apps.  This was a fabulous gift for him and it will last for years!  I do wish it came equipped to be charged instead of having to change the batteries all the time though.
5.0	When you share your life with others, you will always receice - and this is the first game I have come across, where you are garanteed to be celebrated as a winner at the end, too! The cards of the game can also be used separately to start conversations in a party: Just put 2 of them under the plate, and ask the guests to answer one of them. We have tried it!
5.0	This set, Elves and Goblins, was a gift for my eldest son this Christmas.  Around our house, I had a reputation for being the guy to beat, but, once my son pulled out the Elves deck, he BEAT ME FIVE GAMES STRAIGHT!!! He also beat my wife numerous times, and she carries a massive green deck.  The red deck is pretty good, too, but this one is worth it just for the Elves deck.    ***IF YOU BUY ONLY ONE DECK THIS YEAR, MAKE THIS THE ONE!!!***    At first, I thought the deck was unbalanced, but I was just annoyed.  IT IS A FANTASTIC COMBINATION OF CARDS! I've never seen green played like this before: playing cards fast and furious like a red deck and gaining life like a white deck.  Even my old stand-by blue deck could not get anywhere against the Elves.    STRATEGY TIP: BLUE vs. ELVES  ----------------------------  If you are going to take on these Elves, you will need to stop the green player from getting five elves on the field at once (which can allow him/her to bring a 7/7 elemental token into play), and stop him from playing his Wellwisher (which allows him to gain life for every elf in play).  If you like blue, you will want to stack your hand with counter-spell and unsummon type cards, and will want to stay to low-cost creatures.    UPDATE  ------  I tricked out my blue deck with as many unsummon and counter-spell type cards as are legal.  I also made sure I had multiple cards (like Puppeteer) that can tap opponents' creatures.  This helped me even things up a bit.  The ability that allowed me to put an end to the Elves' Wellwisher (tap and gain one life for every elf in play), was the ability to confiscate a permanent.  So, beating the Elves deck with your own deck is definately possible.  In fact, it was a blast tweaking me deck repeatedly until I could face down the Elves on a regular basis.    Black, has also done well against the Elves.    ~AJR
5.0	This is great we used it as a fund raiser for church.  Change for a change.  When we give our offering we drop change in the coke bottle which will be used to funding our handy cap ramp.  We also bought the red coke bottle so one team puts their change in the red bottle and the other team puts their change in the green coke bottle.  Which ever team collects the most the other team has to cook them dinner. It puts the fun in fundraising.
5.0	I love giving these out at the church. With a little ribbon for decoration. They are perfect and fun. thanks.
1.0	This is a complete joke. Pieces of wood and insects. I am a doctor and ended up making slides myself for my daughter. Do NOT buy this please. save your money.
5.0	I think every one of my relatives that my daughter goes to visit has some kind of horse for her to ride/bounce on. She's 2 and loves it!  I know i don't have to compete and I'm not, but I figured why not have one at home?<br /><br />It's important to understand that the horse does not come inflated.  You cannot blow this up manually, you need a pump.<br /><br />We keep an air matress with an electric pump which worked fair with this horse. It didn't achieve the ideal pressure I'd have liked but it was better than nothing. That was until my wife found a hand pump and resolved that little irritant.<br /><br />In general this a nice thick rubber horse.  The instructions says it can safely support up to 100 lbs, although they machine tested it to withstand up to 500 lbs. This gives me thoughts of my whole family sitting on this tiny horse...<br /><br />It is also nice to see that this horse was not made in China, but Italy. Just a random fact some might appreciate.<br /><br />Overall we're very pleased with the purchase. $40 was somewhat pricey but our daughter loves it; so much in fact that she's been dragging it around the house with her.<br /><br />If you can swing the cost, i would suggest picking one up. Just make sure your kid understands that they need to maintain balance as they're bouncing or they'll fly forward, or to either side. My daughter did this 3 times, good thing i was right next to her to catch her.
5.0	[[VIDEOID:233694a510b14c454cb312479737fe80]]There are very few toys that come into my house that will entertain all four of my kids but all of my kids (ages 8, 9, 14 and 16) have sat and played with this Wedgnetix set.  This set is played with every single day by my kids.  My younger three (all boys) love Legos and building so these are right up their alley.<br /><br />This set comes with 16 blocks.  It has 4 red, 4 blue, 4 yellow and 4 green blocks.  The blocks are all the same size around but different lengths.  The red blocks are just under 5 inches long, the blue are just under 4 inches, the yellow are just under 3 inches and the green are just under 2 inches (measuring them all from the longest point to the longest point).  The blocks measure about 3 1/2 inches around.  The magnets are strong and they attach securely.  You can attach them in different direction because of the shape of the ends so you can make 3D or 2D creations.  You can turn them 45, 90 or 180 degrees so that you get a straight line or an angle.<br /><br />The set comes with a book that gives you some ideas on things to make  in both 3D and 2D designs.  My kids have had fun making the creations in the book but also have had a lot of fun making up their own creations. As a parent, I am always a fan of toys that let my kids use their creativity.  I think these blocks are so chunky that they could easily be used by kids who struggle with other connecting blocks.  I think the only thing that could make this set better would be to have more blocks in the set.  My kids are having so much fun with this and I would rate it more than 5 stars if I could.<br /><br />Product provided as a free promotional sample in exchange for my evaluation and my honest, unbiased review.

5.0	We love this clock for our 3 year old son. He has outgrown his naps, but needs to have quiet time in his room each day- he was staying there for 15 mins and then coming down because he was not really good at reading his digital clock. This helps him to see how much longer he has left on his own- it has been a big help!

5.0	my kid took an immediate interest in using the potty as soon as we got this doll. he doesn't seem to tire of pottying with elmo. elmo will say he's thirsty so you have to give him his sippy and he makes gulping sounds to boot. i wish i could say that my kid was potty trained a week later but sadly that's not the case. this was definitely the catalyst though. my cousin bought it for her boy and he is completely potty trained now. guess it's my kid that's defective lol!!!
5.0	Great replica for the person who likes to display collectibles. The sword is very detailed has all the same marks and dings as the cartoon. Also it is quite sturdy they could hold up to kids playing with them, as long as they are not swinging as hard as they can.
5.0	My daughter loves the bands! They are super stretchy and the colors are beautiful! Thanks!
5.0	My grandson loved this cash register.  Came in good shape, in great time.  Has wonderful features and he used it a lot!
5.0	This stuffed Toto is adorable and is a sweet as it looks.  It is soft and cuddly and my grandaughter takes it with her everywhere!
5.0	Great family fun and large enough for the &#34;older&#34; ones to see!
1.0	The item pictured is not the item received.  I received &#34;Millie&#34;  in the correct packaging; however, the Millie I received looks nothing like this train.  This must be a different character that I am not familiar with.  My son picked out this character (probably for the look of the bright colors, etc.).  I hope he is not too disappointed when he receives the actual Millie.
5.0	Excellent quality set,
5.0	Bought it for me 3 yr old niece for a gift and she LOVES it.  She drags it every where.  I highly recommend Pillow pets for any child.  My daughter had 2 the triceratops and the butterfly and loves them both.  she tries to connect them so she can drag them both around.  Great gift for kids!!LOVE LOVE LOVE pillow Pets!!!!
5.0	"Planned a unicorn and dragon party for my daughter's 3rd birthday. These stuffed animals were a hit. I purchased the purple 15\\"" unicorn for the birthday girl and smaller purple unicorns (and red dragons) for her friends. Everyone had fun stuffing the animals and decorating the tee shirts. The kids were so excited to show off their creations!!"
5.0	Really lovely little wooden activity stamps. My little one loves them :-)
1.0	Are you serious?  Hunter green cups, square plates, black napkins,  and just TWO Minecraft stickers doesn't make this a Minecraft party set.  What a rip off.
5.0	This is the second Bug Jug I've purchased (for my two grandsons).  They both love them!
5.0	This piggy bank is absolutely like the picture but prettier. I bought this for my father for Christmas. He was super happy with it, and it goes with his Frankenstien one. They sit on his dresser and match his poster. It is sturdy and if you are a Frankestien fan I suggest you get her and him.
5.0	"I'm somewhat amazed by this \\""puzzle\\"" as I have never been exposed to working on something that is a smooth sphere.<br /><br />Some general thoughts are:<br /><br />That the overall imagery on the surface is rather \\""speckled-looking\\"" (very busy to the eye) and in some cases sort of \\""unclear\\"" (images we usually do not see for zodiac signs), but this effectively makes the whole thing, when completed, take on a rather jewelled effect, which turns out to be really nice. There is a base to hold it steadily from rolling. This is nice, of course!<br /><br />I had a bit of trouble with assembly as the pieces are three-dimensionally curved and become sometimes a little awkward to place. I have some degree of arthritis in my fingers and so I know that this is a part of my difficulty. I am just not sure whether others, with normal joints, would experience this problem or not. Again, the idea of working dimensionally is unfamiliar, too, and this is another factor not normally dealt with.<br /><br />This puzzle is fun, though, and I found it pleasing to work on as it is so very different.<br /><br />I would recommend it to folks that seek something different, new, and challenging. I do not think young children would be able to work this piece and would recommend, perhaps, a regular flat one instead. I would think that someone in their teens and up should be who to recommend it for.<br /><br />Quality-wise, this is a really well made, \\""durable plus\\"", piece that most people will be very pleased with. I recently also got my first Ravensburger \\""flat\\"" puzzle and was very impressed with the quality of that as well.<br /><br />Enjoy this unusual puzzle, it is quite an experience to work with.<br /><br />~operabruin"
5.0	Wow, I didn't expect such a high quality product! Was pleasantly surprised by the size of the puzzle. Fun and brightly colored letters. Purchased on a whim for my little guy for Christmas and I'm so glad I did.
5.0	I'm using this trick in a play and people have been blown away by the authenticity.  I didn't quite know what to expect but it was easy to learn and a nice addition for our prop room.
5.0	This game was purchased for a birthday present.  My sister loved it.  Instructions easy to understand and game is fun to play.
5.0	I bought this for my 7 year old daughter and she loves it, its easy to handle, easy to reload and she can hang with the boys plus she has the better gun for shooting her targets, all the boys want her gun.
1.0	They do not fit the Cheerson CX-10. The mounting opening is too small. Can't force them on .. may damage your motor. Ream them out and you may get wobbling. I am returning.
5.0	This game is vile, sick, and twisted. Ever since buying this game, I have been loosing all of my friends one by one. Every time I place a card down I regret doing it. When my friends find out it is my card they look at me with disgust and disappointment. One by one, they have all stopped answering my texts and calls. I hate you cards against humanity, you have ruined my life--for the better.<br />If you have a christian family that you want to have fun with, this is the perfect game.<br />They will love you so much after placing this game, they will curse you straight to hell.
5.0	Just as picture.  It is Hot wheel size.
5.0	kids like it but get bored. need cd's to play along!
5.0	I love it. We used to play this game making up questions but this is even better.
5.0	My 9 year old son just recently became a Simpson's fan. My challenge was finding some type of stuffed toys from the Simpsons that was kid friendly and not going to cost me an arm and a leg. Everything on the market was overpriced based on the quality and size in my opinion. Then I stumbled onto Funko. Not only did they have a good variety of characters, but they also were more kid friendly than other plush characters on the market. They really appeal to kids because of their young looks. They remind me of Mii characters. I bought three of them for my son and the price was more than reasonable. Very well made and can be used as a toy or collectible. We highly recommend this plushie to any Simpson's fan.
5.0	I purchased this for my nephew for his birthday and he loves it!! It fits perfectly in the yard,very sturdy and he is never bored because of the different activities that it offers. Now I am in the process of purchasing two more!! One for my grandchildren and my niece and nephews.
5.0	Great condition. Arrived before estimated date, what's not to love about that!?! I'd definitely buy again
5.0	A funny and lovely costume to my Ranger son. He enjoyed and asked me to buy a yelow and green too!
5.0	"The Pixter itself is a fantastic toy. My youngest daughter is 4 and has Autism, we bought this for her to discourage her from drawing on the walls. It definately worked. There is a lot of neat features and extra cartridges you can purchase for it. For all intents and purposes the toy is a great buy if you can get it on sale.<br />My only problem with it is while the volume can be controlled the speaker \\""blew\\"" within 3 months of having this and when the sound is turned on it makes a REALLY loud and awful sound in the main menu when the song is playing. We had to open up the case and cut the wire because she wouldnt keep the volume off anf it was that awful. Be aware that this toy is not very durable."
5.0	6 rounds of pain to your coworkers BRAINNN!
5.0	As expected with fast delivery. The quality was super...heavy fabric that hangs nicely. I would recommend this product.  The school crest patch is well done also.
5.0	It came in perfect condition and it looks awesome! It's a little small on my head but I think I just need to wear it more and stretch it out to fit my head.
5.0	INCREDIBLE - the boys love Covert Force - the vest the helmet all of it
5.0	Awsome just what I needed!!! Great compound on the 2.2 pitbull rock beast 2 also goes great with the proline memory foam 2.Thanks for the speedy delivery
5.0	Out of the 3 toy phones I bought during Christmas season, I think this one is the most like &#34;mommy's phone&#34; the screen feels like a touch screen, not like buttons.
5.0	If you ever want a child to get out of your hair for a while try this plane he loved it so much the other kids wanted one to they were fighting over it
5.0	"Another great Learning Resources product!  I purchased this with the hopes of avoiding purchasing the \\""3 Bear Family\\"" counters separately...  That doesn't work...  I purchased the pattern cards, and had intended on using the bears that came with this for those, but I didn't read carefully enough, apparently.  The pattern cards require Mom, Dad, and Baby bears, so if you intend to avoid purchasing the others, it really doesn't work very well.<br /><br />As far as the scales--Fantastic!  They are of really nice quality, and are a great visual aid, and a really nice introduction to weights, and measurement.  They have spouts, so that you can easily weigh different liquids, and have platforms that fit on top of the containers for smaller items.  If I were to complain about anything, it would be those: the \\""platforms\\"" do not attach to the containers very well, and fall off rather easily.  I found out once I purchased it that my kids may still be a bit young for it (2 and 4,) but it will be invaluable for years to come.  We will be able to compare the weights of many different items for a very, very reasonable price."
5.0	Many more choices than the ones bought for my sons 25-30 years ago.  My 1 year old granddaughter has mastered the pull down handle and is enjoying her gift.
5.0	Husband loves this toy so much he bought one for his father and my grandfather
5.0	My grand kids each have one and have hours of fun with this bow. Great exercise in learning hand eye coordination and they are learning patience as I require that they must wait until all arrows are shot before they run up and collect their own and start another round  when shooting at a target (sold separately). also developing an awareness of others when in striking distance
5.0	My toddler loves this!
5.0	My 6 year old begs to play this game!
5.0	Love it! It is as cute as ever!
5.0	I bought this set for my newborn, now 6 mths. old.  He loves to chew all the rattles, and see them move and shake.  His older brother and sister (4 and 2) love to play with him and the rattles themselves.  I cannot tell you  the rare occasions that ALL three play peacefully together...  thanks  sassy, we are big fans.
5.0	I bought this for my two year old and could not have been any more pleased than I am. I would buy this product 10 times over and would highly recommend it!
5.0	This bear was more than expected for the price! The movement is so cute, and the light up candles are a great touch! It is a nice size and the sound is awesome! The best singing/music sound I have ever heard from a toy. I got it for my little girls birthday, she loves to sing the happy birthday song, I was so glad that this sings the same happy birthday song that most people are familiar with. The hat is a little squished due to the weight of the candles, but I think that adds to the silliness of a candle hat anyway...
5.0	Nice small container for precise dispensing of fluids. I like that it comes with a small cap on the needle which my other one doesn't have.
5.0	Yes, he hits every button - but he's 2- that's what they do. ;-) But he'll push the 'words' so it will read to him, then make me read it. He notices when I skip a word or miss something. He loves the sounds and carries it all over the house. The pages bend, but haven't torn, and he's not the most gentle child with books yet.
5.0	This and Mission Red Planet are the best Board Games I've ever played in my life. This a powerhouse strategy board game.
5.0	If your child loves legos, you can't go wrong with these.  This was the first thing they want to do every morning!  Fun and it's not candy!!!
5.0	Just opened 205/500 and it blew me away. I have seen the other versions out there and they are good. This one overshadows them all. The price was pretty steep, so I had pretty high expectations going in, but I am VERY HAPPY. Awesome.
5.0	Very smelly and lasts a long period of time.Pranked my mom in the restroom and man I got her so good she had to use febreeze and Clorox.Lasts up to 15 minutes depending on the sprays.It lasted like a hour when I did it, but I sprayed it like 5 times.
5.0	Great product! Santa got this for my daughter for Christmas and she loves it! It's really cool in the dark.
5.0	Love it. Very affordable to collect.
5.0	Our grandson was born ob 2-2-2000.  So every birthday he receives a ground hog.  This year, at the last minute, he wanted one dressed like the Seahawks.  So we did.  It was a hit.
5.0	This was a gift to a young boy.  He has many Lego's. He has enjoyed building and playing with this set.
5.0	The kids at my son's preschool loved this and the teacher loved it because she can use it over and over again.
5.0	I received this download card for a great price!!<br />It arrived fast, and I have no complaints about this card.
5.0	The Crazy ChCluck Chicken arrived in a reasonable time,  and it was in perfect condition.  A great fun toy for all ages.  John Schlesinger.
5.0	16 month old loves it
5.0	It's a very small puzzle but will be perfect for my 6 year old. The 3d looks awesome. Definitely recommend
5.0	Very very cool.  Worked well and lasted for days without needed a helium refill.<br />Best if you have high ceilings for it to move around.  My sister has a 2 story living space that was perfect.  All the kids loved it!<br />Easy to assemble and control.
1.0	Horrible product. Broke right out of the package. I moved the pegs into position as I removed the center strip it cracked in half. The plastic is thin and cheap. This is not a real rainbow loom, nor does it have their product stamp. I wish I could return this and get my money back!!
5.0	My sweet little 4 year old can do more advanced Legos now but she refuses to let me get rid of this. She still loves it after all this time. Great purchase.
5.0	We are a group of seniors and really enjoy getting together a couple times each week to play dominoes.  Only complaint about this set is that the train spoke does not whistle.
1.0	the heading says it all. the tutus are of bad quality and of cheap material not worth the money we paid. it was a major disappointment when my 3 year old received this as a christmas present. the material is not cotton but like of a very cheap tule.
5.0	My husband loves to play this game. He loves competition and finds this game a blast. It is certainly a battle of wits and there is no down time when playing. The game is hopping and great fun!
5.0	my wife has always been a Loki fan. So when I got this for her birthday she was super excited. The detail is very impressive and he was wrapped/shipped extremely well.
5.0	My son loved his wrestler!
5.0	I sent this to my three month old niece in hawaii she loved it! It so cute I wish b I had had ine for my son when he was a baby
5.0	Fantastic! Just what I needed!
5.0	This is a great game for young children.  My daughter started playing it shortly after she turned 2.  I've been impressed at how quickly she picked up the game.  She doesn't have the attention span to play for a long time, but I think it's educational for her even in short spurts!  It's great for teaching prepositions and giving directions!  Highly recommend!
5.0	Someone who works in the design part of the factory at Matchbox must be a fan of Seinfeld as their version of the Karmann Ghia Convertible has the exact same body colour (light blue) as well as interior (black) that the one Kramer drove on the LA episodes where he would eventually be mistaken and arrested as a serial killer.<br /><br />The great thing about this car isn't the detail, it's the fact that it's a regular mass produced basic cheap Matchbox vehicle that you find on the pegs everywhere (well in the 2008 release of vehicles). Most vehicles from TV and movies are hard to find and in limited numbers. Therefore if you're prepared to do a bit of hunting through all the hanging Matchbox vehicles in your local store, you should be able to find one.  I found mine at the local Coles supermarket.  Even in the years ahead if these are no longer in your local stores due to being replaced by newer vehicle releases, the sheer volume of these out there should mean you can find them fairly cheap online. In stores with small turnover or who don't rotate their stock, you should be able to find these for years to come. The downside of this being released in the basic range is that the packaging is just your regular orange blister pack cardboard with the word Matchbox on the card.  Still unlike Johnny Lightning and other brands the packaging is never usually that great with Matchbox and if you're going to take it out of the blister pack then it doesn't really matter.<br /><br />A must have for the collection of any movie/TV die-cast vehicle collector or Seinfeld fan!
5.0	Bought this as a gift; nice packaging  and cute blocks.... would buy again for a gift.  The little boy we bought them for really liked them
1.0	I would have given it NO stars but it wouldn't let me. I got a rabbit instead!  The packaging even said squirrel. Not happy at all!!
1.0	I was so dissapointed when I received this package. I was looking forward to have a watch like this that I could wear very occantionally. The watch didn't right of the bat! Very low quality product.
5.0	very nice upgrade for XL5
5.0	This was the best part of my 4 years old birthday. It held 3 bags of candy from Costco without any problem. The bottomed opened without any problem when all the strings were pulled. I cant recommend this enough. The fun of a traditional piñata  without any weapons involved!
5.0	This is a straight-forward product.  I gave it 5 stars because I received them as expected and they serve the purpose they were meant for.  I use them in my elementary music classroom at my &#34;Power Station.&#34;
5.0	The baby pool, is really cute and provides the right amount of shade as well. When we are not usingit outside we bring it in and fill it with stuffed animals and my son loves to crawl in and out of it and play. And he also loves the velco fish too!
5.0	My 1 yr old grandson loves these. Easy to carry and easy to push
5.0	My daughter loves Zoobles, and this is a great set.  I got it for $4.99 which makes it even better!
5.0	My son loves to work with these.  Endless hours of possibilities
5.0	I love Othello and seeked out a new board but was disappointed to find I was sold a game missing half the pieces.  I didn't seek return as it was a gift and I waited too long to figure out it was not a complete game and not usable.
5.0	The toy doesn't really look like Johnny Depp but it is a good action figure if you are a collector.
5.0	My daughter loves this little animal.<br />Carries it everywhere with her.<br />I would recommend this perfect little stuffed beanie.<br />thanks
5.0	Awesome sauce!!! Highly recommend
5.0	Just what I needed in a timely manner and at a fair price
5.0	SO CUTE! SENT WITHOUT ACTUALLY SEEING IT TO MY NIECE'S DAUGHTER. ARRIVED AS PROMISED - MY NIECE SAID IT IS VERY MUCH LOVED!
1.0	I have nothing but bad to say about this. First it did not come with a remote. Second the directions were in Japanese. Third many of the parts were missing. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS!
5.0	My 18-month-old daughter loves to take things in and out of containers. So this toy fits that need and she has to match up the correct shape to make them fit. Great toy for toddlers and preschoolers.
5.0	What little girl wouldn't love this little sweetheart.  Fits so perfect in the crook of their arms.  Great qualiy. Beautiful doll.
5.0	We had a Larry from when my first child was little. At 21 he still loves Veggietales wether he'd admit it or not! Years later having my second child who is also in love with Veggietales, I wanted to add Bob. Was so pleased to find him!
5.0	A very excited seven-year -old assembled this herself.
5.0	Just what I needed. Had to replace the one, do to the signal posts broke.
1.0	Each year I buy gag gift for serious minded brother in law, on line these looked like a hit...in reality piece oh garbage, came with a bag of extra rhinestones should have been a hint.  It's a pair of safety glasses with cheap rhinestones hot glued on. At $2.99 they would have been funny..@$20+, a complete rip off
5.0	I don't know why people were complaining this is small. It's about the length of my hand, wrist to finger tip so it's a great size for my 4 year old. She loves these things and the price is wonderful!
5.0	Gave it to my 6 month old for Christmas.  He loved it.  Played with it the whole christmas morning.  None stop.
5.0	LEGO Blinky!!! Now if LEGO could just release Bartman & Radioactive Man/Fallout Boy figures the circle of life (aka Springfield) would be complete.
5.0	my children absolutly love this toy!! you can do so much with this product from building towers and houses to building cars. they can play with this for hours if i would let them and never get bored. they build one thing knock it down and go right into building something else. buy this product it is AMAZING!!
5.0	One of the easier planes to put together but a must have for your collection.
5.0	works great, turn it on to work with my music.
5.0	This item arrived earlier then the expected time frame.  It is very cut and fun, and looks pretty durable for what it is.  Also it is very spacious and had very interesting terrain' on the inside of the pool that add a little extra to it.  I am very pleased.  Also, it comes with two patches for repairs.
1.0	"PLEASE NOTE...this toy (which was a Xmas present for my child) arrived in the original box with the products picture on the box) meaning it arrived displaying what item it is...I received this with my child right next to me...he clearly saw what the item was and now there is NO WAY I can give it to my child as a \\""Santa\\"" present...if the seller had put two seconds worth of thought into it to realizing it was a childs toy and being sent at Xmas time and thought to ship in a non discript box, I would have a present to give my child on Xmas morning, because of the way it was sent, I had to give to my child right then as I could not pass off as a \\""Santa\\"" present at that point and I am now one less Xmas present to give...I just think this was thoughtless and careless on the sellers behalf."
1.0	Bought this based on all the good reviews.  I charged the batteries fully before the first flight.  This helicopter barley came off the floor and it just has enough power to hover at 3 inches.  Very dissatisfied with the performance.  I own 3 other Syma Gyro helicopters that work great.  My favorite is the S102 Black Hawk by far, it has great flight time 6-8 mins and it's very easy to control.
5.0	I have to say I'm very impressed with this company. The first remote we ordered was stolen off our doorstep. The company replaced it without question and sent a new one immediately. My son received the MOTA smart phone controlled helicopter for Christmas and we purchased the remote to go with it. My son said using the iphone was too hard to control the helicopter. But with the remote, it is so easy to control and flies really smooth. No complaints and my son has had several r/c helicopters. This one is his favorite.
5.0	I love this, and the baby loves it more.  My oldest daughter and I might not be as thrilled about the fact that the baby seems to believe these are Un-Stacking Blocks, though.  And, where on earth is the middle sized hexagon???  Is it under the couch?  Is it in the bathroom drawer?  Dear God, please tell me it did not jump into the litter box...
5.0	Not just a fun time, but a challenge for 13 month old. At first he was a little shy about going in until we put his toys in side. Helped build some confidence,  I can see it's use increasing as he grows older.
5.0	Good product. Good description. Good service from seller. Will do business again with seller.
5.0	Pinypons are the best. This is so much fun. My daughter has spent hours playing with it.
5.0	Absolutely love these to John Deere toys. They are durable and very sturdy.
5.0	Really cool, super comfortable, and my friends and I love it.
5.0	I was looking for a baby book that was classic and timeless. This is exactly what I wanted!! I was expecting a white or cream book, but it is actually a light pink color...perfect for the baby girl I am expecting in July, but if I found out I was having a boy I would have returned it. The pages all have a simple layout with places to fill in and I cant think of anything they left out. Overall I am very very pleased!!
5.0	Works great on my Wheely King.  No issues.
5.0	it came in perfect condition...I love it
5.0	My 4 year old loves her new bank.
1.0	I don't know what any of these reviewers are talking about.<BR>THIS TOY IS UNSAFE for a one-year-old. My 15-month-old daughter constantly tipped and fell off this USELESS toy. A simple safety strap would make it usable- why after all the bells and whistles did they not think of this simple SAFETY feature?<br />DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!
5.0	helps to paint a great edge, a little on the pricey side but an excellent product
5.0	Great Dice. no imperfections and they work well.
5.0	so cute  and is very well maid in my opinion. it works well on webkinz and yo will love it
5.0	My grandson really loves it. Hours of fun. Perfect size for a little one. Light and easy to move around but well balanced.
5.0	A very cool jigsaw puzzle! Very unusual pieces and large pieces. That could come in handy for people with sight problems. Beautiful colors!
5.0	This is the second one I purchase for my three year old.  She loves to pet her tiger.  I even bought one for my 10 year old.  Perfect for a small child to hold onto.  It's small but it packs big smiles from the little ones.  His eyes are like sparkly green, which for my little one that was a bonus.  As I said, his fur is really soft and perfect size for napping and traveling.  And maybe even the dr's office.
5.0	Very good! I tried it when I just receive it, it is very easy to control and it performance just as I controlled，tons of fun with it… worth every penny!
5.0	It fit my nephew perfect. He loved it we had no issues with it. It was exactly what we ordered.
5.0	My daughter has so much fun with these! She is 4 and will follow the patterns in the book included to make all different kinds of creations. The price is a little shocking, but after getting these and playing with them I would buy them all over again. In fact we plan on buying one of the kits with more shapes.
5.0	Snow White is so cute and i am waiting for my daughter to be old enough to play with her, right now i am just keeping her in the box so she will stay in great condition
5.0	Can't go wrong with anything Fisher-Price! My 14 month old granddaughter likes it, but she will only play with it if someone else is there to watch and help and encourage!
5.0	I bought the WolVol 3-in-1 Construction Bulldozer Dump Excavator Take-A-Part Truck Toy with Drill and Tools, Lights and Music (Battery Operated), Bump and Go Actio [ASIN: B00LZ9MC1U]  For My grandson's first birthday.  The order was processed same day and shipped expeditiously thank you, love this vendor!
5.0	Lily is a beautiful baby doll and my granddaughter loves her!
5.0	I played this game so much when I was younger, and it's great to have an exact replica for my own now, especially since they're harder to find! Perfect condition.
5.0	This game was one of my favorites growing up and still is.  I love the educational parts of the games and just how much one must think to be come better at the game.  Always figuring out what is better.
5.0	Wonderful product.  Excellent toy for autistic children who want to put things together or take them apart.  I purchased 2sets and extra additional track and my son loves them.  They are the first toys that kind of require imagination that he has ever played with.  He loves to take it apart,  rebuild differently and watch the cars---lights on or off. He has played with them for hours since I got them at Christmas. Highly recommended for anyone who has autism and &#34;needs&#34; to take apart or put together.  As long as they don't put objects in their mouths! First time he has ever played with just a toy and he is 25 now.
5.0	Elmo is so soft and cuddly.  You can't help but want to hug him.  His hands are gloves that you put your hand into which makes him more personal because he can hold a child's hand or point or grab things.  The only negative thing I think the manufacturer should change is they should put an elastic strap inside the top of his mouth where my fingers are.  When I make him talk, my fingers move too freely and the strap would keep my fingers secure in the roof of his mouth for better control.
5.0	My 16 month old twin girls love cars. I found this car as well as a similar one and they absolutely love them. They like pushing the person down to make the different car noises and playing with it as a car. I like that the people come out and can be put into any of the Little People toys. It's a car for the money spent!
5.0	I gave this as a gift, and it was a real hit!  I think I will order more for my three boys :)
5.0	Gift for daughter, who has most of the other versions and she immediately began setting up the game to blend in with the other versions.
5.0	The batteries worked well and fit well. I just placed an order for three more light pole batteries. I think these batteries will have more life than these.just my opinion I'm Mike.
5.0	Our son visited this site when he was just 11 years old. He enjoyed re-creating it with his two nephews. Not a difficult project. But wonderful memories emerged.
5.0	It's fun and it seemed like all age kids wanted to ride -- but watch -- there is weight restrictions.
5.0	loved doing this puzzle, Ravenburger puzzles are the best in my opinion
5.0	Santa will be giving each of my girls one of these for Christmas this year, and they will love them.  Sooo huggable, and very lovable.  Wonderful for kids that love stuffed animals.
5.0	My 5 year old loved it
5.0	My 9 year old son just recently got this toy.  He loves it.  He loves to follow the diagrams in the included booklet and make the different combinations.  He also likes to make up his own combinations.  I think it is educational in that he can experiment with it to try to make it do different things.  The only problem that I have with it is that nothing is explained.  He doesn't know why(and I'll admit that he doesn't care why) the bells whistle or the lights light up etc.  I think there should be some basic explanations about how and why everything works.
5.0	good sleaves you get what you payed for becuse thay are in really good condishion and i was really happy with it
5.0	My oldest daughter has been asking for this latest color combo.  Little does she know, she will have a medium and average size as well as the clip under the tree.  She asked for a box full of beanie boos.  These are the first stuffed animals she has been crazy about!
5.0	Great product and fast shipping
5.0	My son loves this toy!
1.0	The directions accompanying this are printed  on the box and totally inadequate. I think it is cheaply made and I have not been able to figure out how to recharge the rechargeable batteries once placed in the truck.  There is some sort of antenna ( of course) and no directions as to where to  put it.  It does come with the 9 V battery but doesn't tell you that 4 AA are also required.  I got this for our grandson's birthday and I have doubts as to whether it will work.  I guess we will see when my son helps me to figure it out.  I am usually clever at doing things like this but this one is a real piece of work.  Had I known, I never would have purchased it.  If it actually works I will be back and tell you
5.0	I bought this as a gift.  It is nice, but a little smaller than I expected. Overall, a nice set for someone who like chess.
5.0	Who cares if I don't speak Russian? This little guy / girl is the cutest little toy I own. I love hearing it talk--can't imagine what it's saying but I'm having fun anyway.
5.0	My nephew loved this owl. The perfect gift for a two year old that loves to throw. Really, really soft and a great size.
5.0	I'm sure it will get a lot of great use for many years. Bought it for my grandsons for Christmas and they love it!
5.0	My son got this for his birthday and still plays with it.  It has a lot of little parts, so be careful if you have other little ones in the house.  Other than that... Plan on!
5.0	Great Image, Good Price
5.0	I ordered two of these for my twins. They absolutely LOVE them! My only complaint is that one was supposed to be an excavator and one a bulldozer, but they were both excavators. It was too late for me to return it and get a new one in time for their party so I just kept them both. I guess I should thank you though, it turns out with having two toys that are the exact same there is no fighting.
5.0	very cute! good quality!
5.0	I live in a small Manhattan apartment. So unfortunately, I don't have the space for a larger children's table and chair set. We eat in the living room since we don't have a dining room. This little desk is perfect for our needs. My son is almost four and he fits fine in this desk. My two year old also can use the desk. My four year eats his meals here. It has a nice little cup holder so that his cup doesn't fall over.<br /><br />He also colors on the desk, practices his writing and sometimes just sits there to watch tv. He finds it to be perfectly comfortable. the desk has a little storage drawer underneath it where we store coloring books and a bag of crayons.<br /><br />Assembly was not difficult and was pretty straightforward.The desk is sturdy and well made. We have moved it around a lot and it has held up well. The surface is also pretty scratch resistant and the graphic on the desk has stayed looking nice. I recommend it.
5.0	These are awesome!  They look great. They are easy to get out of the tray. Great product for ANY batman fan
5.0	This is an amazing product. I have five children and they all loved this, it was so much a great idea for family fun. My kids loved it. It was so easy to make and simple directions. Definitely will buy again.
5.0	Could not be more pleased with the quality and cuteness of this set. My 3 yr old loves it, as he's a big Tayo fan and has played with it non stop.
5.0	Great product..very durable my son loves it! And the comic book I will save till he gets a lil older..
5.0	I ordered Hide and Hug Olaf, he was such a hit, I had to order extra Olaf dolls for the entire family.  Just the right size to carry around and hide and hug!
5.0	love it, my family has started a game night every week and this is definitely a game we play a lot, much like munchkin, but different enough that it keeps you on your toes.
5.0	"[[VIDEOID:mo292MQPQTMEZS]]How it works:<br /><br />The drinking bird is a heat engine that exploits a temperature differential to convert heat energy to a pressure differential within the device, and perform mechanical work. Like all heat engines, the drinking bird works through a thermodynamic cycle. The initial state of the system is a bird with a wet head oriented vertically with an initial oscillation on its pivot.<br /><br />The process operates as follows:<br /><br />  1. The water evaporates from the felt on the head.<br />  2. Evaporation lowers the temperature of the glass head (heat of vaporization).<br />  3. The temperature decrease causes some of the dichloromethane vapor in the head to condense.<br />  4. The lower temperature and condensation together cause the pressure to drop in the head (ideal gas law).<br />  5. The higher vapor pressure in the warmer base pushes the liquid up the neck.<br />  6. As the liquid rises, the bird becomes top heavy and tips over.<br />  7. When the bird tips over, the bottom end of the neck tube rises above the surface of the liquid.<br />  8. A bubble of warm vapor rises up the tube through this gap, displacing liquid as it goes.<br />  9.Liquid flows back to the bottom bulb (the toy is designed so that when it has tipped over the neck's tilt allows this), and pressure equalizes between the top and bottom bulbs<br />  10. The weight of the liquid in the bottom bulb restores the bird to its vertical position<br />  11. The liquid in the bottom bulb is heated by ambient air, which is at a temperature slightly higher than the temperature of the bird's head.<br /><br />If a glass of water is placed so that the beak dips into it on its descent, the bird will continue to absorb water and the cycle will continue as long as there is enough water in the glass to keep the head wet. However, the bird will continue to dip even without a source of water, as long as the head is wet, or as long as a temperature differential is maintained between the head and body. This differential can be generated without evaporative cooling in the head; for instance, a heat source directed at the bottom bulb will create a pressure differential between top and bottom that will drive the engine. The ultimate source of energy is the temperature gradient between the toy's head and base; the toy is not a perpetual motion machine.<br /><br />An analysis showed that the evaporative heat flux driving a small bird was about 1'2 W, whereas the mechanical power expressed in bird's motion was about 1'20,000 W. The system efficiency is about 0.01%. More practically, about 1'1,000,000 W can be extracted from the bird, either with a coil/magnet or a ratchet used to winch paperclips.<br /><br />The drinking bird was invented by Miles V. Sullivan and co-developed by George H. Shackley in 1945 and patented in 1946. He was a Ph.D. inventor-scientist at Bell Labs in Murray Hill, NJ, USA. U.S. Patent 2,402,463.

5.0	My twins received these for their fourth birthday--I have since added a third set so we have enough that my two year old can play (make sure the small pieces are put together--the new sets have a much improved crank  design).  My girls LOVE to make twirling rainbows and all sorts of creative  cars.  I reccomend it without reservation.
5.0	I gave this doll along with the Corolle stroller and feeding accessories to my one year old granddaughter for Christmas. She loved it. It is just the right size for her.
5.0	I used to play this with my family as a kid and I was so excited to find this as an adult.  It's a mix between bingo and poker and is fun with a bunch of people playing it.  The game boards and chips seem well made.  You do need to supply your own playing cards with this particular set.
5.0	Great value for the money and he enjoyed putting it together.
5.0	This is one of the highest quality stuffed animals I have ever had!  It's great! I will buy more in the future.  I'm glad I found this brand on Amazon.
1.0	"I received a black water bottle without the \\""Prune Juice\\"" sticker.  As this was bought as a gag gift, the bottle without the printing is not very useful."
5.0	My daughter loved getting this Olaf doll for Christmas.  She mostly likes popping his head off (?!).  She thinks it's hilarious.  It seems like it will last a long time, and I love his changing expressions.  It is a little bigger proportionately to the 12&#34; Elsa and Anna dolls than he is in the movie, but who cares?  He's still smaller than them and is super fun.  Great, well-made toy!
5.0	I LOVE IT SO MUCH!! I got it for my husband for Christmas.. And he was in love XD So Was I.. Very good thank you so much..
1.0	hate it its like worth about 13$ for what i se its garbage
5.0	Came as described and a good price
5.0	I ordered this with high expectations, and I certainly was not displeased.It is a picture perfect model of one of my favorite cars.thank you Amazon!
1.0	Sorry but this is a lame product. Neither my kids nor I could make this item do much of anything. Forgettable.
5.0	Thank you. Great job.
5.0	"My 17 month old son got it for Christmas and can't stop playing with it. It comes with a train, but we also use his cars and train set. My girls (6 and 5) also love playing with their little brother with this. He didn't wanna open anything else since this was a \\""Santa\\"" gift. The set up was really easy. some of the stickers are a little spaced, but for a 1 year old it's perfect.  We had a blast Christmas eve putting the stickers and track on. I will say put the stickers on BEFORE the track. Found out he hard way..lol. My my son LOVES it and I would recommend this toy to anyone!!!"
5.0	I got this expansion to spice up our main game a little bit. I feel like it adds so much to the game! The extra tiles are new shapes and have features that were not previously available with the standard tiles. This also comes with extra meeples so a 6th person can play. Additionally, there is one oversized meeple for each player that counts as two meeples. This makes 2-player field wars more enjoyable. The Inns and Cathedrals add a new and exciting twist as well. I think this is an awesome expansion pack that adds a lot to the game.
5.0	Grandson was very happy
5.0	nicely built, easy to assemble, I think it is way over priced, but grandson loves it, thats what matter most.
5.0	This is a nice story that my kids (2 and 4) like a lot.  The story itself is rather short, but it is told slowly and intermixed with slow, soft music.  It's rather relaxing to listen to.  A common complaint I've read about these story cartridges is that the voice is muffled and the sound quality isn't great.  That is a true observation.  However, I knew about this when I bought My Tot Clock, so the product lives up to my expectations.  The creator of My Tot Clock explains that the reason the sound quality isn't better is that it would've cost too much to put a higher quality sound system in the clock...it could be done, but then the cost of the final product would've put it out of the ideal range of their intended market.  The clock already performs a lot of functions and the sound is just be part of the whole.  I think the price of the Tot Clock is ideal where it is, and so I agree with their philosophy.  My kids don't mind the sound quality at all.  Five stars for meeting my expectations and being a nice story.
5.0	Was not disappointed, great quality. My daughter absolutely loves them, she is 21 months and calls them Bubbys. Highly recommended for the Bubble Guppies Fan.
5.0	Really cute monkey, and pretty small. We bought this for our granddaugther, who is into sock monkeys. She loved it!
5.0	Bought this for Christmas and we played it over and over again. My kids loved it, ages 17-10. My husband and I played it alone. It is great for strategy solving and overall just a fun game.
1.0	I had to return this item twice. they both had parts missing( the aircraft identification plates). They need better quality control of their packing.
5.0	This is a good training tool to get some surface mount solderingcexperience.  Its even better in explaining how the circuit works and how to troubleshoot it.  High grade training in a hands on package.
5.0	Gave this to my niece as a Christmas gift.<br />The parts are well designed and pretty realistic! The stethoscope has a little sound effect, and the blood pressure cuff can be squeezed, the shot is spring loaded and can be depressed. The pager makes telephone noises, which she loves.<br />She loved it, especially that it came in it's own case that she could open and lock close. The suture scissors are her favorite.<br />Definitely worth it!
5.0	Used these same wrap-ups with my own kids and am now using them with students and grandkids. Sometimes, simple is good. Gives kids a quick way to check their own work and learn without being embarrassed by making a mistake others see. Great for the &#34;gifted&#34; student who cannot allow themselves to be wrong.
5.0	great gives you lands for a new player and 4 booster packs, only had about 5 cards with another single duplicate, i might even buy another one for my brother so he can also get into the game.
5.0	I got this for my 1 year old daughter and she loves it.  It's very gentle so she loves to play in it.  I love that the worms are soft plastic so I don't have to worry about her getting hurt if she steps or falls on them.  This has kept her very busy this summer.
5.0	Don't know how they make these for the money. Great.
5.0	I bought this for my four year old son. He is graduating up from the Mega Blocks. He loves the wheels and windows that he can use to build &#34;real&#34; houses and cars. I look forward to expanding on this set as he gets older. Hours of fun and a great toy that allows him to use and develop his own ideas.
5.0	My granddaughter and I have great fun playing this game! She loves anything with Hello Kitty on it.  I recommend it for good playtime fun.
5.0	I purchased for a 12yr old boy whose only other yoyo was a 2 dollar ducan yo-yo from Walgeeens. He loves his new yoyo. This is an unresponsive yo-yo with a sleep time of at least 1 minute. The yo-yo is very light and easy to use. Its a reasonably priced and I would buy another yo-yo from this manufacturer. Remember to oil the ball bearing.
5.0	They perform as you expect. No surprises. Bought several, made 500 kids happy at Halloween. No issues, all worked ok
5.0	My daughter and her friend had a blast making these pictures.  It's a fairly neat (the backing does end up all over the floor, but sweeps up easily enough) and fun art activity.  It kept them busy for about an hour.
5.0	Fluxx plus Zombies.  Nothing else needs to be said.
5.0	My granddaughter needed another building plate and this fit the bill.  Not much you can say except it is as described.
5.0	my daughter really liked it.  It's cute.
5.0	I bought this game for my 6 yr old son for Xmas becasue he likes the game on my phone so much. When he got the game he was so excited and wanted to play with it vs open his other presents. It was a little hard getting the grasp of the game at first but once we understood it it was so much fun. I think it helps to teach kids how to follow dirrections and build. All in all its a good game and worth the money especially since its a great hands on game.
5.0	I enjoy a puzzle that portrays our natural wildlife so beautifully, this one delivered.
5.0	Very realistic molding, markings and coloring.  Perfect size for displaying.  Looks like a real rhino shrunk down.  Excellent quality, the weight of it feels substantial.  The recipient, an adult that collects animal figures, loved this.
5.0	This is a staple in any deck. It's costly but it works!
5.0	Unfortunetly I cannot yet afford the real one now so this will have to do for now. Great detail, nice paint, I enjoy looking at it almost everyday and dreaming of the day. I think it was a good price for the quality.
5.0	I just got the game and started playing it with my daughter.  She said it was fun.  I say it's unique and effective. Great concept!
5.0	Bought this for my little brother-in-law for Christmas, can't wait to see the look on his face!
5.0	what I expected and as described, fast deliver. Thank you!
5.0	I bought Settlers of Catan for my family for Christmas two years ago. They play at least 3 times a week. I bought the Fisherman expansion pack because it looked easy to learn and I figured they could use a new challenge. It is easy to learn and adds a new, interesting aspect to the game without changing everything. We find that it makes games more even; rarely is anyone stuck without a decent spot to build. My family and I love it!
5.0	Absolutely gorgeous  - a very pleased daughter!!!
5.0	Great value for a Brio item.  Looks nice putting around with the trains.  Bought the boxcar, the lumber loading wagon, fuel tanker wagon & goods truck each for under $9. The boxcar, lumber wagon, and truck all have payloads that can be picked up by the crane or crane car magnet.
5.0	Adorable!  Very well made - were used as gifts.  Fast shipping.  Highly recommend!
5.0	These balls are the best! I put them in an inflatable pool at my kinds play room and I even get inside with them and the balls are intact (My weight is 127 pounds). We have had them for one year already. Good material, very sturdy but not so hard that it could hurt the kids or they could hurt each other by throwing them. Great product! My only suggestion is that they should be packed in some zipped bag.
5.0	This table is absolutely adorable and functional. Very sturdy and well made It will last forever! The umbrella is so nice and well made not flimsy at all very good quality. The umbrella is very big creates shade around the entire table perfect for my kids to have lunch outside they loved it looks great with the rest of my outdoor decor. The price is amazing I recommend this table 100%  easy to clean wipe down and done fits 6 kids comfortably very happy with this table!
5.0	Was played with 13 year olds great fun only 1 person guessed correctly but everyone loved it also had 3 extra characters made up for extra guests to play but had to share some info. it was all round good fun!
5.0	These help my GGrandson in his motor skills.....Big size, squishy but made good....!!!
5.0	I bought this for my 5-year old along with some magnets. He's had endless fun with them discovering the magic of magnets and magnetic fields.<br /><br />The packaging could use some upgrade as it's incredibly tough to have a 5-year old put the filings back in this cylindrical container.
1.0	I don't own this puzzle but that's not the Golden Gate Bridge, that's the Bay Bridge that runs from San Francisco to Oakland!
1.0	I bought this at our local museum for my 5 yr. old son.  It does not work at all.  The left foot sticks great and then the right sticks a bit but the biggest problem is that the feet hit each other when they go by on the second rotation causing both suction cups to come off the surface.  We tried clipping the tips off the inside of the feet but the &#34;hips&#34; seem to lean in even further and the feet are STILL hitting each other.  Because of the feet hitting together, it won't even walk on the floor more than two steps before it falls over.  I have a very disappointed boy here.
5.0	Awesome love the color scheme
1.0	need to be more specific with pictures & size. super small. would've loved to know how freaking small it was!
5.0	Perfect and wonderful!
5.0	They arrived so fast! This is part of my daughter Christmas stocking stuffers. She loves her rainbow loom and this looms will help her continue making those beautiful bracelets, rings, key chains, etc. Great price!
5.0	I bought this drum for my son, Max, when he was 5 months old, he is now 7-1/2 months old.  He immediately figured out how to use it, and it is helping him to learn cause and effect.  I think it is very educational as it teaches the entire alphabet both verbally and visually, and numbers 1-10.  Max loves the sounds it makes and the lights... he seems to be very proud of himself when he hits the drum and it reacts to him.  I like that it has volume control (although I don't find the sounds annoying at all, and Max and I think the voices are very cute!) I also like that it has several different modes and music options.  Max can change the modes and press the music button by himself.
5.0	My son loooooves it!! Super fun and funny! Great value!
5.0	We received this toy to try out for free.  My son had talked about playing with Bey Blades when he went to friends homes, but we didn't have any.  He was excited to try the newest Bey Blades.  He and his best buddy had a blast.  Let 'er Rip was heard for over an hour.  Then the boys decided to take stadium and Warriors outside and the neighborhood kids came a running to try them out.  We've had tournaments outside using this stadium and Bey Warriors.  Everything is holding up nicely, even with all of the action it is seeing.  Glad that I was able to try this out and would consider gifting it to my son's friends in the future.  Even Dad and Mom have fun playing.
5.0	So cute. I have filled them with several things like hair clips, hair ties,  Disney lip gloss, a few dollars, etc. I know the girls will love these!
5.0	"This thing's got it all!  What's not to love?  A giant, brachiosuarus dinosaur, pterodactyl(or is it pteronadon? Why do they keep changing the names?  And tell me again, what happen to brontosaurus?  I guess that ages me.  Sorry, got off track.), semi-truck, race car, talking, moving transformer.  Whew!<br /><br />Yes, transformers are as popular as ever.  One sees it in the movies, Transformer, Battleship, Avengers, etc.  My kids already have 2 of the Switch & Go Dinos, Silver the T-Rex and T-Don the Pteronadon(Oh, there they go again!), and they love crashing them and transforming them and trading them.<br /><br />It runs on and includes 4 AA batteries; made of durable plastic, the control panel on top moves the motorized neck up, gives a few facts on dino's, which I need to bone up on, and it makes a bunch of sounds.  One can choose the driver's image and control the volume- turn it down!  On the back, load up your race car armed with pteryldactyl (not a pteronadon) which you or your kids can shoot up into the air.<br /><br />The box state \\""over 80 wild sounds and phrases\\""- haven't counted that many, yet.  The legs can stomp if pushed or roll or transform from dino to slick racing vehicle.  If dino, one can change it's eyes or move its jaw by hand. It's a good size toy. Also, it pictures boys on the box, and yes, they'll eat it up, but my 2 girls give it 2 roaring, thumbs up!  LIsted for ages 3-8.<br /><br />This is a great toy, not cheap, and fun for dads, too.  No set-up, just play with it right out of the box.  \\""And you'll get your turn as soon as Dad's done with his.\\"""
5.0	Needed one and this was a great deal!
5.0	In Japan, students' performance improves significantly using device like this.  I learned from Japan TV that these are handy best items to learn to focus.  In the beginning I dropped a beanbag a lot.  Now I can sometimes count up to 100 without dropping. The more I practice it, the better focus I seems to gather.  That means I can get rid of the noise from my head when I play the piano.  I currently toss up only two beanbags in the air; later on, I maybe able to increase it to three or four. My piano practice should improve with it.
5.0	Enjoyed by the children
5.0	This will work great for the cards.
5.0	Loved these wall decals
5.0	Very cute and my boys love it!  It is the perfect size for my 3 year old and he is tall for his age.  The pretend the are at the market and shopping all the time.  It is very cute to watch.  Assembly was not too bad, just a little time consuming.  My only complaints are that the sliding doors are easy for my 19 month old to remove, but also easy to put back on.  And I wish they had not made the curtain removable.  They used velcro to put it on and it gets pulled off by same said 19 month old!  Other than that, I feel it was a great purchase.  Would definitely purchase it again.  We have had it for about 6 months and it has been really played with and is weathering well.
5.0	Now that I have the first three, I just need Sailors Venus, Jupiter and a Mario SH Figuarts for something nice.
5.0	great toy!  came very fast!
5.0	the card is awesome in perfect condition,perfect shielded and in plastic case.do not hesitate   to buy one!!youll destroy your enemies at once!!
5.0	Bought it for my granddaughter and she loved it and enjoying it, mostly cause it is her name as well and spelled like hers!
1.0	I ordered this as a Christmas present for my brother a few days ago and when I got the action figure, both of it's legs were completely broken off. I now have to return it and hopefully buy a new one.
5.0	Great project for a child. One of the three books was made for a gift.
1.0	"I purchased 2 kits for my children, the venus flytrap kit and the \\""tickle me plant\\"" kit.<br />We followed the direction meticulously and 3 months later, nothing.<br />Nothing. Not one of the seeds sprouted, and the kids are SO disappointed. We placed them according to instructions exactly, made sure to measure the moisture level etc. still, no results.<br />Very disappointing, which is even more upsetting than the money wasted, seeing your kids running every morning to check on the seeds, for 3 months, only to find nothing at all had changed."
5.0	perfect item was brand new<br /><br />thank you, Fred
5.0	wonderful toy.  my granddaughter (one year old) loves it.
5.0	My husband enjoyed getting this as a gift. He had a lot of fun playing with the dials and listening to Spock report on the local conditions. It is somewhat lightweight, but still *fascinating*.
5.0	My brother loved it ! Really cute and is fun. He was one when we first got it and he'll be two the next time hell use It so be perfect
5.0	i got this for my dad and he has yet to build it from what i saw of it looks just like grandpa
5.0	Kids absolutely LOVED this item.  Bought it along with another Learning Resource item.  The kids have played with this for hours since getting in on Christmas.  We've done several of the experiments in the booklet, plus some others we've found online.  Fun!
5.0	Loved this game!!!! I received this game through #houseparty and I have never played it before, but once I received it and played it was so much fun!!! Its so funny to hear some of the things that people come up with! Definitely work playing!
5.0	"I have ordered both this Pooh and the \\""all occasion\\"" Pooh to give as gifts.   They are great gifts!  The kids love to hear their names.  Their parents think I'm the greatest gift finder ever!"
5.0	I bought these for my niece and nephew, and the whole family loves them.  Easy cleanup for mom and dad (1 item to pickup) and they are easy to hold and use for little hands.  The crayon doesn't fall out of the holder like it does with some products.  They've asked where I found them, so now I know what to buy for every occasion.
1.0	We purchased this bike for my daughter for Christmas. We put it together as the instructions said, but it never really worked. The seat would not adjust and sat on the bar no matter what we did. We thought maybe we had a missing piece, we tore apart everything trying to find it to no avail. There was nothing we could find that we had missed in the instructions. It squeaked and barely moved when she tried to pedal. You would have thought it was 25 years old and rusty the way it moved. We should have contacted the company, but with two little ones running around, it just got put on the back burner until we finally gave it to a charity for someone who had more time and/or ability to deal with it. I would never purchase this bike for another child and frankly think it's a waste of money. Granted, I never tried to contact the company to tell them of the problem. Do I sound old when I say, when I buy something I just expect it to work properly?
5.0	These pails are bright, colorful and much studier than most buckets.  Our 15 month grandson loves to play in the sandbox and at the beach. We also purchased the Spielstabil Sand Scoop and they work perfectly together.
5.0	Before I purchased this toy I read the reviews posted, and most expressed the difficulty in transforming from robot to car and vice-versa. I had second thoughts.....but decided to challenge my nine year old son anyway.  To my surprise in less than twelve mintes he had transform the robot (as received in the original packaging) to the car.  He did use the contained drawings, which is not detailed as I thought. Kids have a way of figuring out things on their own. My advice: Do not be afraid to carry kids ability to the next level.  I was hoping this toy would have kept him busy during the entire Christmas Holiday, so I have to invest in a next toy to keep him occupied.
1.0	The solution glows, but the bubbles don't
1.0	This is the worst product I have ever purchased! I have flown r/c copters before and purchased this one for my son. We both had a hard time keeping in the air without giving each other haircuts with it! It loses radio response very quickly and does not respond well to the controls you give it when it IS in radio range. I have had it for 2 days now and I already sent a request to return to the seller. This item needs replacement parts because of all the times it fell out of the sky due to mechanical error and parts are not readily available. I would not recommend this item to my worst enemy!
5.0	This is a REALLY fun game great for a game night when you have kids of all ages.  The directions are very, very simple and take a quick 2 minutes to read.  From then, it is easy to play and the strategy can easily be taught to little or big ones.<br /><br />What's really neat is that anyone can win - there is a very nice 'chance' factor in the form of the egg - eggs don't roll straight due to their shape so there's no guarantee your egg will roll where you want it to.  As often as not, we hit our own hens and not just our opponents.<br /><br />The game takes about 8 minutes to play out - a bit faster with 2 people and a bit longer with four people.  Of course, it's more fun with 4 people since there are more hens to chuck the egg at.<br /><br />My 6 year old loves it - she even loves saying the name.  When we aren't playing it, she practices chucking the egg on waiting pieces.<br /><br />I like the 3D feel to this and the way it is laid out.  An easy to play game and fun for everyone.
5.0	Anna Valerious(Kate Beckensale) is one sweet all around figure.This figure is very movie accurate from Van Helsing with awesome detail like it came right out of the screen.Anna comes with two swords and holders for up close monster slaying and two guns for taking out monsters from a distance.Anna also comes with a sword slashing action feature for more realism.The figure is about half the size of a deluxe figure.This is the only part that some people may consider a drawback,but it still dosen't take away the fact that this is a great figure.Anna has great stability for poses to create cool battle scenes from the movie or displaying this gem where you please.The durability is excellent as well with secure arm and leg joints and a solid build to handle any monsters that come her way.Bottom line a well-made,high quality,10 out of 10 figure from the Van Helsing line.I highly recommend Anna Valerious to any one that is a fan of Van Helsing or Anna's character in the movie.Anna Valerious Rocks!!!
5.0	I love this game for what it is- a small, contained, easily carried and stored, simple but thrilling game for a young child- and it's a GREAT game for a child with motor issues, as my three-year-old son has.<br /><br />My son has difficulty with tasks most of his peers can do, and receives occupational therapy for things like cutting, mimicking simple drawings or holding pens/tools, and orientation of his hands.  This game has been something we've come to use almost every night as it challenges him to pick up the tiny (sometimes slippery!) carrots with the bunny tweezers and transport them to the basket.  He loves to flick and spin the spinner, and count everyone's pieces.  He's a bit young to fully get the rules so in the beginning we played just to pick them all up- but he's having fun, so it doesn't matter.<br /><br />We like that all the pieces stay IN THE BOX for the game, and the box itself is pretty small so we can easily store it in the sideboard in our dining room and it doesn't take up a lot of room.  We have gotten in the habit of one of us playing with him while the other parent makes dinner or starts cleaning up the kitchen.  It's great for a quick game and effective therapy.<br /><br />As a bonus, my son loves the little baskets.  He gives them to his stuffed animals, or uses them to transport other objects, even little mini cookies, to them.  He also used it when he saw we were using a basket for gathering very small tomatoes.  He also likes to &#34;plant&#34; the carrots in his sensory bean bin, and then pick them, pretending he is a farmer.<br /><br />For the price and size, it's a simple, entertaining, effective and fun game that we have consistenly since we have gotten it, and will be in heavy rotation for a long time to come.  Very pleased!
5.0	the doll that my daughter wanted.
5.0	Given as a theme gift along with a &#34;Christmas Vacation ornament, a squirrel (&#34;Welcome to the Nut House&#34;), and a &#34;Save the Neck for Me, Clark&#34; apron, this was a huge hit at our annual Christmas party.
5.0	My nephew loves these!
5.0	I ordered these buckets for my daughters birthday party. They were perfect. Came packaged very well and were in great condition. I would recommend these to anyone who might need them.
5.0	3 year old lovesssss!!! Arrived on time
5.0	Wasn't sure what to expect. But it turned out to be very soft and cuddly. My son carries this around with him.
5.0	My godaughter loved it it made her smile and that makes me happy.
1.0	I was very excited  to get this toy but it immediately begins singing every single time you roll it. Over and over. The noise is also very loud and in my opinion the song is a bad pop song you'd hear on the radio. My 2 year old rolled the plane for the first time and heard the sond, covered his ears and said &#34;loud&#34;. He found the off switch and he hasn't  turned it back on.  If the music only played when a button was pressed it would be better, and the little people don't  pop up and down like the earlier version. I've  recently found the older version at a thrift store and switched them out. Get the older one, this one is just a waste of money.
5.0	Works great for my games.
5.0	You don't see a lot of rich purple on Mattel products.. you usualy see garish purple paired with pink so this plum knit top is a pleasant surprise. It is exactly the perfect shade to compliment the denim jeans. The doll is a regular height Barbie and not one of those dreadful short ones and the package is the older and more collectible fasion fever tubes. Collectors are snapping these older dolls up  so don't miss out on any chances you have to complete your collection.<br />I prefer the Fashion fever dolls with more elaborate hairstyles but here the simple bangs and straight hair do go with the causual outfit. Also, you get  a purse.. this was made before Mattel started skimping on the accessories they included
5.0	I purchased this as a Christmas gift for my 2 year old granddaughter.  My husband put it together (fairly easy) and we brought it to her fully assembled.  It was the hit of the holiday!  She absolutely loved it and spent almost the entire day in it.  Her baby sister with either get it in a couple of years or I would buy another one for her.  With all the problems in recent times with foreign made products, I was very happy with this made in the USA toy.
5.0	I choose this rating because this plush is nicely made and not made out of the regular felt that your normal anime plush is made out of. My plush has not yet fell apart and that was a surprise to me, but I am glad I finally found one that did not fall a part as easy as my other ones.This plush does not turn into a pillow like the tag does say so if you are looking for one of those ones this is not the one for you. This plush is very soft and his head is bigger than his body and he looks like he is fat and this arms and legs just hang down, but I would never return my Kuroko Tetsuya plush for anything in the world. This is perfect for a Kuroko no Basket fan and anyone who likes Kuroko Tetsuya for this price and its a perfect fit.
5.0	This  set  is so adorable. We even got a set for my mom. The kids love it and I love it too, because it doesn't make noise. This is such a sweet set that you wont want to put it away with your Christmas stuff. Buy it now!
5.0	Holds up well wipes clean pretty easy (cover comes off but we haven't removed it). Toddler can easily turn it from couch to bed.
5.0	Ordered these cards for my 14 year old son and he absolutely loves them. Great quality and product just as advertised.
5.0	These dolls are adorable!  I ordered the twins for my two daughters, ages 3.5 and 1.  The doll head is hard plastic, but the body is soft.  You can change their clothes, which is why I say it's at least slightly educational (the kids learn how to change the clothes).  They seem to be really durable, and there also seems to be one to match nearly any personality.  I can't wait until the next birthday so I can order my girls more!
5.0	My 2 year old enjoys these puzzles. Although he doesn't use the magnets appropriately. He tends to hold the actual magnet instead of the handle. But they are super cute
5.0	girlfriend loves it. better to buy here than in an asian store.
5.0	This card can't be beat. Worth the dollars to have the chance of seeing it in your opening hand, allowing you to have 2 mana on the opening turn if you have the land. Yeah, a great card. I doubt that any card will ever be made like it again, even considering the cheatyness of the modern day cards...
5.0	I have this pen. it comes with an instruction booklet. you take care of the pet and play games. it writes and there is paper and stickers that come with it. i like this pen.
5.0	This figurine is badass. I kind of felt bad taking it out of the box because it's fairly collectible at this point, but I wanted to be able to pose her on my desk. I wasn't disappointed. Her felt skirt is pretty nifty, and allowing her to wield a Dooku hologram is just hilarious.
5.0	A nice doll. The clothes and backpack are stitched on, thankfully. Durable, squishy, small enough to carry around all day. It looks enough like Dora to satisfy a 3 year old.
5.0	EXCELENCIA EN CALIDAD, TIEMPO Y RESPUESTA INMEDIATA<br />RECOMENDABLE A TODOS LOS USUARIOS Y FUTUROS COMPRADORES DE PRODUCTOS..<br />TIENDA SERIA Y RESPONSABLE.
5.0	Carcassonne is a ton of fun, anyone saying otherwise is likely a COD fanboy who needs racist slurs yelled over hyper stimulating explosions. The game is easy to learn, the box is of high quality, and most importantly, it's perfect for a family to get together and play.<br /><br />In 5 minutes I was able to have two people who had never seen the game playing and understanding the rules. The expansions will take longer, but the tiles can with a few exceptions be used in a normal game.<br /><br />Seller shipped 4 days before expected delivery, would purchase again, and likely will for additional expansions.
5.0	This was exactly what I had imagined for a Beatrix Potter Peter Rabbit.  He is soft, cuddly and the expression is perfect.
1.0	They barely worked and broke down very easily.
5.0	MY PERSONAL FAVORITE!!!!  I lucked into these balls when I was teaching Elementary School Physical Education.  All I was looking for when I bought them was a nerf type ball, but sturdier (it is amazing how quickly nerf falls apart when so many hands are on it all day long).  To my amazement and the childrens...you cannot throw this ball without it being a perfect spiral...and catchability soars - WOW!  So if success is what you are looking for this is THE ball to have.
1.0	i just got my webkinz bull terrier and it was not a signature
1.0	The tiara arrived broken, and the coating on the wand is chipping off.  I wasn't expecting much for the price, but I did expect more than a cellophane bag for packaging.  How could this NOT arrive damaged?
5.0	Bought this for my granddaughter who thoroughly loves this. She can now clean just like her mommy. She wants to clean everything now.
5.0	Got this for a gift for my nieces (7 and 5) whose parents love the full version but they are too young to play. My sister said it's perfect and the kids loved it.  The 7 yo caught on better, the 5 yo is mostly just following along but a fun way to include younger kids in family game time.
5.0	My four year old daughter has about 5 of the ultra eBooks and whenever I ask her what she wants to have in her LeapPad2 for quiet time, half the time she says &#34;Jack and the Beanstalk!!!&#34;, which is one of the stories included. So, it comes highly reccomended from the female and four demographic. :)
1.0	This tent is poorly constructed and the support rods are separate and do not fit properly and keep coming out.  Very disappointed in the construction and quality.<br /><br />My suggestion is DO NOT buy!!!!
5.0	Very cute, just like all the POP figures are. Collecting them is very addicting! Thank you! =)
5.0	Awesome!!!<br />This one will make for the best Whovian Christmas<br />Better than the real version<br />Made for everyone!!<br />Shipped fast and safe.<br />Nice price
5.0	This was a gift for my granddaughter who loves the idea of tape (from<br />using scotch tape).  She has not played with it yet, but I think she<br />will enjoy the gift.
1.0	This item is very cheap.  The Velcro on the pieces doesn't even stick to the top part of the calendar.  All the smaller pieces ended up being cat toys...
5.0	I purchased this along with other Angry Birds for my grandson for Christmas.  He loved this one and all of them!
5.0	I am always looking for something unusual to give to the young kids for Christmas.  Since this is the year of tech buys , the MOBIMATE is a perfect companion - unusual, useful, attractive,  I love the fact that  that the MOBIMATE is a high quality stuffed bear and really facilitates the use of a tablet, laptop or a kindle.  The MOBIMATE is this year's special present under our tree for the young kids.
5.0	As I mentioned in my review of the Tiana Pop, I think the Princess and the Frog is my new favorite Pop set! The Pops are all so detailed and adorable! Louis here is no exception! He has a wonderful facial expression, and I love the pose they gave him, and the detail along his back and tail!
5.0	I'm new to building puzzles.  This might be the first one I finished in my adult life. Although a lot of the labels have similar colors I didn't find this to be too challenging.  It was fun to put the little sections together and see the label that comes out of it.  Mine had all the pieces. I would recommend this for either an individual or group activity.  As soon as we took it apart we wanted to put it together again.
5.0	"My husband purchased this (oh, how I hate to call this an \\""Advent\\"" calendar, as it has absolutely no religious worth and has nothing to do with Christmas, except that it is just a fun way to count down the days until Christmas) for our six-year old daughter.  Our daughter absolutely loves it.  She has had so much fun with it and couldn't wait everyday to open the next door.  If your child loves LEGOS and loves pirates, you can't go wrong with it - unless you actually expect/want/need your Advent calendar to be related to Christmas!!  There is even a mermaid in the set, which was a definite plus for my daughter.  Many of the pieces are very small, so be sure it is age-appropriate for the child who is receiving it.  Actually, this would probably be a great gift for a child whose parent has to go away for a month to work, such as in a military family - it would be a fun way to count down the days until Mommy or Daddy comes back home!"
5.0	All pieces were in the model and the item was fun to put together.  Item was shipped in a quick manner.
5.0	I just came inside from flying in about 5-10 mph wind and it did just great. It fell from 20 feet (due to user error) two times, and both times it fell pretty hard. I thought for sure something had broken on it, but to my surprise only the battery had popped out. I was really impressed actually.<br /><br />When I first flew it indoors I was experiencing some weird flying where it would sporadically rotate or yaw in a clockwise way almost as if it was getting a surge of power. I realized that the AA batteries in my transmitter were really low. After charging them this issue went away. So it must have been interference from having low signal strength or maybe the low signal strength was causing it. I don't know. But I'm very happy that I don't have to send it back. It is really fun to fly outdoors, because there is more room. I feel like you need the extra space with this heli.
5.0	Bought for a company picnic. Big enough that even fairly large construction worker-type guys fit in and were able to hold them up around waist height or a bit higher.
5.0	Came ahead of schedule.  Definitely adult/teen age sized.  cute!
5.0	This chess set goes far beyond my expectations. It's made if nice wood, it's extremely portable, and it's just great to take chess wherever you please. There's nothing about this board that's cheap or lackluster. I would highly recommend it. For those of you who are wondering about the strength of the magnets, they're pretty weak. But, they're more than enough. You're definitely not going to be able to play with this set during a plane crash or something but it's great for a long car ride, plane ride, or like I said previously, just to take chess wherever you please.
5.0	Yes it was nice  it was fine
1.0	Ordered this pillow for my 7 year old daughter over two months ago. She had saved her own money to purchase it. Called the company last night and was told it might ship in another month, but they are not 100% sure. I cancelled this order and found something similar on Amazon with 2 day shipping. Please do not give your money to companies who have such poor customer service. It only encourages further bad behavior. FYI, this company does sell your contact information to other companies and tries to sell you other products.
5.0	Lots of fun.  Kept the kids entertained for days,  long after party ended.
5.0	This is a fun puzzle to put together and not too difficult either.
5.0	I received the KidiStudio for review purposes. I was not compensated in any other way.<br />I have 2 kids ages 6 and 4 who enjoy music. So I was thrilled that the Kidistudio is designed for kids ages 3-6. I knew that even though my daughter is almost 7, she would still enjoy it.<br />This allows for my kids to explore a variety of musical instruments, adjust the tempo and sing along to music. They can even record their masterpiece to share with friends and family.<br />Keyboard lights up to allow kids to follow along and learn how to play their favorite melodies.<br />20 melodies are included and can be done in Rock, Hip-hop, Jazz and Techno styles. Plus there is the added feature of a voice changing microphone.<br />I liked that the included microphone can be folded down to stay out of the way when in storage. When in use it simple folds out.<br />This is a great product to allow your kids to explore what music has to offer. You can simply follow along with the music or play whatever your heart desires. My kids enjoy playing both ways with this product.
1.0	This is such a useless product. They are super tiny, just the size of my nail. I don't know how can people even use it. I am returning them.
5.0	My husband and I really like St. Petersburg.  It is right up there with Carcassonne, maybe even better.  The rules can be a bit confusingly written in a few spots, but once you get the hang of it you will like this game and play it often.
1.0	I am an avid fan of amazon and often purchase everything from toys to household items to toys here.  i am generally pleased with what i buy.  this is my first review.  This fort, priced at $28, is not only made of ridiculously cheap materials, the clips and suction cups won't hold the weight of the fabric.  i can't emphasize enough what a horrible product this is.  planning on returning it immediately.  Even if priced at $5 it would be a huge rip off.
5.0	no complaints everything was fine and as expected, I have no reason to complain so shop with confidence and ease.
5.0	Perfect for a 2 year old Xmas gift. Soft and stands up well.
5.0	More John Deere green, grandson loved this also. He is looking like a farmer like his daddy. Neat o item.
5.0	I got this for my nephew's 7th birthday present. He LOVED it.
1.0	So plastic looking .......
1.0	Terrible quality!  The plastic is so cheap and sticky it will not bounce properly.
5.0	Such an adorable set!
5.0	I haven't actually given this gift to my daughter yet who is 3 1/2 years old.  I am saving it for christmas.  Just looking at it through the packaging though it appears as though it's not the real cheap stuff if you know what I mean.  I anticipate that she will really enjoy making her own jewelry and that it will hold up.  the pieces aren't teeny tiny and I think they will be easy for her to thread the beads through herself with my help.
5.0	Great game and the kids love it.  Keeps them entertained.
5.0	This is a cute well made toy for my toddler Grandson. He is 1 I'm still teaching him how to use the remote. He likes chasing the car while we operate the remote.
5.0	Great play for my granddaughter.Quick shipping.
5.0	My daughter loves giving lambie a checkup while she's watching doc on tv. Throughout the day she'll bring lambie or stuffy over and tell me she needs her checkup kit. She's so happy with them.
5.0	kids lost them about a week after Christmas lol I am sure they're great but I have no idea where they are
5.0	Always makes for an evening of laughter. Do not play with easily offended people. Quick and easy to learn to play
5.0	Thank you, great buy,
5.0	This bird is very well made.  He is so detailed he makes me want to hug him for hours.  The cape is my favorite part because it sticks out and looks really good on him.  I have a lot of other birds in my collection and they like him a lot.  I named him Lasery because he shoots off like a laser.  He's one of the best birds I've gotten in a long time.
5.0	Impressed with how detailed this figure is! I was surprised to see there was actually two pocket computers (one open, one closed), and now the fun begins with choosing the pose. Stand feels easier to adjust compared to the one that came with Sailor Moon. Looking forward to the Mars figure next year! ^^
5.0	Really great figure, brand new. I love it! :D
5.0	I received little quadcopter as a fun birthday gift from a friend.<br />This has probably been one of the most fun quirky gifts I have received.<br /><br />First time I used it, it darted up to hit the ceiling, hit a tv, then popped a propeller. I found the propeller and easily reattached it. It is designed to easily reattached.<br />Battery life is pretty good, I usually charge mine for about 25 minutes and it lasts for maybe 5 minutes of flight time. The box does not come with AAA batteries needed for the remote.<br />Overall a fun gift for an adult.<br />Not good for pets, my dog wants to know what the flying mini vacuum tastes like.<br />Not good for small children, many small pieces.
5.0	Not too many kids still like Pokemon cards but I know I still do. These cards are great! You get 5 booster packs and 2 garunteed holos(not counting the ones you get from the boosters)I even got 2 Shiftrys and a Sharpedo!(for all you parents out there it`s like winning the lottery)This is a great gift for holiday season, birthday etc. The only bad thing is your little brother/sister might be begging you for all the awsome cards you get! P.S.This is great for any Pokemon fan!
5.0	My 4 year old granddaughter loves to change her dolls clothes.  She was so glad to get a new supply.
1.0	el perro funciona pero la correa q lo hace caminar con dirección ya se daño no duro ni un mes y ahora mi hija no puede pasear al perro no lo recomiendo
5.0	Love all the Green Toys products I've seen so far. They are simple, very sturdy and free of many of the hazardous chemicals found in a lot of cheap toys (and also thankfully free of the ubiquitous marketing tie-ins of most modern toys) . Best of all my 2 year daughter loves every one as well. This little boat floats well in the tub but is relatively easy to capsize in the pool with other kids. It has drainage holes to empty any water it may take on board, so no bilge pump required.
5.0	Awesome and exactly as described.
5.0	Nice rims. Includes NISMO decals for each rim.
1.0	This product took a long time to deliver a TINY crayon and was extremely difficult to clean up to make any more crayons. The child and father would rather do more rewarding things than to take too much time to make a mess which is HARD to clean up!
5.0	Awesome game!  The product was shipped quickly and was received in great shape.  It arrived just as promised. I am very happy with my purchase. :)
5.0	My 2 year old loves playing with this. A new fan of WOW toys here. Keep waiting for more good deals to add to our new collection.
5.0	both sets of grand children loved it
5.0	my grandsons just love these little creatures. very sturdy plastic. make great toys in the sandbox for burying and finding.
5.0	great sleeves, very smooth, shuffle VERY well!
5.0	Bought 3 of these for my neice ( 4 yrs) for Christmas and she LOVES them!  Soft, good size and look amazing!  She even takes them to bed each night.  Recently she just nursed them back from sickness (:-).
5.0	Great product! Timely shipping!
1.0	It was way more expensive than any other place to purchase therefore it was the only place I could find it.
5.0	Product was received as described and the quality of the product was excellent. I would recommend this product to others.
5.0	To give this product 5 stars is just not enough. I loved the tiny whimsical vases. I bought it for myself since I do dolls and their accessories with their home collections. I have bought these tiny flowers and when I saw the vases i fell totally in love with them too. They are life like but in mini's. PLEASE make more like these. Thankyou very much, yours truly Zeny from da block.
5.0	These napkins are not only bright and exciting, but they are ideal for Day of the Dead Celebrations.  Really, these are abstract enough to be used for many occasions. Sick of the traditional black-and-orange Halloween theme? Searching for something neon and perky for a birthday party? Look no further.
5.0	Daughter loves to play with these on her little people zoo
5.0	Great toy for the price.
5.0	it amazing set , and they came on time
5.0	"My daughter adores this cat and has pretty much taken it everywhere. Thankfully it's made of durable material since it's been getting lots of \\""baths\\"" in the washer. She actually got upset the first couple of times it had \\""a bath\\"", since it's very life like. It's a smaller version of our actual cat, and this one won't be upset about being dressed up in doll clothes, and being lugged around the house in a doll stroller."
5.0	I just bought two of these sleeping bags, one in each color, for my girls' American Girl Bitty Twins. I was very surprised by the excellent quality! They are wicked cute, seem durable, extremely well made, and my girls love them. Definitely worth the price and I think they're cuter than the American Girl sleeping bags!
5.0	Love these!  They are a cheaper alternative to the name brand plates and work just as well.  My son had no complaints about them either.
5.0	I bought these to go in my gaming room where I use them to hold up video games. They work very well as book ends and seem like good build quiality.
5.0	A great puzzle!  Nice patterns!
5.0	good product.Butt i think that start bottons are better than cords to starts talking sistems,ok?Please sends review to the toy factory.I receive very fast and all is perfect.Thanks a lott.Will
5.0	Prêt-&agrave;-Porter is an economic strategy worker replacement game created by Piotr Haraszczak and Ignacy Trzewiczek. The game puts you in control of one of several fashion companies trying to make your mark in the industry. The game is good for 2-4 players.<br /><br />Now note that the game has players playing the roles of fashion companies and not fashion designers. The actual clothes are but a small part of this entire game equation. Thus you need to think about the salaries of your staff, the quality of your materials for your clothes and of course what to put on the runway at the next fashion show. And this is what everything really boils down to since the fashion shows are the primary venues for actually making money.<br /><br />The game plays out across a 12-month calendar year. In a manner of speaking, each month represents a particular game round where players take turns performing various actions. But the tricky bit is that there are also 4 fashion shows that take place every third month where players can show off their clothes and get a chance to actually sell them for money. Thus you have the core game pattern of 2 months of preparation followed by a fashion show month.<br /><br />In those two months of preparation, players will scramble to put together a viable collection for the fashion show - although you also have the option to wait out a show and focus on the next one instead. But given money is typically made during fashion shows, you really can't survive for long. Back to preparation, players vie for limited worker slots to come up with designs for clothes, purchase materials for said clothes and possibly hire additional staff or rent new facilities. And the diversity of your preparation options reflect the many ways one can win notice on the runway.<br /><br />Their are several possible criteria for judging at the fashion show, and these come up in random order based on the cards the represent the various city locations. The March fashion show only involves one city and this steadily increases to four cities come December. The possible criteria are Size of Collection, Trend, Quality, and PR. And given this is a competition, you need to come out first in order to win big - tying does not make you a winner after all. And thus players end up mapping their collections based on the projected cities for the different shows, something which is openly identified at the start of the year when you begin the game. All the tools for your success are pretty much laid out ahead of you as long as you're smart about things.<br /><br />It's easy to get buried in debt early in the game. You start with only $40,000 and this has to cover the wages of your employees (you start the game accountable for three basic staff members who have no direct game benefits) and the rent of your additional buildings, but you also need  buy the materials for your clothes and determine what quality you can afford in order to break even come fashion month. You could take out a loan, then you'll still need to settle accounts during the next fashion month anyway. And if at anytime you fail to pay your obligations in a given month, you will end up taking a &#34;mandatory loan&#34;, which quite frankly feels like an infusion of cash from organized crime. Interest rates get crazy and you can quickly fall deeper and deeper in debt if you're not careful.<br /><br />Unlike other worker replacement games like Lords of Waterdeep, there are a finite number of slots for your workers. There is no option to expand or add additional worker slots to the board - plus each section only offers up to 3 worker slots. Given a four-player game, someone is bound to miss out on key items like more designs or perhaps more affordable materials. In every game we've played, the level of stress in this game is a lot higher than Waterdeep.

5.0	I'm sure someone's said it somewhere already, but this is like Apples To Apples for all your dark, twisted, hilarious and mischievous inner children. EXCELLENT to play with your teenagers. Not many games for bridging the generations like this does. No, wait, there are NONE like this!
5.0	Grand daughter is going to flip.  This is possibly one of the best deals I have run across.
5.0	my step son  loves these. We got them for his new room  and he was ecstatic, super high quality , sticks well, comes with a handy tool for application. 10/10  would buy again !
5.0	Great product. Thank you
1.0	Poor quality. It didn't work. But good probably for make believe with the littler ones.
5.0	My daughter loves this robot and she carries it around everywhere. She is already learning with alphie and she got it for Christmas.
5.0	My grandsons loved this. Anything Lego is great!
5.0	I bought this for my nephews age 3 and 6.  They both love it and can't get enough of it. I needed something that was not easily breakable. These kids break everything. They haven't found a way to break this one yet though! It was very easy to put together.
5.0	These are gorgeous and will be perfect for my son's Peter Rabbit themed party!
5.0	11 days to delivery!! The best item!! Thanks!!
5.0	Fun for Halloween Party - They fit all the various bottles.  Great conversation pieces for the adults.  I will purchase next year too.
5.0	My 2 year old can change the clothes with little assistance and LOVES it
5.0	I love this doll. It tells about how a Jewish family in the early 1900's might have lived. Rebecca is a lively girl with a dramatic flair, who yearns to be a movie actress. Rebecca is a traditional Jewish doll. The only down side is that the American Girl dolls are too expensive.
1.0	A waste of money. Don't purchase this Barbie if you are looking to have all of the fun glitterly extras. It is not worth it. Barbie's are not made as well as they used to be. Case in point this Barbie. I found it to be cheaply made. First her hair broke off  as you combed it. Second her clothes felt cheap and than there is the glitter patterns. They do not stick to Barbie's hair very well. That is if you can get the pattern to come off the paper first. If you want to keep some of the patter in Barbie's hair then you can not style it after you put the pattern on. Don't worry as you can change designs by just combing it out. Also the glitter was messy so by careful where you play with Barbie.
1.0	Initially, we thought these balloons would be the best invention ever.  The majority of them filled up just fine but we found that there were many with pin holes in the balloons.  After a couple of hours, we only had about 35 balloons that actually held the water.  The rest had holes in them.  Such a disappointment!
5.0	Took 5 min to set up. My son plays with it every day. I would buy it again. the lowest setting is perfect size for him since he is only two. he'll get a lot of use out of it!
5.0	Okay, so pardon the above pun, but my son has loved the pounder since 6mo of age.  We look for quality toys from SAFE companies.  Plan Toys provides safe toys free from BPA, phthalates, or lead paint.  The balls are stained, not painted, so they won't ever chip!  We also look for toys that will grow with our child.<br /><br />As an infant, he liked to mouth/teeth on the balls and mallet.  When he started crawling, he had TONS of fun crawling after the balls on our hardwood floors.  They were great crawling incentives.  Then, he worked on dumping things out, and now, at 9.5 months, he is working on putting the balls back in.  I know the Mallet will eventually double as a hammer for work projects, and someday, it will be great for teaching color sorting/cause and effect and coordination/motor skills.  It will be a long time, I think, until he is able to use it for it's intended use.  Before they are able to use the mallet to move the balls, the child can press the balls down to make the next one pop up.<br /><br />It's wonderful!  (And the balls fit other Plan ball toys, too.)
5.0	I have a son who is autistic and fell in LOVE with the Wreck It Ralph movie. He saved up his money for a Fix It Felix, and after browsing the limited selection decided on this plush. Very well constructed product, which honestly surprised me with it's quality. My son has dragged him everywhere for 2 months now, and so far, so good. No flaking of the gold hammer or rips in the fabric, which again, surprised me. Would definitely recommend!
1.0	It broke within 3 minutes. It now does not work at all. It can not even write, let alone make sounds. Cheaply made.
5.0	Bought as gift. Sphere is huge, kids have a great time with it. Heavy duty plastic hasn't come apart in any way.
5.0	Great product for a teenager.  Used it for looking at coins.
5.0	These tools are perfect for real yard word with your little guy.  I can't wait for the leaves to start falling.
5.0	My granddaughter sleeps with it ! She love's it no matter whatever it is ??
5.0	wodnerful, inexpensive, very sturdy and seemingly safe so far. kids had a blast from ages two to ten with them.
5.0	Beautiful! Arrived quickly and very well and attractively packaged.
5.0	Great accessory for any Elsa for Halloween or Frozen themed party. My daughter plans to use hers for both. She was Elsa for Halloween but she is also having a Frozen themed party and can't wait to use all her Elsa stuff. This magic wand lights up and blinks in different patterns. If your little girl loves Frozen - this is a great buy.
5.0	Very well made. Same pricing as the plastic ones that tend to fall apart easily.
5.0	Good product, I use them to store my &#34;junk&#34; silver and helpse keep inventory of what I have.  Lids screw on tight, nice quality.
5.0	We started out small with a starter set and after a year we added more to, my kids have had these for about three or four years and still break them out, they are educational in that they a geometric shapes that inspire construction and creation of 3D shapes and ideas.
5.0	Arrived as stated, can't wait to try this product!
5.0	Cute as can be..small enough to use in kinetic sand box in our playroom.  Well made.
5.0	Cute little trophies :)
5.0	Grand daughter loved it, arrived ahead of schedule too
5.0	"My 2 1/2 old grandson can't get enough of these puzzles. When he visits, he doesn't even take off his coat -- he heads right to the toy cupboard and announces, \\""I do my puzzles.\\"" The images are clear and uncluttered with recognizable subject matter, and the border colors provide great solving clues."
5.0	My granddaughter loves playing doctor in this outfit.  Length of the outfit may run a little large.
5.0	This model is highly detailed and true to scale (N scale).  It is sturdy, not delicate, as to cause problems with large hands moving about the Train Yard, bumping into things.  I am very satisfied with this model and how it enhances my locomotive maintenance area of my small<br />N scale layout.
1.0	My sister bought one for her husband and we used it ALL DAY on Christmas.  I got one for my boyfriend for Christmas-it ran for about 5 minutes, then the controls just crapped out.  He'd try to shut it off and it would keep running.  When he wanted it to take off, he'd power it on all the way and NOTHING. Haven't contacted the company yet, but it looks like we're responsible for shipping, and for the cost of $20 for the helicopter it's not worth it which I'm sure is what the company counts on.  I wouldn't buy another one.
5.0	This puppet appears to be high quality and durable. It is large and quite impressive. The puppet aspects of it might be hard to use for small hands but I did not buy it to use as a toy, rather as a display item.
5.0	2 and 4 year-old daughters love this display
5.0	hi i had wrote about the cheap shipping on a site.  It looks like everyone went out and bought it right away they were sold out within 12-15 hours.  luckily they had them back in within 2 days.  So then i purchased one for my little princess.  I was shocked to see them sold out that soon expecially how late i wrote the review.  This is a great toybox.  They seem to last forever.  and mine still looks new.
5.0	We thought this was a great deal. No complaints about the quality of the bands, however some where slightly off-color, but it was a very small number, and when you're talking 1800 pieces, it was a total non-issue in my mind. We will be buying them again!
5.0	Great quality item.  We are very happy with it and it was worth our money.  No complaints.  Definately the real thing. Highly recommended.
5.0	This is great! Love the little storage for the dice so you can store it in your purse or car.
5.0	This game is a crowd pleaser for both kids and adults.  It is a great way to enjoy some quality family time together.  The sturdy construction ensures hours of playing time.  My kids just love to play this old school game.  Just goes to show you that the simple games are still the best!
5.0	This is a great game. Lots of fun to play with both adults and kids. Anyone over the age of 8 or 9 should be able to play this one. Don't play this with sour losers though, they'll just get frustrated. Make sure you always have a banana nearby and don't wear anything blue!
5.0	Awesome game. Perfect for little hands. Gave it to my son for his third birthday. It's his favorite and we can play it anywhere. Am considering buying a second one to add more pieces.
5.0	A wonderful game for the whole family- expect lots of laughs!
5.0	So cute.  I love Webkinz hamsters.  This one is for my granddaughters first birthday.  Kids love playing with this size of toy.
5.0	This comes with two good decks. The Coalition is very interesting and can be evolved any number of ways, (I made mine a dragon deck) and is a very well built deck. I also like Phyrexia because it does have some big creatures and gets very powerful. I mainly kept Phyrexia as is, except for removing a few cards and adding Lilliana Vess and Sheoldred. Having seen these I am exited to look at other dual decks, and think that this is a very good buy.
5.0	"Four year old recipient loves dinosaurs in general and has a blast interacting this one with others in the series. Would recommend getting at one or two more in the set (there are six total) as kids get a kick out of the interaction as they \\""talk\\"" to each other."
5.0	This Push Toy was a big hit with my great grandchild on his first birthday.  My grandson sent me the video.  He was on the verge of walking.  &#34;Now I can walk&#34;, he was thinking.
5.0	Bought this for my granddaugher's 6th B-Day gift since she loves animals soooooo much. She loved this gift and is spending a lot of time enjoying it.... and so is her 8 year old sister!!!<br /><br />Good creative play and this offers lots of room for fun interactive play for sure!
5.0	My niece collects these little cute purses. Very cute.
5.0	My son collected most of them. they are very good quality and sturdy. I loved the size as well, very portable. they are easy to transform back and forth and keep they form.
5.0	We got this for my daughters play at school and we loved it. Very durable! She wants the other ones now.
5.0	I chose this rating of 5 because my grandson absolutely loves this. He totally did not expect to get this so he was double excited. The parents made a video and sent to us as he opened the present.
5.0	Purchased the Shadow and Thunder fury swords for my son (4 y/o) and picked this up for myself. The weight is perfect, the design is solid, and it doesn't hurt to get hit with.  He can swing it pretty well, but obviously with a serious lack of control.  It was a lot like watching the drunk scene from Conan the Destroyer.  The swords (all of them actually) have held up really well, and I would recommend them for any sword loving kid over the age of 5. (The Fury swords are great for 2 - well, any age really)
1.0	This is just not worth it, doesn't work well, I purchased this for my grandson and it was such a disappointment I don't think he really used it once because the quality was that bad.
5.0	great product and service just as expected thank you
5.0	I'm a huge fan of Supernatural so finding Sam was like hitting the Lottery!! Absolutely love it! Reasonably priced as well! Thanks
5.0	Nerf Rebelle Bow Set made for girls, is so cool, and I love the girly colors! My daughter loves this thing. I don't think it shoot quite as far as it says, but with a little elbow grease, it flies far enough. Great item for pretending to be on the Hunger Games! Look out Katniss, my daughter is hunting for you!!
5.0	My grand-daughter loved this Barbie doll.  It was a birthday gift.  It is beautiful and I'd recommend it to Barbie collectors.
5.0	My husand and I and our toddler LOVE this Aquadoodle Mat!  It has a large surface.  There is no mess to clean up.  It comes with multiple drawing tools and our son likes to use one and give us the other to draw with him.  The drawing tools also store in a pocket that is part of the mat.  Great for travel too!
5.0	Alot of fun to make with the kids. The ice cream is good but the candy packs are not. Easy to use and clean up.
5.0	Everyone loves this game, hours of entertainment and laughter!
5.0	Got this for a gift for a 5 year old through Salvation Army - I got a note saying the boy really wanted Legos.  At first i thought about maybe a star wars set or something like that.  But then thought back on my childhood and the MEGA bucket and how many hundreds of hours i spent making anything that I thought up of.  Unfortunately i Couldnt afford the MEGA Blocks because i wanted this kid to open more than 1 gift for Christmas.  So i went a step down got this, which at over 600 peices, should help get this kids Lego obsession started!!
5.0	My 2 year old son absolutly loves this house. My father in law had to come snap it together, but besides that it has been a great toy to have on our back deck. Everyday my little man looks forward to going down the slide and going in and out of his door, and sitting at his picnic table. I would highly recommend this to parents with young children.
5.0	Love it! Can't wait to give it to my son for his first birthday!!!!
5.0	Cute!!! Daughter loved it!!!
5.0	The vendor is SUPER quick!  It only took about a week when it said it would take a month..!<br /><br />Great product; my favorite medium to fix my inking mistakes.<br /><br />For those wanting to buy, the Deleter White 2 is thick, almost gouache-like consistency.  I add a bit of product into a separate container with a bit of water to thin it out.  Do not add water directly into the jar of Deleter because it will eventually mold (trust me!).
5.0	Legends was the third expansion to the insanely popular collectible card game Magic: the Gathering.  It was also the first large expansion, featuring 382 cards.  It introduced multi-colored cards and the legend card type, and featured many cards that are considered some of the most powerful Magic cards ever released (including the blue counterspell Mana Drain--counted by many among the top 10 Magic cards ever).  It featured 5 'Elder Dragon Legends,' 3 color dragon cards that, at the time, were quite powerful and very popular.    This is a great set for collectors.  As is the case with many of the older Magic sets there are several cards that don't really fit well within the Magic dynamic, and some cards that would probably never make it into expansion sets today (like the white card Moat).  Card for card, however, Legends comes up short compared to other sets, as many of the common cards don't have much value outside of their collectibility.  There are many cards that have quirky and interesting abilities (like the kobolds), though most of the cards in the set wouldn't be considered useful in today's Magic environment.  Considering the price I wouldn't be buying expansion packs with the intent of opening them, since most of the really good cards have either been reprinted in subsequent sets or are so powerful you wouldn't be able to play them in most tournaments anyway (when I was playing a lot I loved tossing my Mana Drain around, but only in casual play).      Legends is a great set, if not necessarily for overall playability (again, many of the common cards are fairly useless).  If nothing else it harkens back to the old days of Magic, when every creature did not have to have an ability to make it into someone's deck.  Look into it if you're interested in Magic history or for nostalgia purposes, but don't expect to build a Kobold or Elder Dragon Legend deck and make it too far against the cards of today.
5.0	Super cute, our almost 2 year old son loves it! The canister in the back can be filled with water so you can &#34;pump and spray&#34; it, and the entire truck is super charming. The only thing I wish is that the side had a door that opened- however, one side is lower than the other (as you can see in the photo) so child can climb in that way. For the adult, you can lean over and push it around while holding on to the white rails-so that is nice. Horn beeps, wheel turns. All in all, really cute product.
5.0	[[ASIN:B004NM55BU LISA FRANK Sticker Book ~ Over 1850 Stickers - 2nd Official Collector's Set!]] I have looked through this book about 5 times. The stickers are thick enough, & seem like they won't give any problems. The colors are real, just as you see them online or better; very brilliant colors & glossy. These stickers will add color & style to everything she uses them on. I know my 9 year old great-goddaughter, will love them. I plan to write a note on the 1st page in the diary she is getting with these, & other stuff for her birthday. So I am trying to decide which sticker to use to go beside my entry in her diary. It is hard to choose! They have several duplicates of most of them, so she will be able to use the same one over again. I it has a lot of animals that she will love, hearts, peace signs, hearts made with several colors,or joined with other graphic designs, & so much more. Some are larger, & some are small stickers, but all are so very lovely. It was well worth the money!
5.0	My five year old son wanted a Accordion for his birthday. It was the one gift he was asking for, so I hit the PC and tried to locate one for him. I found this and after reading reviews went with it. I am pleased I did. The instrument is sturdy and crafted well. I think my son will be able to use this for years! I was surprised to hear real notes and tunes being played. Impressed with the quality! I do believe that it would be a bit nicer if it had a strap that went around him like other Accordions... BUT if you are looking for a fun &#34;toy&#34; that your child can practice on....go for it!
1.0	Cheap and poorly made.
5.0	Love this. A huge improvement from the previous version. Works as an MP3 player too. My kids love it! And it has a large storage space. I've never run out of space, and I have a LOT of books on it.
5.0	Good value, great little game. Easy to teach
1.0	I bought two of these quadcopters because I thought it's the same as the Estes Proto-X which I have a few. The two share very similar parts with the major difference being the electronics and software. That is what makes the Croto-X inferior to the Proto-X. The Proto-X performs far better than the Croto-X in all categories. Here are the problems with the Croto-X.<br />1. It loses communication out to about 20ft and doesn't go near the 100ft said in its description. It's likely due to poor antenna design using a wire for an antenna that's not matched. The Proto-X flies much further with its meandering f antenna that is likely tuned. I was able to improve the flying range of the Croto a bit by standing its antenna vertically out of the body.<br />2. It's motors do not spin in unison. It's uneven or sometimes one motor doesn't even spin. You might find the rest of the motors spinning at full speed which causes the quad to flip on the ground. The quadcopter needs to be turned off and be initialized again with the controller. The Proto-X always spin in unison with appropriate speed like a quad should do.<br />3. The initialization routine of the Croto-X doesn't always work. The Croto will remain flashing and will never be ready to arm so it will need to be power cycled. The Proto-X works 100% of the time and arms quickly to fly.<br /><br />There is also an arming sequence the instructions failed to mention. After initialization the red leds goes into a slow blink. You have to move the stick to full throttle then back to zero. You will hear a beep at each end of the stick movement. After this arming sequence then will the red leds go solid, indicating ready to fly.<br /><br />The Croto and Proto controllers are not interchangeable.<br /><br />Avoid this quad and pay the extra to get the Proto-X! Thank god I can return this garbage back to Amazon.
5.0	Super for the girl that desires to style hair. Perfect for her to use on friends hair and even dolls hair
5.0	Bright light great toy
5.0	One of the funniest, most engaging games I've played in a long time. Definitely NOT for children. I'm hard to embarrass and even for me, I would say that I'd have a hard time playing with anyone under the age of 18 because some of the cards are deliciously raunchy, for sure. Perfect for girls night in, and for breaking the ice - and quickly - with folks you've only recently met; we played with new neighbors and after the first couple of rounds it was as if we had known each other forever and we were all laughing so hard we could barely contain ourselves! Not a family night game. Probably not a game you want to play with your mom. ;)
5.0	"Note: The version of this toy sold (only?) at Toys R Us is My Mystery UFO made by Do & Discover by Edu Science is the version of this toy that I purchased. I believe it might be of better quality. That is what I am reviewing.  I purchased this as a Christmas present for my husband, but I was the first to give it a try. I made sure I was alone so that I could surprise him with a presentation of the UFO's \\""flight\\"". I used the practice thread, and within a half an hour I felt confident enough to try using one of the super thin, polymer threads. They are pretty hard to see, and get caught in their attached putty and can break. So take your time when you unwind them. Once you have the putty attached behind your ear and on the UFO, it doesn't matter that they are so thin. You don't need to see the thread to work it, and they are as easy to use as the practice thread.  After a bit more practice (about 45 minutes total) I demoed the toy for my family. They were absolutely flabbergasted! I was in a moderately lit room, and I was wearing a white shirt (which the instructions advise against), but my family could not see any sign of the thread. After demoing for a while, I gave in to their requests to give it a try. I was able to remove the putty from the underside of the UFO top without their seeing me. Then it was my turn to be amused as they tried fruitlessly to make it fly while I gave them \\""pointers\\"".   It was my 6 year old daughter, who, growing ever more frustrated, spat out \\""There must be an invisible thread that I can't see. How can I make it work if I can't see the invisible thread???!!!\\"" that made me feel like a rat and relent. So I showed them how the illusion worked. My husband is one of the most observant people I have ever met, and he had no clue that I was using a thread until I showed him.  So for all you rubes who thought you would discharge some special kind of static or electromagnetic energy from your hands, GET REAL and GET OVER it. It's an illusion, and adarned good one. It clearly states that twice in the product description: \\""Amaze your friends with the floating, hovering illusion of My Mystery UFO.\\"" \\""No one will ever guess it's an illusion.\\""  It also takes a little practice, and patience. Some people will be better at it than others. I found it pretty easy to make it float and spin beautifully. After repeated attempts, my husband's presentation was still rough. He uses too much force. Spin it and move your body slowly and smoothly, and you will amaze and entertain people! Even if your hands DON'T emit some unworldly energy! (^_^)"
5.0	I got it to replace the one my child had that I broke. I think that it is funny. My child can put the puzzle together but as her mother I could not get it together. As a child it was fun. As a mother it was funny that at my age it did not work. It was great fun.
5.0	I love the product. It was delivered quickly and I am very happy with it.
5.0	We hung this on our childs ceiling.  The hanging options leave a bit to be desired, but overall we've had no problems with it.  It's very neat and is being enjoyed thrououghly.
5.0	Perfect for any Sharknado survivor! I love the blood and the condition was perfect.
5.0	I originally thought my daughters power wheels Cadillac escalade was headed for the curb. It was very slow and the battery would die quick. I bought a new battery and after two charges performance started to get worse and worse. I hoped that the charger was the problem and saw this rapid charger and gave it a shot. It's been an awesome addition. Now her car is running like the day it was new. This quick charger is also much better than waiting 15 hrs compared to the original charger. Must buy!!!
5.0	Not only huggably soft and lovable, but comes with a code to enter the wonderful online world of Webkinz and create a pet; play fun and educational games to earn points to feed and stylishly clothe and accessorize your beloved pet, as well as furnish its cozy, ultramodern home. Too many and diverse games to grow bored anytime soon!
5.0	I highly recommend this set. It includes a ton of little accessories and the large princess ponies have been a huge hit. They have provided hours and hours of non stop entertainment for my daughter. They are solid and have held up well to abuse. Their hair gets matted relatively easily but our solution has been to soak them in a bucket overnight with fabric softener and have a beauty salon session with them the following day. My daughter particularly likes that Nightmare moon and Princess What's-her-face both have little lace dresses.
5.0	We got this without expectations and hung it at adult knee/kid level and our little ones enjoy walking by and reviewing their letters.  It is spaced by the characters which provides a visual break.<br /><br />Good product.
5.0	Got this for my 2 year old who is obsessed with Thomas and he LOVES it. Super cute, pillow like and fairly large. He totes it around and sleeps with it.
5.0	I'm so glad that I found this toy for my grandson/s 1st birthday. He is still learning how to press the different buttons, but for now he loves to close them after they pop up. I think it's an excellent learning toy.
5.0	My kid loved it, even though the airplane doesn't have wheels.
5.0	Christmas gift, they love it!
1.0	My son counted the days until this kendama arrived and he had it out of the box in no time.  Bad news is that the string came out within his first hour of use...So he got very little use out of it.<br />It may have just been a bad one, as we would love to have a new one to replace it!
5.0	Good condition, in the collection, just so I can have a green one, a blue one and a red one :)
5.0	changes color just like it says. My 2 102 year old granddaughter loves it. Good size. Well worth the money
5.0	Couldn't be happier! Both the contents (figure, accessories, etc.) and the box were in excellent condition.  This is a must have for any Fett-fan!
5.0	I love it its so cute.
5.0	Great tool for my students as they learn to use a resource.
5.0	4 year old granddaughter plays with this all the time
5.0	This was a beautiful and wonderful gift for my son who is a Sonic the Hedgehog fanatic.  It can before the due date and in excellent condition.  Thank you so much for your courteous attention.
1.0	It really stinks when you have to sew it up the minute you get it!!!!
5.0	I bought two brand new sets for my kids. Everything was delivered on time.
5.0	When paired with a 54t spur it added acceleration and speed to my 4x4 Stampede! Great with 3s lipo! The 17t pinion I purchased had slightly better top end speed but was horrible for bashing and going slow. Gear slipped at slow speeds. This 14T pinion is a perfect balance for speed/bashing!
5.0	Literally THE best game I have ever played. It is a stellar game to play with friends. Enough said.
5.0	My daughter loves these puzzles!
5.0	"A pleasure to have in his puppet repertoire!  Mine were of good quality, so maybe this company is hit and miss- the first toys we have purchased from them.  A coupel of the puppets are tighter fitting than others, which is great so different sized fingers can use them.  He loves the \\""space dog\\"" puppet, and it is fun to have such unique little puppets for his cardboard box theatre!"
5.0	My son loves the truck . The wheels are really big ... I only wished that the wheels were a harder rubber since my son is very rough on toys . Good deal for the price
5.0	This train set was an awesome deal.  It's obviously a little cheaper made than the Thomas tracks but sturdy none the less.  It fits our Thomas tracks with no problem.  The hills you would.probably want to glue because they come apart easily.  But overall for the money its a great set.
5.0	If you are looking for owners opinion about this cube then I'll tell  you, it's best, take it, You will not be sorry. And I love stickerless cubes they are best for everyday use.
5.0	We got the complete set of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles characters for our son for Christmas and he loves them all.  Good quality and holding up well to hard play.
5.0	We have played this game as a family for years, and have started playing with (grown up) friends. It's fun and easy to learn.
5.0	I've been a fan of Voltron since the show first aired in the 80's. Never would have considered becoming a collector until I broke down and ordered the first die-cast set. The Black Lion is still in the box and sealed just like the Keith Figure. The main reason for getting into collecting this set is they form an almost 2' tall Voltron. As an adult collector I have no plans to remove these toys from their original packages and play with them. However, if you are going to give this as a gift to a child keep in mind that they are plastic. All though they will tolerate some light abuse they are not indestructible.
5.0	Item arrived on time and looks great. Thank you!
5.0	My boys love this.  8 year old and 6 year old.  It takes 8 D batteries and goes kinda slow but so cool!!!!!!  Where were these when I was a kid,  I did order 2 and got the exact same color, so far that is my only complaint.  I have no idea how to store these while out of pool so for now, they are in the garage.  We used them twice so far so hope they last without deflating....
1.0	Very poor Quality, It won't last even a week.<br />All legs will break after a week. I will not recommend it to anyone... Hazardous to kid<br />Amazon should not entertain such cheap product.
5.0	My 5 year old loves it.
5.0	This cow is so cute, my toddler picked him out. He is obsessed with dancing animals. It sings Maroons 5 song &#34; Moves like Jagger&#34; but instead it says &#34; Moo like jagger...very cute for old and young. Was pricey I thought at first but quality worth it once received. Came on time, would be a cute gift for a Valentine!
5.0	My grandchildren totally loved this item. They enjoyed putting it together and it was alot of fun. They display it in their rooms.
5.0	Waddles is the cutest little dude this side of the arctic circle and my girlfriend loves him so much she cuddles with him every night.
5.0	It has held up nice and is significantly cheaper than ones you will find in the store. Even including the price of shipping, it comes out cheaper. I think this battery is actually higher quality than the one I originally got with the power wheels I purchased. Definitely a great buy.
5.0	buy turbotron helmet now! the buy turbotron helmet now! buy turbotron helmet now! buy turbotron helmet now! buy turbotron helmet now! buy turbotron helmet now! buy turbotron helmet now! buy turbotron helmet now! or else!
5.0	Hard to find item, happy to find on Amazon. Just what I wanted!
1.0	I bought these thinking that there would be 10, 13ft long strings of these and there is just one.  I could have bought this same thing at party city for $5.00. Definitely would have been worth the money I spent if there had been 10 of these in the packaging. But it was not.<br /><br />Disappointed.
1.0	I would advice to get a different brand of alphabet magnets for your kids. These alphabets have no strength to stick properly. Aesthetically they look too average.
5.0	This toy is well made and a hit with the two year olds in our childcare.
5.0	As soon as I got these I added them to my keychain collection. I love them so much. For any fan of Sgt. Frog, these are a MUST to get!
5.0	This DC universe Toys are great, my kids love them, and can not be find any where else, so I'm very happy!!
1.0	This is very poor quality.  It broke the first time we inflated it.  My girls didnt' even get to try it out.  The older model was made of thicker material and lasted a few seasons.  They should bring that back instead of this.
5.0	This is my sons' fav thing to do since the day it has arrived
5.0	We bought this for our 21 month old and she loves it!  She doesn't steer too well yet, but other than that she can work it just fine.  This jeep has done really well on concrete and grass.  The battery has lasted for 2 or more days before needing recharged.  My husband say's it was fairly easy to put together as well.  Our daughter is having loads of fun with this!
5.0	I have a young child 8 who has many difficulties this toy and others like it really help her to calm down when other things do not work. We are very happy with this purchase.
5.0	My Son loved this whole set of toys, he played with them for hours on end and I think he saved some for when he has children of his own.
5.0	I was very pleased with this little baby doll. It was a Christmas present for my daughter, and she loves it, too. Great value, super shipping time, and big smiles for a little girl!
5.0	Very Nice! Ready to put the surf board on the roof and drive to the beach. Five Stars!
5.0	East to fly. And for the price you can't go wrong. It is so much fun to fly a young kid can fly this.
5.0	The kidrobot figures are great for any Simpsons collector & I especially love the Treehouse of Horror line! They aren't all that big or poseable but they're a perfect display piece & I enjoy the mystery of opening each box.
5.0	I gave this Tonka Light and Sound Fire Engine as a gift for Christmas and the recipent loves it.  The sounds and lights really hit it off with the little guy.
5.0	This friendly bear has the charming to be huggable since the first time you see it. My nephew loves it! It is the kind of toy that everybody wants to play  with it.<br />It is made of a very good quality (Gund is warranty).
5.0	We love this game and play it after dinner with friends at home.  We usually don't pay attention to the time, and next thing we know it's midnight or one o'clock.
5.0	Boy was this a hit when my niece's sons visited. They really enjoyed playing on the mat with their toys and it was heavy enough to lay flat and not bunch up.
5.0	Granddaughter just loves them. Fits perfectly in her little purse for when she goes to daycare or just a ride in the car.
5.0	Nice for feelfree kayaks. Fits almost all rod holders and depth finders. Must have for a feelfree yak. It is kind of weak since it hangs over the side. Don't expect to jerry rig a trolling motor to that piece. Overall the uni track uses small screws so still don't jerry rig a trolling motor to it lol.
5.0	Crayola, who don't love them? Stay away from cheap brand specially foreign brand as they may contained poison and lead.
5.0	"I purchased this mic today for my 6-year-old.  Maybe I got lucky or they changed the quality, but this mic works fabulously for a $10 toy.  Although I can only get it to work on 1 frequency in northern NJ (around the 100 dial), it comes in loud and clear.  The manufacturer is Creative Designs Int'l Ltd, which is not mentioned on the Amazon website.  They should label the package better to say that you don't sing along with the radio station, but you sing on a \\""vacant\\"" airwave to whatever music you've got playing elsewhere.  Again, for $10 bucks, it's a hit at my house!"
5.0	These are fantastic for both my 3 year old boy & 5 year old girl. They can literally sit and play with these brightly colored tiles for hours. I pack them up and bring them to office visits or to have on the sidelines of various sports activities. they are durable, bright and definitely stimulate the kids imaginations. A little pricey, but for the entertainment they provide and the peace and quiet I get out of them, they are worth it!
5.0	"First off all, IT'S ABOUT TIME they released the \\""Thulsa Doom Temple\\"" version of Conan. Its arguably Conan's coolest pose and outfit in the movie. This figure has an AMAZING likeness to ARNOLD. The figure is absolutely CLASSIC and I'd buy an 18\\"" version of this in a heartbeat."
5.0	Very nice product, got it for my son's date to a party. She loved it so much. Very cute and a good sized bear. Fast shipping and well packaged.
5.0	Works great for my 3D Printer. I used this to add Y-Pillow support to my 3D printer and so far it has worked great to add support and quiet down the Y-Axis creaking.
5.0	Received these as a gift and they are awesome. My kids can play for hours with them.... And never get bored!
5.0	My boyfriend got me this toy out of the blue and i totally love it. great gift for any bioshock 2 lover.
5.0	My two great nieces, ages 7 and 9, love it.
5.0	Bought this for my son because I remember my brother and I enjoying it when we were little.  Just like I remember, he was proud of his creations and asked me to hang up.
5.0	Love the design and the durability. My girls were so excited when they got it.
5.0	"This costume was a real hit!!!!  Everywhere that we went trick or treating the people were in stiches laughing.  We were told many times it was the best costume they had seen.  Some people even called the costume, \\""Joe the Plumber\\"", due to the election."
5.0	Got this for my KJW GBBP. A lot nicer than airsoft specific silicone oils. I use this stuff for moving parts (mostly the slide and nozzle), works great. The lighter weight stuff works good for lubricating your propane adapter.
5.0	Hard to believe but a 12 month old child quickly learns to push the bird headed plunger to start the popping ball fun!  My grandson knew within one day how to start the toy with the plunger, feed the balls into the top, and retrieve any loose balls; he loves the toy and is able to entertain himself for some time.  I strongly suggest that you purchase at least 10 extra balls as they quickly get lost behind sofas, by pets,etc.
5.0	I purchased this for my children 4 years ago. At the time, they were 4 and almost 2 years old. I have always admired the Melissa and Doug brand and thought highly of them.<br /><br />This Birthday Party Cake set has held up incredibly well over the years! They play with it a LOT still. The pieces are all wooden, and the cake slices attach with Velcro. Despite heavy use, all the pieces still look great. The paint hasn't chipped or faded much, and the velcro still sticks well.<br /><br />This toy is worth it's cost, it has given us years of fun, imaginative play, and I'm sure it will last for quite awhile longer. We now have an 8 year old, 6 year old, 5 year old and 1 year old in our family, and they all play with it still.
5.0	grandson absolutely loved him
5.0	Great quality and my son loves them.
5.0	Great toy! Keeps my girls 3 and 6 yrs old busy for hours.
5.0	This expansion to Dominion adds new aspects to the game. You can overpay for some of the cards, earning a reward for doing so. There's a little new strategy, as well. Save up coins to help you make purchases on turns when you don't quite have enough for that Province or Colony.
5.0	My daughter is a horse nut, so she fell in love with this sleeping bag.  I needed a sleeping bag for parties and for her summer camp, so I needed a bag that is thick enough for the floor and to keep her warm as a comforter.
5.0	Grizzly Bear was purchased for a 4 year old boy. His older sister had been asking for the Parrot puppet because she saw it at her school. They love these puppets. They are loveable and interactive because they are puppets and can be made to move and interact. Very good quality.
5.0	I first saw this toy on a trip to Canada and purchased two 10 piece set's for the Grandchildren.  The adults had so much fun with them that we bought two bigger sets and love the family fun we have with them.
5.0	Great product, great price! It's adorable, and my three year old loves to baby this pony and nurse her back to health.
5.0	Love these!  No worries about marks on walls, fabric, or skin.  Fun for face painting :)<br />I have given these for gifts many times, & always a good time.<br /><br />I do wish Crayola would label the color large enough to read.<br />Even elementary school kids can't read this tiny font.
5.0	If you loved the original, and you're a Trekkie, you'll love this. Don't get confused with the cards though. Also the new commander card things create an interesting concept
5.0	I purchased this for a 5 year old and it was love at first sight. All the jewels and glitz make it every princess' dream. The easy to follow number coded directions make for a fun project that you can do together or they can make themselves although it does take some time. When you're done you have a beautiful and functional jewelry box that any girl would be proud to show off.  We loved it so much that I purchased the matching butterfly wall hangings for future craft projects.
5.0	My kids love the moon!  I just redid their bedroom in a space theme.  Added the Uncle Milton's moon and it looks awesome!  I do have to keep an eye on the remote though since it's the only way to actually turn the moon on and off.  Would have been helpful to add this to the actual moon too).  Automatically comes on a 30 minute timer, very nice to just turn on at night.  You can set it to one phase or to rotate through the phases.  Just to note, it was the perfect brightness for a night light.  It does look pretty realistic too.
5.0	Got this doll for my daughter who is obsessed with grease. The doll is beautiful! The box was in brand new condition. The doll looks n is dressed like the character. I'm very pleased.
5.0	Free Product provided for evaluation and review.<br /><br />Although this is a product perhaps geared to a child, I was drawn to the graphic and wanted it for myself.  The primary green, which is between a lime and a true green, matches the little lion perfectly.  The graphic is so playful and fun.<br />The bottom of the light is also the battery compartment, and it takes inexpensive batteries with a nice lifespan when used with LED lights like this, cell size CR2032.  These are easily found here on Amazon or most local stores. (I’ve even found them at dollar stores.)<br />It works right out of the box, which is very nice.  The package makes a great presentation and would help this light be very nice for a gift.<br />It’s very easy to use.  There’s a little button on top of the light that simply clicks on or off.  The ‘stalk’ is very easy to direct and aim, and gives more than enough light to read a book at night without bothering a partner.<br />The clip fits nice and tight and is also easy to use.  It doesn’t slide around if it is clipped on a few pages of a paperback, or a hardback's cover.<br />I can easily recommend this light.  It’s cute as can be, is well designed for readers, and works fine.
5.0	Conversations with those folks who you don't really wish to hear. I often get people coming over to my house and they bore the living life out of me. To them I hand over this fantastic puzzle - and keep on irking them to solve the same. They can't, of course, because it is damn hard, and if they do, I really wouldn't mind conversing with a person patient enough to pull through.<br /><br />Win win!<br /><br />Die cast quality is excellent.
5.0	These were perfect! The blue Cat balloon was much larger than I though and it was just perfect!
5.0	Bought for a friend. Looked great on her. An eye catcher and so inexpensive!!!!
5.0	My 13 month old twin girls love this set!  It was sitting in the floor Christmas morning along with other toys, a huge pink wagon for 2 and a pink rocking horse.  They grabbed this first, played with it and paid no attention to the other gifts!  They are still playing with although there are a ridiculous number of other things to play with.  SOOOOO glad Santa bought this! :)
5.0	"I got this for a school project for my son. It's the centerpiece of his Meerkat presentation, and it's perfect. The only way to make it more realistic looking would be to have it \\""stand\\"" on its feet instead of \\""sit\\"", but the pictures of \\""standing\\"" meerkats I found for sale look far too fake.    In spite of what an earlier review said, it WILL stand on its own, on flat or less-than flat platforms (it was shipped to my work address, so I had it sitting on my cubicle wall \\""guarding\\"" my desk all day; for the project it's sitting on a small log).    It appears to be durable. The arms (paws) are sewn to the body."
5.0	The age range on the box is 3 to 8 years, but I think the more accurate age range is 2 to 3 years -- perhaps slightly younger for a child that likes to examine images. My 2-year-old girl is just becoming interested in matching. She loves this game and spends time pouring over the pictures of each room. I gave this game to my son when he turned 4. The 4-year-old played once or twice, but really wasn't challenged, and quickly got bored. So, if you buy this game for the right age, you and your child will enjoy playing it together!
5.0	This game has been a favorite at our house. Our four year old son loves playing board games, specifically Hoot Owl Hoot. As a parent, I love the cooperative nature of the game and that it teaches him strategy lessons at a young age in a way that he can understand. He learns and is entertained without the tension of playing against other people. I highly recommend this game.
5.0	Daughter loved this and very affordable!!
5.0	I use these blocks for speech therapy sessions with my client. Great quality and paint hadn't chipped off yet with daily high use.
5.0	it's not really of toys because it comes on a keychain. but it's very durable I left it in my car in this Arizona heat and it didn't even melt. I mean for days, and kids seem to like it because of the bumblebee of course.
5.0	"These blocks are super. They are heavy, so our towers don't fall down for days. I built one that was 5 feet high, just to see how long it would stand in the playroom, and after five days I knocked it down myself. The edges are clean and not sharp. The blocks are perfectly smooth. We also bought some Haba fantasy blocks, which we use for accent pieces on our towers. My son, who is 4, LOVES these blocks. My  baby girl, 8 months old, loves to knock the blocks together to make noise. Although my son is unable to build a complex tower by himself, we will build with him, and he loves it just the same. We build pirate ships, \\""chicken towers\\"", \\""goat schools\\"", islands, corrals, rockets, doorbells, and the list goes on. The things we construct actually replace so many of his plastic toys, we are about to get rid of a ton of them. We don't need the plastic zoo anymore, we can build one. We don't need the plastic dinosaur cave anymore, either. There are a few toys that are great with the blocks, though. My son's dump truck, which is big enough to carry these blocks, his garbage truck, which has a hatch back and can carry these blocks, and a Bilibo (look it up) that can act as everything else thinkable. If you like a stream-lined playroom without a bunch of obnoxious junk in it, these blocks are a great start. There are small Haba block sets and marble runs that go along with this set, and I think I am more excited about getting some of those than my kids are! I bought this at amazon, but Fat Brain Toys have great reviews and competitive prices. You can find all kinds of long lasting, imagination enhancing, classic toys there. Five stars!!"
5.0	What can i say? I am not Cloe's biggest fan, but i absolutly love this gorgeous doll. Her clothes are fun, funky, and modern. Her hair is curly, but soft and easy to brush. I love her make up, it is very light, and very simple looking. The boots are gorgeous; they have very unique and detailed designs on them. I own her, and this is definetly something you'll want to buy, before she goes out of stock. Kids and collectors will love her.
5.0	excellent value very detailed looks just like the real actors
5.0	wonderful classic game to have for family game nights!
5.0	My 9 year old boy loved this - he had fun performing a few simple magic tricks, everyone had fun, I'd buy it again.
5.0	Works as expected. No problems
1.0	It appeared to be suitable for an older child. We will be returning this item this week.<br />Please excuse our error
5.0	Really cute and nice quality. Did take some time to assemble.  Bought this for a tall 5 year old and she can use the cart just fine.
5.0	I brought this for my second son's 1st birthday. We have had it for a year now, as he is turning 2.<br />I am constantly having mom's inquire about the trike wherever we go, and I thought maybe I should post some of my comments where I brought it.<br /><br />First off I should admit that my husband put the trike together so I can't comment on the difficulty. Took him 15min without difficulty, but he is an engineer and good at technical details. There was nothing broken or missing. The front pedals did spin when they were suppose to be disengaged, but that only lasted 3 days until it got worn in.<br /><br />I saw a lot of bad/mixed reviews when I bought so I thought I'd comment on some of the things I'd seen posted.<br />1) I saw a lot of comments that it didn't steer straight. Ours worked prefect for 2 weeks then suddenly started veering all over the place and I thought oh no. I looked down and realized my 1 year old was trying to steer. There is no way to lock out your toddler from taking control, but I easily over power my little guy so it is never a problem. If you are having problems steering make sure the culprit is not your little angel :)<br />2) The sun shade is great, but not meant for strong winds. Also if it rubs against your child's blonde hair over the course of a long walk you may look down to discover your child has pink hair ( which luckily washed out). Easy to remove the shade.<br />3) the bucket on the back won't take a heavy load. I use to put my purse in the bucket but it has a tendency to dump the bucket and purse (i do have a heavy purse). Since it didn't carry my purse I figured I didn't need it right now and removed it. I'll put it back when we turn it into a dedicated trike.<br />4) The seat and seatbelt and surrounding safety bars still fit my 2 year old fine and there is still some growing room. Granted my child runs on the smaller side (26-27lbs). Most trikes don't have seat belts, so once he out grows them I'll stop using the belt. ( Andone good thing about the safety bars only fitting small children is my 5 year can't steal his brothers trike, which thankfully saves me one sibling fight).<br />5) The toy phone got played with the first day and I don't think he ever touched it again. The cup holder at the front fits his sippy perfectly.<br />6) the saddle bag on the handle doesn't fit much. I like to carry a bottle of sunscreen in it for the days I forget the apply before leaving the house. Maybe an extra diaper, pack of wipes, bucket hat and some sunglasses.<br />7) My only real con about trike is pulling the trike backwards is a bit unstable. I use to pull my strollers through store doors backwards holding the door with my body. The first time I tried it with trike I nearly tipped it. Luckily the trike fits through doors going forward nicely so I haven't had any issues since.<br />8) both my kids refused to sit in a stroller from 11 months on. This is a great alternative. My son loves to ride in it. He tries to climb in without help.<br />9) one warning. Don't wear your Sunday best shoes or open toed sandals. My son likes to drag his feet on the ground despite having both the foot rest and foot pedals for options. It doesn't seem to be hurting his stride ride sneakers, but I could see some little kid somewhere scuffing up their nice shoes.<br />10) I love the grow-with-it factor. How much money have I spent on toys, clothes and baby gear that only lasted for 6months before the child grew out of it? It's wonderful to spend money on something that is going to be useable for years! A year of use, I've already gotten my money's worth, the next 2 years will just icing on the cake.
1.0	The volume is very low. Not a good buy!!
5.0	My Jette loves her MoMo!
5.0	My daughter loves her new stick horse!!  It is very cute and makes realistic sounds when you squeeze the ears.
5.0	AS A MAGICIAN, I LOVE IT'S ADVANCED TECHNIQUES---VERY DECEPTIVE ILLUSIONS!  I ESPECIALLY LIKED -FOUR ON THE FLOOR.-----THIS IS A GREAT BOOK!
5.0	You have no idea how fun this game can be until you have played, and, once you have played, you will never miss a chance to play, again. <br />It's a great party game both for people who know each other well and those who don't.  You'll laugh so hard your sides will hurt.  <br />Great game!
5.0	The number one thing my daughter loves at the moment (well, all this year so far) is Minecraft. She loves stuffed animals, and when the mini plush Enderman, Creeper and others came out, she quickly collected all of them. A few bigger characters like the zombie and skeleton came out, and while she thinks they’re cool, they’re nothing compared to the REALLY big plush guys like the Ender Dragon, spider and the Ghast here. Fortunately for parents, the Ghast doesn’t cost anywhere ear as much as the Ender Dragon does, and if you ask me, he looks cooler.<br /><br />This is a large stuffed Ghast with no sound or light up feature. He’s a basic stuffed toy made for cuddling, being thrown around, and just looking cool. He’s a lot bigger than most of the other stuffed Minecraft characters, and is made of a super soft fleece-like material. Its face and other details are sewn in, so there’s no worrying about toddlers choking on anything if they play with it. They went with the fireball shooting facial expression here, which is more exciting than the Ghat’s neutral face where the eyes are closed. Its six legs are all here and can be moved around to smack the smaller animals and monsters around. It’s definitely unique, and paired up with the big Creeper or some of the smaller stuffed animals like the ocelot and Mooshroom, it’d make for a great display piece in your Minecraft collection.<br /><br />It looks like the Ghast isn’t as hard to find as he was a few months ago, so no more inflated prices! At the standard MSRP price, I think he’s a great deal. This is a big cuddly ghost-thingy, sure to make any Minecraft fan happy. If you haven’t gotten a chance to see one for yourself and you’re on the fence about ordering it because of the price, don’t worry about it. This is one of the coolest Minecraft collectibles out there.
5.0	Last year we got pink table like this for our daughter's 3d birthday, along with 80-piece bag. All our family had so much fun with it, so we had to buy another bag with 80 more pieces.<br />Our baby son loved it so much, so we had to buy this one for his second birthday, and160-piece bag this time.<br />Now they both can really build away, connecting both tables with a bridge, and making up all kinds of buildings.<br /><br />It is good for the kids' development and also so much fun, that keeps them busy for a long time. After we are done playing, we have to compete who picks the most blocks :-)
5.0	This game has an optimum balance of complexity, duration and engagement for me, my wife and our 7 y/o daughter. Like it much more than Monopoly and other American-type strategy games.
5.0	I got this for my youngest daughter since she likes almost anything that plays music.  She liked it, but since it requires a stroke motion to get the most out of it, she didn't get into it to much.  She's 1 1/2.  My older daughter who is almost 3, enjoyed it much more and usually plays with it when she sees it.  It will not entertain her for long periods, but it does for a short while.
5.0	My little guys loved them as did their Uncle's!!!!
5.0	My 2 year old LOVES these puzzles!! They are a good size for her to handle and work with. Very satisfied!!
5.0	This was a nice theme for the Christmas season.  It was a dark puzzle so it was a bit difficult to put together.  We glued ours together and hung it on the wall for the holidays.
5.0	Sturdy, easy to assemble and the perfect size for an 18 month old.
5.0	excellent product of very good quality and useful for its purpose.<br />very good price for this product.<br />thank you very much.<br />need more cars
5.0	I bought this for my 8 month old who was just starting to show signs of walking readiness and I was a little concerned due to some of the negative reviews but still decided to take a risk since it seemed to have more bang for the buck (since it also is a ride-on).  I am so pleased that I did!<br /><br />My daughter loves it and was able to use it rather well right from the start!  I have wood laminate floors and I was worried it would take off like a shot but that has never been a problem.  She can just as easily control it on the laminate as she can the carpet.  She has also never had a problem with the design of the wheels (others mentioned it being awkward).<br /><br />It easily transforms from one style to the other and assembled easily.<br /><br />When it is in the ride-on mode it sits low enough that after the first couple of tries she could easily get herself on and off without me worrying about spills.  And since it can hold up to 40 pounds my 4 year old can also ride around on it when he gets the whim.<br /><br />Overall I can find no fault with this toy and highly recommend it.
5.0	Loved them so much I purchase every football set. Hours of fun! She takes them with her when we travels, wish they came with a nice bag.
5.0	This is the second Neca action figure I buy (the other was Freddy Krueger), very satusfied with the level detail of both figures and also the considerably lower price than other action figures from other manufacturers. Just search and compare
5.0	We bought this for our 3 1/2 year old, and she is enjoying it so far (just a few days).  The parts seem very sturdy and they are cute too.  No frills, but cute pieces for each room of the house.<br /><br />My mom bought her the Melissa and Doug Wooden Family Doll Set to go with it, and after seeing both separately, we were worried the people in that set wouldn't fit.  They do fit, but just a few more centimeters on the biggest ones, and they'd be too big.  They are almost too tall for the upstairs since the roof angles and cuts off the ceiling/standing space, but it's fine.  They are too long for the bed and bathtub, but they fit fine in the chairs, so I think it's fine.  She doesn't mind if they are a little too long. (I will include pictures so you can see in case you wanted to buy additional people for this set.)  The two people who come with the house are cute and bendable, just like the ones in the additional set.  They two that come with it look like two adults but then if you get the additional set, they are much shorter, so they can become children in the family.<br /><br />We are ordering the Plan Toy Doll House Nursery set to go with this based on pictures that another reviewer posted.  I'm not 100% convinced by the pictures that the pieces will fit in this house correctly, but it might be close enough to work.  She can play with them on the table surface if not, but I'll try to post pictures of that once it arrives in case you're considering the same thing.<br /><br />The only negative I can think of on this doll house is maybe the second floor ceiling space where the roof cuts off some of the standing space.  I don't think it will bother my little one a bit, and to have a relatively inexpensive and small but cute dollhouse, I'm willing to deal with that issue.
5.0	This has been a very fun toy for our family.  We bought it for our 2 year old and it is easy enough for him to use, with help, but our 5 year old loves it as well.  We can hook it up to other hot wheels track sections so the cars can go straight for a long time or just use it as is and launch them across our kitchen floor.  We play with it often and it seems to be very well made.
5.0	It's very well made, very easy to assemble, and very durable!!!  I love it and it's very easy to fly.
5.0	I love playing around with fun little toys like this and decided to purchase it for my son and I and it was such a great buy! It really is indestructible and lasts so long. My son would throw it in his fits of rage and it still survived and didn’t break and gives us hours of fun. It is definitely very durable and does everything you’d want it to do from a remote control helicopter for kids. Definitely worth every cent!
5.0	Team Associated Hood Pins will work in most cars and set ups.  These are normal clips and work as advertised.
5.0	Bought these for 2 year old grand daughter she loved them took a while to come but worth the wait
5.0	Fit perfect, better quality than expected!
1.0	5 phrases and NO thunder buddy song! Very disappointed! The description is not very accurate of this bears sayings.<br />Don't buy if u want the song! Also did not come in a TED box just plastic bag! Boo!
5.0	Fast and uncomplicated delivery. It is a present for our baby and he loves it very much. Our older son helps him dearly. Thanks!
5.0	Very detailed kit. All parts were painted and ready to assemble.
5.0	My 8 yr old nephew love it and enjoyed the options of building it different ways.  He put it together immediately.
5.0	This product was great. The arrival time was great. The customer service was very professional. The information that was displayed about this card made it easy to decide if I wanted to purchase this product from this company.
5.0	This is a really cute, easy puzzle.  Good one for beginner puzzle lovers.
5.0	This is the prettiest Little Red Riding Costume I've seen.  My daughter is almost 3 1/2 and the costume fit perfectly.  She loved wearing it and looked adorable with her little brother, The Big Bad Wolf.  I did have to put a white turtle neck underneath with warm leotards for nighttime.  Great costume - would definitely recommend this product!
1.0	There's barely any tension on the bow and also there's not really a guide for the arrows, so it's basically impossible to shoot.  Do not buy this.
5.0	I wasn't sure if it would be big enough but after I put it together it was 51&#34; tall - just perfect for my 5 and 7 year old. It is made very sturdy and durable and high quality!! It is worth the money!! They have been using it outside to sell lemonade and everyone loves this!!
1.0	I bought two of these for my kids through another retailer because they had a pink and white one for my daughter.  We were all so excited to start using them XMas day.  One of them stopped charging and never came back on the very day we pulled it out of the package.  We decided to return them both the day after xmas, because one was not working at all and the othe,r because after reading all the negative reviews, we figured it was only a matter of time before the other one failed.  I emailed Zoomer customer service two weeks ago to express my dissatisfaction with the product and no one has bothered to email me back.  It seems to me the major issues are charging and the dog never turning on again and voice command and recognition.  I think the company to was premature in their release of the dog and should recall it if this many people are having the same issues.  DO NOT BUY!
5.0	Gave as a gift to a friend. Our kids have used their for four years now as dress up capes, scarf, pareo and you name it. Not cheap but worth it, I think.
5.0	My eighth grade boys love tossing this around and it does make the games and conversation more fun even for lower functioning students.
5.0	I am in love with this toy! It is perfect for babies 6 months and up and would hold the attention of a 3-6 month old if an adult assisted them in sitting.  This has so many toys within a toy - IT'S AMAZING!  You don't have to worry about hearing the same annoying song over and over!  There are 75 songs!  That alone is worth the price of the car!
5.0	My 8.5-year-old daughter loves to make bracelets and necklaces using the Rainbow Loom and has been experimenting with different color combinations. I went to look for rubber bands in single color packs but a lot of the craft stores don't stock enough rubber bands and frequently run out of the colors we want, so I decided to get them here.<br /><br />This pack of Loom Bands contains 600 rubber bands in white and the pack comes with 25 C-clips. The bands are stretchy and I haven't had any issues with them breaking. They appear to be compatible with the Rainbow Loom.
5.0	I needed these balloons for my son's snake party.  We were trying to make a twisty balloon snake and realized the balloons you buy at the party stores aren't made to be stretched too much.  So we quickly ordered these right before the party and they arrived on time and were great!!
5.0	i also bought my daughter the Fisher-Price Dora The Explorer Singing Star Microphone it is loads of fun for her, she is always singing.
5.0	Yes it met my expectations. Very nice. Thank you.
5.0	This is my grand daughter's (22 month old) first tea set and she absolutely loves it. It is the first toy she goes to when she wakes up in the morning.  The product is safe, good quality, and provides loads of fun for toddlers. I paid $17 for it, and it is worth every penny.  It is not too complicated and just right for her age. She is learning to share and good social skills as she play tea time with her dolls and stuffed animals.
5.0	Gorgeous and wonderful
5.0	I cannot say enough how valuable the Leapster Explorer is!!  Especially with the new camera accessory that has come out.  My son loves the leapster and the options are endless...from the downloads online to the games you can purchase at most retail stores, it is truly a versatile tool for learning.  I will say that it is advised to purchase the battery charger as batteries will bankrupt you as much as you will find your child wants to use the toy!  I also found it difficult to locate the case (as organization is important as you increase the number of games and accessories).  However, I was pleasantly surprised to find the discounts and free shipping (if you purchase more than $50 worth) on the leapfrog site.  I saved a ton ordering leaplet downloads and games through the site.  All in all, I would say this has been the best purchase so far in terms of educational toys for our son.
1.0	If I could give this zero stars I would. These looks nothing like the picture. They are a weird pinkish-purple, not lavender. There was a rusted staple in some of them. I ordered these for my wedding an don't even want to use these, the color is just wrong. I wouldn't recommend these at all.
5.0	Bought this for my daughter for her birthday last year and she loves it. She keeps all her mini Lalaloopsy dolls in it and she's got about 80 and they all fit. It's held up very well, no rips or tears. The button shape is really cute too!
5.0	Great set  - Aside from Princess Celestia and Luna, we now have it all. Great toys at a decent price.
5.0	My granddaughter loved her gifted Melissa and Doug plush tiger. It was so cuddly as well as being colorful and well made.
5.0	I bought this toy for my granddaughter who is very rough with most all her toys, including this one. It's doing great, not falling apart at all, and she loves it carries it everywhere. I must say I think this toy might be her fav.
5.0	Love this detail on the doll bought it at the disney store for half the price listed here. he is the only boy in this line of dolls really hope they release all the other boy dolls too.
5.0	I bought this for the boat.  It's perfect - blows up in a snap (with the Intex 12 volt d/c pump I purchased) and deflates as easily for stowing.  The cup holders are shallow but they're great for drinks.  I was hoping to stow other items in them so we can float in the lake for hours on end without having to get back on the boat for key items.<br /><br />The lid on the cooler is great - keeps the sun off the ice and the water out of the cooler.  Doubles as a table for playing games, eating lunch or just resting.  The tether is good too, and it easily connects to the leash to the boat.  I do put a bag cooler inside the cooler for added coldness.<br /><br />Seems pretty sturdy and lasted a full season so far.
5.0	these neck-less were nice and all but one of them have the wrong color. but still i can use it and i love wearing them each day so i love them.
1.0	Returning item.  It came without cord and CD player does not work. Very disappointed.
5.0	This is my first Jody Bergsma puzzle. It is very pretty and has nice pieces. it was just hard enough to make it fun.
5.0	My 4 year old son loves these magnetic tiles. He plays with them all the time and makes such cool designs.
5.0	I gave this set to my four-year-old son and he loves it, as do his daddy and I.  The only problem is that he made something that took almost all the pieces and he likes it so much he won't take it apart!  Now we have to get another set for his birthday so the grown-ups can play, too.  If you get these (and I highly recommend them), get a lot; everyone will want them, especially if you have a house full of builders and geometers like we do.
5.0	She is adorabley dark :) her painting is a lil messed up but she's still wonderfully detailed how of is shown in the picture
1.0	The condition of the item was poor and looks like the ear had been chewed up from a pet.  Also, it did come in a box as illustrated.  False advertisement by the owner!  Truly disappointed and not worth the price.
5.0	Great coloring and fully stuffed.
5.0	I got a little car that a neighbor was throwing away.  Spend a little for a battery & charger and now my grandchildren are having so much fun riding around in this little car.  Would have been so much more money to buy a new one and now there's one less thing in the landfill.
5.0	Adorably cute :) Well made :)
5.0	My five year old grandson loved this Christmas present! These sound as good as the one that I bought his dad and it wasn't a &#34;kid's first duck call&#34;. Of course, my daughter and her husband weren't too fond of the present in the house, but it was, and still is, a hit! My grandson goes duck hunting with his dad and this will definitely be a take-along for him. I can't wait to hear the results of the day.
1.0	Horrible, did not work at all. I followed directions to the T. I tried a couple of times. My son was so disappointed! We ended up using a real seed in a small glass container, like a small mason jar with water, no dirt or nutrients needed.
5.0	My 9 year old daughter loves these.  We bought them cheaper at the toy store.  A lot like Squinkies, but mini food items, beauty products, etc.  My girl plays with these for hours.  The supermarket and other things like the veggie stand are nice quality.  Happy with the purchase.  Get a big plastic container to keep the buildings and Shopkins in, to keep it organized!
5.0	Very cute bear...very soft and was happy I ordered. Perfect gift for a newborn for christmas to keep as a keepsake
5.0	Grandchild really liked this. This is what was asked for by child for Christmas; it was exactly as described.
5.0	This is great! I bought for my 8 year old. It was easy to put together and is very sturdy! Holds 3 18in dolls!
5.0	Fast shipping, my son loves them.  No problems with reception!
5.0	These robot parts are not easy to find.  I was happy to find them at a reasonable price.  My grandsons are have a great time building strange vehicles and making them battle each other.
5.0	Finally... there are no other words. It's big, it's black. It's a box.What more do you want me to say?
5.0	Two boys still working it over and it holds up well.  No issues with it and boys are enjoying it.
5.0	I wanted it for a one time use, and after that i kept it for playing. Very nice looking on the first use, you could see it staring to wear after the first use. If fit my 2y old just fine, and my 6y old too.
5.0	Great item. Came right on time. Thanks!
5.0	My son loves paw patrol.
5.0	James got this Christmas morning and there have been several days that he was able to use it outside.  My son and I put it together in less than an hour, charged the battery, and James has a GREAT day.  Since we have only had it about a month, I would be hesitant to say it's a good value for the price, but, the smile on James' face is worth the price of the 4-Wheeler.  That's what is important.
5.0	Five year old grandson had a birthday and the kids had fun with these. Loved all the colors. I secretly wanted to take one home😄
5.0	Beautiful lite pink and silver. Very soft. My niece won 1st place at the local Halloween Carnival. Headband was comfortable also. We just added some long beads and white fishnet tights.
1.0	Very, Very Cheap.  It fell apart first time he played with it.  I would not recommend this.  My son was very disappointed.
5.0	my grand daughters love it!  they love all mobster high stuff!  i like them too.  dolls arms & legs pop off & on, by design.  they're great!
1.0	"The 3rd time my 9 year-old grandson pulled the arrow back, the plastic which the bow was composed of BROKE INTO PIECES! This toy is worthless!  I was unable to return it as the box it came in had been destroyed and I didn't have another.  ALSO - I ordered TWO of these bow and \\""arrow\\"" sets, but only received one.  Altogether, I would NEVER ORDER FROM THIS SELLER AGAIN."
1.0	The Furbys are fun to have around the house. These Party Rockers do nothing but keep the more expensive ones awake. They don't learn anything or do anything remarkable! Not worth it.
5.0	This game was made specifically for the hardcore strategy board game player and for those familiar with Starcraft.  If you fall into those two categories, then this is a must for you!  If you're a hardcore board game player who likes a game with plenty of strategy, then pick this game up.  If you're simply a Starcraft fan, I can't guarantee that you'll like this game since the game has a very steep learning curve.  The rule book is over 40 pages long!<br />To sum up the game, just like the computer game, there are three races and each race has two factions, allowing a maximum of six players per game.  Most of the action takes place by giving orders and executing them, each player taking turns to do so.  Battles are resolved using cards and each player has their own deck for their own race/faction.  Cards also represent resources and events throughout the game.  Plastic figures represent each individual unit, all from the computer game, and they are of extremely high quality, although they are fragile and some can break easily if mishandled, especially the air units.<br />The game is rather quick to setup, at most 30 minutes if all players cooperate in the setup, but the length of the game depends on the number of players.  Two players can finish a game in under two hours, but six players can be playing up to five hours or more.  In general and as previously stated, this game is ideal for the hardcore strategy board game player and for those familiar with Starcraft.  Even if you don't know about Starcraft, if you're a hardcore board game player you'll enjoy this game.
5.0	Our two-year-old twins love to be pushed through the neighborhood on their radio flyer trikes.  Their feet don't quite reach the peddles and times when we can't walk them...they push themselves around on the family deck.  A sturdy toy...one that will be passed down to another toddler.
5.0	I gave this to my niece for Christmas and she loves it. She also doesn't mind that the arms and legs don't bend. She loves the hair and the dress - especially the color of it. And she also loves the little dog. Needless to say she plays with this all the time and likes to show it off to people.
5.0	Great toy box! Best size and best price! I love how the lid is not connected so there are no worries of pinched fingers!
5.0	I bought this to supplement my regular Pit game!  We wanted to play with more people and this works awesome!
5.0	my boys said &#34; excellent cards&#34;
5.0	nice chalk, easy to use.
1.0	They arrived all broken. They are nice but definetley not worthy. The candles and shipping over $23.
5.0	The six year old recipient loved it and it was about the right size for her to schlep around. As for durability, I haven't inquired as it was a gift.
5.0	Very funny. Nice addition to the game. It would make more sense to purchase the full game with all expansions though, imo.
5.0	Many friends have these for thier little ones so we bought these for our son for Christmas. we are so excited for him to open this in a matter of days. They are so durable! We know kids that have them for YEARS! They shipped super fast. The box was a great size for the item. Its alot heavier than we thought it would be! But that should be expected with durable cardboard.
5.0	This will be perfect for our artist!  made of a plastic\rubber material.
5.0	This was a great gag gift.  Quality is better than other similar fake mustaches .  Brought a lot of laughs. The only negative was that shipping cost the same as the product.
5.0	My mother inlaw but my 2 year old a play tent and my wife wanted to buy this for our son. So I bought it and couldn't be more pleased the green lattern and little stove is very durable he drops this all the time and they keep working. He loves it infact he keeps brining them home instead leaving it out there with his tent at his grandparents. If your little one like outdoors they will love to have this set!
1.0	"I bought this kit to serve as a weekend project for my son. After two days and no sign of life, I kept telling him not to worry, since the instruction say \\""2 - 4 days.\\"" After a full week there was still no sign of life. I suppose if left out in the open long enough, SOMETHING would start growing in the water...but not triops."
5.0	I love all dinnerware from Crocodile Creek. Good quality, cute design, and last forever. We have several dinner sets for my 2 year old son, and he defintedly  loves all of them.
5.0	I got this for my niece who is a fairly precocious 2 years and 7 months (just shy of the 3+ age rating). As soon as I showed it to her (before we ripped it out of the box!) she loved it. I showed her all the buttons and what they do and she immediately sat down and pushed buttons and sang into the microphone for a good 45 minutes straight - only stopping because we were having dinner.<br /><br />There are several buttons and she liked some better than others. On the one side there are songs and genres: ABC, numbers & shapes and Pop, Reggae and Rock (I think). She was far more interested in the other side of buttons which modifies the sound of your voice. There was monster voice, alien voice and echo and of those she liked echo the best. She absolutely LOVED having the microphone in hand and hearing her own voice.<br /><br />Each of the buttons ABC, shapes, pop, reggae have two songs each that they play and as long as you are pushing those buttons it won't turn itself off. However, since my niece liked to hear herself sing more than sing along to the songs it had it would sometimes stop in the middle of her singing and she'd have to press a button to get it to wake back up. It was a minor annoyance really considering how much she loved playing with it.<br /><br />The little robot can speak and play in two languages English or Spanish although she wasn't exactly interested in the Spanish side until I explained that it was the Dora side. Even the adults liked playing with this toy and we would ask her what sound a lion makes when it was on the monster voice and then she'd just giggle and laugh and do it again. It stood the test of time when she came over to my house the next week and started playing with it again (and showing her dolls how it worked too).
5.0	grandkids love these guys
1.0	The other battery trains have a total of 6 wheels for a reason. It Helps them stay on the track after curves and such. This one only has 4 wheels. 50% of the time when it turns a curve it falls off the track. The Battery Powered Thomas does not. That left me with one answer. Its the lack of the other two wheels.
5.0	Kit was what was advertised, now on my layout
5.0	"My 3 yr old grandaughter collects all of the \\""Favorite Moments Dolls\\"" and this was the only one she didn't have.  The dolls are small, perfect to hold in a small child's hands.  She takes them everywhere!  They have removeable \\""rubbery\\"" dresses, that are stretchy; so easy to put on and take off.  She plays with them for hours, and gives her quite the imagination, which is educational in itself.  She also enlists her dad to play and \\""voice\\"" the prince!  Any child that doesn't get bored with a toy over months of play, is definitely a 5-star toy in my book!"
5.0	My two year old had entered that phase where she doesn't want to do anything anyone asks of her.  I read a lot of advice on the subject and &#34;use a timer&#34; or &#34;beat the clock&#34; seemed to be a recurring theme.  I wondered if it could really be that simple...  Well, for us, it pretty much is.  She hates nap time, so we have a small routine before hand: pick up toys, snack, and then nap.  I set the timer for nap time and, if she's finished picking up toys before the timer runs out, she can have her snack.  If not, snack is moved to after nap time.  However, that consequence has yet to happen since we got the timer!  I think it works because I'm not just setting an arbitrary limit, it takes the focus off of me or whoever else as the &#34;bad guy&#34;, and the warning alarm is awesome since she doesn't have a grasp on the concept of time yet.  We always leave the warning on 5 minutes so maybe that'll create some consistency?  Violin practice was always a battle, too.  She would just want to mess with the violin instead of do her technique games.  We set the timer for 15 mins, 5 min warning.  She knows when the warning alarm sounds, she can freestyle after that.  We always want to end on her still being interested so we never go longer than that.  Only thing that I wish is it could have a tooth brushing timer, but I guess it can't do everything haha.  Other than that, it's awesome.  She even takes it to bed after 20 mins of story time because she wants to time her chat time with my husband haha.  Awesome, awesome, awesome purchase when I was just looking for a standard kitchen timer.
5.0	Nice for students  while teaching lessons.
1.0	"Unless you consider crude and tasteless humor your kind of \\""family fun\\"", you will be sadly disappointed with this game.  With a big bare butt, sperm and phrases like \\""laying pipe\\"" printed right on the board, this is not even close to a family game let alone entertaining.  (...).  This one went back! There are so many great choices out there--this is NOT one of them."
5.0	This is the Nerf gun yet! Buy lots more clips!
5.0	We purchased this for our 5 year old grandson for Christmas. It wasn't on his wish list, but was by far one of his favorites.
5.0	good card, fair price, arrived on time. thank you.
5.0	I loved being able to sit in a lawn chair to fill balloons for a party.  The plunger to turn on and off the water is great.  The self-tie feature saves wear & tear on my hands.<br /><br />We have only used it today (the day it arrived), so I can't report on durability.
5.0	This model of a VW Golf GTI is exactly the one my son wanted. He loves it. He's a VW lover and this model fits the bill. These are hard to find in the retail stores. It arrived promptly,as stated, no problems. I will definitely be ordering from this seller again.
5.0	This is a wonderful educational toy. It teaches about science and robotics. Children do not know that they are learning because they are having too much fun!!! Teachers love this toy!
5.0	Fun designs and big deck. Not too fond of the spider sense cards
5.0	Exactly what my great nephew wants for Christmas. I could not find the same toy in a store and ordered it instead of continuing to look.
5.0	these were hard to find at he local chain stores for whatever reason, but Amazon had these over-priced babies ready to go.  Kids loved them for the size
5.0	Exactly as advertised and performed it's job well.  I would not hesitate to purchase again if the need arises in the future
5.0	I love these! They are so fun for kids. They are made in China which I don't usually buy, but they are super nice. I have MCS and they stunk a little when they came in but they aired out in the garage for a few days, and noe they are just fine!<br />Would definitely recommend for anyone!
5.0	As her travelling companion she arrived very quickly! Protected well! That it is good to think of the fact of adding clothes.<br /><br />  Francine Boucher
5.0	I have all of the Tokidoki Cactus vinyls, and love them all, but I think Porcino might be my favorite.<br /><br />Like all the other Tokidoki vinyl toys, he is solid, durable, and well crafted. His paint job is great, and he is super kawaii. He has all the right shades of pink, and looks great with the other cactus vinyl toys. He stands about 3 inches tall and is a bit wider than that across.<br /><br />He is truly adorable and looks great on a shelf. He really brightens the place up, and I am very glad I got him.<br /><br />A great gift for a Tokidoki fan, but he's really not a toy, so pass on this for the younger crowd.
5.0	My granddaughter wanted me to buy this for her Christmas present. It hasn't been used yet, but know it will come in handy for her putting stuff away. I know she'll love it.
5.0	Zolo is so creative and everything you build looks like a work of art. In fact, in our house my kids created 5 stand alone creatures from this pack and named them all. They decorate our kitchen and family room. The sticks require a little push and twist to get a snug junction and thereby may be a bit difficult for the youngest kids (under 4). They are so bright and can be taken apart are rebuilt endlessly.
5.0	Wonderful toy for the avid Thomas the Tank collector...my son, he is four....Just loves it....great addition to his Thomas collection.
5.0	We bought this for our Nephews for xmas.  They loved it and still have had no issues, and its Feb.  Great gift.
5.0	My 8 month old daughter will sit at this and play all of the time.  She loves this thing.  I hope she continues to love it because it's intended for 3+ so if we can get that many years out of it, that would be great!
5.0	Bought this lunch box size because it's got many little pockets for mini figures the bigger size doesn't have. My 5.5 years old really likes it to haul his star war figures and a small millennium falcon. We have taken it to at least two road trips and it held up well.
1.0	Clearly a defective product received. Charged fine, trim control did nothing so it spun in circles and would not take off. Returning.
5.0	Loved the color and the dice were well made. I loved the unicorn symbol in the zero/ten place. Even if you don't do the Five rings rpg they do excellent in other games requiring 10 sided dice
1.0	There were only 8 plates included for the $26.25 price.  I wrongly assumed that there would be a reasonable number of plates (at least 50) for such a high price.  DO NOT BUY.
5.0	we looked all over for a good-looking, durable dragon action figure.  this is it!  my boys were only 2 and 4 at the time and it has been stomped on, thrown down the stairs and who knows what else.  it thought for sure it wouldn't hold up, but it has!  it still looks great despite all the  abuse it's endured.  beautifully crafted, but not too scary for little ones.  great product and great brand.
5.0	This little helicopter is amazing!  So durable! You can't beat the price and it really flies well.  We've had so much fun with this!
5.0	My twin granddaughters love this.  They are about 18 months old, love to draw and use the magnetic letters.  How:-)awesome it is two sided, perfect for twins.  All of us adults are enjoying using it with them too.  Sturdy so far, and versatile so we can use for more than just drawing.  Perfect size and price is reasonable.
5.0	We got this for my mom's surprise 70th birthday party. I admit I was expecting it to be flimsy and cheap looking. I was pleasantly surprised to see that the box it was packed in was very nice, and that the tiara is heavy and high quality. Very sparkly. It stayed in her hair quite well with the combs. All in all a nice product!
1.0	It's cute. One wash on gentle cycle and it ripped apart =( Waist of money.
5.0	My 9 year old son is so into fish.  I bought him this fish for his birthday.  It's small enough that he pretends that he caught it as a real fish, but not too small.  Great quality, he is rough with his toys, but this has really held up.
5.0	Took a little while to get them as they are drop shipped and the company had to get their next order in, but this ship is beautiful and the seller stayed in contact with me the entire time. I have to say that it was very nice to have the seller update me on what was happening. The ship itself is stunning. the detail is incredible. Again, Bravo Zulu to the Seller  &#34;My Police Stuff&#34;. I'm really impressed with his/her  attention to detail and the level of attention the gave to my emails. Great work. I would definitely buy from these folks again, and will if I see something that catches my eye. I bought two of them one for my friend and one for myself. I wish I could give them two 5 star reviews, but it will only allow me to write one review. They deserve two 5 stars. I don't know why Amazon won't let me write two reviews one for each. There was two orders.
1.0	We purchased this item as a Christmas gift and within the first month it quit working! Because we ordered while Christmas shopping we did not actually open and use it until a month after purchase so by the time it quit working our window to return the item had expired! Terrible purchase.
5.0	My grandsons loved it and welcomed it into their collection of Hess Trucks.  Like always Hess trucks are packaged well and provide hours of entertainment.
5.0	I love this product. This is truly a value for the money. I play Warhammer Fantasy and 40K. This works for both very well. It is packaged well. The only small quibble I have with this product is that it is heavy for it's size. I am not going to drop this on the floor to see if it is as brittle as it seems to be. I wish you well and a good day.
5.0	My 7 year old son LOVES his Snap Circuits. He has learned to line the parts up to the grid and can build most projects without help. Hours of fun and learning!
1.0	For some reason my grandson does not like this toy. I think it is beautiful but he has not played with it once. I would like to return it but do not have the box.
5.0	My kids really like this this kit and so do I.  The pieces are sizable and do not get lost as readily as tiny LEGO pieces (I can't even begin to calculate how many LEGO pieces I've accidentally swept up in the vacuum).  This 100 piece kit and the instruction booklets easily fit into a gallon Ziplock bag.  This is an excellent starter kit (which is also affordable) and you can upgrade the 100-piece inventors kit through purchasing other ZOOB kits that include other shapes, colors, and pieces with wheels if it turns out that your kids really like this toy.  To put in perspective how many things you can build with 100 pieces, in the attached picture, we built the glasses, scorpion, kangaroo, kayaker, and giraffe and we still had 11 pieces leftover so your kids can make multiple creations without having to disassemble everything.  The literature encourages users to create their own designs and there is even a &#34;Official Entry Form&#34; to submit a picture of their own creation for the Inventors Contest where winners will be featured in the next Inventors' Kit.  I should note however that although I received this product in August 2015, the contest dates was from 10/1/12 - 4/20/13 and when I went to the website (www.infinitoy.com/contest/rules.shtml) there is no reference to a current contest nor any links to imply that kids can still submit pictures of their creations.  Five instruction/assembly manuals are included for users to replicate some creations.  There are booklets to use 20, 35, 55, or 75 pieces and there is also a booklet to make the 10 creations that were winners on a prior Inventors' contest.  I think these booklets are a great jump-start to get kids interested in the product and help guide them to modifying the pieces to create their own creations.  This is a very cool kit that is durable and I can definitely see why it is considered an &#34;award winning&#34; toy.  The only downside to this product is that larger creations tend to fall apart more easily.  There is a flower design that my daughter immediately made and when she held it up, the pedals and stem began to fall off.  This didn't impact her desire to continue to play with the kit - she simply moved on to a different creation.  It seems that the more compact the creation is, the better it stays together.  Like with any new toy, learning all the different ways in which the pieces can attach together takes a little bit of patience however there are illustrations that help transition through this learning curve.  My kids really get into this toy, they figured out the assembly very easily, and there are literally hundreds of creations that can be assembled with this 100 piece kit.  We highly recommend it and we found out by accident that the pieces float (several pieces were kicked in the pool and they didn't sink to the bottom)!
5.0	Good product in regards to quality.. This item will not fit if you have any brand of aftermarket A arms only works with stock A arms.
1.0	Not at all what I was hoping for, especially considering how expensive it was.
5.0	This is such an Adorable doll! It's so nice and soft that my 4 month old likes to hug, and now that she is starting to teeth she bites her. I really like that there are different ethnic selections.
5.0	Thank you cards are post card style.
1.0	Gave as a gift & had to send back as did not perform as expected. 5 year old boy was disappointed.
5.0	I bought this to help with my toddler nephew's hand-eye coordination.  I bought the original Mr. Potato Head and my nepthew loved it, so I purchased wifey for a companion!
5.0	Exactly what I was looking for at lowest price with free shipping. Arrived in 2 weeks, much sooner than expected.
5.0	"We played this growing up. It is one of the few games we kept. It works well for kids of many ages. Little ones can play because it can be played as a game of chance. Older ones are challenged because if you keep track of where the holes go as you pull the bars you can use strategy to win. If you lose marbles you can buy the right size online (\\""regular\\"" marbles are a tiny bit too big). Classic game. And no batteries or electricity needed LOL."
5.0	These are excellent. They have a good weight to them. The white stones are smooth and the black stones are matt.
5.0	THE TOOK A WEAK FIGURE FROM THE OLD HE MAN AND MADE HIM TOUGH LOOKING AND COOL. AND IN THE CARTOON HE SOUNDS LIKE SEAN CONNERY.
1.0	The picks so huge this is the worat thin ever
5.0	I got the original in 1957 as a kid.  It's a simple build, fun, and really stoked the imagination of a 7 year-old.  The original had two exhaust flames cast in day-glo clear red, that glued onto the studs facing rearward on the thruster engines.  None of the reproductions to date have those parts, I guess it's cheaper to not include them, or maybe no one remembers that feature.  This is the same model Ed Wood used in several shots during his filming of &#34;Plan 9 from Outer Space&#34;.  If you have the DVD and freeze-frame it you can see the details.
5.0	I love iron man and this was an awesome thing to get. its durable as long as you don't keep pulling your key out. It also doesn't fit some keys but it is still awesome!
5.0	My granddaughter used these diapers for his baby doll for Christmas and she loved the diapers.  I would recommend purchasing these for sure.
5.0	Love it! Super easy to assemble. Everything comes clearly organized to be assembled. Pretty solid wood excellent material love it and would definitely recommend people to buy this table!
5.0	I purchased Melissa & Doug's Slice and Bake Cookie Set for one little girl in our circle. She loved it so much, that I bought another one for her cousin, who is only a few months younger. They have a blast with this toy. It's one of their favorites, and they use it over and over again.<br /><br />I've never purchased anything from Melissa & Doug that scored anything but top ratings. Their designs are very creative, and it's all very well made.
5.0	Fun activity for my 2.5 yo. Offers lots of options for sensory activities.
5.0	Saving for my grandson's birthday on January 21, 2014.  Has not seen his reaction yet.  Will be glad to rate after 1/21/2014.
5.0	My 12 year old loves it.  Was a great Christmas gift.  I would recommend it for anyone who likes star wars Lego.
5.0	This has been a great little helicopter for my 10 year old son.  He hasn't ever really had a decent remote control device, but wanted one for his birthday.  The one he wanted was at Target for twice the cost of this one, so I took a chance and ordered this one based on the reviews and price.  He has loved it, and we haven't had one problem after about 6 weeks.  He caught on quickly with no help, and it seems very durable, since he has had a few &#34;crashes!&#34;  I would buy it again!!!
5.0	I gave this five stars because this is a great card with a perfect price attached to it. Thanks for a great buy.
5.0	Grandsons loved it! Well made!
5.0	Love how all the pieces for this game are all self-contained. The game is part Uno, part Farkle and a little like Yahtzee. If you like those, you will like this.
5.0	My 5 year old loves it!
5.0	My son loved the little crayon character shaped crayon sharpener that came with it, and I liked how it was made entirely of plastic and had no sharp blade for him to accidentally cut himself.
5.0	I Always Use Vallejo Products
5.0	Granddaughter loves it
1.0	All this is is a bag of fabric strips - nothing special and something that anyone can make - simply by cutting slices of material. Definitely overpriced - don't waste your money
5.0	I liked this set. It was affordable and it has many pieces to it. The baby bottle was adorable. I recommend this set.
5.0	We had so much fun with this game poking fun about the silly stuff we tend to get upset about so easily. Get it play with some friends you'll see<br /><br />Satisfied in Milwaukee
1.0	Would have loved to write a favorable review for these, however when I received them all five batteries had extremely loose connectors, and none would accept a charge. (Three different chargers). At first a couple would charge for a minute or two, and then shut off the charger. Thought maybe I was doing something wrong, but tried all different combinations of batteries-chargers to no avail. I need decent batteries to resume learning to fly helis. Service was awesome, refund process was relatively painless.. Tips on charging, tips on reliable batteries appreciated.
5.0	We bought this for our Greatnephew who is 2 1/2 for Christmas. We tried it out when it first came. It is really neat! He absolutely loved it, too!
1.0	I didnt like it because it looked really fake and it got really wrinkley. People started to notice that it was fake because of the color and the wrinkles
5.0	I got this for my daughters Frozen birthday party. It looks nice and she liked it. It fit in with the them nicely.
5.0	Love these. Great for little ones and adults. Kids, aged 1 1/2, 4, 5 and 10 years, have used them and been happy. Unlike normal crayons, you don't have to worry about the kids peeling off the paper or breaking them in two. I like that my hand doesn't smell of crayon after using them.
5.0	I am very pleased with these tools. Recently found them in pastel colors locally for $8 each. A good buy here. Packaged just fine, Delivery timetable okay. My 5 1/2 yo grandson loves working with the tools.
5.0	Who doesn't love Bozo!! This is a great addition to any collection.I purchased this dummy for my grandsons 5 th birthday ! These are well made.Easy to care for.Great for beginners or just to sit in a child's room.
5.0	We tied a string to the post before adding the top layer and turned it into an ornament. It's a Lego product, so of course the quality is great. And we love toys that aren't made in China.
5.0	Perfect for my daughters stuffed animals and sturdy enough for her to drag around.
5.0	My daughter has many many stuffed animals, but this one actually stands out! Sweet face, very soft, and a narwhal!
5.0	This was for my grandson who is 5 and he absolutely loves it!!  Many hours of building fun and a challenge for him.
5.0	My 8 years kid liked it so much. Specially he is into these cards. It makes a nice surprise if your kid into these cards.
5.0	costume quality,  it makes a few sounds,  cheap plastic toy but that is what I expected.
5.0	Product purchased for my daughter, very good quality and finish. I recommend it 100% for children of any age.so you can buy with confidence
5.0	I've ordered the ships from this collection that are available on Amazon.  It has great detail but the wings don't move on this particular Bird of Prey model.  The magazines have great info.  Good piece for a Star Trek collector or for someone who just likes the ships.
5.0	Granddaughter loves this and enjoys playing with this all the time
1.0	Don't waste money.<br />Doesn't work
5.0	Both the two and a half year old and one year old enjoy playing with this wooden puzzle with magnetic pieces and wand. We are glad we found these.
5.0	Exactly as described. Reasonable quality. Delivered on time before Xmas. Reasonable price. Nice size.
5.0	Love all of the different stores and places to visit in the &#34;city&#34; on this map. Parents of clients have commented on how great it is!
5.0	This dress is adorable and very well made. I could not be any happier about it. Just love it and my daughter does too!
5.0	Gave this as a gift to a 5 year old to go with her fisher price house . She loved it. Had been looking for this but couldn't find it only at Amazon.
5.0	I consider this dress, the best ooh all the ones I bought,<br />Nice outfit with cute shoes and bag, I really recommend this outfit
5.0	I am glad I put this tribute collectable doll in honor of Elizabeth Taylor on my wish list. I was so happy to receive it as a birthday gift! Thanks Erika (you know who you are). I now have all three of the Mattel Taylor dolls.
5.0	bought this for my 6 year old God-daughter for Xmas.  she loved it and plays with it a lot. fits the soft dolls and the larger ones too. the scooter does more than just go back and forth. overall made well. arrived fast and was packaged well.
5.0	I purchased this for my grandson that LOVES anything to do with Cars. He had a hospital stay a year ago at a Devos Childrens Hospital in Grand Rapids Michigan and the movie helped him SO much. This along with a Leapster2 game controller will be going to him at Christmas.
5.0	I bought both the Alexis and Krystal dolls as the show was at its peak in popularity when I was in my 20's.  Absolutely love Krystal-Mattell nailed it with her! Her hair, face and clothing are spot on. However, the Alexis doll in comparison is a real disappointment, if they weren't meant to be  a set I would have returned her.  Alexis looks like just another brunette Barbie with a pretty dress and nice jewelry-her hair is even awful and does not look like Alexis to me at all.  I will be giving the Alexis doll 2 stars-but by all means get Krystal you wont be sorry!
1.0	This product, although looks like a Rainbow Loom, is really a counterfeit product and VERY poor quality.  Rainbow loom replacement parts DO NOT work on this product.  Copy and paste this link to see more information on this.  Don't get tricked like we did!!  [...]
5.0	One day my friends and I decided to buy this game because it was recommended by another friend.  We brought it home and played it and from then on it became our obsession.  We brought it to school and every party we went to and it became a hit with everyone. People would beg me to bring it and get mad when I forgot it.  We are 16, this is not just a game for little kids or families, it's great for everyone and will be a big hit whenever you play it!
5.0	Cute teddy, I really recommend all the things I rate highly I stand by them 100%!!!!!!<br />I am very happy and so are those I bought them for!!!
5.0	My niece loved the bracelets!
5.0	Got this for family member who owns chihuahua! When I received product, it sang only like 3 songs. But it's hilarious. Couldn't stop laughing. Toy isn't soft-spoken. Sings pretty coherently. Head moves and juevos move as well. It was also bigger than expected. It's about the size of a real chihuahua. Get it if you have someone who loves chihuahuas and a good laugh! Very entertaining!!!
5.0	Have this in my 1/10 2wd ruckus, works pretty good.
5.0	It's a great educational product suitable for grade schoolers.  It may need some adult guidance during assembly and punching the pinhole.  I recommend using a small cut up piece of aluminum can as pinhole section rather than the included foil.  It's a fun introduction to film photography for all ages!
5.0	My kids had a great time with this kit. They have always loved the Magic School Bus and Miss Frizzle so this kit was a great way for them to learn about the human body. I would highly recommend this product.
5.0	My grandchildren love this slide.  It's sturdy as well as colorful.  Very happy with the product.
5.0	2nd Polar express set, the Grandkids love trains !
5.0	great set of craft brushes
5.0	This game is quite a lot of fun and far less intimidating than some other strategy games.  I especially like how it adds an element of randomness and mystery on which roles each player chose.
5.0	My kids love anything Star Wars!
5.0	I ordered this for my youngest grandson. I know he will love it along with his red ninja costume. Thanks
5.0	I been searching everywhere for this purple minion! I love it! It is too bad I can't ship directly back to Singapore, and need to use agent to do it, and it cost a bomb! Shipping fee is even more expensive than the doll itself! Nevertheless, I'm still glad that I finally manage to bought it.
5.0	It is perfect for make better your lessons
5.0	I searched and reviewed many children table &  chair sets.  I know Doug and Melissa products are very well made and solid. At our local mall, I saw a display of this particular table/chair and was impressed with the whole thing!  My grand daughter, who just turned two, sits at it for many purposes, ( eat, color, puzzles, ect. ).  The seats are sturdy that my husband or I often sit in the 2nd chair, (and we are like 180# each! It ran about $100.00 and well worth it for the sturdiness and build. I'd buy or recommend this in a heartbeat!!
5.0	Love the poster included and got 3 reverse holo rares, a holo rare and 3 exs (including a full art Mega Gallade)! Really helps a collector or someone who'd like to start playing the tcg.
5.0	I have an 5 year old girls that loves K'nex.<br />It's the third box were buying and she keeps building interesting stuff.
1.0	Fish basically stays in one place and spins in one continuous circle. Your kids will be disappointed unless they are very, very young. Don't bother with this. There have to be better ones for your kids on the market. Count your blessings it appears to no longer be in stock.
5.0	Great gag for over the hill gang
5.0	Great math tool for early childhood.  Also works well for fine motor using the pincer grasp.
5.0	This is just TOO CUTE! Every Ice Bat lover should buy one because HE is such a cuddler. :)
5.0	We had so much fun when these little critters arrived. All out flying animal war. I never laughed so hard! It's like a new kind of rubber band fight for kids and adults alike.
5.0	These days kids get the best toys. And this one is one of them. I am totally in love with this product. So much fun to make pretend. I just wished I was a kid again myself so I could join in.
5.0	My grandson collects Batman figures, and this Joker was one of his favorites.  It is an asset to his collection.
5.0	We have a 6 year old and a 2 year old who both love to play with this toy...along with us. Unlike a regular frisbee style flying disc, this is soft and easier to handle for our little ones. Great product.
5.0	I purchased this item for my grandson and he is just learning how to operate his Leapster.  The different aspects of the game teaches him various skills.  He loves it.  I am very pleased with all the Leapster products I have purchased.
5.0	my grand daughter is a princess. She's wanted this for a while now, I finally bought it for her. It's a adorable and perfect for a Christmas gift.
5.0	It's exactly like the picture. It's perfect and well put together. You'll absolutely love it trust me.
5.0	Great hit with my granddaughter and grandson!!!!
5.0	I bought one for my niece and loved it, so I just had to get one for myself.  LOL!  This figure is great... however... as another review said, my Axel figures hands did break.  It wasn't just yours!  LOL.  It's okay, though.  He's a display item only, so it's not too bad.  He's still a great figure.  I love him.
5.0	Love it. Great, sturdy product.  After one year, still in perfect condition.
5.0	This product is just as well made as the other Melissa & Doug products we have purchased, we love them all!
5.0	Great price, fast shipping.  Thank you.
5.0	While the first one didn't work, it was quickly replaced with a new one.  Absolutely no haddle outside of a phone call.
5.0	Everybody loves Sulley! This guy takes a lot of abuse, but he just keeps smiling.
5.0	Nice slow crawler motor. Bought it for my 4 year old boy to put in his Tamiya Pumpkin. It's slow so he can control it better. So far so good.
1.0	Within 5 minutes the flashlight switch fell off so is now useless.  The camera takes 35mm film, do they even make that anymore?  Terrible product, they shouldn't be allowed to sell this. Disney made enough money off Frozen to make a better quality toy!
5.0	My son received these for his seventh birthday. He was very happy to add them to his already big collection. He says we only need a few more to complete the collection ;)
5.0	Bought as a christmas present
5.0	That's the way a toy should be. Hips of fun with all that noice. Very good quality and easy to handle
5.0	These are really cute but I was really surprised how small they are.
1.0	We have been avid fans of Amazon.com for years. The Kids love the brown box excitement when they open them. My Lord, When we opened this up excitement was palpable, only to find they are paper weights. Change the Description CLEARLY. This is not a toy.. it is a disappointment.
5.0	For families that have nursing babies or to whom nursing is natural & a way of life, this is a prime toy ! My granddaughters fell in love with it at first glance. Actually, for children that have not been exposed to nursing in the family, this is a lovely toy as well. Provides them with a nature nurture tool. I will probably get the nursing pig & nursing cat too at some point. Just delightful nurturing toys. The puppies stay hooked on with a magnet & it really works well.
5.0	Great game! Fun for the whole family.
5.0	When searching for a doll crib for my granddaughter I wanted something authentic like the one I had for her mother when she was little.  This heirloom cradle is perfect.  It is sturdy enough for our little one to swing it with gusto and looks adorable in her room.  She loves playing with it, putting her dollies to bed and rocking them.  It entertains her for long stretches and the educational aspect of her learning to nurture is really valuable, too.  I would definitely buy this little cradle again without hesitation and from this Seller as it arrived on time and as described.
5.0	For what I expected this globe to be, based upon reviews here, I got what I expected.  It isn't high quality, but it is what it is!  Which is a very small globe for a child or where space is limited.  I have both a large, higher quality globe and this one.  I use this one for a quick reference, without getting up to refer to my bigger globe.  This would be a nice, first globe for a child - if they don't toss it around!
5.0	my granddaughter picked it out herself. i'm sure it's the first of many times that she exchanges what granny picked out for something that she likes better. lol! as long as that little princess is happy, gramma's happy!
5.0	Red light targeting beam!  Scope with crosshair hash!  Silencer!  Magazine clip!  Great sound effects!  This gun rocks.  Absolutely rocks.  Kids today are lucky.  Glad I'm a big kid so I can get in on the action.
5.0	Avent bottles are pretty good, they do leak if you screw the cap too tightly though.  They also make good storage containers for baby food later on.  I think they are worth the money overall.
5.0	This was a gift for my grandson who absolutely loved it.  He said it was what he had always wanted .
5.0	"I have an over-sized tough little 20 month old and she absolutely loves this set! Best purchase by far thanks to her Papa. I've read complaints about it being \\""hazardous\\"", \\""flimsy\\"", and \\""too distracting\\"". Simple fact of the matter is that you have to teach your child how to play. You can't expect to give them two sticks and they're going to automatically know how to handle them or how to use them. And the tambourine is not \\""sharp\\"" lol. Also, how can anyone complain about the color of a children's toy being distracting?! They're supposed to be colorful to gain attention and keep it. That's part of the educational process. My child can't speak but if I tell her to go drum, she does. If I say play the tambourine, she does. It's learned behavior. And she is a tough kid. I mean TOUGH. So her toys take a beating and these stand up. The only thing I would agree to is that the top of the drum does not connect...though that was kind of obvious seeing as the other toys are contained in it. Simple fix...super glue. VOILA!"
5.0	This is such a great product!  I have always had good luck with KidKraft products.  As with their other items, this is very durable, well made, and solid!  It took me about 30 minutes to assemble, so easy.....and it holds up under the pressure of both my 4 and 2 year olds on it.  Granted, it is only made for one child, but it is that sturdy.  The hair and ears are really cute and I am very comfortable leaving my 2 year old on this by herself.  Even when she is rocking fast, it only moves a little bit, but has never toppled over.  Great for a little girl, I would buy this again in a heartbeat!
5.0	This was a suoer fun puzzle it did take a while to finish!
5.0	This is such a great gift for any little girl and gives two looks with one product.  The tutu look is also perfect if your little girl is a little bit shorter.  My daughter is 17 months and fits great.  I can't imagine a 3 year old wearing this, but I would imagine it depends on their build.
5.0	OUTSTANDING product.  I highly recommend buying this item.  I work at a public library, and bought this for the children who visit.  Everyone loves it.
5.0	My 2 year old son got this for his birthday and is a HUGE fan of it...even my 5 year old loves this toy- they play with it together daily.  The truck is so realistic, the little yellow car is amazing...it is SO fast, and it hops over everything- from the ledge in our entryway to the bumps in the sidewalk.  Love this toy...perfect for that little person who loves trucks!
5.0	Great product, well priced and shipping was accurate
5.0	I think this doll is great and looks like Dakota Fanning. I like how her smirk was captured. Her outfit is great. I really love her beautiful face and striking red eyes. I know some people have bought the Twilight dolls for children to play with, but I recommend that this doll only be given to an older child who isn't as rough with her things because her body and legs are hollow plastic. She is definitely more durable for someone who is a collector. I have mine out of her box and on a shelf and I'm not worried about her durability at all. I especially liked her necklace with the Volturi crest. The actual pendant part of the necklace is metal. I thought that was a nice touch. All in all, I have to say she is a great doll and a must have for Twilight fans and Barbie collectors alike!
5.0	A fun and easy game everyone can enjoy! Travels well.
1.0	Cheap mask, came broken and cracked, you get what you pay for
5.0	My six-year-old daughter is a huge Barbie fan, and we have one other Mega Bloks Barbie-themed playset, which she has enjoyed for a long time. This &#34;Fab Mansion&#34; set is even better, in her opinion (and mine).  Keep in mind that this is not like a Lego set, where you build everything completely from scratch.  It is more of an interior decorator kit, where you select the layout and furnish the room with tons of tiny accessories.  Although there may not be much actual &#34;building&#34; going on, there is a lot of room for fun and creativity.  My daughter loved this set and played with it for hours after school.  Honestly, she was engaged with it for more than two hours.<br /><br />It has pretty much everything a young Barbie-loving girl will want - lots of pink, nifty accessories like a hair dryer, teddy bear, flower pots, fridge, and TV, Barbie figurines, a dog, and, well, lots of pink.  It's an elaborate set, even though describing it as a &#34;mansion&#34; is a bit of a stretch.  This is not the Barbie Dream House, but it is a very fun, highly interactive set for any little girl who likes to decorate or play house.  And my daughter loves both, so this was a perfect set for her.<br /><br />One pretty obvious word of warning: as the box states, there are 222 pieces here, and most of them are very, very small.  You will definitely want to devote a plastic tub or some sort of sealed container to this set if you have any hope of keeping 3/4 of the pieces together.  It can, however, be combined with other Mega Bloks Barbie sets.
5.0	This is the perfect game to lure you kids away from the PS3.  You can spend quality time with them while bonding at the same time.  My teenager loves this game.  I took a little while to get the order, but it was worth waiting for.
5.0	I purchased this for my husband along with a larger Phantom quadrocopter, with the intent that he could use this to practice controlling a quadrocopter, etc. This little toy has been flown for many hours, crashed many times, has been fished out of trees at least twice, and it's still running 3 months later. Pretty great for the price. It's worth buying extea batteries so you can enjoy more flying time.
5.0	Just what I was looking for! I looked at so many tool sets for my son. He just turned 2 so I wanted something sturdy that would not be damaged if he chewed on it or dropped it. These fit the bill. it is a hard plastic with good weight to it and they fit him perfectly. The pager sadly only works half the time. But I got it for the tools not the beeping sound. One warning though if your little one likes to hit others or things be careful as these are heavier than most toy tools and could easily result in a broken window or a bruised sibling.
5.0	Beautiful and perfect. Perfect for collecting.
5.0	Great conversation piece in my office.
5.0	Huge value for a Jeff Gordon fan!  Wonderful and space efficient collectible!  Love it! Want to find more like it.
5.0	it won me an award for best overall costume.
5.0	Still very fun, but different from the first making the games interesting.  The first one is slightly better in my opinion, but still great.
5.0	This has occupied my three-year old for many hours over the past week-- it's really a great toy, especially for the price!  There are lots of different ways to construct the set and easy enough to add other animals and toys to the playtime.  As another reviewer mentioned, if you are rough with it, the little tabs that lock each thing in place can get bent.  It's just important to show your child how to attach and remove the attachable things (window, slide, storefront, etc).  I'm totally pleased with this playset overall.
1.0	I reviewed another item from this company, which resulted in the same waste of time and money. I will shorten my review here. NEVER, EVER buy anything from NKOK, for they not only make a toy which will immediately break upon completing setup of it, but will NEVER respond to any inquiry about replacing it. I sent them two emails about this toy and they have never responded to my inquiry.<br /><br />Please do not waste your time and hard-earned money on garbage. Go somewhere else, do your homework, and purchase a toy from a reputable company that will stand behind the product they make. NKOK does not care about you or your children. They only care about taking your money and giving you a piece of trash in return.<br /><br />Be warned!
1.0	I got these in the mail and only recieved one of the boxes, which was slightly torn. I opened it up, and found that I had only gotten Miku, Rin, Len Kaito and Meiko. And not only that, but the quality was terrible. In fact when I looked at the Rin Nendoroid, I realized that I already had it; I got  Keychain at an Anime store that had that exact nendoroid, terrible quality and all, but n a chain for $5. I am really dissapointed, and wasted my money on a piece of junk, that was not even complete. PLEASE DO NOT BUY THESE NENDOROIDS.
5.0	This is the third type of bubble gun I've bought.  Best one yet.  Doesn't leak... easily.  Consistent reliable bubbles.  Cool
5.0	Got this for 9 yr old grandson, he and his dad have spent hours assembling and playing with this set. very happy with it.
5.0	I felt like I was able to play within 10 minutes. The condensed rules are logical and easy to follow. As a GM, I use the CORE book and give this very cost effective booklet to my players. Highly efficient.
5.0	Perfect for my daughters witch costume!
5.0	This card is in excellent condition. This card looks as advertised.
5.0	My 2 year old grandson is going to Luv this.  It came in perfect condition.
1.0	not that player friendly
5.0	cute! I got them for my granddaughters and I know they will love them!
5.0	Great fun, especially if you like Scrabble or any word game!
5.0	"Purchased the \\""Little Superstar Sing-Along Stage on 12/13/07, it arrived a few days before Christmas. Everything was in good working conditions; all the parts were there and it was ready to go. My 16 month old loves it. I can't keep my 8 yr old away from it. We are very satified with this purchase and would recommend it to anyone."
5.0	I can see the numbers and everyone says ooooooo! when they see them. lol They're almost to nice to roll.
1.0	This was a very disappointing purchase.  When it arrived, the base was loose and had to be tightened with a screwdriver.  Not a big deal at all.  But what did bother me was the fact that our American Girl doll could not stand properly in the stand.  She tipped over frequently and ultimately got a scratch on her face.  As a collector, I am not happy with this purchase, which was intended to enable us to protect and display valuable dolls.  As an alternative, I recommend the Our Generation pink 18 inch doll stands sold at Target.  These are similar in price and of superior quality.
5.0	At my local dollar store they sell huge packs of these as decorations for plants..etc..they are multicolor.I'd suggest going to a dollar store or a plant store to buy the refills..itll save tons of money..u could even use them for orbeez refills. But the toy itself isawesome! I love playing with it.very durable. Great price for the gun itself. We have the crossbows.
5.0	It is very cute and my sone loves it
5.0	Excellent customer service.<br />Amazing product.<br />Item as described.<br />THANKS....
5.0	My granddaughters ages 9 and 6 absolutely love the science kit.  They tell each other that they are scientists.  They look forward to playing with it.  I will definitely continue to purchase more advanced kits as they grow.  A great starter science kit.
5.0	I received the product around two weeks earlier than expected.also it is an excellent product.I highly recommend.deadpool bowen action statue
5.0	I especially liked the metal box.  I liked the game pieces, and the level of difficulty of the game.  I would recommend it to anyone with preschoolers.  All five of my grandchildren have enjoyed it.
5.0	Beautiful color!  Exactly as pictured.  Worked perfectly in the heart sand ceremony vase.  I had 3 colors (Me, my husband and my son) for my wedding and had sand left over.
5.0	I recently purchased an 1899 Black Eagle silver certificate on eBay and wanted to be sure that it would be protected, so I picked up this item.  It works wonderfully.  Through a mechanism that I'm not quite sure of, it opens easily but closes very securely.  The bill fits perfectly inside, and I have no doubt that it will protected for a very long time.  The plastic is transparent but very solid.  Overall, this is an excellent, excellent product.
5.0	great idea and it works like a charm!!
5.0	cool cloth cape and neat helmet detail also glad it comes with a speeder biker pistol cuz i lost mine haha
5.0	Fisher price makes wonderful and sturdy children's toys, this bike is no exception.  I had purchased a very pricey trike for my toddler but it was so heavy he could barely maneuver it, once this was assembled my son got on and within minutes he was riding it the way I imagined he would.  This is now his favorite ride-on toy, he rides it every day.  This low priced trike is an awesome product.
5.0	Purchased this to repair the damaged receiver on my V911. The board does not come with any instructions. No big deal if you are familiar with electronics. Just remove the old board and re-solder the power connector, main motor and tail motor. My V911 came back to life, just like new again.
5.0	Adorable and pretty well made, made a great present for my shark loving companion.
5.0	Adorable! My grand baby loves it.
5.0	Got this for a christmas present...works flawlessly.  Most everyone who sees it comments positively.  I highly recommend this product if you are looking for a uniques gift.
5.0	Bought this as a gift for my niece since she collects the Monster High dolls. She has been wanting this one for awhile now and I was excited to stumble across it on Amazon. The package arrived quickly and in great condition. I would recommend purchasing this item for any young girl who likes the Monster High dolls.
5.0	Child-2.5 years, very satisfied! Bike itself is bright, colorful and qualitative performance, easy-going! And it's very easy, moms will understand me!
5.0	When I ordered this for my granddaughter's 3rd birthday I had my doubts about it being the right age gift for her.  A lot of  <br />the reviews talked about this for younger kids.  She loves it!! <br />We had her for the weekend and by Sunday afternoon she could pick out the letters from her name and the starting letters for both her mom and dad's names.  The daycare/preschool she goes to works on their letters and now I see how much she's learned and how fast she picks up new things.  Thanks Leap Frog!
5.0	It's a cute little stuffed grizzly bear, I'm not sure how much more I really need to say.  It's good quality, nice and soft, and very cute!
5.0	Looked great at my party.Perfect for a kids party, arrived quickly as promised.It was just the touch that my party needed!
5.0	I bought this for a Christmas present for my 3 year old granddaughter.  She loved it.  Now she wants to be a mermaid.
5.0	I played game with friends and they love it too!
5.0	Was hard to find at the time, but a great buy!
1.0	When they arrived the package was soaked:  I threw them all away!
1.0	Many of the stickers had already come off by the time the package arrived at my door.  Of the ones that were still on, many had shifted, so the sticky part was obviously not working well. There is no way I can put these in the goody bags for my daughter's birthday. Very disappointing.
5.0	My grandson loves this product and sleeps with it every night.... Since he is into Toy Story, this really came in handy for sleeping..
5.0	LOVED it, totally fantastic and definitely a good buy,  make a good purchase with this one and you'll be pleased
5.0	Love it. Got this for my son for Christmas. Was pretty cool and educational. Obviously not the most exciting gift, but is a great value and is something that can be kept forever, not like some plastic toy that will be thrown out or donated a year later.
5.0	Awesome fun and definitely one not hard to learn or boring.  If you do have any problems learning the game just put &#34;Dungeon Roll&#34; in search at YouTube.
5.0	This was a gift for my 2yr old son for Easter and he loved it.  He is in speech therapy right now and this toy really helps us get him talking while he is playing.  The tub it comes in is really sturdy and seems like it is going to stand up to whatever a 2yr old can throw at it.  Overall very satisfied with the quality of this toy.
5.0	Great item and the gift recipient seemed to enjoy it as well.
5.0	My husband wanted slime as he could no longer play with it when he was a kid he did enjoy playing with the slime it's much the same as slime from when we were kids (38-43 years ago) the only downside each tube was difficult to open.
5.0	She's a nine year old collector of little glass figurines and she loved it!!!!  I'll have to watch for sales on these little critters.
5.0	My husband and I bought this for our granddaughters second birthday. She loved it and so did the other children at the party. We were very pleased with the size and quality of the product.
5.0	A gift for a special little friend who loved this
5.0	They cured my boyfriends athletes foot
5.0	This wis a great game for groups of any age. I played this with my family and the youngest of us was 33 and it was still a lot of fun.
5.0	Prefect duplicate of the real thing, again my 1 and 1/2 year old grandson loves helping mama with house work
5.0	Fast shipping, kids loved them!
5.0	Product is as expected. They are quality Lego products...just don't expect the packaging to be such. They arrive in a plain, unmarked plastic bag as previous reviewers have written. I would recommend seller and product!
5.0	"This was actually my first oracle deck and I love it still.  It is clearly a \\""WISDOM DECK\\"" not a Tarot.  If you look at the pictures you can clearly see this is NOT TAROT.  The cards are nicely done, but no, not quite as vividly done as the packaging.  The artwork is beautiful though and the cards aren't any thinner than my tarot decks, just larger.  If you're new to the Oracles this is a nice set to start."
5.0	Grandson loves this plays with it all the time.
5.0	My daughter really loves this and I secretly like playing with it with her too.  I agree with another reviewer that the idea of a &#34;pet salon&#34; rather than having something less shallow (like a vet's set) isn't the best and just reinforces appearances/etc. - but it's a really cute toy, well made, with cute (not too annoying!) songs and sounds - and we love how Minnie and the pets can wear the bows.  Besides, it is fun to be a little shallow sometimes.  And if this gets my daughter to allow me to brush her absolutely wild hair, all the better. :)
5.0	Absolutely love the monkey as my great granddaughter is going to do also.  And most importantly the monkey was AMERICAN MADE!!!!
1.0	Some don't have magnets and others don't stick because the magnet is to low.<br />I do not suggest this product as the quality isn't there.
1.0	I hate to say it, but this game really is as bad as the other posters have stated. My daughter & I are huge fans of all things Eric Carle, so we were very excited.  The whole concept of this is just strange & boring, so we wound up keeping the cards as flashcards & trashed the rest.
5.0	THERE IS HOPE!!! As long as you have this card ;) Amazing card, amazingly speedy shipping, and arrived in Excellent condition!
1.0	"I thought it was cute and bought it for my granddaughter who is turning 1...it said it sings Happy Birthday...I was disappointed then when I received it, to hear it play...\\""they say it's your birthday\\""..had I known I would not have purchased it for her...that is a song for someone \\""older\\"" ..does not fit the cute little dog in a box...disappointed for sure."
5.0	As usual with Funko, this is an awesome figurine. An absolute &#34;must buy&#34; for any Thundercats fan and/or 80s nostalgia enthusiast.
5.0	Description is what it is.  Although I did find a couple of commons.  It ended up putting me over 100 cards as if it may have been made up for. The rares were packaged separately from the uncommons but all the cards were there both orders I got exactly what I asked for. You were expecting something fancy need to stop being so naïve. If You are a collector I recommend buying them singles. As for me I'm new to the game and like all the cards I get useful or not.
5.0	my grandson likes this toy
5.0	Never saw this figure on store shelves (Toys'R'Us Exclusive). So I was excited to add this to my collection. This is the same mold as the 2008 Bumblebee Deluxe Movie figure, but this was part of a small series, replicating the scanning process as seen in the Transformers film. PROS: 1) Molded in Clear Plastic - gives a nice effect in Alt (Car) Mode. 2) Nice scanning paint applications, 3) Much better head/face paint compared to regular mold. Lighter Gray Face and bright blue eyes. 4) Transformation is good, lots of moving parts.5) Cool Arm Cannon! MINOR CONS: 1) Robot Mode - Paint apps are flat. Would look better with some dark washes on face, arms and arm cannon. 2) The eyes tend to look beady, they could use more paint details. 3) The clear plastic does not work in Robot Mode - creates almost a ghost like effect and Bumblebee's upper torso looks like it's floating. OVERALL: The paint on this figure showcases Bumblebee's face much better, especially from a distance. NOTE: Although there are 3 other figures in the scanning series, the effect works best on Bumblebee and Sideswipe. I highly recommend this figure! Looks Fantastic in Alt (Car) Mode. Retail: $12.99
5.0	It arrived way earlier than the estimated date, which was my son's birthday - he's got to toy on his birthday.  Thank you.
5.0	The Home Depot Leaf Blower is shaped like dad's, sounds like dad's and my son honestly feels like daddy wouldn't be able to get the job done without him!
5.0	My 8-year old granddaughter loved this, and spent a couple of hours playing with it Xmas afternoon!  Would definitely recommend this gift.
5.0	Excellent for dinosaur display. Displays well.
5.0	Good, nice and cheap.
5.0	really nicely made, not cheap plastic. great price too! Great for couponers or business card organizing too!
5.0	Our grandson enjoys playing with this!
5.0	This is basically a clear coat flat/matte spray for your plastic model kits.  Good for painted kits or color matched unpainted plastic model kits to give it a matte/flat sheen and finish giving your kit a more polished look.  Also good after applying decals to secure them in place and keep paint from fading or flaking off.  The only downside is 88ml is a small volume and it will run out after a couple model kits.
5.0	Perfect. Granddaughter loved it.
5.0	My grandson loves to play with it.  It  entertains him for hours. Love the fact that it shows the alphabet & numbers while saying it.
5.0	My son will love this. It's going to be a great Christmas gift and what I would expect for $25. If you have an obsessed LOL gamer in your life and want to get him something besides the obvious. Get him (or her!) this! Inside it also comes with a chain so they can be worn as necklaces.
5.0	i orded this car i recived it ok good price but i orded the car with headlight covers but i got a car with round head lights i would keep the car and order another one i just want to make sure it has head light covers like the photo thanks
5.0	These cards were for a gentlman in an assisted living home.  He cold not see thecardsand he wanted to play pinochle.  We found the cards and they were delivered very quickly and now he can see thecards and play.
5.0	These are the dice I use exclusively for silly rolls. They've yet to fail me. Even when using the Fly spell from 500 feet to hurl bricks at my enemies, or determining the accuracy of my Peasant Rail Gun.
5.0	Fun squirting camera. I've tricked several of my students.
5.0	Very sturdy and great for the grandson's to play with on the frig.
5.0	My 3 year old loves the Snap 'n Style dolls.  They are easy for her to handle by herself---much more so than the similar Disney Magiclip dolls.  The Magiclip dolls are hard for ME to dress and undress, and are a great source of frustration for my daughter.<br /><br />What I like about the Snap 'n Style dolls:<br />--They stand up by themselves.<br />--They have nice, brushable hair.<br />--They are easy for younger children to dress and undress (with the exception of the shoes, those are a little more difficult)<br />--When undressed, they are still in a swimsuit and flip-flops style, which is cute.<br />--They are affordable.<br />--The pieces are large enough that I'm not worried about choking hazards.<br /><br />I have a hard time locating these dolls in stores, but Amazon always has them for a good price.  This is my second Snap 'n Style doll, and it probably won't be my last.
1.0	This junk does not belong in a civilized home.  Sold it on ebay the same day I received it.  Nasty.
5.0	It looked great on the cake thanks! It definitely lit the room up. My daughter was so surprised and pleased
5.0	I bought this item for my 6 & 4 year old and they LOVE IT! However, I am going to have to order another set because one set will not build a fort big enough for both of them to sleep in but that was expected at time of purchase. Well built product and surprisingly tough.
5.0	My daughters ages 8 and 9 love these. They are so cute. They love rag dolls because they are so floppy and these dolls are just the same but plastic! Just a bit bigger than polly pockets. Their legs swing freely, heads bobble, and their arms can be twisted. Just very cute. Seem very well made and durable. They were their favorite toy this Christmas! Agree with the prior reviewer to wait for the $7.00 price though because really the only cool things in the set are the dolls so shouldn't pay more than the retail price for sure.
5.0	I bought this for my daughter's freinds birthday. Their both big hello kitty fans and I thought this was great. It turned out awesome. Packaged very cute and made me look good in front of the other parents. Definite buy if they're into hello kitty.
1.0	Another item I should have just got at the Dollar Store.  Those items would have been MUCH better. Very poor quality, very few items worked and the majority were broken. Just threw away!
5.0	I purchased this toy for Christmas and it was a hit.  My nephews loved them.  They are durable and easy to use for the smaller child (toddlers).
5.0	Great condition, its definitely new, there are no creases in it, I am a very satisfied customer, I greatly recommend it :)
5.0	My daughter absolutely loves this toy! She makes sandwiches for her mom and dad and then starts to do the same for all of her dolls. The pieces all velcro stick to each other making it a fun toy that lasts a long time. It teaches her names of foods which I love and it's really good for her imagination. Overall good quality toy and we bought it at a sale price so good for Mom too!
5.0	My son loves it, great product as advertised. My son is very violent with his toys, this toy has been thrown off of ledges and has survived.
5.0	This game is simple to learn, yet astonishingly addicting. A game round takes around 30 minutes, and come win or lose you will be dying to play again. We have a lot of fun playing this board game.
5.0	HOURS of entertainment for our son! LOVE!
5.0	Amazing, great quality
5.0	This is a larger toy that has a tiny gup style car that can launch out. My 3 year old and 5 year old fight over this one!!!
5.0	Our son has most of the Leap games and books and he loves this item in particular. He has been reading clearly since he was just over 4, now reads at a 3rd grade level at age 5, and I attribute items like this to his overall success. I would point out that this is more of a first stage stepping-stone, where as the Leap Reader &#34;pen&#34; System (see link) was where our son graduated to from this, and is now what he uses more than this item (which is good in more ways than one, the Reader system is looking at actual books, whereas this product involves screen time). The Disney Planes material was quality as well, and of course that was the most attractive part to our son - he wasn't at all disappointed that this wasn't a traditional game for his Leap Pad.<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00CRZXV3O?ref_=pdp_new_dp_review<br /><br />Overall, this was only a single cog in a larger working machine of in-house assignments with traditional workbooks, preschool, and most importantly, sitting down with your child and reading to them on a daily basis from an actual book (which we have been doing since he was in utero).
5.0	My one year old little girl had grown really attached to Kissy Cat and lost it a few months ago. I searched for him everywhere because she was beside herself without him. I finally found him and of course, he just happens to be a collectors item now. Oh well, definately worth the reaction when she saw the new one!!!
5.0	This is a great stroller, and it's in a neutral color so it's just perfect for boys to play with, too. I was skeptical that this inexpensive stroller would hold up to the play of an energetic toddler, but it has turned out to be very sturdy. My twins give it four thumbs up!!
5.0	My daughter loves this toy. She was about 13 months old when I got it and she has been playing with it nonstop. It did take a little while until she figured out how to put the blocks together but, within a week she was building things in my living room. It was also great in teaching her how to clean up after herself. We would grab the little wagon and drag it throughout the room picking up all the pieces. She now knows when were done playing how to clean up after herself automatically. I have to admit I thought it would be broken by now with all the abuse it gets, between my now 18 month old sitting and standing in it and our 100 pound dog occasionally stepping in, around, and on it, but it's held up great. It's wonderful. I was also happy to learn I can buy additional blocks very inexpensively. She also has the mega bloks bus, they all interchange. It's a great toy that gives me hours of quiet time.
1.0	low quality, doesn't lock together when assembling
5.0	I gave this doll and a Little Red Riding Hood pop up book to a young child for this Christmas.  I am sure she will have hours of fun playing make believe with the book and doll.  Clever Idea.
5.0	My son had some birthday money from an aunt, so I let him get on Amazon and look up some Thomas trains. He was so excited to find Flynn. It's exactly as pictured/described and we're happy with it!
5.0	These have become mandatory stock in my field box. Easy to use and very reliable. A must for micro FPV HUD! Seller JKM ships very fast and is USA based! I received my order on third day! Plugs are solid and well thought out...cleanly wrapped ta boot!
5.0	Is awesome I love it it looks like a real police uniform
5.0	My kids like puzzles a lot and this puzzle is cute and it is a challenge to do. The packaging was great too.
1.0	Worst instructions I've ever seen.  The poles are not labeled at all.  They are different lengths.  I called the company to complain and have never heard back.
5.0	I do gospel magic and have used a stiff rope in my show for years. After several years' use (and abuse), my old rope needed to be replaced. The construction of this stiff rope is top quality. The trick works perfectly.
5.0	this is a wonderful learning toy, perfectly safe for younger children (a certain 4 year old I know loves it)<br /><br />soft durable foam with labels that cannot possibly peel off<br /><br />labels & colors on one side to indicate which parts of the brain can do what, other side still has color coding but no labels; making this a learning tool, too
1.0	Ugly, scratchy, cheap. Not like the picture.
5.0	Sturdy costume quality. Arrived quickly. Fits adult heads. Will work well with a photo booth!
5.0	This is a high quality Pirate Outfit for a Child.  Highly Recommend - you won't be disappointed!
5.0	A favorite among my 21-month-old daughter's toys.
5.0	The card is in perfect condition. I'm very happy with the purchase!
5.0	Perfect for our Nerf war birthday party. I bought 200 and even though it didn't look like much it was it worked out great.
5.0	If you are looking to collect all the Heralds of Galactus, this is a piece you don't want to miss out on.
1.0	Horrible piece of junk
5.0	Got Miku yesterday and happy say I will come back to this seller for any of my Japanese product needs!
5.0	My 5 year old train enthusiast loves this addition to his collection.  The pieces are sturdy and he can build different bridges using just this set.  There are two adapter pieces to allow this set of tracks to the regular Trackmaster tracks. Be sure to use the new generation Trackmaster trains as their wheels have more grip for the hills.
5.0	This doll is so cute!  Ulquiorra is my favorite character,  and this is a must have for any ulquiorra fan!  :)
5.0	I bought this for my 9month old.  He's done so much with it, besides trying to eat it.  He used us to pull himself onto, which eventually lead to walking.  He learned that certain buttons, switches did different things and played with them over and over and over and over.....  GREAT TOY!!!
5.0	My daughter (10 years old, 4th grade) LOVES this tool. We have others, and she uses them to practice other math facts, and I like that it's something so different. Easy to use, and I'd think doing these would use more than one part of the brain. Who doesn't want math to be fun and different?
5.0	We got this for our 16 month old daughter for Xmas. She loves it. She knows how to turn it on and off and really enjoys vacuuming while we vacuum with our dyson.
5.0	Great card, on time thanks.
5.0	My wife decided to buy this for my 18 month old daugher that loves animals, and since its moves, and flips my daugher loved this product.  Just be advised that the dog will bark and flip until you turn off the off switch.
5.0	The masks were a big hit at my superheroes party.  It's called &#34;Paper Masks&#34; but it's actually a stronger paper, which made it more durable with the guests.  We still have them after the party and still re-useable.  The price is reasonable considering it includes Prime.  I would definitely buy more if needed.
5.0	Our family had a great time together trying to solve this puzzle.  Even after learning how to solve the puzzle it makes you want to pick it up and try again.  It's not all that easy no matter how smart you are!  Great family activity (non video) and one you can pass on to friends!
5.0	Don't get much time on it but a lot of detail and well made.
5.0	Shipped super fast. Absolutely adorable!!!
5.0	We bought this toy because our son just loves the Itsy bitsy spider song and although he is only a few months old he just loves his itsy bitsy spiderman, both songs on it are awesome and it gets him moving waving his hands and legs. He can't stop starring at it. I'm so glad we bought this for him!
5.0	My boys really like using this to make creations.  Sometimes their pieces are too thin and break apart after it is dry and they mess with them.  They have always loved making things with Play-doh.  This enable them to be able to keep some of their creations so we are pleased.
5.0	I purchased this phone for my grandson who is 4 and a big Bob the Builder Fan. This is his second one. It didn't break, he just lost it, and was so upset. He could have had anything else, but all he wanted was Bob's cell phone. We finally found it on Amazon, and he was right there with me placing the order, and everyday he would call me to see if the mail man brought his Bob Phone yet.  He plays with it constantly, and keeps it in his pocket at all times. Great gift, for all the Bob fans.
1.0	This product is difficult to use and breaks very easily. It is cheaply made and should not be so expensive.
5.0	My son has so much fun with it. We love to see them interact to eact others. Nice material. Nice size.
5.0	Had a great time putting this together.  It was a beautiful scene and it provided a fun and interesting challenge.
5.0	Loved this.  This is the only costume item that I bought to make my cowardly lion costume for.Halloween.  It really completed the look which was achieved with makeup!  High quality for a Halloween item, money well spent.
5.0	My 41/2 year old son loves this game. Anything to get him to sit down and work on his math skills. It's amazing to see him grow with it after just a couple uses. Simple concept but sometimes the simplest things work.
5.0	This toy is so much fun that my grandson's dad had a hard time putting it down!
5.0	"I bought this ES44DC from a dealer in Canada, in which InterMountain Railway in Colorado, made.  As my opening description said, it's a true work of art.  It's detailed in every way, as the real life locomotive is.  As far as my ratings go, let's be frank here.  It got 5 stars on the \\""fun\\"" scale because of the detailing outside, and the SoundTraxx Tsunami decoder inside.  Yard bells, warning horn, variable engine exhaust sound depending on the speed, compressor sounds (complete with the poppet valve blowing the water vapor out) dynamic braking, cooling fans and many more.  It's truly a replica of the real thing sound-wise.  SoundTraxx claims to record the locomotive sounds as they operate, then digitize those sounds in their decoders.  Start-up, idling, powering the throttle up, brake release,  brake squealing at a fast stop, coupler clanking at hookup...all very realistic.  Even the ditch lights wig-wag when you sound the horn.  Educational value got 4 stars.  It's educational in the sense of what the GE GEVO-12 series locomotives look & sound like.  The outside has detailing that is extremely close to real life, even down to the grab irons and cooling fan radiator screens.  Durability got only two stars because of one factor: since this is a very detailed locomotive, I don't believe it will survive the eager hands of a small child without some of the detailing either breaking or coming off.  The hand railing on either side of the locomotive is comparable to a fine wire.  It will hold under it's own weight, but will probably not survive being grabbed on the sides and squeezed to be picked up.  Now, for someone who can truly appreciate the value of the fine detailing, it appears it will last for many years.  My overall rating is 4½ stars.  See my reasons above for any explanations!  The picture you see of this locomotive really does it no justice.  It's nothing more than a drawing to illustrate what it *should* look like.  Once I received mine & opened the package,I was thoroughly impressed, & believe me, I'm not easy to please!  I've been railroading for many, many years...so I've seen a lot, & I believe in my mind, that this is a top of the line model.  I will absolutely order another InterMountain engine or some other rolling stock in the near future.  Oh, & the SoundTraxx Tsunami decoder is definitely worth the extra money.  You won't be disappointed!"
5.0	We purchased this for our 2 year old grandchild. She has had hours of fun with it. Well made & sturdy. Great price too.
5.0	I bought this for my daughter's 5th birthday. She is obsessed with Frozen and really wanted the dolls. I saw another brand on Amazon that cost over double what this one cost. Once I found this one, I decided to order it based on other positive reviews. I was not let down at all upon receiving this as it is great quality and just like a regular Barbie doll and looks just like the character as well. A family member purchased the more expensive one for her as well (unknowingly that we had already purchased this one) and I can honestly say other than a slight difference in the hair style, there was no difference, especially in quality. I highly recommend this over the more expensive one.
5.0	Fast shipping! Wanted a real looking kitchen and not one of those plastic ones that's an eye sore.  Be ready to have a patience to put together because there are tons of pieces and screws but well worth it. My 17 month old daughter loves it. Very good quality wood and durable definitely will last a while. Over all I am happy with the purchase and worth the price would buy this brand again!
5.0	Great Product!!!  Impeccable Service!!!! Thanks, Will visit you again,
5.0	This is another beautifully made, incredibly detailed toy from Schleich.  One might think that a toy that isn't posable (other than the wings) wouldn't be well received by young children, but nothing could be further from the truth.  My four year olds LOVE this toy, and their older brother and sister go for it whenever they make the mistake of putting it down.  It's so vibrant and lifelike that the imaginative quality of the play it generates is without parallel.  Just a great, great toy that is so durable it should easily last from one generation to the next.
5.0	Super fun &#34;candy free&#34; valentine to hand out to our Pre-K class.
5.0	This is waaaaaaaay overpriced at $149.99.  It's available for about $80 at ToysRUs and the Lego store, including online.  All of the Mars Mission sets are overpriced on Amazon.
5.0	I bought it from seller eknightmedia. As cute as I thought it would be. Now I can have great moments in having the Iwatobi chan keychain in my possession. It's the cuteness and weirdness from the Free! anime with this Iwatobi chan keychain.<br /><br />I could not have asked for a more charming detail in a keychain.
5.0	I was curious on how the real deal versus a clone compared.  Pretty darn close with some interesting differences.<br /><br />The Yiboo comes assembled.  There is no need to mount the camera and fight with the short camera cable.  A USB charge cord, camera download cable, and tail rotor are included in the Yiboo package.  a charge cord, download cord, tail rotor, AND small screwdriver come with the Syma.  The yellow charge cord will interchange Yiboo/Syma so there are no worries of cross polarity when charging.  Weights are similar with the Syma at 44 grams, and the Yiboo at 46 grams.<br /><br />The Syma comes with a flashing red/blue light in the nose, and the Yiboo has a bright white LED in the nose and four red/blue flashing LEDs (two each side).  Flight times were around 7 minutes with some power to spare, but I don't fly past five minutes on either to save the batteries.  Flight characteristics are similar, but the Yiboo flew a bit sluggishly compared to the Syma.  I had assumed the Yiboo would have more forward/reverse speed, as the tail rotor has much more pitch, but this wasn't the case.  This isn't really a bad thing in a camera ship though.  The trim knob on the Yiboo transmitter made panning the camera angle much smoother and easier to control while the trim wheel on the Syma took some getting used to.<br /><br />Both sport the same camera, BUT the Yiboo comes with a small cellophane cover over the camera lens.  There is no mention of this cover in the instructions and video quality suffers considerably until it is removed.  This is the same type of plastic found on most electronics.  Some people leave it on, some take it off.  You really need to take it off for best picture quality.  Even so, I found the Syma camera offered brighter videos in lower light conditions than the Yiboo (plastic removed) although both have decent picture quality in normal light.<br /><br />I like the Yiboo transmitter better than the Syma.  The throttle is spring loaded and levers are much more solid.  The levers on the Syma control can fall off if you aren't careful.  The buttons controlling the vid/cam are located on the front, but they are transposed with Syma controlling vid from the right front button, and the Yiboo from the left front.  The Yiboo has it's trim knob on the top middle much like a traditional Syma, while Syma has put their trim knob on a wheel located on the right side.  I prefer the Yiboo placement although the trim knob is quite stiff to turn.  Both transmitters seem to have similar range although my house is too small to really stretch their legs.<br /><br />*NOTE  The transmitters will NOT cross control Syma to Yiboo.  They each use a different protocol.<br /><br />In the end, with so much similar, it really comes down to price.  Yiboo = $54 PLUS shipping,  Syma = $43 shipping included.  While I like the Yiboo transmitter more, it isn't worth $16 more.
5.0	my little nephew is a big Mario fan and his favorite character whenever we play anything related is koopa . this plush doll is well made no complaints here.
5.0	Gift for family member, had similar products, so know will be enjoyed...THANXS FOR GREAT SERVICE, A+++
5.0	Super cool!!! We bought it for our 7yr old!!!!
5.0	This was just adorable and worked like a charm. Our grand daughter went nuts!! She just loves Olaf and sleeps with him every night!! LOL
5.0	granddaughter likes a lot this is what she wanted....because her brother has one also
5.0	Great riding toy for preschooler teaches them how to balance. And most of all this toy does not require batteries like the other big boy ride on toys. I highly recommend this toy.
1.0	did not include the 2 handle pieces. Due to it being a present, exceeded the return/replace window. No easy information on how to contact vendor for the missing part.
5.0	The best product on the market for drying postage stamps, recommended by stamp collectors and dealers alike.
5.0	Fun to put together. A bit smaller than expected but easy to build.
5.0	Our grandson, who is 4, uses this in the house to race around and around the bar in the kitchen (concrete floors).  This is a great way to wear away energy, develop coordination, and safe to use.
5.0	I bought this to my friends and myself. All of us, love Sakura Cardcaptor. Despite that is childish and with characters for little kids, love the series and the manga. We followed it during my post-teen years and still gets me. ^^ for us, this is so adorable and true to her most memorables outfits. I recomend this for your collection. Due to Tomoyo's position, you can get rid of the part of the keychain and put the little Tomoyo over a shelf and is a collectable figurine!
5.0	This is a great kids desk! It shipped quickly, was well packaged and goes together easily. It's the perfect size for elementary aged children. My son loves it! I would recommend it!
5.0	Got my new bird and love it, but going from a 2 channel to 4 channel has been a wonderful challenge
5.0	We have a similair toy by Melissa & Doug (i think) that has doors and latches, but...this one is so much more fun & educational too! it's a shape sorter, has the doors to open & close, and latches that my son hasn't even really played with yet! He loves the pieces and putting them in the holes, taking them out the doors, etc...I'm very sad to hear that other's have had problems with it...we bought it for my son for christmas - he was 9 months old, but with 2 older brothers, so...we have little pieces everywhere, so we watch him most all the time as he plays...we leave it on the floor and have not had a problem with the latches, doors, pieces, or weight! but again i'm with him or watching him when he plays! (but don't feel THIS toy is unsafe - others in our house yes...) This is one toy i wish we had gotten with my first son - the best shape sorter in my opinion and we have about 5! And my 2 older kids play with the baby all the time! it's definitely the baby's (and maybe the 4 and 6 year olds too!) Latches aren't any more dangerous than the one's on Melissa & Doug's so...maybe that is why the 18+ months age range!??
5.0	Great quality helicopter, my almost two year old absolutely loves it!
5.0	I received the Stirling engine as a gift. It is a little gem. It works well and is a quality product. I recommend it.
5.0	My 13 year old still loves stuffies and this guy was perfect for his 13th birthday! Very happy with this purchase!
5.0	Ravensburger puzzles are the best puzzles on the market.  They have a varied ability choice.  They are sturdy for kids and hold up very nicely!!  The pictures are beautiful and we have put them together over and over!!
5.0	It is awesome you should buy this toy it is great for battling other castles.
5.0	My 2.5 daughter loves them.  Great colorful picture puzzle, easily assembled.  4 in a medium size box good for travel.
5.0	Beautiful dresses. These were a bit too large and too long but makes for easy dressing. Very well made. Granddaughters are happy and therefore I'm the best...lol! Recommend this seller
1.0	I chose this mat because of the large pieces (other mats had smaller squares and dozens of pieces-a nightmare to put together everyday) but I was dissapointed to find that the speakers cracked.  When I found this product, I was so excited to find such a large mat, I overlooked the fact that it takes 14 AAA batteries.  The manufacturer stated that it comes with alll 14 batteries, but mine only came with 2 for the first mat.  The mat is excellent quality, but the speakers aren't.  I am taking mine back after only having it 2 months.
5.0	Excellent! Bigger than i expected and looks really fun
5.0	I got this for my 2 year old nephew and he thought it was the greatest thing ever. He loved the motor sound it makes that was his favorite part and it's fairly sturdy.
5.0	June 2013  My kids love this game!  It doesn't hurt when it chomps.  It came with NO directions, so once I learned to deal with teeth getting stuck they're having a blast.  It's also simple enough to understand that my child with developmental delays loves it and can play with his sister. It is small so it's tempting to hold it in your hand, but leaving it on the table instead helps keep the teeth from getting stuck.  Slamming the mouth shut a couple of times is working to get the teeth back up. Now we're happy happy.<br /><br />Jan 2013 Original review: teeth do get stuck as others mentioned and it's not easy to get them all back up.  Also, it was much smaller than I imagined from the picture.  I guess I should have looked to see if measurements were listed.  The 4 year old did play with it for awhile but resorted to hiding things in its mouth.
5.0	Love how portable this is for my daughter
5.0	I'm Gene and I'm 13. I thought i wasn't going to ride the GM because i was heavy but it held like a table held a fether(it held my up perfectly). This thing is for EVERYONE!(besides really really old people and infants or babies) The spin-outs are awsome! It's so fun and my friesnd are so jealuos! They ask me to ride it but i give them the (i know this isn't nice) finger and tell them to get their oun. That's how much i love this thing. OVERALL: IT'S THE SHIZNEY!!!!!!!!!!!!
1.0	I ordered 2 for my daughters ages 3 and 5.  They arrived and the paint was completely dried up.  I missed the return by date, but not a good purchase.
5.0	We like the Eurographics puzzles, and after completing them, we cover them with white glue, frame them and hang it up on the wall.
1.0	Poorly made.  Pieces don't fit together snug, need glue.  No instruction in box.  Had to look them up, all visual, no text, and parts did not go together as the visuals suggested.  Typical to today's companies.  Decent product concepts, but adolescent support and instruction quality.
5.0	My daughter loved this crib as her bday present.  She puts all her &#34;babies&#34; to sleep in there.  Plus it's so much cheaper than the bitty baby crib.
5.0	Excellent product and service.
5.0	I bought this for a stocking stuffer because the price was so reasonable. It is about 3x the size I expected and very cute.
5.0	With supervision and minimal assistance my 2 year old grandson uses it with ease. Keeps him running and retrieving the rockets. Nice toy to burn off some energy! Only tiny complaint would be in his enthusiasm the tripod base comes apart. Easy to put back together and to be fair he is younger than the recommended age.
5.0	"We ordered some other blocks for our son as a Christmas present and were disappointed, so we looked a little harder and found that these blocks did indeed come with a good quantity of blocks.  Having a larger number so our son could stack 5 or 6 or even 20 high. They also have animal shapes and bright colors and numbers and are a good weight for him to pick up.  He is 8 months old. We like to spell out words with him, and often spell out messages for photos for grandparents. This can be tricky as our son likes to play with the blocks and brake down \\""buildings\\"""
5.0	I wasn't sure my five year old son would be interested in this game, since it is obviously geared toward girls.  However, he really enjoyed playing it, particularly because it has a find the hidden object element.  I love that this game teaches reading and spelling.  It also is very neat that you can create customized spelling lists for your child.  That is a little advanced at this point for my pre-K son, but I think it is a wonderful feature that we can use as he advances through the early grades.<br /><br />The only problem I have with Leappad games is the cardboard packaging they come in. You pretty much have to rip it to get it open and I wish Leapfrog would take a cue from VTech, whose Mobigo games come in plastic cartridge cases that open easily and then allow for easy storage of the game when not being used.<br /><br />Overall, I do recommend this game and not just for girls.  My two and a half year old daughter is a little too young for this game but has already shown great interest in playing &#34;the Barbie game.&#34;  In the meantime, it is a great game for her brother and he is enjoying it.
5.0	I am so happy we bought this game! It is easy enough for the kids to understand, challenging enough that they learn, and entertaining enough that we all enjoyy it. I couldn't be happier!
5.0	Provided lots of laughs over Christmas when we played with family. I really would love to get some of the expansion packs. This is NOT for those that get offended easily!
5.0	Perfect & great price! My 2 year old is going to be so excited on Christmas!!
5.0	Excellent resource game by managing meeples. FYI the D&D theme is that alone, theme. It has no impact on gameplay. There is no role playing etc. fun to play and really easy to learn. Lots of replay ability.
5.0	I'll feed my Grandsons' Lego appetite for a while with this toy ;),  which will make  his mom happy,  which will get me a great and  early Christmas gift ,  which I will shared with my girlfriend...while on a boat in the Bahamas,  while my wife's in Alaska.... great product ;)  (just kidding about the Bahamas)
5.0	got this for a friend they loved it great for collectors
5.0	My granddaughter loved it! Putting in the battery required a screwdriver. It was a great Christmas present. Word word word
5.0	Absolutely adorable and arrived in good time thankyou!!!!!!!!!!!
5.0	She loves to swing. We hook it up to the tree in front and she laughs and giggles like crazy.
1.0	I was very disappointed when opening up the package I received today. I read the reviews before buying these eraser as mostly everyone had a positive experience buying these erasers. However, upon opening my package I noticed almost everything was a duplicate. Out of the 48 erasers only three were not duplicates. The rest are typical flat erasers I could have bought at the dollar store. I was expecting more unique erasers from everyone's review and the item description. I'm extremely disappointed and so my nieces and nephews will be as well.
5.0	This skirt is very cute and well made. I got it the next day just in time for parades!! Great product.
1.0	This version of Deal or No Deal is agonizing slow.  Also there isn't a board that show you which cases you have already open and the money board is only visible after you pick all your cases and only for a few seconds.  I was very disaapointed and won't recommend this version of the game to anyone.
5.0	I ordered this for my oldest daughter's bday party and it arrived on time plus it was a hit for all the girls including mine at the party. I would get it again if they wanted to have another monster high party!
5.0	I bought this for my husband to keep on his desk because we love minions! it's cute and funny and looks just like dave!
5.0	This was a fun winter activity.  The pieces are sturdy and are not so easy to fit together which makes it challenging.  I don't usually glue puzzles but I did this one.  Then I had it framed and it is now hanging on my wall.
5.0	Purchased for a school program. My son still likes to wear it and pretend he's a scientist :) .. Made well.
5.0	first time purchasing these guys Gundam  Fix Action figures looking at them  they stand around 4 inches to  5 Inches with  all these Amazing accessories set  I usually don't open  They already come  w/ this amazing box display that is just perfect just to leave them as is ( 4 me IMO )  amazing packaging Once again for being a first-time buyer of these figures Gundam  Fix Are pretty cool<br />Hope it helps
5.0	Q-Workshop's dice are always high quality. These particular color combination looks the best out of all of them. The ivory color makes them look like worn and weary artifacts from a lost time - a perfect fit for Eldritch Horror. I recommend at least 2 sets for games in the Arkham Files series.
5.0	Used this item in our Summer Matters Medieval Times Thematic unit the program leaders and students thought it was awesome and fantastic.
5.0	Lego gives my son the opportunity to have quality time at home, thinking, building, dealing with hundreds/thousands small parts and the joy to get it done.
5.0	These are remarkably fun and fast if you have someone pushing you!  Great fun!
5.0	Gift for my son he loves it! Did buy extra blades afraid he would crash it quickly. But it has held up great, he has had it now 2 months still runs great!
5.0	Cute and the dolls are just fine! Viva Lego!
5.0	excellent it was half the size of the nendroid series but i love the caracter so it doesnt´t matter
1.0	First, this comment is for the size 4-6 that this item was originally sold as, which was the size I needed. By the time I received it and tried it on the 14 days(according to their return policy) to let them know the sizing was inaccurate had passed. Then, after calling to let them know I needed to return, they said it was too late. I couldn't get in contact with them and they never returned my call for the RMA number required to return. Then the 30 days to return had passed by 1 day when I finally got in contact with them. I filed a claim with Amazon and they had said I didn't do what I could on my part and I am now out $45 and a costume that fits a 12-18 month old. Oh, maybe Amazon forced them to change the size since this is not their first complaint.  This company has horrible customer service!
5.0	Really strong even though he bends! My son loves Mr. Bean! This is a cool toy for any Mr. Bean fan and it's not found in stores around here...
5.0	My 2 1/2 year old loves the zoo talkers and I have kept up to checking to see if there are any new animals that have come out.  I have found that Amazon has the best prices for them that are new.
5.0	My niece wouldn't open another Christmas gift once she opened this! She played for hours baking us all cookies.  Very good toy!
1.0	At first we couldn't turn this machine off.  The on/off button had no effect, and the reset button just stopped the irritatingly loud jingle while pressed.   After removing the batteries and re-installing after 5 minutes, it restarted properly and my daughter played with it for 5-10 minutes. The next day we could not get it to come back on.  We have tried new batteries and since we had discarded the packaging are now stuck with a piece of plastic junk.
5.0	I had to leave feedback as the quality of the costume was excellent, shipping prompt, and I now have a happy happy 4 year old musketeer. The blue fabric is soft, and the satin shinny and smooth. Easy to put on, and with a sword also bought on amazon--it is the perfect musketeer costume.
5.0	It doesn't seem like there are many vendors that make beautiful Babie dresses.  Olivia's Doll Closet was quick.  It think I got in just 3 days.  I have also bought several other dresses from Olivia's Doll Closet and they were all shipped out the same or next day.  I got them within a few days as well.  I am very pleased with this vendor and I think they've got a great selection of beautiful dresses for really good prices.
1.0	You cannot hear the other person at all. There is no voice hidden in the static. There is just static. If my kids hadn't torn up the package, I would take them back to Walmart.
5.0	Clash of Cultures is a great civilization based game.  Works well with 2 players, even better with 4 players.
5.0	Gift for grand child. It will be played with extensively.  Good  product.  Small pieces so not good for too young.
1.0	"My grandaughter wasa really in the \\""octopus\\"" This was my son's recommendation to get her an octopus thing of some sort. It was a disaster. My grandaughter was disinterested immediately and hasn't as much looke at it since. It was a waste of money... Stan"
5.0	Darling doll boots! Seem well made, and really cute.
5.0	great game to teach young adults about work.
5.0	I have 3 little girls and countless dolls.  Among them, we own 3 Baby Stella dolls.  She's the perfect first baby.  My oldest is 6 and still plays with her Baby Stella so she's obviously a durable doll.  We've collected several of the outfits as well as a few of the accessories over the past several years and all are really well made.  The doll is soft and the look is really sweet.  She's fairly easy to dress, and if my girls have loved her enough that I had to buy duplicates, I'd highly recommend her to others looking for a cute first doll that's made to last.
5.0	This is a great way to spend time with your children and to do something that is way to fun. Love it, thanks Amazon
5.0	This is a wonderfully made soft little lamb that is perfect for the newborn and up. It has no pieces and parts, and that was exactly what I wanted for my 8 week old grand daughter. It is the perfect size and softness for her tiny hands and has a soft sound to it's rattle. It is PERFECT !!!
5.0	Great for cosplay of the Naruto character Haku!
5.0	work out well, got the parts in a reasonable amount of time, they worked very well thank you
5.0	gift for granddaughter's birthday.
5.0	I recently acquired a riding toy from a yard sale, that did not have a battery pack or charger. It works perfectly now for not even a fraction of its actual price tag.
5.0	Her skin looks like real porcelain.  I did not expect that.  I read the reviews and rolled my eyes.  How can her skin look like real porcelain, when it's plastic.  I ordered it as a gift, but now I'm just itching to add her to my own collection.
5.0	its just a cool toy I wanted the whole collection and my local store was out of them so I got it here the price is high but at least I got it.
5.0	This product was an amazing gift. Although it's not as challenging when u put ur hands on it it's still a great time consumer among family on Christmas morning for the adults to laugh at the members who still can't figure it out.
5.0	My 3 year old grandson loves it. Easy for him to transform from Robot to vehicle
1.0	My Baby love this toy
5.0	This made my deck complete and I'm glad I bought this because without I would have a very hard time without this cards effect!
5.0	Works great, it's used all the time and we love it. I would recommend this to anyone. Fast shipping too!
5.0	Arrived fast - packaging was good. Perfect addition to our growing collection of Pop collectables.
5.0	This item is so cute and soft I bought it for my niece for her birthday.  Can't wait to give it to her at the end of June.  She's been wanting one for a while.  Amazon is amazing, order came before the due date, no damage to the packages at all.  All items were in perfect condition when I received them.  I LOVE AMAZON!!!!
5.0	Great way to store your valuable comics or variant copies that you dont want to bend.
5.0	first off let me say this thing is awesome. Rides like a dream once u figure out its workings. Like everything it has its pros and cons.  First the pros. Easy to assemble. Fast. Sturdy. And most important very fun ride that will turn some heads. Now the cons. Though few they need to be addressed. First off the throttle cable is too long. To adjust it uses little unscrewable things not unlike a bike. Downside is screws arent long enough. Fixed this with tape though so no problems there. Doesnt turn as sharp as i would like. Requires one heck of a learning curve to ride but worth it. Biggest problem ive noticed is wobbles at higher speeds but may just be me lol. Overall i recommend this for someone looking for an extreme take anywhere head turning toy. I do recommend full safety gear when riding though. Motorcycle helmet is my choice and looks cool as well as protects. Hope this helps
5.0	Very nice solid wood domino trays.  Another vendor has them for $43!  They are well worth the price here.
5.0	I must say that this mini is a nasty little bugger (that's a good thing; it's an evil dwarf from the Underdark). He's a solid mini, thick built and the details are great. I've bought many other minis that look nothing like the pictures and this one is well detailed. Worth every penny. I sincerely hope the seller locates more inexpensive deals like this one and sends me an e-mail about them because I'm very happy with these, so far.
5.0	So adorable and works perfectly! It's fun for all the girls  in the family to use. The best part is when the music plays.
5.0	These ponies are super adorable and very well made. My son had to keep one for himself and I gave the other 2 to a friends daughters and they love them.
5.0	Thinkfun's Rush Hour Traffic Jam Junior game comes with a traffic grid, 40 challenge cards, ice cream truck, 15 blocking vehicles, and a convenient carrying bag. The challenge cards come with a vary of challenge levels which is great for younger kids and the older kids that may want to play together. The recommended age is 5 -15 years old. My son is five years old so he started with the super easy challenge card. The goal is to get the ice cream truck out of a traffic jam. The game definitely makes you think! I loved that it was teaching my son logic and how to sequentially figure something out. He had to come up with a solution. The game also be played alone so if I'm not around to play with him he can just grab his traffic grid and cards and play a game. The game is also convenient to take when you are out - eating at a restaurant or car rides. The easy carrying bag make it easy to take along when you want to continue the fun outside the home.<br /><br />Disclosure: I did receive the game to facilitate my review.
5.0	In our home, we began to call these fun balls as they are intended for the beach but our children are playing around with them everywhere - in the living room, the bedroom, the yard, the garden. They're really fun balls. Obviously we also take them to the pool. It's a great product. Our children most like to throw them or play soccer with them. It's great to have all the same color so as to avoid our children fighting over them. All have beautiful colors of the rainbow. It's a great product. I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.
5.0	We we able to put together the slide easily - my grandson loves it!  Very sturdy and can use indoors.
5.0	My 10 month old grandson fell in love with my first one so it went home with him and I reordered one for me!!  Incredibly soft middle section and vibrant colors.  My grandson's name is Jude Rigby so maybe it was meant to be his!
5.0	"Squinkies (for those of you unaware) are soft, TINY, rubbery toys. They are like pencils top eraser size. They don't \\""do\\"" anything and usually have no moving parts. The only squinkies that move are usually the bigger accessories that a squinkie will sit in. And sometimes even those don't move. But these are great for imaginative play and definitely fine motor control. The little bubbles can be a pain but the squinkies keep very well in them and are good for resale. I love these things. And the boy squinkies are reasonably priced in comparison with girl squinkies. Not for children who like to put things in their mouth or nose."
5.0	Very durable high quality digital chess clock.  Smaller size then early Chronos clocks with an improved switch system and improved buttons. The case of the clock is metal and very durable, Perfect for travel.  This is my second Chronos clock, my first one still works after nearly 10 years of solid abuse at coffee house and tournament chess play.  The only down sides are the cost and non-intuitive interface for programing. This clock cost nearly 3 times some of its competitors.  Even with the price tag I would recommend it, just keep the instructions if you want to play with the custom settings.
5.0	This was a great gift for my grandson and his cousin for their birthday. So very pleased
5.0	Cute and fun! Oh, so fun and can do many styles, my son enjoy changing the parts around, thank you
5.0	Pretty basic design but it is good for kids and batman shoots out the cabin and across the room. Good value but don't let young ones chew the rubbery batman head!
5.0	Great addition to my collection
5.0	I bought this to use with my DC Collectibles Arkham Origins Firefly, and it works excellently.  I was amazed by how much you could do with these stands. it comes with 3 of everything, the bases can be connected, pieces of the arm can be connected to form a very tall arm, the base has several covered peg holes so you can connect the arm in different places or multiple arms on one base.  If you're looking for a flight stand/ action pose stand, look no further!
5.0	Percy is great.  Stays on the track better than other powered engines.  Keeps going for hours.  The best addition to our 2 year olds train set yet.
5.0	I bought this wonderful T-Rex skeleton at a yard sale. I came here to see what it costs new. The model is authentic and interesting after it's assembled.  It takes an hour or two to put together, but it's worth the effort.  I used pliers to press a couple of the parts together.  I see that some people gave it a bad review because it's difficult to assemble.  Yes, it takes some time and concentration. It's somewhat challenging to put together, but it's a satisfying effort.  It takes some thinking, sort of like figuring out a jigsaw puzzle.  The result is wonderful.  I love it.  The detail and color are realistic.  It looks just like a small (one-tenth size) T-Rex skeleton in a museum.<br /> It stays together without glue, but it's a little unsteady on its own, so I glued a few key parts together.  No problem. Now, it's very sturdy.  Everyone likes it. It's five-star product, contrary to the impatient nay-sayers.  It may be too difficult for a young child to assemble on their own, but I think it would be a fun project for a child and an adult to work on together.  I think a child and parent would enjoy the accomplishment.
5.0	Nice detail on the Gryffindor robe with the patch and the clasp on front. For the price, this robe is a good value and my kids adore it.
5.0	My daughter loves her fish. She calls him Nemo because he looks like the same kind of fish as Nemo from the Finding Nemo movie.
5.0	I love this pin--I love the big orange T with &#34;Atom Design.&#34;  I will wear it to my grave!  Love the movie--great message about the Future.<br />But Warning: I paid $20 for it (it was worth it!) but then the price dropped to $15 then to $8 plus shipping.  So be patient and shop around.<br />ENJOY!!!!
5.0	it's really awesome flowers
5.0	I love it so much even I am 25! The quality of this product is wonderful like always. fast shipping, everything is perfect!
5.0	Arriba el toro loco, perfect for my son's collections
5.0	We had a dance party for my daughter's 5th birthday, and these were great. We used them as party favors, and the kids loved them! I didn't have any trouble with holes, etc. but the tabs were somewhat difficult to close once the guitars were blown up- this led to some air escaping before they could be closed, but we were able to get them inflated fine after a couple of tries. These were *well* worth the price- very cute pattern and quality.
1.0	Don't waste your money if you live at altitude.  Once we filled it with helium the shark floated then we attached the engine pod and tail the shark never lifted up again.  We are assuming it is due to the altitude.  Wish the company would of stated this on the box and saved us time and money.
5.0	Item received quickly in perfect condition. Exactly as pictured. Can't ask for more.
5.0	We bought this, along with some fun plastic pit balls, for our very young nephews for Christmas. It was a hit!
5.0	After playing this game now for just over a week I have to saris is the best game I have ever played. My band recently went on a trip to Disney world and I brought this game along. We played it every night, and we laughed a lot every time we played. If you have an issue with inappropriate material then I don't suggest this game for you, but if not then you should have no problem.
5.0	I was given a used Power Wheels riding four wheeler.  The battery had given out.  It was great to find an exact replacement.  It was a bit pricey for my taste but cheaper than anywhere else I checked.
5.0	Our Family loves this game.  We have played it numerous times but we have never used the board.  We ususally divide up into teams and each team gets one point for each correct answer and if they get all 5 correct they get 5 bonus points.  We use the timer to start and stop the answer period.  We have used this with small groups and large groups at holidays and it has become somewhat of a holiday tradition with a homemade trophy for the winning family.
5.0	We recently purchased this set for our 10 year old son. Although he has lots of Lego including several sets. So this set is Great for<br />someone who's starting up or otherwise! He and his friends love the Lego city stuff over the other themed sets. I like how this set has a robber, policeman including other mini figures for creating endless emergency scenarios. A real bargain for the price!!
5.0	Really cute.  Giving to my grandson for his first birthday.  Know he will love it!
5.0	Love this ! My Grandson and I play on his felt board every single day thanks to your wonderful cut outs
5.0	Awesome!  Keeping it MIB!  Must buy if you are a fan of 80's cartoons or just a GI Joe fanatic!
5.0	Great toy for little ones to use with other toys and build on to it. Many hours of pleasure already given through the use of this.
5.0	THIS DOLL LOOKS LIKE JAMES FRANCO. THE DETAIL IS AMAZING THE DOLL LOOKS VERY GOOD. I GAVE IT AS A GIFT FOR ONE OF MY KIDS AND SHE KEPT IT IN THE BOX BECAUSE SHE WANT IT TO LOOK THIS GOOD FOREVER. I AM PLEASED WITH THE PRODUCT.
5.0	Our Granddaughter loved her umbrella!!!  She loves twirling it and singing, &#34;Singing in the rain, Singing in the rain&#34;.
5.0	I've purchased all four of the Melissa and Doug puzzles in a box for my 2/12 year old grandson and he loves them.   They're almost getting too easy for him.
5.0	I've already bought gloves from emazing lights before and they're always great to me. Right size gloves and all the lights and casings work.
5.0	I ordered two of these.  One for me and one for my nephew.  Both arrived in excellent condition.  The detail is great, and the wing doors open, which is very cool!  I give this seller an excellent rating.
5.0	This is a great costume for the little Frozen fans to use on their dolls.  It is well made and fits the dolls just right.
5.0	This Funko figure is excellent! The one I received was painted very well, which I can't say about a lot of other Funko figures I own. Very pleased!
5.0	My granddaughter loved this doll. Very pretty.
5.0	My granddaughter absolutely loves this bad piggy, she throws it around with her other angry birds and not a minute trouble with the sound. Very happy

5.0	Very prompt delivery and very happy with Barney.
5.0	Cards against humanity keeps you coming back for more! We play this game every chance we get and can't wait to show it to friends that have never heard of it!
5.0	Classic Transformer I never had as a child glad to be able to finally get it for my collection.
5.0	It is really cute key chain ever!! I am thinking to buy more Vampire Knight things! Go, Vampire Knight!! :D
5.0	The Cuddlekin three toed sloth was exactly what I was looking for. It is adorable, soft, and just the right size.
5.0	My grandson loves to play his guitar and act like a rock star! It was a great gift!
5.0	this card works great  if you use it with the Darksteel Forge card as this card will not be destoryed by any damage at all.
1.0	The manufacturer sent the wrong doll, buy gave me a full refund, including the postage I used to send it back.  I did not give any negative feedback because I got my money back.  I re-ordered the doll from Target and received it in time for Easter so everything worked out and I got the replacement doll in time to give it to my grandaughter for the holiday.
5.0	Great toy for ages 1 and up!  Great Fisher Price quality as usual.
5.0	This protects the leapfrog from hazard, it's pretty daughter loves it. Also great for smuggling glo-fish across the CA border.
5.0	The model is very high quality it has so much more detailed then what is seen in the pictures and the seller got it here in 3 business days even though i only paid for standard shipping i'am very pleased with the quality and speed that this product has delivered.
1.0	These slide whistles don't work. The sliders move in and out but when you blow into them they just make a hissing noise and don't produce a tone.
1.0	"I have no problem with creating a little \\""Christmas Magic\\"" for children. However, this is a far-cry from anything magical; potentially causing more \\""harm\\"" than good. Don't get me wrong, I love Christmas for all the right reasons, but this is simply not one of them.<br /><br />To some, \\""Elf on the Shelf\\"" may appear to be a harmless, charming, and \\""all-watching\\"" doll for the fantasy and adoration of children. Remove the \\""fantasy and charm\\"" from the equation, and you've got nothing short of a creepy \\""spy\\"" of sorts. For me, and many others, it is an intimidating symbol for the behavior modification of children; an unwritten \\""threat,\\"" if you will.<br /><br />I must fully concede that in my childhood, I was scared of anything that I believed was \\""watching me.\\"" Having read books where animals \\""come to life\\"" is not always a positive one. Sometimes the intent (construed by the child) may be to \\""cause harm.\\"" I know that I am not alone in this suggestion, as I've seen similar posts from others. The suggestion to move this figure around the home (or wherever) so that it can \\""watch\\"" the children may be a very scary proposal, and one you might want to discuss before buying.  If my parents had had one of these things when I was in my childhood...I would have absolutely freaked out! No, not in a good way either.<br /><br />From the vast numbers of comments (good and bad) that I've read, it appears that so many proponents of this overly commercialized franchise are using it as a psychological \\""tool\\"" of sorts.

And yes, for those of you who wonder if I've even \\""read the book?\\"" I have; cute book -- scary doll.<br /><br />My suggestion to parents boils down to this - talk to your children FIRST! Don't think that this is guaranteed to be received as a \\""good surprise\\"" for the Holiday Season. Some will, and definitely, some won't. The suggestion that this \\""Elf\\"" will make your children \\""behave well,\\"" is just about as misguided as the parents who buy Baby Einstein videos/books; believing their child will be the next child prodigy or Nobel Prize winner - despite the fact there's simply no evidence that they work, much less, ever been tested (which they haven't).<br /><br />If you're that worried about the behavior of your children and what they're up to, invest in a wireless security camera(s).

5.0	they dont claim yes or no on if this money is real but it smells like real money and some of the bills even have water marks.
5.0	I bought this as a gift for my daughter, because I remembered how much fun I had with a similar toy when I was a child.  She's used it a lot and enjoyed creating a lot of pictures.
5.0	The Thomas train and train collections are durable toys. Their real value, though, is that playing with the toys allows children to act out the great Thomas and Friends children's stories they read and watch.<br />This is a nice layout that provides far more track than the usual figure 8 layout that gets purchased first.  It also provides a scenic mat, a tressle, and a building.  But it is very expensive. There is generic track available that costs far less. Our kids haven't noticed the difference. IT IS EASY TO CREATE ELEVATED TRACK AND BRIDGES USING LEGO OR DUPLO PIECES AS SUPPORTS. GENERIC CRANES ARE AVAILABLE FOR MUCH LESS.<br />Kids' imaginations can remarkably supply buildings and water towers and cranes, etc., so that they won't even miss what might be lacking from less expensive sets. And families can build some of these items themselves out of old boxes, etc.<br />Purchasing recommendation:<br />* Choose which type of Thomas trains you will 'standardize' on. There are three kinds: This size of wooden trains from Learning Curve; larger, plastic, battery-operated trains from Tomy; and smaller, die-cast metal trains from Ertl. The wooden trains have the most products and accessories available.<br />* The clickety-clack (grooved to look like real railroad) track in the Thomas series is great, but it's expensive; I recommend buying generic track. ... You can literally save hundreds of dollars by buying these kinds of sets.<br />* Buy the Thomas and friends engines separately--and wait for sales. The kids care about the characters, so no short-cutting (ie., Brio or generic trains) here.<br />* Look for trains bundled with VHS videos. You can get a video and a train (on sale) for about the same price as a train alone.
5.0	If you like Monster High Dolls she will make you smile!  Her sloth only adds to her charm!<br />Every Monster High lover will love getting a new doll to add to their collection.
1.0	Actually, putting it together wasn't horrible until I got to the floats.  None of the holes lined up so I'm stuck with a pretty, useless chair.
5.0	I got this for my sister-in-law (who would really prefer a live one, but oh well) to use as a game piece.  She likes to play Texas Hold'em and Mexican Train and this figurine is the perfect size and weight to use for either.
5.0	Exactly what I expected.
5.0	My nephew loves these. I bought them for him for Christmas and he plays with them all the time. They are really hard to find in stores.
5.0	Lovely touch to my dollhouse entry hall....warm and inviting.
5.0	So awesome since its just the skull and not the girls. Im not going to color it, well maybe just the skull so it shines on my wall. Love it.
5.0	Bought this for my niece on Christmas and she loves it.  Look it up on youtube.com if you want to see it in action.  It's a fun toy.
5.0	Not for the faint of heart or the easily offended, seriously, I'm not joking.  But if you're laid back and have a great sense of humor buy it, it will be your favorite game!
5.0	I brought this product as a gift, very fun game.
5.0	Put together easily and the 18-month old  just loves it, and it holds up even when she insists on trying to get into it!
1.0	I am very dissappointed with this purchase.  I bought this for my daughter for Christmas to go with her much loved Gotz doll.  The bottles were completely dried up.  I only recieved it a few days before Christmas so it was too late to get a replacement so I had to give it to her.  I emailed Haba/Gotz USA customer service but I haven't heard back from them.  The set is otherwise very good quality.
5.0	This Lego has a fair price for what it is, since I live in a small apartment its size is enough to put anywhere.
5.0	For such a low price this product works amazingly well. I filled it with helium at the grocery store for $4, assembled it per the instructions, and my 7-year-old nephew absolutely loved it. We flew it around the house all weekend. It is surprisingly nimble. Even though the remote control is IR (and therefore line-of-sight) it works in situations where I wouldn't have expected it to.
5.0	Got as a Christmas gift for our 5 year old daughter.  The age limit starts at age 7, but she destroyed her mother and grandparents in a legitimate competition (we don't gift wrap victory in our family).  If they have a knowledge of Disney movies, its age range can be anything.
5.0	This item is very well made and fits the American Girl Doll very well.  I was very pleased to find a good quality at a reasonal price.  Most of the clothing from American Girl is expensive.
5.0	Great product, daughter loved it! She plays with it and makes new jewelry on a daily basis. Will order more for sure!
5.0	Great toy!  We purchased this toy for our 9 month old and she loves it.  She likes to push it around.  Her 2 1/2 year old brother loves it, too.  He loves to ride it around the house.  Even our 5 year old loves this thing.  I would highly recommend it if you have hardwood floor or tile flooring.  The 360 degree wheels are great and give this toy an edge over other ride on toys.
5.0	I really like this new toy,it's beautiful! Can't wait to get all the new ponies ,in this new My Little Pony line.
5.0	Some of my preschoolers love to work with puzzles, so I try to find unique puzzles to pique their curiosity and help them learn at the same time.
5.0	Clics are collection of durable (will not break!) square plastic pieces (bricks, building elements) that can be joined together to build various 3D structures, animals and machines. Note the size of pieces (~1 inch x 1 inch) thus creations are quite large,-- good size for the small hands. In the box, instructions (consisting of ~15-30 steps) for building four construction vehicles depicted on the box are included.  This set includes four large wheels, six small wheels (necessary for attaching the large wheels), axles (rods) of various lengths and stickers which really enhance the look of the vehicles.    After playing with basic set of Clics elsewhere, my son has been asking me repeatedly to buy him Clics! Based on his interest in construction, I bought this set together with race car set. I was thinking that race cars are simpler to make for young child of 3 years age, but my son immediately said that he wants (me!) to build a digger! Having two sets together is good because more wheels (and pieces) are available so we can build two vehicles at a time. We built green/black forklift and I thought it looked even better than traditional yellow/black color scheme.    Instructions are essential for building these complex machines (as depicted) as some of the connections are not apparent/intuitive from just viewing the images on the box. Manufacturer correctly has labeled the box as toy for age 7+ (maybe younger kids can put this together as well). For now, I am building the complex vehicles at my son's request, but he can build on what I have build for him. Some connections of pieces are not easy,-- it is physically challenging (even for adult) to link the pieces with bent rods, but it is not impossible. These connections enhance the creation, but are not entirely necessary, so I don't see this as a problem. I find following instructions a good exercise for the mind and hope that building some models by following instructions allows for learning how to build various modules and eventually allows for inventing new machines.  Aside from models depicted in instructions, we have built a simple plane (without instructions) and less well defined other structures. My son, even at 3 years, can play with Clics for some amount of time...as long as I play/build with him.  Down the road, I plan to get another set to add more colored pieces and some eyes for building animals. I wish that information on instruction booklets (available separately on Amazon) would be more thorough. It seems that some models are not included in these booklets and if you wish to have instructions you have to purchase the entire new set (for example, the plane set).   All in all, I highly recommend this building toy. I would rate Clics superior (that is, more challenging and educational) to Lego Duplos...with advantage that one can build (!) actual 3D vehicles and animals/creatures from building blocks. Clics are made in Belgium!
5.0	This set is a great basic collection of kid knex pieces. Kids love the colors and the endless possibilities for creative play. I wish k'nex would make more sets like these rather than the ones with the lego type blocks mixed in, the basic knex pieces are fine on their own!
1.0	Very Cheaply Made nothing like the ones I bought 4 years ago  at penguin Magic
1.0	[[VIDEOID:moTPECOC75RLHV]]I have purchased all three of the Perplexus toys to date (Rookie, Original, Epic) and been satisfied with 2 of the 3.<br /><br />I mainly got this for our 4 year old because the Original is too tough for her.  The day we got it, I didn't even open the packaging.  I kept it in the box and hid it.  This was a Christmas present that we bought pretty early in the year.  After opening it on Christmas, I was thoroughly disappointed.  I was ticked.  I was mad.  I never had the sense to return it because it was purchased months earlier...<br /><br />The main problem was that it was poorly engineered.  The silver ball was not physically able to pass obstacle 8.  The track was so close to a different obstacle, the ball would not move past it.  It doesn't fit.<br /><br />Literally, the supposedly easiest Perplexus is and was the hardest.<br /><br />I purchased this over a year ago and it still just sits there, waiting to be played up to obstacle 8... reminding me over and over to write a review on Amazon.<br /><br />I'll update with a video or a pic soon.<br /><br />So, go buy the other two Perplexus...  not this one.
5.0	These were great for decorating the crafts at the party and just overall fun for the girls, there was a great assortment and they stuck great!
5.0	Lovely smushy and very green!  Perfect.  Thanks!
5.0	I purchased this hedgehog as an inexpensive &#34;add-on&#34; gift for my eight-year-old niece who only asked for a gift card for her birthday.  The plush is darling, and looks just as represented in the photo.  It is very small.  The four-inch height in the product description includes the pointy birthday hat with pom-pom!  Still, the facial features are adorable, and the birthday girl loved it.
5.0	The pole is removable and is great for guiding the kids around. This version is better than other version that has gears that stear front.
5.0	Great part of the set
5.0	This puzzle is very nice and very high quality. My wife and I (unfortunately) have not been able to complete it. In fact, we were unable to even get the border put together properly. We tried for many hours over the course of several weeks and just couldn't get it 100% of the way there. We haven't given up though -- we just bought a new puzzle instead (with only 500 pieces) and are going to cut our teeth on that one.     Buy this puzzle if you're looking for something very durable, but also very challenging. I'm sure one day we'll get it together and when it's finished, it will definitely be frame-worthy.
5.0	As a music therapist who works a ton with kids and has WAY too many instruments, I can confidently say, this is a quality product and is a great deal! I'm ordering a 2nd one now : )
5.0	great for the halloween party. will recommend them for their speedy deliver<br />and just in time. the trophy is like oscar for the grown indiviual.
5.0	It came on time and was everything it said it was! I bought it as a gift and they were really excited about it.
5.0	My son hasnt taken it off since it arrived he loves it
5.0	Great kit for the price!  He loves it and its very easy to cart around.  I would recommend this product for anyone
5.0	Perfect toy at perfect price. Am always pleased with my searches at Amazon and usually always find what I am looking for.
5.0	great, awesome, gnarly, radical, fantastic, superb, amazing, majestic, mind-blowing, impressive, magnificent, exalted, breath-taking, beautiful, awe- inspiring, wondrous, grand, astonishing, overwhelming
5.0	Needed these for a science project for my son... What do you say?  They are filings of iron.  They respond to magnets.  Itty Bitty bits of metal.<br /><br />Exactly as advertised.  Not an exciting product, but hey, they are iron.
5.0	It was a great birthday gift!
5.0	I purchased this as a gift for my four year old niece.  She loves it.
5.0	"Smaller than what I thought it was going to be, but adorable none the less. My 4yr old niece has a quite a few \\""Miss Kitty\\"" (as she calls her) items. This Kitty met with her instant approval - she loves it!<br /><br />Word of caution - this is not a toy for small children as it contains small parts that can be removed."
5.0	floats nicely and stays upright
1.0	THE GYRO NEEDS TWO PLACES THE BUCKLE CONNECTS TO THE BLADE ASSY!!!!!!!!!!!
5.0	very cute and super soft fur.... it's gonna' be a hit with the recipient!
1.0	this item shipped without the counters in it...not much use
1.0	Half of the glasses arrived with the lenses popped out.
5.0	So much fun to play with 4year old grandson....he just wants to buld, play and tell me what's happening
5.0	My daughter loves Monster High dolls. So this is a steal for the price I paid at the time it's cheaper now. It's free shipping too.
5.0	This is an absolutely adorable Hello Kitty Beanie Baby. I am going to use it as an Easter decorations. I would recommend it.
5.0	my little niece loved to play &#34;house&#34;...perfect for her
5.0	G-Granddaughter loves having a new boy doll too.
5.0	And she loves it. Being an imaginative child, she has already imbued it with personality. And I have to admit, it is a cute toy.
5.0	A little pricey. Much cheaper at Walmart like half the price. If I had know would not have bought on line.sorry.
5.0	We LOVE this show so this was a Great gift for my husband! We all love to play it :)
5.0	I love these little trinkets, they are so cute and some are hard to find!! I am glad I found this one!! Great price great product!!
5.0	Needs more weight to keep the contacts pushed down for it to run.
1.0	U don't get what it show on pic all u get is the battery box n no battery case
5.0	This game is great for kids as well as adults. If children play the game, harder letters can be eliminated, ie, q, z, x, to enable their success at creating words. We have played this with 2 players, and 5 players so far and the game is challenging, yet different with each.  Great game!
1.0	"Why don't any of the Harrisville loops tell the number of loops in the package.  Yes you can barely read the number on some of the 40 loop packs, but please include the pertinent info - Cotton - number of loops - size of loom.  Some loops are really small to fit the loom (8\\"") that we have. 1 star because you do not know what you are buying."
5.0	This 12 inch, highly articulated figure comes with an authentic Masque of the Red Death costume and staff.
5.0	My nephew went digging through it to discover the treasure that had come with it and the ones I added.
5.0	it is fast and awesome if you buy it you will not regret this RC car.
5.0	Perfect game. Great crowd pleaser
5.0	My 7 year old loves the new version of this game.It is much harder and requires them to really think.With the old guess who , we could be done in less than 10 minutes! Worth it if your child still likes games!!!
5.0	This little guys is just to cute. For the time being, I'm using him as a sugar bowl. He receives a lot of compliments from my guests when I bring him out for coffee or tea service. I may order several to amuse to serve chicken salad in as a dinner course.
5.0	Would definitely order these again--they were perfect for our tractor themed birthday party for 3-7 year olds. Anything John Deere works for a tractor themed party.
5.0	This Pikachu is really soft and beautiful, looks exactly like the picture
1.0	Very disappointed! Looks nothing like it is pictured, doesn't even look like a unicorn. I ordered it for a party decoration but upon inflating it and seeing how ugly it was, I decided not to use it at all!
5.0	If you do a lot of puzzles, you will love this. My husband and I love doing puzzles and before we purchased this, we were always getting up from our chair and walking around to put a piece in the other side. This is made well, spins smoothly, and saves us from having to move. Also the table is easily moved to clear our dining table for meals. Be aware of the puzzle sizes that you buy to make sure it will fit the table. Would definitely buy again and highly recommend.
5.0	Excellent toy for babies just starting to crawl.
5.0	Exactly as I expected.
5.0	My whole family loves to play Munchkin together and we have almost all of the sets. We got this one for my son for Christmas. We sat around the kitchen table for hours laughing ourselves silly over this one. Much more lighthearted than the Zombie, Bites or Apocalypse versions. Looking forward to getting the expansion.
5.0	Bought as a gag gift for a hunting buddy. He had a plaque made for it, and now it will be a yearly pass around trophy for the person who misses the most!  The plaque reads &#34; Can't shoot s**t&#34;.  The guys at the shop couldn't stop laughing!
5.0	Great product here, I have no complaints.  I only wish there was a way to connect the zip bins to make one big Lego Friends land for my daughter. Future product idea maybe? Include me ins the copyright please. ;)
5.0	Got this for my daughter and she loves it. I would definitely reccomend this. Great learning toy for young kids
5.0	the phone is easy to use, and so colourful - i never lose it in my purse! my granddaughter likes that the receiver is chewable, and the rotary ring sound is fun, exciting and emits screams of laughter from her. well worth the price of admission.
5.0	I agree with some other reviewers that this toy could have been made a little better, and for K'NEX that is surprising as I have had $100 roller coasters before that were well thought out, though a pain to put together. My son loves anything zombie or specifically Plants Versus Zombies. He loves the game and so this for him is pure heaven and delight. I had to assemble it as he was not able to do son on his own and it took me a long time and some bad language but in all respect that is the case with Playmobil and Lego as well. I did not have any issues with parts not being correct or fitting but it was time consuming and frustrating to assemble. However, once done he was delighted and it is not the most sturdy toy once put together but it is fun for him especially the shooting part.
5.0	This is a perfect addition to the Ticket to Ride game. It makes the game more fun, because it gives you SO many more routes. WAY more fun!
5.0	my grandson is 5 just loved this hat good quailty,easy to use looked great in it. was a great xmas gift
5.0	Super fun game for 2 people. Doesn't take too long to learn and a great mix of strategy and worker placement.
5.0	Excellent little photo album! We bought this for our 7 month old daughter. She loves to look at photos, but needless to say is pretty hard on paper pictures! This little album holds 12 4x6&#34; photos and keeps them protected from her crinkling hands and drooly gums! She loves to look at the photos of her family and drag this soft little book around. It's so sweet to see her looking at pictures of her family members! We took pictures of them with her specifically for the book.<br /><br />I have not experienced the same problems as other reviewers. The plastic is clear and in good condition. It is a bit &#34;wavy&#34; but that is what I expected. The pages are flexible to allow baby to play with them without damaging them or hurting herself. I think the pictures look great in it and have not had a problem with them either sticking to the plastic or falling out. Ours works very well and everyone compliments on how adorable it is!
5.0	my 6 months old daughter loves going in there and jumping around...the sounds and lights aren't overwhelming. yes putting the jumper together was challanging at times...but what isn't....great for what it is! thankfully i bought it at babies r us for 49 bucks!bbb
5.0	Who doesn't love Jemima? She is well made, soft for cuddleing, and as ducks go....pretty! What's not to love? Hope your little one enjoys her as much as mine does.
5.0	Absolutely wonderful item...my daughter loved it. Well made, very soft, and a very good value. I would buy other similar items
5.0	Excellent quality in a very hard to find size!
5.0	Bought as a gift for our Grandson!
5.0	Durable and good quality.
5.0	We always do a family puzzle @ Christmas and are fans of FLWright's work.  This puzzle was reasonably challenging, with bright sturdy pieces.  Definitely recommend.
5.0	A very enjoyable family game - the games are quick and it's easy to teach to new players.  It has quickly become a favorite go-to filler game on game-nights while waiting for people to show up or between games.
1.0	My daughter got this as a birthday present.  I would never have chosen this for a 7 year old because the doll looks whore-ish, but I allowed her to keep it.  Within five minutes of playing with it, she complained that the hair clip broke and that it wasn't fun.  She said she wished she could have taken it back.  The hair that is supposed to be able to be crimped, etc. barely works (even I tried unsuccessfully)  It was a huge disappointment for her.This is junk--do not waste your money.
5.0	Good activities, lots of fun.
5.0	I bought this easel for our 6 year old grandson's birthday. I figured he would like it, and I hoped it would be something his 3 year old sister could enjoy also. It was a big hit. They both could draw to their hearts content at the same time without interfering with each other. Another plus is the clip at the top of each board. We discovered that was wonderful for paper drawings and those large coloring sheets. We added washable dry erase markers and sidewalk chalk to give them many options.
1.0	My daughter got this for her birthday.  We followed the directions down to the letter - leaving it in the fridge for weeks, using only rainwater, etc. After several months ONE plant began to grow - 6 months later and after lots of research - I've determined that we've spent 10 meticulous months growing some plain clover.  I'm disgusted.
5.0	All my friends purchased their sets at the flea market for well over $100.00 (with hard case & pushers)  My set is exactly the same as theirs except it came in a soft case which I happen to like because I toss it over my shoulder, hop on my bike and much easier to carry than the hard case.<br />It works great for me and my life style.
5.0	Works great. Useful purchase.
5.0	20 different designs, usually 4-6 of each, 100 total. All of them appropriate for children. It was a nice variety of different charms. Each one is about 3/4&#34;, and has the small metal ring attached, just like in the picture.
1.0	Was not very enjoyable - too dull
5.0	Birthday gift for my 2 year old grandchild. She liked it
5.0	Nice starter pack to duplos. Santa brought it last year, and it's enough to get building, great to add on to with some of the specialized duplo packs. We love the duplo/train track attachment, so we can build duplo train stations that the track can run through...
5.0	It is so Cool after assembling it, shinning my small cabinet
5.0	My 9 yr old loves this. We got it for a Halloween costume, and it was perfect! Very sturdy, considering it's mostly cardboard, as long as you don't abuse it.
5.0	very cute and well make.  every in the winter  and there are no bugs out, my daughter likes to hide her little treasures in it.  great toy.
5.0	Beautiful - but quite small.
5.0	Beautiful dolls for my baby girl. I buy this more than 1 year ago, and they are cute because of the size, just perfect for my little girl.
5.0	Very cute and a great addition to the baby shower gift I gave
5.0	Got this toy for my 22 yr old male employee for Xmas and he said it was the best present ever.  He put it in the fish tank & was 7 yrs. old again.  The fish seemed to get a kick out of it
5.0	Granddaughter loves this and is a Frozen fanatic.
5.0	all excellent, fast shipping - I'm very happy
5.0	I have bought several of Melissa Doug Reusable Sticker Pads and the kid's LOVE them.  This one was for my 2 and a half year old granddaughter and she loves it.  My grandson brought out one I had given him about a year earlier so we could play with it!  It was still in good shape, one smaller piece was lost but didn't miss it.  That was BEFORE I gave him or my granddaughter the new ones!  So, they hold children's interest a lot longer than other things.<br /><br />As always they are made well, sturdy, last a long time and are a fun way for young kid's to be creative.
5.0	I just love takeing the three mid size boats (each around the size of the robot half of the mega optimous prime).When you combine them into the big warship(the size of the full optimous prime truck) it is easy.  When you change the warship into the robot the robot it is about the size of Super optimous prime.  The minicon is a jet that transforms easaly.  It isnt that great alont with the power (the guns on the gun boat swivin 90 degres.  Whoo Hoo)  Overall it is a good set.
1.0	it dosent fit the 13inch lap top
5.0	my 2 yo is obsessed with nemo. He absolutely loves this toy. it is small enough that he can easily play with it and snuggle with it. he likes to pretend along with the movie :)
5.0	"I had been praying and asking questions for half my life. I never got a clear answer, in fact, I never got any answers at all.....    All that has changed since I received my Answer Me Jesus. Finally when someone says \\""what would jesus do?\\"" I can help them find out. It's almost as if I have divine powers. Like I said, years went by without any of my questions to jesus being answered. I expected about the same results when I purchased my Answer Me Jesus, but I had to take the chance. Boy, am I ever glad I did! Of course all of the answers are totally based on chance but so are all prayers so what the hell! Highly recommended, comes in pink velvet so that your hands don't get rubbed raw after holding on to it for hours on end."
5.0	It takes a little time to set it up but now my little girl doesn't stop to play, she loves it.
5.0	The items are ok and exact date when i receive
5.0	My daughter has had this for quite a while and really loves it. She has no problem rolling it into the ball.
5.0	My 5 yr old grandson loves Hook. He Would like something like this for Smee, Sharky and Bones too. Thanks
5.0	These are so realistic looking & are perfect for our kids' play kitchen!
5.0	I bought this before I had my daughter from a toys r us going out of business. I gave it to her when I was finally expecting our 2nd baby. She loves this doll more than any other. It looked like mommy too and we could take the baby out too. Without the belly the doll looks like any other barbie. The legs move outward too and she was frustrated when her other barbie wouldn't move the same. Love this doll. Would love to get for my b.f. expecting but they don't have it on here anymore.
5.0	This completes the Fisher Price Nativity set.  Very nice.
5.0	so happy to find this CD. Have looked for a very long time for the Dodgers song. Thanks for carrying this
5.0	Many hours of gaming so far with no defects, chips, or damage. They may not be fancy dice, but they are adequate for any gaming use.
1.0	This cubby does not fit the standard size fabric cubes; each cubby is about a 1/2 inch too short! The wood laminate contained lots of imperfections and knots.
5.0	Arrived on time. Just what my grandson wanted!
1.0	Placed order Dec.13 after receiving an e-mail confirmation from seller indicating that the Parent Child Testing Product would arrive promptly and well before Christmas. Dec 20 received e-mail from seller that product was on back order and would arrive Jan 5th. That dog won't hunt, Monsignor.
5.0	I thought it was horrible and cheap, but my son said they were all like that.  The big thing is that my granddaughter loved it.  It was just what she wanted, so I was thrilled with it.  I just remember the My Little Pony items from my 35 year old daughters childhood and they were soft rubber with hair to comb and brush.  Now they are hard plastic with no hair to brush.  My son said I was lucky to get them.
5.0	"Collector of Twilight Series - Not Used as a \\""Toy\\"".  So marking the \\""fun or educational\\"" values are low due to this only.  It is a perfect additional to my daughters collection of dolls.  It will be for display only."
5.0	I actually bought two of these. My 5 month old German Shepherd loves this toy! It's a fun little monkey!
5.0	It was a huge hit with the 3 year old. We made sandwiches, cut up the fruit and bread, ate the pretend carrot!
5.0	Amazing how clean this card was.
5.0	This is just what I needed.  It came right away and works perfectly.  I would definitely buy it again.  Good product.
5.0	Bought this for my 4 yr old daughter. And she loves it! I would suggest for every little girl!
1.0	Product leaked from day 1. Was bought as Christmas present for grandchildren so was not opened right away. Vendor would not allow return even though defective. Would not recommend to anyone.
5.0	Who doesn't love this game, its always a crowd please and we all enjoy playing it.
5.0	Classic Velcro wallet with iconic batman logo. My kid absolutely loves it.  Of course she wanted some money to put in it right away.
5.0	It's a TF. 5 stars says it all!!
5.0	The wig was delivered on time.  The quality was excellent and my granddaughter wears it daily!!
5.0	Absolutely a beautiful jewelry box. Gave it as a gift. Each corner comes out for more space to place earrings or whatever is desired. It's pretty pink and made strong  for a young child to open and close without it breaking. I am impressed with the quality of the product. On the top is more space for more jewelry. It holds quite alot of jewelry.<br />I bought this specifically for a child that loves to dance and loves the song &#34;Swan Lake&#34;. She enjoys it and has it displayed for everyone to see. It is getting used and we are happy with the product. As usual Amazon helped make my Christmas shopping easy.
5.0	Ordered this for a 70s/80s themed NYE party as decoration.  After a few hours of being plugged in, it worked fine.  Now it sits on my college aged daughters bedside table.  Cute little lava lamp.
5.0	Heavy duty float. Very stable and durable.
5.0	Grandson really enjoys it.
5.0	I bought this toy for my grandson who loves indians.  He was thrilled with the toy. The little indian is very sturdy and very colorful.
5.0	The set was complete and very nice.  It has a strong case.  The set came in a very quickly.  I am very satisfied.  The characters are easy to read with the white background.
5.0	I was concerned that the pacifier which triggers the sounds would be too difficult for her one-year-old coordination,  but it was easy for her to operate and she loves that baby doll!
5.0	I love Strawberry Shortcake, and have enjoying it for 20 years since I was a young girl. I was so excited they re-released it and could not wait to buy it. I just received this new doll and - it's great!!!  A+++++++
5.0	My Great Niece LOVES her.
5.0	Our youngest has taken up karate and Santa brought this for her on Christmas.  I have seen dolly now a couple of times dressed in her Gi chopping away at the air, just like her girl.  The only complaint I might have is that our daughter's karate program wears black, so the white isn't a perfect match.
5.0	My four and six year old enjoy Squinkies and they especially love the Disney Character ones. This is an entertaining pack with four different Ariels (three wearing a different dress, one with a tail). Much more costly on Amazon as I was able to get for half this price at Walmart. Worth it though, if your child is a Little Mermaid Fan! (Also comes in Cinderella and I believe Beauty and The Beast.)
5.0	Will order more from Silver Oak when I review the album page by page need for stamps. Not rushing myself. Found Silver Oak's  location in Arizona. That's nice.
1.0	I tried to buy these from from Tapped Out Magic, they never sent my cards and ignored all my messages asking where my cards were. Do not buy.
5.0	I am always on the lookout for cooperative games and this one did not disappoint me.  The game itself is gorgeous, and it's also very educational. It allows my children to learn about herbs in a fun manner, and I was quite surprised by how generous my son was with me when we played this game.    The idea of the game is for a group of children to take a hike in the woods behind Grandma's house and collect huckleberries. Along the way, various things can happen to the children when they land on various spaces, such as sunburn, bug bites, etc.  When the children pull the card with the ailment, there are pictures of herbs that can help fix it.  If the child who pulls the card does not have the herb card that can help her, then others can help her.  The whole idea is to work together. It doesn't matter who wins--the point is for all of the children to make it back to Grandma's before it gets dark.  There are even cooperation cards that can be drawn so the children who are ahead can bring another player up with them.  The first time we played the game, it seemed a bit long for my 5 year old, but then I found the adaption of rules for younger children.  We also got more comfortable with the game and realized we weren't following the directions completely. Once we learned them, the game went much faster.  I enjoy playing this game because I learn something too.   Highly recommended!!
5.0	Best set ever got vanity's emptiness
5.0	Loved it. My daughter was extremely happy with these little rubber bands. Whatever makes her happy makes  me happy!! Probably will buy this again. I need more
5.0	I bought this for my kids. They love them. I remembered these as a kid myself and how much fun they were.
5.0	This is the best priced float out there and is really comfortable.  I'm sure there are nicer...but I don't want to have to buy an expensive one and worry they will break.  We use these in the lake with friends and adults and kids like them.  No way to avoid getting wet in them....but great for relaxing in the water.
1.0	If you know how this trick works you know there are 5 permanent &#34;dots&#34; on one side.  These idiots have put six permanent and immovable &#34;dots&#34; on one side.  This is not even consistent with the instructions they provide.  For those who do not know how this tricks work, having 6 permanent &#34;dots&#34; makes this trick unworkable!  DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!
5.0	very nice peace, price beat the competitors goes well will my over 400 diecast collectables
5.0	Great party game! Creates a lot of laughs and really challenges you on some letters.
5.0	Made a perfect Valentines Day gift combination; though, I wanted to keep it for myself, but my guy loved it
5.0	I bought this for my 4 month old and he LOOOOOVES this! He will sit for long periods of time making it spin! He also adores the animals that came with it! He mostly love the music and lights though! He just loves watching the middle part spin and hearing the music play when he gets it moving. He is totally delighted with it! I am thoroughly impressed with the quality and durability of the product too and LOVE the Amazing Animals line! Another great product from Fisher Price!!!!
1.0	Part functions as expected.  Problem is with purchasing.  I ordered quantity of 2 parts and they only shipped 1.  I inquired and initially got a prompt reply but no follow through.  I've paid for 2 parts and as of over a month later have only received 1 part.
5.0	These were so cool for a Hawaiian themed party.  At the end, I folded them up to use again.  They looked awesome.
5.0	We are having so much fun with this playhut everyday.  When not in use I carefully fold it in two and put in closet.  (I do not fold any further because of top rod, do not want to damage.  REMINDER - as other reviews told me to do the top rod goes outside the top.  Slide it into the Velcro tab.  Easy to do.  Most look inside tent where to place.  GREAT others told us all in review.  My four year old granddaughter and her 15 month old brother LOVE playing in this tent.  She calls it her dollhouse.  She has told one and all she wants to live in it thank you very much.  Two sides have mesh openings.  The little one loves to go in and out.  The front has a door that is made into a hinged, Velcro holds it shut.  The hinge is a smaller rod you slide into the slots easy assembly.  There is a window and an awning above the window.  There is a hidden pocket inside under the window like a pouch? that velcros closed.  Our granddaughter keeps her treasures in there.  In the back is a milar (?) mirror, large oval that velcros into the back of the tent.  She loves every inch of this roomy tent.  No floor.  I lay a smooth baby quilt down and position the tent over it for a &#34;Floor&#34; to catch cookie crumbs, etc. as they insist on picnics in it.  FUN!<br />Looks better in person also.  Like the material it is made from.  Great price.
5.0	Too Cute....these were perfect for my child's party!
5.0	Good Quality. Arrived really fast.
5.0	Wife loved the little bear
5.0	le recomiendo este producto a todos, excelente atencion por parte del vendedor y mucha rapidez al entregar el paquete. muy bien
5.0	These are amazing! My 18 month old daughter loves to color. For awhile, I was using Color Wonder markers, but these are better because they &#34;colors&#34; show up more quickly. You don't have to worry about the markers being dried out either.
5.0	Should come on the Rally already. It works well but the lower setting for the smaller batteries doesn't work so well. Overall I'm very pleased and now i can use my hump back batteries
5.0	These are for my daughter to make bracelets for her friends at school.  The have a blast making them.  Thank you
5.0	After using this device at her weekly Mahjongg outing, my wife asked me to find her a set, Amazon had the lowest price. My wife said they were exactly what she wanted. She and her group were happy with these pushers. Product was as described and were listed at the lowest price I could find on the Internet.
5.0	I just got the pictures back of my nephew's 6th birthday and you can tell that the kid is really, genuinely thrilled to have received this truck. It's the one I had when I was a wee lad and I'm pretty sure that it'll last forever. My sis says that he hauls Legos around the house with it. Way to go kid. I loved Legos too but -- man! do they hurt when you step on them with socks on, huh?. You know what, a truck is actually pretty educational come to think of it. Kids see folks in their hometown driving work trucks around and they look up to those folks. That's important. If the kid has the impulse to move the Legos from here  to there, then it must be very satisfying to get the job done. Learning the value of accomplishment is also very important.
5.0	This is a pain to put together, but it seems sturdy and came nicely shipped. My 14 mo old loves playing with it so far. A really nice size for him too!
5.0	My grand daughter loved it.
5.0	I looked all over the place for replacement balls for the glow in the dark green version of the burp gun - the &#34;Glow In The Dark Moon Blaster Gun&#34; and these were literally the only ones I could find! I'm very happy with this purchase. The balls are hard, as opposed to the bendy plastic the original balls were but I think my cat likes them even more because they make a louder sound. Our kitten LOVES to play with these and it requires little effort on my part! I loose a ton of these balls though and they are a pain to find, so having a source for replacing them is fantastic! They are the perfect size for the gun just as advertised.
1.0	This is the worst toy ever!  Its sand so we all expect its going to be a little messy...but c'mon it was all over the place.  Moulding?  That never happened it was just one big pile of mess.  The kids couldn't even get it to stay flat like a pancake without falling apart...I'd definitely not recommend this toy!
1.0	The quality is horrible. It arrived hard, and wasn't flexible at all.
1.0	This item's title, photo and description were stolen from my eBay store, &#34;Kerbey Lane Miniatures&#34;.  I sell this item for $1.00 (ONE AMERICAN DOLLAR).  Susie lacyhome4boys on eBay.
5.0	they were exactly what I was looking for .. perfect fall cloves .. I don't like to have my fingers covered so this was a fantastic solution ..
5.0	This is a great figure for a number of reasons.  It's a great likeness of Ryuko, and the pose is just epic.  The sculpting and painting on the figure is top notch.<br /><br />The figure comes with an alternate hand, and 2 versions of her scissor blade (1 extended as portrayed in the main pic of this figure, and 1 standard).<br /><br />The base is some generic grey rubble, and one piece is removable with an optional piece that has a clear plastic support for one of Ryuko's knees.  You really don't need it and I think the figure looks a lot better without it, but it's nice to have.<br /><br />If you're the type of collector to keep things in the box, this is a great figure for you.  The box art is really well done and the packaging design is thoughtful.  The plastic windows are shaped to resemble Ryuko's Kamui.  You do miss out on the ability to display this figure in her epic pose with a full extended blade, but this would be a nice figure to keep in the box (not something I do personally, but I know there are collectors out there who do this).
5.0	My 2year old grandson loves it! It's great for imaginary play and just the right size. Now he BBQs like his dad!
5.0	Great model.  It is made by italeri, not tamiya.  It's an italeri model in the tamiya box.  Just started working on it.....so far it seems great.
5.0	I grew up with this game. I introduced my kids to it years ago and they recently took it to a game night with college friends. It was a hit! We bought this one as a gift; it comes in a nice tin for easy storage and protection of the cards.
5.0	Valentine's Day gift for my girlfriend...&#34;Be MINE MINE MINE&#34; :)<br /><br />Get it?...Anyway, it's a very nice, Disney authentic, plush toy. Not much else to say! Very satisfied!
5.0	We have had this toy for a couple of years and it never seems to get old!  it's really durable.  While it has a flat suction bottom to keep it in place on flat surfaces, it still works fine on carpet. The spinning arm is plastic with a metal rod and does come off, but I stepped on it and it bounced back with no problem.  Definitely good value for the money and lots of entertainment!
5.0	Delighted with this buy. My sons teacher asked where he got it. It was a great price and did a perfect job for my ten year old dressing as Abraham Lincoln!Great price too.
5.0	I bought it for my 3 year old son. He liked it a lot! Easy to transform. He enjoys to transform it once and again. Great Idea the way it transforms. For a 3 year old is perfect!
1.0	OK So I am a huge fan of the Prince of Persia movie, enjoyed the games and all...but this is not about that, this is about this toy....wow I love Mcfarlane Toys, they always sell the most detailed toys I have ever seen in any figure. Though this toy is pretty bad....It is in fact really well detailed but its designed to stand in the most awkward pose ever...most Mcfarlane Toys I have are given stands because if they do stand awkward, this helps them stay up.....Although this figure...I have no idea what they were thinking....It is nearly impossible for it to stand on its own...I have NO idea why it has arm moving action when by just inserting the sword into its hand the thumb on the figure broke right off....I really do not know what else to say...if you find it in a discounted bin in your local toy store for under 10 dollars...and you are a fan of Prince of Persia then yeah get it...but if by any chance you are looking online for this and are given an option to pay for shipping ...save your money...its pretty bad and not worth it.
5.0	everybody loves elmo, this backpack is so sweet you are not carrying much, but enough to keep a little one happy
5.0	My son spent more than one week playing with it and he learnt a lot.
5.0	My niece and the family dog were fascinated with the new pup!  It provides many hours of fun.
5.0	Perfect for my daughter 1st birthday.
5.0	I wasn't sure if my little girl would be ready for this, since she was getting it for her 1st birthday and couldn't quite walk yet, but she loves it.  First we had to put her on it and she would just take off.  She also likes to push her sister around on it backwards (and her sister is 4 1/2 and 40 lbs, so it is a sturdy toy).  After about a week she could lift her leg over and get on by herself, but she still cannot steer it very well and often ends up stuck against a wall or something (although it is really easy to steer, she just doesn't understand the concept yet).  The scoot about is attractive, small, sturdy and fun and I would definitely recommend it to anyone!
5.0	My girls and their friends are obsessed with Ever After High.  My own daughters have so many dolls and they have been on birthday and Christmas wishlists for awhile now.  This one I bought for my 11 year old's best friend who has a couple of dolls but wanted Raven Queen.  We gave it to her for her birthday.  She was totally stoked when she opened the package and if she didn't love us forever before, she does now. :D<br /><br />This Thronecoming doll is just as beautiful as the other dolls in this series.  She is made just as well as the other dolls.  The stand leaves a bit to be desired, but my daughters have never once did anything with the stand beyond throw it away with the packaging. :D<br /><br />Beautiful doll.  I love the Ever After High brand. The books are fun, the videos are cute, and the dolls are so pretty.
5.0	My grandson and I both love spiderman and this glove and shooter is better than alot of the others on line.
5.0	I bought this for my boyfriend, who paints Warhammer 40k models, and he loves it. This is a great, affordable brush for fine detail painting.

5.0	I bought this for my Mother-in-law for Christmas.  This purse is not my style at all, but she LOVED it, and I do have to say that it was great quality, and very nicely made!  If this is your style, it's a great purchase for the price!  you can't go wrong getting genuine leather for under $25!!  I do like the turtle design in the beading.
5.0	Awesome product. My boys love it. Very sturdy. Promptly shipped and delivered.
5.0	This is a well put together item. It has a nice finish and is light weight but sturdy. I read a lot of negative reviews of other models but this one had the best reviews and rightly so. Minimal assembly is required and it looks great on my sons wall. This is the one to get.
5.0	I haven't opened this game yet, but I played at a friends house and just had to have one.  I know I will get many hours of enjoyment from it. May give it to my family as a gift.
5.0	This was a Christmas gift for my 10 year old daughter. In order to assemble it, make your life easier and watch the video (link is provided in the directions.) Husband watched it and had it set up in minutes. We also purchased a helium tank from a local party store. We are four days out from the day we set it up and it hasn't lost an ounce of air. All the controllers worked fine. It is awesome to watch. Highly recommend this toy!!
5.0	I bought the drum for my 8 month old grandson, and he just loves it.  It's also extremely durable, as the drum has rolled off the couch, with the help of his feet, to the tile floor and it's still intact. The music, flashing designs, and ABC's seen to hold his attention.  I see him enjoying the drum for quite a while.
5.0	Very realistic. Used it when we were driving up to Tahoe out the window (I was a passenger) and a lady pointed to me and screamed &#34;OH MY GOD ITS A SQUIRRELLLL!!&#34; people got a good laugh out of it. Eye holes r very small and hard to see out of but it's ok. It's really cute when the hair from the ears blows in the wind
5.0	Had a slight bend, but worth it.
5.0	Christmas gift for my granddaughter my daughter said she loves it. Shipped it to them direct from Amazon so I didn't get to see it. If my daughter said it's great than great it is.
5.0	MI SIX YEAR OLD SON , LOVES BOTH THE MOVIE AND THIS FIGURE !!  THANK YOU !!!
5.0	Very cute and nicely packaged. My granddaughter is age 4&1/2 and has a large foot size child 11 and since these are slip on's they fit fine for her.
5.0	My great-nephews are in high school and one in college, but nothing or no one dampens their love of Legos - ordered as a gift and they were obviously thrilled to receive it.
5.0	What a fun game.  Purchased this for my Great Nephew because he said they played with this at school.  He is 5 years old, and the game kept him content for a long time.  I enjoyed playing with it myself.  Excellent purchase for the little ones.
5.0	Got this for my 3 1/2 year old grandson for Christmas, and he loves it! He had fun with the changing side design before it even came out of the box. And then when he could put his Lightning McQueen car inside - well, that was big time fun!
5.0	He opened the gift and had me put it together right then! He didn't care about the rest of the party. All the other kids there were in awe and loved putting it on and making their voices change.
5.0	Totally awesome looking and really does the job!
1.0	Ordered two batteries, plugged the first one in to charge and it shorted internally.  Almost set my office on fire.  Afraid to even try the second one.  Either the battery was defective or it's not compatible with the Futaba 14SG as was advertised.
5.0	this is vary satisfactory this totally worth the small amount of money put towards it I think everyone should buy this awesome product
5.0	perfect for my 10 yr old grandson.  strong and wide enough for his seat with comfort.  also nice chain.  great materials and coating on chains.
5.0	These dice are amazing I love using them and they make me proud to show off my dice during a game.
5.0	Great firm to work. As a new Amazon user, I could not have been more pleased with the quality of the service team at Dragon Dungeons! Thank you! I will be back!
1.0	Not really satisfied.  Not what I was expecting.  I have some round ones and love them.  They are so easy to use.  These are a pain to use.  Do you have any refund policies or could they be replaced with simple round, foam centered ones?
5.0	My three year old granddaughter loves this puzzle.  Even her 5 1/2 year old sister likes it.  Sturdy and enough redundant pieces that its still very usable even if they lose a couple of them.
1.0	My wife and I blew up 1,500 balloons for our kids' birthday party (balloon pit, massive success) and I bought this thing in anticipation of saving our lips/lungs. It is poorly constructed of too-thin, unbuttressed, injection-molded plastic and requires more time spent &#34;pumping&#34; than the half dozen or so breaths needed to blow a balloon. The tip was poorly crafted as well, meaning getting the blown-up balloon off and tied was a tricky ordeal.<br /><br />Save your money!
5.0	Only took 2 days to get this card and I got it in a nice ultra sleeve as well as a hard case to keep the card safe.
5.0	First of all, I do not consider this game to be a TOY!!  But the set is great - it includes the pushers and all fits nicely in the very sturdy case; and all at a reasonable price.  My only complaint is the size of the dice - teeny tiny.
5.0	I purchased this specific activity table after a visit to my in-laws. My daughter had played with other tables and they managed to keep her attention for a brief time only. Then we stumbled upon this one... And she adores it!  She will dance and dance and dance. Now that she's getting older, she is getting into the microphone. It's a hoot to watch her play, the music selections do not drive us batty, and she adores it!  Easy to assemble and worth every penny.
5.0	I bought these for my 3 year old daughter for her birthday and shes been playing with them ever since its like she doesn't get tired of them she carries them every where in her Dora backpack i had previously order for her,they seem to be machine washable because i have done it and they came out looking new.I feel they where a lil pricey but she's happy so im happy,im satisfied with this item and i would recommend them to friends.
5.0	is an awesome little raft it's a regular inflatable plastic graph inside a canvas cover so you could even have like a dog placed on it and it wouldn't be able to puncture through
5.0	I think the item needs more details I thought the toy teaches you spanish instead it's in spanish and it teaches you spanish either way it's cool my son likes it thas all that matters
5.0	Initially I thought they would not be sufficient to hold lasagna/mannicoti.  I was wrong.  The birthday package did everything I was hoping it would do. Thanks .... Had a great 60th birthday.
5.0	My 5 year old granddaughter loved it xxx xxx xxx xxx xxx xxx xxx xxx xxx xxx xxx xxx xxx
1.0	I am very disapointed with these fart Bombs. I bought them to get back at a few friends and they dont even stink.....
5.0	Brains, WANT BRains! Yup, if you have heard these words before, no doubt you have battled zombies. I bought these to play with ZOMBIES the game. They are great where you need a number of different kinds of zombies to make the game interesting. They are plastic, and best of all cheap. Buy them. Give them as gifts and use your BRAINS...
1.0	Some of the finger holes are way too small. The shapes of the glove's fingers are wide at the top and narrow at the bottom to give it that cartoonish look but my 5y old struggles to get his fingers in...and his fingers are not large. Overall the gloves were a bit big and the finger openings were ridiculously small. NOT WORTH IT!
5.0	We have this bike in both navy and pink.  Our son started using his at around 20 months of age and has used it nearly every day for the last year and a half.  It has the lowest profile we have found for a balance bike and is very light weight. The tires are a hard foam and have held up well given the hard use on city streets and sidewalks.  Our daughter used her E-Z Rider 10 bike (pink) for around a year before transitioning to a pedal bike.  She was able to start riding her pedal bike in under an hour of practice at age 4 so I give this bike A LOT of credit in teaching kids the proper balancing techniques to prepare for bike riding.
5.0	I don't know what everyone is complaining about this awesome car. Because i got mine, i put batteries in and i tested its endurance. I thought it was going to break in like five minutes and it's been lasting for like a week or 2. My dad step on it, my grandpa step on it, my tried to kill it. So i think its a great product. Especially the price. Also how fast it got here it took like 2 days.
5.0	Nice look, and chessx quality.
5.0	I purchased this car for my son's 1st birthday and he loves being in it. I had researched these types of cars for a while since I wanted to get the best one for our son and this one seemed to be the best. Yes, this car does need a seat belt for the children, but on the same note, I just tell my son to sit down and he has no problems.  My son loves the buttons and all of the gadgets to push and pull.  I love the idea of the floor board and the handle coming out when they are older. I would recommend this product to all of my friend.
5.0	"I just bought this Lego for my 10 year old son.  He loves it.  He has already made a few different things such as the robot, the car and what I call the bug.  He says that it is the \\""the coolest and best Lego\\"" he has ever had.  I would definitely recommend to ages 8+; even though the box says 7+ in age. It would be a little much for any child under 8."
5.0	I love to collect cabbage patch kids, so I ordered this one. I bought her for $50. I usually think that's expensive for a doll, but her cuteness beats the price. Her bottle and pacifier fits perfectly in her mouth, and will stay there until you take them out. On her birth certificate, it has her name, birthday, thumbprints, footprints, and an oath of adoption. Her head is scented like vanilla, and that's all you can smell when you open her box. Her smell starts to slowly fade, but lasts a couple of years. Her head is made of hard plastic, and her body is made of a soft, sponge like material, with just the right amount of stuffing inside. Her hat fits perfectly on her head. This doll is a little more expensive than most cabbage patch kids, but she is cute and soft and is easy to hug, and I would suggest buying her.
5.0	Lovely Toy, well made and arrived in plenty of time for Christmas......and I had one happy Granddaughter she loved it.
5.0	This by far is Bruder's Best backhoe loader they have made yet it's much more solid than the 4CX it's slightly larger and it Paxmore of a punch. I had to wait forever for it to get here though. I did my first field test with it yesterday and it really got the job done! Here are the things I love about this backhoe The cab doors open but not only that the back windshield also opens so you can put an operator in there without having to try to cram the figure into the cab. Another thing about this backhoe is when you get it in the box it doesn't come completely assembled you have to assemble it just a little bit, but the good news is this is a very easy thing to do. All you need to do is make sure that the round pieces on the back excavator fit in the little round holes and it will click in like a dream. So here are some direct comparison things that compare it to the other large backhoe loader Bruder makes. First of all The front loader bucket is a bit larger and slightly more straight, The second thing The 4CX had a little problem with it's out rigors they wouldn't stay down so what would happen would be you were digging and then all of a sudden the outriggers would go up without warning and cause the machine to flip over. The good news is that this will not happen with this machine! And here's the final and best thing about the new 5CX versus the 4CX You get for extra inches of reachthere's only one little tiny problem that I found with this machine that is do not push the bucket too hard when you have a load in it because it will close but you need to make Sure that you close the bucket the proper way because the little cable underneath will snap out of place as well as the U joint will mess up to but the good news is that is also very easy to fix all you would need to do in that situation would be popped the U joint off but you don't have to take it completely off of the Backhoe and then you just need to line up the underside cable with the bucket and snap that into the piece that's underneath it and then the top piece where you popped the U joint off of can then be reinstalled by snapping it back onto it another interesting thing about this backhoe is that you can actually slide the top piece out and a sunroof is revealed
5.0	My grandchild loves it .....it is make very well.  Would order more of them if they make them, would order again
5.0	my 2 years old son loves it. the feature is like a real bus in NYC, and the doors are open-closed. it's awesome!
5.0	Got as a gift for a friend's child.  Liked it so much I bought another to give to Children's Home Society, as they have a problem finding enough African American baby dolls.  This one is very cute.
5.0	We have this little toy for our grandson and he absolutely loves it!  It is reserved exclusively for diaper changing time, practically eliminating the squirming and rolling around that a one year old does when your trying to change them!  Wouldn't want to be without it!!!
5.0	Ordered it ...it came ....kid loved it!!:~)  What else can I say? Really..What else is there to say. Please, now I know why I don't leave reviews!
5.0	My son loves all the carnivores.  This is a toy that he plays with quite a bit and didn't seem to be bored with after only a few days.  The T-Rex can be found in local stores now so don't do what I did and pay way too much for it online.  They cost $[...].
5.0	This is a very sturdy wheelbarrow that is just the right size for children! All my children (ages 1, 6, & 9 ) love playing with this!
5.0	Worked exactly as it should, very satisfied!
5.0	Great game for the adults to get together and enjoy an evening of entertainment and friendship with a lot of laughter!
5.0	Very soft and bigger than I expected!  Purchased as a Christmas present for my son and one for my nephew.  Definitely for a boy or a girl.  Pretty cool toy when you wanna get a few laughs!
5.0	The figures were perfect and used for a baby shower with the spStar Wars theme!
5.0	Really cool toy! My son is 3 and he loves it!
1.0	Very poor quality! Beads bled on clothing. Will not purchase again.
1.0	I'm disappointed because my sons chess bag was torn at the seams.  When i got this one I was so excited that i threw his old one out.  The second day the bag ripped at the handle seam AGAIN.  It is poorly made and he is carrying around this ripped one because I do not have the time or patience to do it all over again. The bag looks hefty and would be great if they used superior stitching but it must be hand sewn because it cannot support the weight of the heavy roll up chess silicone and weighted chess set.
5.0	Was here in time for Christmas and made a great gift for the person who received it, not only was her favorite but completed her Supernatural collection.
1.0	These are cheaply made and what I consider to be a hazard because the beads are threaded through elastic and very simply tied together. Obviously they are made for children which increases the possibility of an accident.
5.0	Awesome learning tool!! My kids love it and I love that they can practice learning money without touching dirty currency. Would recommend to anyone.
5.0	Granddaughter loved it!
5.0	Card arrived in wonderful condition. An ultra-rare card from the ZTIN series, just as described.
5.0	Bought this to decorate my daughters birthday cake, but we moved during this time and was in storage so it wasn't used for it's intended purpose. However, we use it now as an Ice cube tray and everyone just loves them. It's a cute little surprise and my daughter always asks for Batman ice in her drinks. I would love to buy some more!
5.0	If you have the second set of Andromeda trading cards,then you must add this card to your collection-I have it in my collection and it is a perfect companion card to ARC-UK!
5.0	These dishes rock. Seriously - my daughter has played with them every single day since she got them a week before Christmas. She loves them, and so does her 7-year-old brother (I think he plays with them *almost* as much as she does!).<br /><br />They are very sturdy and look quite nice. They've been stepped on, moved from our house to grandma's and back, thrown around (literally) and they still look wonderful. They should stand up to years of continual use...and I like that they are made of recycled products and are food-safe (for those little ones who like to actually put real food on their play dishes;). Another bonus? They are made right here in the U.S. I can feel good about letting my kids play with these and I certainly enjoy watching the hours of fun play they've had so far (I think every stuffed animal in the house has had a dinner/tea party with my 2-year-old daughter). Daddy has had his share as well...<br /><br />I highly recommend this set, as well as the tea set that Green Toys also makes. The dishes are very high-quality and durable, and look quite nice.
5.0	Great item fast service
5.0	I love this stuffed animal. It was purchased because my daughter wanted a real yorkie for Christmas and we could not afford the cost. It is beautiful and she has named it Journey (which is what she would have named a real one)  I accidentally ordered 2 of these and emailed the seller -AllPlush- who told me to return to sender, package refused. This was done immediately but I still have not gotten my credit back for this item purchased. I feel I should have received this credit long before now. It has been almost a month!
1.0	Legs broke off the days the kids started playing with it... Worst made Pop ever.
5.0	Great toy! My children enjoy it very much.
5.0	These T.S. Shure magnetic doll sets are a wonderful value.  They are very sturdy and provide hours of fun for little girls.  The price is just right for a birthday present that will not break the bank and they are a very good quality for the money.  I have several of them for my 6 year old who plays with them a lot. And, as for me, I love the way they can be packed back into their plastic carrier which keeps the pieces together and doesn't take up much room on the toy shelf.  We own several sets and have bought more as birthday presents.  This one includes a horse which is an added bonus for any animal loving little girl. I have not seen these in a store and am happy to have discovered them here.
1.0	Item too small. It is not what it looks like in the picture. It is just a cover with an open sole that is very small. Won't cover a child's shoe.
5.0	The Star Wars Child Boba Fett costume was great. It was exactly what we were looking for. The size was perfect too.
5.0	Cool card this card is great and it also has a great effect. You need Kazejin and Suijin to special Gate Guardian. It's really sick. Buy them and you'll enjoy them.
5.0	Absolutely love this lacing toy and so does my 21 month old granddaughter. I was looking for something that would teach her a new skill and really grab her interest and this is perfect. She's fascinated by it. It's not difficult to use at all because it laces via a nice sturdy wooden handle/needle and the holes in the wooden vehicles are big enough that the lacing goes very smoothly. There's a good healthy challenge element to it, too. She hasn't completely mastered it yet- it keeps her guessing and cocking her head to one side as she figures it out. She'll be playing with it for a while, I think. I chose this particular lacing toy (I think the company has several types with different objects to lace) because my granddaughter loves cars & trucks & buses, etc. There is a lovely variety of vehicles on this including a taxi cab, school bus, ambulance, ice cream truck, etc. She really loves it and when she's not lacing it, she plays with the little vehicles on the floor. Really great toy that teaches an important skill in an imaginative, fun fashion. And I love that it's challenging.
5.0	Tons of fun!  Everyone from age 7 to 42 (ahem) loved this toy... who would not love a catapult anyway?
5.0	Bought as a gift for my Corgi-loving wife. I was worried that it might be a bit deformed since it came packaged tightly like a ball in a bag, but it looks exactly as advertised and my wife loves it! Very cute and soft.
5.0	Definitely a must have game for parties and gatherings! I played this game recently with my family and this game was so much fun - we laughed the whole time.  This game is a timed, quick thinking, word-phrase game. Great ice-breaker and overall a good time!
5.0	Bought this as a gift for my two year old niece and it is a WONDERFUL toy!  Unfortunately, my brother bought her the same exact one so, I had to return it.  However, she really loves it and the return was also very quick and easy.
1.0	Received the bag, balloons, cups, napkins and plates - and everything was printed ugly. Colors were off, print and colors did not match, colors of eyes were beside the actual eyes so everything looked weird. So disappointed.
5.0	Perfect for cosplaying
5.0	My twin boys needed to learn the capitals of the states in school. I got this flash cards to help them and they are great. It comes with 2 sets 1 that shows the state map and capital and the 2nd set it gives you interesting facts and flags for each state.<br />Great purchase, I definitely recommended for moms with kids in school.
5.0	AAA+SELLER. SUPER FAST SHIPPING. ITEM AS DESCRIBED. THANKS
5.0	It was very cool and it was so awesome! And I really love the glasses so much so niceeee! ;)
5.0	What a fun, terrific product!!!!!! I was a little weary on ordering them, but was completely pleased! My kids LOVED them!  Ordering more for a party coming up!!!!!
1.0	The Jokers arms were on backwards. His shirt and jacket were printed on the back of the torso with the arms facing forwards. Since the Joker is only available in the larger more expensive sets coupled with the fact that getting the Joker for my 3 year old was the only reason I ordered the set in the first place, needless to say I was kinda bummed out with the product. Its really not a huge deal I know, but my son is sharp as a tack and doesn't miss a beat, it took him all of about two seconds to point out it wasn't right and all of about 2 days badgering me with questions about why the Joker put his clothes on backwards to which I responded that the Joker had a little bit to much to drink the day before at  the Bat Bar and that's why he should never hang out in seedy dive bars drinking when he gets older. True story. I wish I had 2 more hands so I could give it 4 thumbs down.
5.0	My Granddaughter loves it!!!!!!
5.0	I bought this game for my 9 year old niece.  She loves science, robotics and absolutely loves Mindflex Duel Game.
5.0	My 8 year old niece loved the doll! She's totally into Monster High and wants to collect all of these dolls.
5.0	His name is Shrapnel. Hasbro somehow lost the rights to his original name. He is an Decepticon insecticon who transforms into a stag beetle. I used to own the original but I didn't take good care of it. There's really only two versions of the G1 character. The 1985 and this. I actually find this version to be better than the original. Shrapnel comes with a mini con named Reflector who is also remold of Viewfinder. Reflector is a camera who transforms into a grenade launcher for Shrapnel to hold. Transforming him from insect to robot is easy but transforming him back is a little tricky with the legs. He can pose just fine. The arms and legs have joints to bend and move.<br /><br />I recommend Skrapnel aka Shrapnel to transformer fans. Buy Bombshell as well. Hopefully Hasbro will release the rest of the Insecticons in the future.
5.0	My 3yr old loves this toy. Worth every penny!
5.0	Great piñata !  Held a lot of candy and took a while to bust open so everyone got a few turns in
5.0	Bought this for my five year old who decided he wanted a blue teddy bear. He takes it everywhere. We have washed it and air dried a few times and it is holding up well. The ribbon is very patriotic and not so easy to take off; we left it on. So...his name is American Man Bear.
1.0	I can't stress this enough.<br /><br />I am a professional drone photographer, and like many of you I am always seeking for ways to make my drone fly longer and be more stable in unpredictable winds. I bought these blades hoping they would help me in both departments, and even though I've read some bad reviews, I figured people just didn't know how to balance these and thats why they're having problems. I have a custom balancing system so I should be OK, right? WRONG!<br /><br />I was flying out in Ocotillo Wells this weekend, when all of a sudden the drone started losing control (at about 100' up) and heading straight down towards some boulders. I was able to slide the ailing drone to a slightly softer sand area as it was tumbling down, and luckily crashed it upside down, so the 3+ black and the Zenmuse were unharmed. Upon inspecting the props, I came to find that one prop was simply coming apart at the seams next to the shaft. How lucky I am that this disaster only cost me $25 worth of props and not my GoPro, my Gimbal or even worst! I cleaned up the sand from the motors, threw on my trusty OEM props and continued filming all day. You may NOT be so lucky. These are made very poorly with lots of weak spots. PLEASE, for your sake and for the safety of those watching you fly, DO NOT use these props. I am attaching a picture of the splitting prop, and I may also upload the video of the crash when I get to it. I am also going to re-post this review on each seller who is offering this product, because never mind the fact I will be saving countless drones....I may also be saving someones face or hand or life by urging you avoid this horrid excuse for propellers.
1.0	When this product arrived I was shocked...the plastic was completely scratched, marked up, beaten up.  It looked very used and like it had been kicked around quite a bit.  Definitely not worth the $98 I spent on it....worth more like $5. I even double checked and the tag said 'new'.  I can't understand how a seller can actually send out merchandise in such condition, label it as 'new', and accept nearly $100 for it.  Buyer beware.
5.0	This great little instrument is well made simple fun.  It's brightly colored with a wonderful joyful sound that has brought many smiles into my home.  It arrived very fast and has sheet music available.  What more could you ask for?
5.0	an eight year old boy and his brother loved all the pieces and what they were able to do with them
5.0	This deck is amazing. I just love it.
5.0	These ice cream cones are so cute!  Our granddaughter loves playing ice cream store with them.  They are well made and have provided hours of fun.
5.0	It's a game you can't pass up! For a party or just to get your family and friends together, this game will do it!
5.0	My husband likes his new hobby.  This helicopter is louder than his single prop one.  He can &#34;save the world&#34; for 7 minutes.
5.0	Being a deployed troop, double bunked in a 10x10 room can be really crowded with no personal space out privacy. This bed tent makes all the difference. It's easy to put together and the darker color even blocks out a little bit of light. It does get a little warm in here so I leave a small opening in one side of the zipper or put my fan inside (small 5in) inside at the foot of my bed to keep it cool. Definitely worth the money since in a deployed location, you can't put a price on privacy. I would definitely buy again. If I were the manufacturers, I would think about selling these in base exchanges in deployed locations.
5.0	I purchased a WL V911 4 CH Single Rotor Helicopter and went ahead and got these spare parts and I am really impressed with how much you get for the price.  I have not needed to use them yet but I like knowing I have them for when I do.
5.0	Just the right length and works well
1.0	Our 6 years old son did not play the game after opening the box since it is hard to understand and not exciting.
5.0	"These are adorable little fairies. They are unlike any of the current Barbie doll family (they are almost the same height as Stacey, but they have \\""ballerina\\"" feet, so they can't stand alone. It's a good thing they come with a strong, sturdy stand! Their face sculpts are really pleasing, and their colors (hair, clothing & body paint) all blend together nicely.  For a Barbie \\""purist\\"", this might not be your thing. But, if you love dolls of all sorts, and love fairies of all sorts (especially Brian Froud- these are similar to his works, but in 3-D!), then these little darlings are for you!<br /><br />Also, since there are two dolls in the one package (both can be held by the stand at the same time), little ones can play together and SHARE the dolls.  The dolls themselves seem to be pretty sturdy. I'm not a 5-year-old, so I don't know what sort of wear & tear a child would put on these, but they seem reasonably well made.<br /><br />Overall, I gave this set of dolls 5 Stars.  I have one set, and am thinking about buying another just because they are so cute!  With their little arms outstretched with their hands up with the palm facing out, they are like little sentries for the gateway to Fairytopia :D<br /><br />I hope this review has helped you :D<br /><br />>^..^&lt;"
5.0	Awesome and sturdy, plenty of room for four people. Love the net center to cool off your feet . Built to take climbing in and out as has a sturdy ladder. Great to drift off the beach and relax.
1.0	Beautiful ball that doesn't hold air.
1.0	Was not satisfied they were melted when w receive the,  we place them in freezer over night.  My Granddaughter open them the next morning. before she could unwrap one it was melting in her hand..  I purchased these for her birthday she is very disappointed and so am I.
5.0	My baby loves it and so do I
5.0	It was a gift for my grand daughter she loved it. The quality of the bag is nice. It comes with a nice outer bag
1.0	Neither of our 2 children have hurt themselves on this, mostly because as soon as they drag it out, my husband makes them put it back. Why, you ask? Because this thing is REALLY, REALLY LOUD!!! Save your sanity and skip this one.
1.0	I assumed these would be of a stretchy material that would accommodate a variety of child's hand sizes.  They are not. They are very thin, non-stretchy nylon and the fingers are freakishly short.  My daughter couldn't pull them onto her hands. When her fingers had reached the tips of the gloves, the material in between each finger was a couple of inches away from her hand, making them extremely uncomfortable.  I can't imaging anyone but a toddler being able to wear these successfully. The cost of mailing them back isn't worth it, so these go straight into the donation bin and I have to buy another pair of skeleton gloves.
5.0	My swim Team kids absolutely loved them.  Great quality and even better price !!!!!  Will be ordering more soon for other club events.
5.0	Very Pleased, Great Service. Thank You
1.0	Bought this game for my sister who was travelling.  I recently visited her and find that this game in the Vegas mode will allow about 1 win in 100 - 1%.  The satisfaction of getting the game to a win is exceedingly low.<br />This version is not as good as the original, which allowed a much more frequent game play / win ratio.  Overall the bells and whistles added to this new edition to enhance it, are no compensation for the lack of wins.<br />A big disappointment over the original which was a lot more fun to play.
5.0	Purchased for great nephew and he loved it!!
5.0	Great just what she wanted
5.0	One of my favorite LEGO sets!  It's awesome!  Make sure you get one!
5.0	Awesome value for crafting
5.0	Great product, very happy
5.0	I bought this Precision Gyroscope for a 6 year old boy.  The very first thing I did was to lube the bearings with a light weight oil. ( 3 and 1 )  The balance, construction and performance are excellent .  The gyro would spin for over 4 min. and the rack and pinion pull strip makes it easy for a child to spin up the gyro.  Not only was the child fascinated by the gravity defying actions, the gyro sparked an intellectual discussion about Torque, Angular momentum and Gyroscopic precession among the adults.  My advice is to get more than one of this fun, educational toy.
5.0	This Radio Flyer is great, just as I remembered when I was a kid pulling my wagon everywhere I went. And later pulling behind my bike like a truck and trailer, these were good times. Know almost 35 years later it was time to get another wagon to help me around yard and for hauling all the stuff to the beach and the park. And is also a fun project to customize.
5.0	These are so much fun - my grandkids loved them.  So worth the price.<br />There were enough for two kids to share.
5.0	Puzzle is colorful, challenging and fun.  Great value for the money.<br /><br />....My only isssue, as I have read from other reviewers, from time to time, there is 1-2 pieces missing!<br /><br />I will attempt to inform Amazon of this.  If anyone know how to report this, please post or reply.  Thank you!
5.0	I purchased the Chipmunks for my four year old grandson.  He loves them!
5.0	My two-year-old grandson loves this plush toy set. He's a precocious kid and an enthusiastic Thomas the Tank Engine fan. His parents read Thomas books to him, so he knows the names of all of Thomas' friends, but he was sleeping with the books and with metal Thomas toys. Now he can go to bed with these soft, sized-for-toddlers plush toys. The toys are sturdily constructed and well-detailed. We wanted a toy that didn't make noise or attempt to 'educate' our grandson with Q&A sessions, bells, whistles, flashing lights or other displays. He gets plenty of stimulation from the world around him and it seems to me that a lot of the 'noisy toys' (as we call them) can overstimulate a child and reduce his attention span to that of a gnat. Our grandson loves these 'quiet' toys and spends long periods of time inventing stories and situations for his new, plush friends.
5.0	Gimli is awesome! Nice size and so far, seems durable on my key ring.  I want to check and see if they have Gandalf!
5.0	Super cute. My daughter loves it
5.0	Great quality stickers. Stick well and do not peel off on their own. Kids loved them and had fun using them.
5.0	the kids loved these little golf erasers in their goodie bags. They had played miniature golf for my son's birthday party. Arrived on time and in good condition.
1.0	I bought this coz it looks cute, but when I got it, it's really tinny.<br />It looks like a $0.25 item to me. This is the First time give out 1 star for anything I bought, consider I shop about 2-3 times per week for the past 5 years.
5.0	My son was thrilled receiving this for Christmas. It is very well thought out and made like all Legos. Would recommend.
5.0	My daughter needed the costume for a school project and ended up wearing it for halloween too.  It is typical costume weight, not the most durable thing in the world but she wore it 5 or six times to different events and still has it to play dress up in.  She even one 1st place in a costume contest in it.  I purchased her normal/average size and it fit well, with room to wear a layer underneath on a cold halloween night.
5.0	My grandson loves the book<br /> shelf. The purchase was a good one and it is made well. I would recommend  the product to anyone with a grandson.
5.0	My 2 year old loves these colorful letters.  He is past the stage of putting things in his mouth, so we haven't had the issue that some other reviewers have had with the paper coming off.  They stick very well and are of a good size.  I highly recommend these over the ones I had as a kid--cheap, lightweight plastic letters with a tiny magnet in the back that popped out and didn't properly hold the letters the right side up.
5.0	Have two which were shared by the family. One broke but will probably buy another to replace it. These are so great to lounge on in our above ground pool.
5.0	The little one loves this!
5.0	ALWAYS WANTED A BIG PUSSYCAT FOR A PET..THIS ONE FITS THE BILL...AND I DON'T HAVE TO FEED OR WALK HIM...PURRR!
1.0	Do not buy this...horrible quality. The poles that hold this up punctured throught the bottom within a couple days. Then the ties that hold the poles broke away from the tent and I've had to throw it away...after ONE WEEK! Very disappointing.
5.0	Just received this pool for my 6 year old son and we absolutely love it!  The floor of the pool inflates which is a big plus right there, as it makes draining the pool sooooooo easy.  I used to wrestle with the old pool from last year, every night - it took me a good 30 mins to drain the big rectangle monster, had to prop end of pool to get water out and then start bailing with a bucket.  NOT this pool - you just pull the floor plug and all the water drains by itself.  My son enjoys this pool as well - just getting in to cool off with all of his pool toys - he has a grand old time.  Great pool for kids and easy maintenance for parents.
1.0	"A good concept, but the execution is flawed.  The fish is sufficiently life-like, but its movements aren't:  too much \\""swimming in place\\"" followed by odd bursts of frantic motion.  Calm, leisurely lapping of the bowl, or simple zig-zagging, would be much better.  The colored-light show is just too disco; no light (which would save on the batteries) or just white light would be better.  Contrary to the product description, batteries (necessary unless you find a 6v500ma DC adapter) weren't included, nor mentioned on the box or in the instructions.  And why limit movement to a choice of only 30 seconds, 90 seconds, or 5 minutes?  Adapter users would probably prefer to be able to run continuously.  Finally, the ticking of the motor is a tad too loud for quiet environments.  I'll give it one star just because it's better than condemning a real fish to the inevitable early death inside a goldfish bowl.<br /><br />UPDATE:  Oddly, the fish now swims only in a constant circle (and never shuts off), apparently because the batteries are giving out, which actually seems more lifelike, except the LED is also stuck constantly flashing red (I guess to warn about the batteries, although the fish has now been swimming constantly for hours).  All in all, the designers have provided a very strange combination of modes."
1.0	its not even musical, the hello kitty is backwards & I should have returned it.  a waste, dont buy it unless you can find it cheaper than $10.. like someone else mentioned about $7 @ walmart.  again, very disappointed in this rip off.
5.0	Great cube. Stickerless cubes are a good choice. Moves fast, no locking...
5.0	Perfect. Arrived quickly. Grandson loved them
5.0	Leela was made a lot thinner than Fry and Bender (even though she supposedly has more meat than a cow) and as a result, she's a bit harder to stand up straight.. Adorable regardless.
5.0	My granddaughter loves it....great quality so far!
1.0	This toy was NOT A CLOWN FISH! It was a cheap rubber fadded bluish blob! My cild was very dissapointed and I will never buy from this company again! I do not reccomend at all!What a rip off!
1.0	How disappointing this purchase was.  Removed from the box and the leg fell off.  I tried to re-attach but everytime the robot would turn it would fall off.  Not only was it frustrating it was dangerous as the robot fell hard and could have hurt a child playing with it.  Also, the voice commands don't work AT ALL.  It is not user friendly for a child or adult for that matter.
5.0	My daughter has about 14 of these catridges. I appreciate how they all teach different things at a reasonable price.
1.0	I own several of the other PlayArt figures and this one appears to be the worst in terms of quality.  Her arm broke right off when almost no force was applied.  The plastic is super cheap and not sturdy at all.  Her left leg is also incredibly loose and refuses to remain in its socket.  Furthermore, the hands are practically glued on to her arms.  You need to pull real hard with a tool to get them out.<br /><br />Sure, the paint job on this is nice, but other than this figure is a huge disappointment for a $50 figure.<br /><br />Unless you're looking for a collection of limbs, then I suggest you avoid getting this figure online and getting it somewhere in person so that you can inspect the QC before buying.
5.0	This Post is for All the Posters they are Wonderful Great Items. Thank You
5.0	"As a mother to daughters ages 2 and 4, I know all too well about difficult bedtimes.  When I learned about Shnoozles I had hope.  I love the Shnoozles back-to-basics approach to bedtimes.  The big, bright eyes are a hit with the kiddos and they all loved that you could pull out the eyelid and make the Schnoozle \\""sleep\\"" when it was bed time, just like themselves. The book that accompanies each Schnoozle is super cute!  The entire plush is soft and cuddly and I feel that bedtime issues or not, this would be a welcomed addition to any child's room. If you have a child that is going through some bedtime difficulties, I strongly recommend that you try this product!"
5.0	We have had so much fun playing this game. We are all different ages including an 8 year old and we have so much fun yelling and trying to beat each other, all in the name of fun, of course!
5.0	My 2 year old daughter got this slide as a gift from her grandmother and LOVES it!  It's easy to set up, fold up and is very sturdy.  I was worried at first that it may be too big for her, but it was just the right size and it'll last for a few years.  We've used it on our deck as well, and we've also put it so she can slide into her wading pool.  Overall, it's great, well made, high quality product.  I highly recommend it.
5.0	the leap frog touch magic counting train is a great way to introduce kids to numbers, it teaches you how to count and it will ask you to find the picture with the correct number so it gets your little ones engage and counting on there on.
5.0	These wall decals were the perfect touch to our 2 year olds tractor themed room.  He loves pointing out all the tractors on his walls.  They hold up great-we put them up in our old house then we moved and I wanted to try and transfer them to his new room and to my surprise they peeled right off no problems and I put them up in his new room and they never lost their adhesiveness.
1.0	I ended up returning this item because I found something better and cheaper, but the case looked pretty cool and it was very light weight and I'm sure it would have worked just fine.
5.0	There are 2 similar Stampede trucks.  Both are awesome, fast & fun and run for about 20 minutes run time on a full charge. The one I bought was around $225.00 & is a 4 x 2 with standard electric motor & came complete ready to charge it up and run it. (RTR) It is FAST... about 30 mph.  Traxxas are the best because:<br /><br />Super tough<br />easy to upgrade & replace parts<br />water proof / should &#34;read&#34;water resistant<br />radios & good quality<br />these arrive fully assembled & RTR (just charge & ready to go) I suggest buying a better charger.<br />Great for the price<br />They really don't compare to other similar priced trucks, these are far superior in every way for a beginner.<br />Great warranty<br /><br />The other stampede is 4 x 4 & I think have brush-less motor.  This model is twice as fast & a longer battery & 4 x 4.  These cost about $340.00USD.<br /><br />Another thing that makes Traxxas the best, there are tons of accessories to add-on later & fixing broken parts is easy.<br /><br />Have fun!
5.0	The price was fair and the shippment came on time. The product was as advertised. I would use again. Thanks for everything.
5.0	My granddaughter has three mice now from Folkmanis<br />Believe it or not they are her favorites.  She got the first one when<br />she just turned 3 and she is now 6 and loves them just as much
5.0	It was better than expected ! Was expecting a thin cheap kinda plastic but it was like the really big party bouncers !! My son loves it !
5.0	My granddaughter just loved this thing. It was made very good.  I do not know what else to say about this item. do to the fact it is a kids toy
5.0	this will make your car lighter and if you go to youtube and search hpi bliz mods 101 #15 shows you how to make it look relay cool
5.0	I love the trunk and versatility of the wagon.
5.0	This was great! Thank you so much for the keychain.  It was just what my sister-in-law wanted. Have a great day!
1.0	olny gives u 1 PACK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! SO LAME GOT IT SURPISED THAT IT TOOK 1 WEEK FOR 1 PACK SERIOSLEY CRUDY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5.0	We purchased this along with the Leapster for Christmas this year and I was so glad I did!  Instead of going through countless batteries, you just insert the large battery pack and it can be played on while charging.  The only mistake I made with this is I hadn't charged it before giving it to my daughter and when she wasn't able to play with it right away (we didn't have any batteries left in the house) she lost total interest in it because she had no idea what it did.  So if you buy this as a present for a child, put the battery charger in and charge it before giving it to them.  It took all of Christmas morning to charge!
5.0	I was skeptical of this 50-pack because of the price compared to other sets.  But inside there were 50 individually packaged Hot Wheel cars of all sorts.
5.0	The display case exceded my expectations. The Cherry finish looks great and like the adjustable shelves.<br />I recommend this product and would order again.
5.0	Very cute,  came before the delivery date. My grandson loved it.
1.0	This product came in a plastic bag and it was obvious it was a &#34;used&#34; item.  The animal is suppose to talk when you press its paw, it does &#34;NOTHING&#34;.  I purchased this for my granddaughter out of state and my daughter threw away the packing slip and gave them to my granddaughter to play with.  Will never, ever purchase from this vendor again!  Amazon should stop using vendors who send out &#34;used&#34; products and sell them as new!  False advertising is Illegal!!!
5.0	My daughter received this rhino from her aunt as a gift. She is so in love with it as are we all. Very cute and cuddly. There is a crisis if its missing at bedtime. :)
1.0	This worthless medallion came without a  clasp and was practically a choker around my neck. I would LOVE to get my money back.  I tried to give it zero stars, but the site wouldn't let me.
5.0	It's a gift and we haven't put it together yet, but it looks as described and arrived promptly.
5.0	fun game. It should have come with more than one ring.
1.0	Is this really necessary?<br />Assault rifles are what kill our brothers and sisters in our military!  Lets be a dumb azz parent and watch cnn and isis while our kids our playing with these stupid guns!
5.0	I love this product! Super-fun for children ages 2-3 years! It has great sound effects and the child it was bought for, loves it!
5.0	I’m so in love with this!! My son literally bounces around the house with this bouncing smiley blue ball. Its made wonderfully and is inexpensive as well. Compared to others we have owned, this is definitely the best one in my eyes. It's  wonderful!
5.0	We actually used this puppet on one of the deer forms you see at Christamas and made a Pegusus-unicorn statue with it.  The eyes on this puppet are so real, it is really awsome.  Would definately buy from this dealer again.
5.0	got here on time. l  my child loves it.
5.0	I've been a Scrabble fan for years, and you can't beat the convenience of this board! hold the tiles in place so they don't slide all over, and turns easily to face each player. Curved tile holders help a bit in preventing those wandering eyes from getting a glimpse of your tiles too.
5.0	The produce arrived in perfect condition and was as pictured.  Great fun for the kids.  I would purchase again and highly recommend product.
1.0	We did not receive the one pictured here. We got a much cheaper version with just the domino like mask held on by a thin elastic around the back of the head. The costume itself was fine as most thin one piece ones are, but since we bought it mainly for the full head mask as shown, my boys were pretty angry.
5.0	my 3 year old girl loved it!  very safe and stable to ride and easy to carry.  highly recommend.
5.0	These cigars were purchased for a stage play.  Although theatres allow the smoking of herbal cigarettes, we could not find herbal cigars  and the play required cigars which appeared to be real and burning . The fake cigars worked extremely well and lasted long enough that we have some left for any future productions.  In addition we needed fast shipping and the company was extremely helpful in this regard.  I certainly would recommend them highly.
5.0	I got this item as a gift for a family member and it was built and displayed on a TV console table in our living room.  It often catches people's eye...each time followed by a compliment. :)
5.0	I ordered this for my Grandson's first birthday which was Saturday. It was a hit. He loved it as did his parents. Very nice product. We are extremly pleased.
1.0	BEWARE of &#34;shipped from overseas&#34; - those are Knock offs! Could be dangerous for your kids. Make sure your item has a UPC and manufacturer's address on the package.
5.0	High quality.  Beautifully hand painted.
5.0	This has been a favorite of my grandchildren...lots of noise and things to keep them busy for quite a while.
5.0	my granddaughter will love it
5.0	Great quality for this doll's western outfit.  The boots are the same western white cowgirl boots sold seperately.  I thought it was a good deal to include the white boots.
1.0	Avoid since wire construction (ALUMINIUM clad in a little copper, or solid copper) is not disclosed
5.0	It seems to be a bit more challenging than the Friend Lego set we also purchased. The girls love it. Perfect set!
1.0	the batteries die right away and its glitchy any little hit and they turn off having to turn them on every time
1.0	Poor quality, Extra Small size and very expensive.<br /><br />Not recommended at all.
5.0	The rubber inner tube is durable and you can cut the small strap as your child can become more independent or ready to feel confidence in swimming. It should last one summer or longer.
5.0	"This is a very challenging game - at times frustrating for my 6-year-old - but a great \\""brain workout.\\""  My husband and I enjoy playing it with her, and find ourselves challenged as well!  The bright colors and different, interesting shapes are very engaging. Highly recommend."
1.0	I brought this for my nephew. The first time he loaded it and shot it it worked great. He loved it. However, after that first time the gun has stopped working. It misfires so he spends the majority of his time reopening it to pull out darts that are jammed in there. I would not recommend purchasing this.
5.0	It's so. Darn. Squishy! I love it!!<br />The material's quite soft and nice too.
5.0	Awesome receiver! Fits perfect in my mini quads and ACCST has amazing range. I just wanted to add I didnt pay $75 for the Rx. Thats not the correct price!
5.0	These are awesome. Perfect size for sensory activities, seem very well made (especially when I accidentally step on them with bare feet), and there are lots of them in the bag. The name of each dinosaur is marked, which is very helpful.
5.0	This was a good Christmas present - meaning that it kept his interest past the holiday season. He is 10 years old and when he first asked for it, I thought he was way too old for it, but that did not turn out to be the case.  His cousin told him it was cool also.
5.0	Seven Wonders is an absolutely fantastic board/card game!  I'm completely addicted, and that's saying something since I'm normally not a gamer.    If you're a casual gamer, don't be intimidated by its rulebook - it will suck you in once you try it out.  I was hooked after two games.  If you are a hardcore gamer, it's complex enough to really enjoy.  The balance of play is perfect, in my opinion, and any perceived imbalances are leveled out by the Leaders expansion set (though this is definitely not required to enjoy).      We bought this game at our office, and we play at lunch at least twice a week.  Of course, we're a bunch of nerds, but it's crazy addictive.    Just trust me - you'll love it!
5.0	Love this little guy!! The eyes pop out one at a time or both!!  Great stress relief!!
5.0	With the intention to setup 2 lipo battery packs in parallel.
5.0	I love these adorable toy story color splash buddies for my grandchildren.
5.0	Great toy!!!!!!!! My 3 years old son loves it and he plays with it and his castle :)<br />I got this toy on Christmas and it is still not broken so good made :)
5.0	It is great. My son loves it. He sleep with it
5.0	"I got this as a gift for my 1 year old daughter. It is absolutley adorable! I love how you can place the hands over the eyes to play peek-a-boo, place them together or even stick her up on a magnetic surface. We also received the Posing Goliath that can \\""pose\\"" with JoJo. It's cute for any JoJo fan and also for little babies because of it's softness. Much better than the plain plush (which are REALLY small when seen in person!)."
5.0	Awesome set, good price!
5.0	excellent quality, held up extremely well...we filled up the balloon (with helium) on the day of the birthday party and it is 11 days  now that i am writing this review and the balloon is still holding up ...fresh like day 1.<br />our 2 yr old  daughter and her friends loved the huge, bright elmo presence at her birthday party!
5.0	I like so much, the product is very cute, recommended for children and collectors of all ages, of excellent quality
5.0	My son was very have to get this bc he couldn't fine the others. He had no complaint about it thus far.
5.0	This game was a hit at my house party.  It was geared towards the older children and adults.  It got crazy!!!!  I would recommend this game for a fun filled family game night!!!!!
5.0	I'm just amazed at the fact that this thing can actually fly!  However, it's not a simple matter of push the stick and watch it go so if you're not patient or want something that will fly 2 minutes after you get it then move on.  However, if you read the instructions, adjust the tail rotor as indicated in the instruction, and just practice hovering with easy movements then it will fly.  The flight forward is a constant pace too so don't expect to push a lever and it'll move forward, pull back and it'll move back.  However, that said, it's a fun toy and at 35 I'm enjoying it a lot.  At less than $30 I purchased a second one for my best friend to enjoy.  I've also had other friends recommend this to me as well!
5.0	"We got these for our son who we've started a nighttime routine of \\""puppets\\"" with his stuff animals.  Basically, the stuffed animals all have different personalities and ask him how his day was and interact.  We got these puppets to augment the experience and add a few new characters, and he loves them!  Very well made and easy enough for even him to give a try!"
5.0	These are so stinkin' cute it's hard to believe they are just balloons. Bought them for a coworker has a silly gag-gift and she liked them so much she held onto them until all the air was out and then re-filled with air! Multiple people stopped me after I filled them with air at the store asking where I got them. People turn heads as you walk by with these somewhat floating/walking pug balloons.
5.0	I bought this as a joke for my husband to take to the Office and everyone loves it.  Now the dogs want to play with it but I know it wouldn't hold up.  It actually does fly and scream!  Too funny!
5.0	This item was for my son and he was very happy with it. It was exactly what he thought it would be.
5.0	Item exactly as described, now if they only came with real cookies.
5.0	Beautiful, soft and safe for my 9 mon child.
5.0	Very happy with our purchase!
5.0	This dart launcher is really big, lightweight, functional, is a great replica, and arrived before Christmas for my kid. I am excited to see his joy when he receives this gift.
5.0	I ordered these so my children would have creative ways to tell stories before they start writing them. They love getting them out and setting their imaginations in motion.
5.0	Wonderful my baby loves it
1.0	it sucks.i can not get it to work.
5.0	Couldn't find locally. Good deal.
5.0	"I'm a huge fan of Christmas, Lego, and of Star Wars.  If you've never \\""done\\"" a Lego Advent Calendar, you're missing out.  This is the first one they've done in Star Wars.  If you don't mind the rather ridiculous Santa Yoda, and if you love the above like I do, you'll stay awake at night until you order this.       It looks great and I couldn't be happier...until December 1st when I start opening it with my kids!"
5.0	Great item! My son loved his costume!
5.0	My daughter enjoys wearing this every so often
5.0	This is a christmas present so my daughter will not see it until tomorrow, but it is everything i hoped and expected. thank you.
5.0	"Wow!, this figure is amazing! When I saw it, I knew I had to buy it. Not only does this come with the figure itself, but it comes with a little stand with the movie poster of \\""Nightmare On Elm Street\\"". To begin with, the entire Freddy figure has blood all over him. He has blood on his shirt, pants, and his boots. Freddy also comes with the \\""butter knifes\\"". The problem with those is that they are not very durable. The knifes can fall off. Freddy also comes with his trademark hat (which also has blood). When you take off Freddy's hat, it looks distgusting (I would not recommend you taking it off). Parts such as his head and hand are very detailed with burns and stuff like that. Excellent figure, and should be an instant buy for any horror fan or fan of Freddy."
5.0	I hadn't planned on getting my 5 year old an MP3 player this Christmas, but I am sure glad I did.  Her big sister took the disk and downloaded a few songs and that is all we have had to do.  She has figured the rest out herself.  She hasn't put it down.  It is very durable given that her little brother has picked it up and tossed it around a few times.  There isn't an off button, she just simply takes the headphones out.  This turnes it off.  The only thing I recommend is getting headphones for little ears.  The ones that came with it were great, she just didn't like the way they felt in her ears.  We also purchased headphones that didn't allow the volumn to loud.  Otherwise, this has been a great gift this year!
5.0	This is probably the best piece we bought for our daughter's train set. Trains can travel on the bridge and then through a cave where there's a surprise drop and then also travel underneath the bridge. While this feature makes it loads of fun  it also makes it hard to work into your existing setup, because it pretty much has to go in the middle of your set in order to use both the bridge and the underpass. There's also a talking feature that goes off every time a train with a magnet passes over it. I would recommend this toy, because I feel it's one of the best wooden train buildings currently on the market.
1.0	Came broken and unfortunately I was out of town and very busy. When I got to opening the game to play I was already passed my due date to return. I have played this game a few times at a friends it is a lot of fun....as long as it works :)
5.0	I chose this because this is so durable not cheap and bendable like other that I have bought....my baby loved it.Just the texture of the veg& fruits feel so real & strong...
5.0	My niece loves kitties. She loves this kitty, and takes it everywhere. The eyes are big and glittery.and the kitty is very plush. Washed well also. Just put in a  laundry bag or pillow case to protect the eyes as they will get scuffed.
5.0	The Barbie collection is beautiful. They look as much as possible like the characters and are dressed like them. I intend to get them all.
5.0	Purchased for grandchild.<br />Grandchild loves it.
1.0	Do not buy this one very fragile It do not last
5.0	Purchased this for my daughters birthday while I was deployed and my wife said it got there before her birthday, so it make is worth it to me!  She enjoys the animal sounds that it makes.
5.0	Very pleased with our purchase, the giraffe is just as described.  Will definitely order from here in the future
1.0	This item should really get 0 stars.  The item shipped is a knock off brand and is NOT what is pictured.  It is cheap and has plastic eyes.  This is FALSE ADVERTISING.
5.0	Oh my gosh this is huge! My 5 year old G-Son is going to love this. Pricey, but really three toys in one.
5.0	I have had this bookmark for ever andthe strings on the top are not fraying yet. the bookmark itself is not fading and is a very good quality itself
5.0	Really nice toy , great quality, thank you
1.0	The costume doesnt really look like toothless. The tail doesnt look right...and the wings WILL NOT stay in the fabric! We also bought a Gronkles costume and its the same way! For how much we pay for these Costumes you would think that they would put some quality into them! :(
5.0	Great price for these.
5.0	The Southern Belle Barbie Doll is a lovely doll dressed in traditional 1850's era gown.  This is a collector doll not really a toy.  I would suggest this doll for a collector or older child.
5.0	I got this product in a time and in great working order.
5.0	Grandchildren love these!!
5.0	I did a superhero cityscape theme in my sons room and this is the perfect nightlight to accent it.  Very realistic.
5.0	This tunnel is the most fun for kids when they can or can't go outside. They have loads of fun for hours. Delivered in a timely manner.
5.0	They're compact and don't get in the way (as awesome as the 35 dart drum is, it's too bulky to be practical most of the time). The mechanism seems to be a bit more fragile than the straightforward straight clips, but it hasn't been an issue so far.
5.0	Of course being Melissa & Doug toy this is wonderful quality which is number one reason I chose this toy.  While my 3 yr old son doesn't play with cars too much (more into trains) he plays with this a lot.  I think he likes that he can take it apart on his own.
5.0	Quick shipment and arrived pretty fast. We are using these for our wedding!
5.0	Perfect, my 3 year old girl loves it. For Xmas present it was perfect, now she sleeps with baby Ariel
5.0	I don't play the card game, I bought a couple of packs in hopes of getting a spectral tiger.  No luck, I do want to say that the cards are pretty cool and have very nice artwork.  If I wasn't so lazy, I would actually learn how to play the card game.  I'll stick to the video game for now though.
5.0	The balloon was exactly as pictured. It arrived promptly, was neatly packaged, and looked great once it was inflated. My 5 year old, who is a huge Sofia the First fan, was thrilled to have it for her birthday.
1.0	I too fell victim to the misleading headline, assuming I would get both guitars. I didn't read the fine print which is probably the point. So the cost was not worth the mistake. Bad headline = bad review.
5.0	These are the perfect size for my toddler.  He got a more boy type kitchen and likes to cook alongside mom, so he wanted some dishes.  It has salt and pepper shakers, cups and pitchers, as well as plates and silverware.  The pans are made to work with the Step2 kitchen sounds on the stove.
1.0	I have a daycare at home and every year the kids enjoy looking at the butterfly metamorphosis. for more than 5 years I order the cup from the main bran and ALWAYS got 5 butterflies out of the caterpillars I got in the mail. This year they were out of stock so I decided to buy this kind, but I regret it. All of them died  and now I have to order another set for the kids. Waste of money and time.
5.0	The title says it all. It's cute, sturdy, and holds money. It's so adorable I can't stop looking at it.
5.0	My granddaughter loves these little horsed and plays with them all the time she is collecting quit a heard with the small horses
5.0	Amazing card, especially against token decks and decks with a ton of beefy creatures. Use it to beat my friends battalion deck often and gets him mad every time.
5.0	This item does a good job of measuring variables I use for my R / C airplane flights. It is very accurate
5.0	My kids love it! Works really great!
5.0	"This big Thomas the Train puzzle is great.  My 3 year old grandson has not been a fan of puzzles for a while, but I thought I'd try this one for him, since he LOVES Thomas and the puzzle isn't the usual \\""wooden piece\\"" type that he is used to.  This puzzle was a hit!!  My grandson was so interested in seeing the picture that putting the pieces together was no problem for him.  He was impressed with the box and it captured his attention right away.  Although there is no guarantee that some pieces won't \\""go missing\\"" as is the case with most of our puzzles, at least the pieces of this puzzle are large enough to see easily and are sturdy enough to withstand a little \\""lost and found.\\""  I'm quite pleased with this puzzle and will consider purchasing the others in the  \\""Thomas\\"" series."
1.0	I was looking for tack for my 2 real live horses/ This item was in the grouping for real tack.<br />I was real supprised to receive a toy? I returned and ordered from Horse.com the real thing.
5.0	My son loves it. The size is just right for a 2 yr old kid. It is firm and no loose threads. The quality is very good.
5.0	Perfect for toddlers.
5.0	My kids love to play with these cars on the Kidoozie play set. They are 4 and 5 and are rough with the toys. They hold up well.
1.0	Wooden pieces split when breaking a part the numbers and letters from their other half
5.0	All of the  kids (12 in total) in the neighborhood loves this toy.  Ages 3-10, they all have fun with it.  I just bought it so I don't have to chase my son down the street when he wants to play with the neighbor's.    Okay, it IS messy, but sweeps up easily and is actually easier to clean up then play-dough.  The figures come out fine from the barn as long as you put enough stuff in the mold.  VERY true that the hay bales and such are practically impossible to get out of the mold.  My favorite way to do it is to tap it at an angle until it falls out.  This is a pain, and you almost want to hide these particular molds, BUT I still bought it.
5.0	These gloves were the perfect addition to a halloween costume.  They fit my 6 year old daughter perfectly and the feather trim did not fall off.  They are great now to play dress up with!
5.0	This handheld game is wonderful! My girls love it. It is made really good and there is so many things that you can do with your character. Everything that you really do in everyday life you have to do in this game....eat, go to sleep, go to school, go to the mall..ect. It is amazing and loads of fun. I would recommend this game to anyone that has daughters.
5.0	5 year old loves it!!
1.0	My three year old loved it.  I hate it.  After a week, it has one wire that is bent at a curve permanently.  I don't even know how it happened, I think the wire somehow twisted in the casing.  This causes the whole tent to collapse in on itself and now I have a very frustrated little boy.  It's not worth the time it takes to open the box.
1.0	I dont recommend you to buy it.<br /><br />The toy is too small, has a poor quality, and The price doesnt worth what you find in that tiny box.<br /><br />My daughter is very desappointed and so I am.
5.0	I give this product 5 stars<br />I purchased this for my 3 year old niece for her toy kitchen ,she likes things to look and feel real<br />She likes it very much and makes breafast for everyone all the time!  I would recommend this product to others.
5.0	Silly Sam was a gift for my two year old son for Christmas. He loves to imitate us as we clean the kitchen, iron clothes, and do the daily chores. I thought Silly Sam and friends would be a great toy for him for that reason. Silly Sam and friends did not disappoint. There is Silly Sam the broom, a dust pan (unfortunately he does not talk), a dust buster that has realistic sounds, a trash can that works and talks, an iron and ironing board. My personal favorites are the broom and the iron. I will admit to using Silly Sam to sweep up minor dirt instead of going to get the actual broom. I love the iron because the steam burst sound just cracks me up...it sounds so real. My son really likes Silly Sam and friends. They are well-made and sturdy. My son is rough and these have held up nicely.
5.0	WE got this for our 14 year-old niece who is a big fan.  She was so excited and immediately attached it to her coat.
5.0	good quality too! they use it with the belt and bow & arrow and look stylish. great gift for kids/
5.0	Easy for my 2 year old to open and close
5.0	What is not to like.  They seem to be made just fine.  I've always been a fan of Sonic.  Good
1.0	Maybe I am just not patient enough but these boots are so heavy and clunky I could barely walk in them, let alone be brave enough to try and jump in the air. The hard plastic clasps are difficult to use as well. I returned right away before I broke my leg.
5.0	Super cute! They're small like the ones u get in a quater machine but perfect for what I needed them for, to make rave kandi with! Yay!
5.0	My husband has been wanting these for over a year now. He saw the pictures and just had to have them. I got them for him for Christmas and he absolutely loves them! (:
1.0	Looked good in the add.  It is just cardboard with a paper scene glued on.  The lock is poorly made and did not work.  The music did play and the ballerina did turn.
5.0	This was a Christmas gift for our almost-six year old son who loves the Creator sets and cars.  He built it with a little help from his dad on Christmas day and the rebuilt it into the race truck the following day.  He loves his Technics.  He's raced them creating tracks with pillows and magazines and they stay together. If a part does fall off he just puts it back on and is back to racing in seconds.  He received 4 of these easy build technic sets and  he built all 6 cars and now he's inventing his own.  It's a great set !
5.0	Love it! I wish I had bought it earlier for my three year old. I love that it's slightly higher than most standard stools since my daughter is small for a three year old. It has empowered her and she loves her autnomy. She can wash her hands, turn lights off and on etc...
5.0	It's a lot of fun if you're looking for a cheap little RC truck to drive around. This is NOT a hobby-grade truck or climber, so don't expect $100-quality for a $20-something plastic toy. It can drive on carpet and hard dirt but not soft dirt, grass, or shaggy carpet.  We drove it around the backyard up to 50 feet away, and it didn't lose signal like another car we have (similar size, different brand). It has a tight turning radius, which is fun for driving around obstacles. It also has decent speed for running on AA batteries.  Box says 4+years old, but I'd recommend 6+. As long as your kid(s) are reasonably careful (unlike the kids of many parents/grand-parents who write toy reviews!), and they won't sit on it, slam it on the pavement, or set it on fire, Big Foot will be fine. :)
5.0	very cool kit for interaction with your child and helping them understand about the weather  wish they had stuff like this when I was his age yeah
1.0	These fell apart before my daughter got to wear them:(
5.0	So cute! My 8-yr-old granddaughter loves them.
5.0	I bought two of these along with several pounds of kinetic sand for two special little boys.  They just loved it!
5.0	Overall she is one of my favorite dolls.. She has nice blonde with blue streaks.. Related to daring and dexter she is a must have for eah collectors (:
5.0	My boy loved it it was much bigger than he inticipated
5.0	very, very challenging.  hard to fit pieces in place.  buy this if you love puzzles. and the subject is fun
5.0	My son really likes horses and he LOVES this set.  The horses were bigger than I thought they would be - the perfect size for playing.  And each one is a different color.  My son plays with them for hours.  Great product!!
5.0	"My toddler and I are having a great time with Mama K's play dough.  Each of the five \\""flavors\\"" smells incredible.  We've play with the dough about six times in the last week and it is still just as moist and fragrant as when we opened the package.  The colors are not as bright as the play-dough from my childhood, but my son doesn't see to mind.  The lavender color resembles blue corn tortilla chips, the lemon grass resembles overcooked green beans and the sweet orange is the color of tumeric.  I'm extremely happy with my purchase."
5.0	Our neighbor bought this for their grandchild when they were on vacation in Canada.  When they showed it to us, I just had to have one.  Tracked the Rollover dog online, saw they have more than just the dog, so we got the dog and a cat.  OMG, we can't stop laughing.  Great gift for anyone who loves to laugh.
5.0	i suprised my son with this toy and he absolutely loves it he drives it over jumps hes made and he stays strong its a pritty durable toy and at a fair price
5.0	This game is a lot of fun.
5.0	my nephew has a blast on this tractor.
5.0	These are really very high quality toys.  They looked great on the cake, and it was great that they came with a little plastic liner to put into the icing so that the toy itself stays clean.  I'm glad we got these 3-dimensional decorations rather than just making a picture with icing.  Once the cake was gone, a very high quality toy remained, and you'd never know it was sold as a cake decoration.  My son loves that the Big Bird tow-truck hooks up to Elmo's car.  I was only expecting a decoration, so I was very surpised that these are really durable, good quality toy cars that my kids can play with for a long time.  If these were sold as toy cars and not as cake toppers, they would sell just as well.  Great product.
5.0	really is a great toy.  The darts do stick to the objects.The sound of it is really cool. The problem I have with it is that it is to heavy and hard to pump for an 8 year old.So I do the pumping and he shoots it. He loves it. This is a better shoot toy than others.
5.0	This was a gift for my 9 yr old. We had fun making the bracelets. Simple instructions, we can't wait to get more paracord and fasteners. This was great and taught my kid something new - and he gets to wear it.
1.0	I have been paying attention and taking notes.  My 8 y.o. son knows every intricate difference between the various mini figures, as thus, do I.  And the General Grievous loose figure offered here, all white, should be offered with a cape if I am not mistaken...besides the cape, it equivalent to the G. Grievous mini-fig offered with LEGO Star Wars General Grievous Chase (10186)$209.99 several years ago.    The latest of the General Grievous sets seem to be the LEGO Star Wars General Grievous Starfighter (8095)$49.99. And the G. Grievous included is fantastic, a  true General Grievous mini-figure with detailed eyes, mouth slats, multifaceted and bendable feet and hands in both gray and off-white.  Also included are the four light sabers with chrome handles.    Unless you are a professional collector who simply must have every Grievous ever made, don't waste your money on this overly simplistic and overpriced $20 Grievous when you can get an entire set with a superior product for $50.  More importantly?  I promise that your kids will notice the difference.
5.0	I bought the panda and the Teddy Bear puzzles for Christmas gifts.  They were a big hit and look so adorable put together.  My 11 year old wasn't very patient in trying to figure it out so our college age friend put them both together and is going to put them in her dorm.  She loved them.  Very well made.
5.0	We bought this because our children have tons of Barbies and accessories for them and they were all over the place.  So now they have a nice organized place to put them and they can easily move it around.
5.0	I was surprised to see the quality of the clothes and shoes I ordered.  The price is way better than on the American Girl Website.  Any girl who has one of these dolls should shop on Amazon, you get way more for your Money and parents and Grandparents can give Amazon gift cards, then they can pickout what they want.
5.0	My grandson asked for Nick Fury for Christmas and this figure looks just like Samuel Jackson it is unbelievable...He is going to love this figure and can't wait til he sees it.
5.0	We got this for our 8 yr old with autism. He is not normally that interested in toys and he also has weak fine motor skills. Well, he LOVES this toy (as do our other two boys.) He plays with it off and on all day long, he can turn it off and on, count them, name their colors, and even uses his fine motor skills to put the penguins on the right way. GREAT toy for him!
1.0	I'm so disappointed in this set.  Our kids love Thomas but this set is very hard to get together.  My husband and I have to get out the instructions every time we try to assemble it.  Then, if we are lucky enough to get it together it falls apart so easily.  I did a lot of research on different trains and thought the Trackmaster was the way to go.  I recommend sticking with the Take and Play sets (which link together) or going with a wooden set!
5.0	Bought these for my daughter and she kept them on all night. They are pretty sturdy and do not hurt her head. good buy.
5.0	great product and service just as expected thank you
5.0	I´ve just started and its realy what I expected it came on time and in a realy good state no damages at all not even on the box! :)
5.0	Love this truck! My 3yro loves loading the back with as much stuff as he can.
5.0	Awesome!    If you haven't already, buy it!    If you have bought it already, buy another copy!
5.0	This little pig snores when you press the button on his foot- totally adorable! My friend saw mine, and I ordered one for her to give her granddaughter. It was delivered by date promised, and arrived just as expected. OH - I forgot to mention- the little pig's ears move, as so does his body, as if he's breathing- love it!
5.0	My family and I love this game and play it all the time. Instead of keeping up with monopoly cash you keep funds on credit card. It is a great spin on a classic game!
5.0	My niece is a Bullseye fanatic!  When you press down on the tail, Bullseye gallops and nays (sounds) and the light in his mouth turns on.  This is perfect for the preschooler who is getting used to sleeping without the nightlight on.  It is assurance that if she needs a light it's there for her.  Besides, it is Bullseye--so it's just added security for her.  She really does sleep with it right next to her along with the rest of her Toy Story stuffed toy crew!  So cute!!!!!
5.0	Grand daughter loved the funiture and it went well with the  castle  good quality and arrived on time  Packed well no assembly
1.0	We love the idea behind the bike and taught my son great balancing skills but after just 4 months the bicycle has fallen apart. It was left in the rain once and the combination of that and humidity made the &#34;wood&#34; separate and get totally soft and now unrideable. So disappointed.
5.0	Had a blast with it in the first couple months, and completely expected my friends (who are a bit rough with &#34;toys&#34; and such) to have it broken within a week and leave me to buy another one, well it didn't happen, I've had it for months and its still kickin'!!
1.0	The instructions are in Chinese!!!!!  With over 60 pieces to assemble, I think the universal language should be considered. Helloooo!
5.0	So happy to find this item.  It completes my grandson's collection.
5.0	This is exactly what we wanted, all three of my boys had these as they were starting to walk and played with them until they were 18 months or so.
5.0	"This is a great nativity set for young children, as it's very inviting for them to touch and see the elements of that first Christmas night. I've bought two of these sets, and I'd highly recommend this item. The squawky little voice that sings \\""O, Little Town of Bethlehem\\"" delights my grandchildren when they press the star at the top of the stable (not everyone will enjoy this as much as a child, but it's all part of the appeal!). Again, this is a wonderful product."
5.0	We bought this kitchen for our daughter's second birthday. She loves playing with her kitchen, making food for Mom and Dad.  We were worried about the height of the kitchen because our daughter is so short, but everything is easily accesible for her. Some of the appliance are a bit difficult for her to pull open. The kitchen is very sturdy and has held up well. This is not a product for someone who does not enjoy putting kits together. Took about four hours from start to finish.
5.0	Everyone seems to enjoy 'playing' with these Sing-A-Ma-Jigs. Great price, terrific stocking stuffers!  They seem to harmonize well once you get them going. Remember you'll need more than one for this feature.
5.0	Love the set came fast to
5.0	Insanely adorable!!! Just like it is in the picture. I love it and would very much recommend it to any fan of The Walking Dead :)
5.0	Ton of fun ... play with lots of friends and family.
5.0	Purchased this for our 2 year old grand daughter to go with her kitchen set. It was well made and she has enjoyed the pieces
5.0	My daughter (and every other kid on the planet) thinks this machine is the funniest thing ever.  They will play with it until the batteries die, or they pass out from laughter.
5.0	An amazing product just perfect for any fan of the kingdom hearts series but if you ever want to buy more the best place to get it from is DGI mart
5.0	Flash Duel is a card game that simulates a battle between two characters in a manner similar to video games like Street Fighter, Guilty Gear, and Tekken. By playing numbered cards you move forward and backward on a linear playing surface (also built out of cards that are included in the purchase), trying to get in a blow against your opponent before they get in one against you, and before time runs out (i.e. before the deck runs out of cards). The basic mechanics of the game fit well into the easy-to-learn-but-hard-to-master category, making the game fun for kids (I'd recommend ages 8 and up) but still leaving it with enough depth to be enjoyed by adults as well. In fact, mastering the game requires a lot of planning ahead. Like most card games, the gameplay revolves around a mixture of skill and luck, and the balance between the two is such that planning ahead and strategizing is important, but less skilled players will still have a chance of winning, so every round is interesting even if players are of unequal skill.    While the game's basic mechanics are enough to make it enjoyable, its real selling point is that players can pick from one of 10 different characters each of whom get a few unique powers that really influence the way they play. This means that there are 45 different matchups to play around with, each matchup having a substantial amount of depth. This should keep the game interesting for a very long time.    I'd also recommend this game to budget conscious individuals and parents, since unlike many fantasy-style card games it does not require repeated purchases of more cards in order to collect them all. Instead, you get the whole game all at once and will never have reason to spend another penny on it.
5.0	It's a box of pokemon cards. My son loves it and was so excited to open up each package. I don't see the value in spending that much money on these cards but then again I've spent more money on worse things, so good on him.
5.0	love this! my daughter loves &#34;monkey George&#34; this was a good price too.
5.0	Good selection of sizes for my craft project.
5.0	So Cute! My daughter immediately wanted to dress Baby Stella in her new jammies!
5.0	They work perfectly and are built beautifully.
5.0	My son is only 1 year old and he already loves these.  I set them up and he knocks them down.  He doesn't always use the ball to knock them down, but he does knock them down!  We received them for a gift and I put them up because I didn't think he was ready for them yet.  My husband opened them when I wasn't home and now they are the first things that my son pulls out of his toy box every morning.  I highly recommend them.
5.0	This is the one thing my 5 year old had asked for at christmas--it looked very cheap and I didn't think that it would work. I was wrong---it works very well. She needs help using it but it makes beautiful designs and she finds all the movement very entertaining...I would get this as a birthday present for a 5-8 year old girl.
1.0	The water marbles never grew. I finally just threw them away. What a waste of money
5.0	It is a great game! I love it and I am going to get a expansion pack or two in the near future.
5.0	My kids love this ogre paired with the eagle talon castle.  The interaction is great!
5.0	I am in love with this kitchen.  I didn't want a big chunky plastic kitchen and it's perfect slightly smaller then a dining chair for a rough size. Not all the numbers matched the instructions but it was easy to put together. Definitely a great kitchen for toddlers.
1.0	Yes, this has the fabulous Harry Potter logo on it. I certainly hope I never have to see something of this nature come from that name again. I will not believe that this is something JKR approved of. (Did you warn her when she gave movie rights?) The game(s) are insulting to anyone with any IQ over three, but the simplicity of the games is only understood if you can wade your way through the instructions. I finally did, and couldn't believe it was THAT simple. I hope this is scathing enough to keep anyone from wasting their money or their time.
5.0	We loved this doll house! My daughter is two and has a blast and it's so cute! We like that it's wooden, it feels like it's going to last a long time plus it adds tip the charm. I would buy it again in a heartbeat! My daughter sat on her daddy's lap as he built it and she just kept saying thank you daddy thank you! I love my tiny house!
5.0	Very Excellent condition.  Great for The Hobbit Collection.
5.0	We LOVE this game.  We played it on vacation with some cousins and came home to buy it immediately.  I bought this version, which was less expensive than our cousins nicer unpainted version.  I was only a little disappointed that the pieces weren't a little bigger, but for the price, it's great.  This game teaches the kids to think about their strategy more than traditional tic-tac-toe.  Everyone who comes to our house plays this game and loves it, kids and adults alike.  It's a great game and my only regret is that I didn't shell out a little more money to get the nicer version since it's always out! :)
5.0	Gift for my expecting sister in law. Husband said he favorite character as a child was Winnie the Pooh, so we thought it was just the right gift to let them know from 900 miles away our excitement. She will cuddle this for a long time.
5.0	I do not know anything about &#34;Planet&#34; sock monkeys but I know this is cute, cute, cute!!  I used it sticking out of my daughter's (Mom of college students) Christmas stocking.  She loved it!!
5.0	The assembly was very complicated and took about 6 hours. Once assembled, it looks just like the picture and my 2 year old grandson loves it!
5.0	1. The battery came fully charged and ready to use. It was actually a 240 mah battery. cool. Just waiting on the helicopter now. I'll be flying soon.  2. Dont bother, the helicopter doesn't last that long. The red ones die real quick. The bottom rotor stops working on them. If you dont believe me check out youtube. Alot of people are having the same problem.
5.0	My son is obsessed with anything from the &#34;Cars&#34; movies.  He already has the two main characters and requested some more for his upcoming birthday.  I know that he'll really enjoy his gift which is strong enough to hold up to my son's rigorous play.
5.0	This is harder than it looks and everyone loved playing it, age6 -60+. We played it several times on vacation and it was always a challenge.
5.0	Everything was beautiful and nothing hurt.
5.0	cute, our favorite drivers, nice that they have alot of space for all the info that was needed. Very pleased with them
5.0	We love these chairs.  We have two and my 2 yr-old daughter uses them everyday.  They are very sturdy.  The finish on one of the chairs arrived cracked at first, but the customer service dept was great and sent me a new chair immediately.  I'd buy more of these if I had a place to put them!  Great purchase.
1.0	the pic  tricks u  its not a real  sized brick
5.0	excellent product, thank you very much.
5.0	"I am so excited for the release of VTech's new InnoTab 2S (SRP: $99.99)! My boys are HUGE tech fans.... even at 6 and 3! I am constantly fighting them both off over the use of my iPad. I know in this generation being able to use technology effectively is a very important skill. BUT as a mom, I do not just want them lounging on the couch all day playing apps and video games to their hearts content. I want them actively learning as well. Luckily the new Innotab 2s has just been released and has all the quality I look for in technology for my growing boys.<br /><br />The Innotab 2s features all of the same upgrades as the InnoTab 2  including a new rotatable camera and video recorder, plus a secure Wi-Fi connection to VTech's Learning Lodge Navigator for easy and secure downloading of games, e-books, music and more!<br /><br />Plus, I love that VTech has also launched a new educational program, VTech University, that kids can take part in by using their new InnoTab 2S or their InnoTab, InnoTab 2 or MobiGo 2 products.<br /><br />Here is why we love the Innotab 2s:<br /><br />InnoTab 2S contains all the product features of the InnoTab 2, plus a secure wireless connection to VTech's Learning Lodge Navigator.<br /><br />Once users have downloaded a new app from the Learning Lodge Navigator, you can seamlessly sync the program to your InnoTab 2S wirelessly - no cord is needed! This is a HUGE plus for me because I can never seem to find the cord when I need it!<br /><br />The new InnoTab 2S tablet features a 5\\"" touch screen that keeps my kids entertained and engaged while they learn.<br /><br />Also just like mommy's iPad, the InnoTab 2S also features a rotatable digital camera and video recorder that allows kids to capture memories of themselves or their friends. My oldest LOVES this feature. He has caught some seriously funny moments using his Innotab 2s.<br /><br />I love that each of my boys can have their own account. This way one boy does not \\""mess up\\"" my other sons games. Also, when we have play dates, their friends can play with their own account.

5.0	These are part of my sand tray miniatures collection.  They various poses and expressions are clear and a nice alternative to standard figures.
5.0	Soft body, simple control, cute design.  The two-button design allowed my 18-month-old to figure it out pretty quickly.  The one-directional turn feature is better than it sounds--the bus pivots on its center.  It uses one button to go straight and one to pivot to the direction you want to go next. <br /> <br />It is a bit loud, but that is nothing a piece of scotch tape couldn't fix.
5.0	Bought this for my son's 14th birthday. They are durable, attractive and arrived on time. Very pleased with purchase.😊
5.0	Adorable! We love the new style of LPS. My daughter's spent hours last night decorating the animals and the shop! Their favorite thing about this one is putting the bird on the monkeys head! With the little studs you can redecorate them over and over. We received this toy free in return for our honest review.
5.0	THE CROZ RETUNS AFTER CLEAN JAIL TIME AND STUNS THE CROWD.THE OPENER,TRACKS IN THE DUST,A FOUR WAY CONVERSATION WITH HIMSELF,AMAZES.MONKEY AND THE UNDERDOG IS TRUE TO LIFE.I FIRST FOUND THIS MANY YEARDS AGO AND WORE IT OUT.
5.0	We bought these cups for our 6 month old daughter. I cannot say enough about them. They're fun for stacking, teaching colors and numbers. We use the cups as bowls to put the ball in, or we create balls from the cups and hide the small jingly ball in them. She sits up to quietly stack and unstack the cups, or we click them into balls and she rolls all over the floor with them. They're great for encouraging your baby to crawl. She watches us stack them in absolute awe. This is one toy that I think she will play with for years, and it's such a nice contrast from all those noisy, battery powered toys out there.
1.0	This has got to be the worse item of all magic tricks ever designed! Its super small, about 2 inches and is NOT what the seller discribes! Dont fall for the deception as I did!! Its actual garbage, that's where it belongs!
5.0	Really great product, I would just like to point out that you should wear baggy clothes so the leg accessory stays on otherwise it'll just slide down your leg.
5.0	good quality, daughter loves it
5.0	Excellent condition. Nice bright colors.
5.0	only thing was it took me 15 min to set up other than that i think this was an amazing purchase its sturdy and my 18 month old son loves to dunk on it lol. get it. its well worth it.
5.0	"Well Woody was a big hit at Christmas. I have 4 children ranging 8mos to 7yo and every single one of them has had their hands on Woody. Since he can \\""sense\\"" when he looses his hat my 2.5yo thinks its the bee's knees that Woody asks for it back. It is well made. Even my 8mo old has figured out how to pull the string so Jessie is next for us. im VERY impressed with this toy. Its the coolest one Ive ran across in years! Great job!"
5.0	Our daughter had turned two and we used birthday money to buy her this set. She really loves it and it incorporates well into her other blocks. I like the detail pieces such as the animal food and worker tools that come along with it. No matter a boy or a girl gift, either should love this set if they are into legos of any age.
5.0	LOVE IT!  Also amazing Customer Service!
5.0	I got this as a gift for Dad.  He really enjoyed putting it together and it looks great as a little decoration in his livingroom.
1.0	I bought this airplane for my grandson's birthday, and should have known better as I'd read about the screwdriver problem!  How disappointing to give a dud gift!  I contacted Battat who readily agreed to send a replacement driver but a month later still have yet to receive it :(  Not impressed and certainly will not order from this company again!
5.0	I bought this for my son, and he absolutely loves it. It's extremely easy to put together, and durable. (My son is 2) The only minor inconvenience is that sometimes the magnets on the backs of the accessories come out, but nothing that a little super glue didn't fix.
5.0	The Servo I bought was very easy to install and worked perfectly. I've purchased other Syma parts. They cost much less than other brands and are easier to work with
5.0	My granddaughter was very happy with this outfit. She enjoys changing clothes on her doll every day. This outfit is well made.
5.0	Bought for my sons who are both nearing their Eagle and hopefully achieving in the next year. Wanted something special to give them.
1.0	Firstly, I was shipped the wrong item. Then comes the issue of quality...the nose on the plush is sewn on sideways and crooked, the ears are misshapen, and disproportionate with each other, and also the markings on the belly of the plush look and feel like screen printing, and it's patchy and can be seen through In several areas. On the positive side, it's still very adorable, arrived faster than expected, and was very affordable. But the poor quality of the piece and the fact I didn't receive what I had ordered makes it a miss for me.
5.0	"This discontinued item is very hard to find and when one popped up from an Amazon seller, I jumped at it, no matter what the price.      I have been a fan of Steve McQueen for many years, my favorite films being \\""Bullitt\\"" and \\""The Great Escape\\"".  Much of the stuntwork in both films was done by Steve and as \\""Hilts, the Cooler King\\"", he proved was also the \\""King of Cool\\""  With the many stars that were in the film including James Garner, James Coburn, David McCallum, Richard Attenborough, Charles Bronson and others, McQueen literally stole the film with his performance and the motorcycle scenes.    The action figure does a wonderful representation of Steve in the film, is highly detailed and even includes the signature baseball and mitt used in the solitary confinement scenes.    If you are a McQueen fan, raid your piggy bank and buy this if you can find one.  Highly Recommended!"
5.0	This is a granddaughter birthday gift . She will love it. Timing of delivery was great
5.0	I bought this for Christmas for our 3 year old daughter.  Although she wasn’t initially very excited about it (I think she wasn’t totally sure what it was), it has since become one of her go-to toys.  I did a lot of looking for the perfect cash register and I am happy with this selection.  Although I think my daughter would have been more excited by a character cash register (e.g. Minnie Mouse), this is a toy I can see her using well into elementary, if not middle, school.  Ultimately, I was deciding between this model and the Learning Resources Pretend and Play Calculator Cash Register.  Ultimately this model won out for the following reasons:<br />- Ability to use real or pretend coins in the coin counter – adds to the educational value of the toy<br />- Scanner makes it more realistic for playing “grocery store” and goes well with our play kitchen, play food and shopping cart<br />- Cash register talks, which allows there to be educational play even without an adult<br />- Overall nicer look to the cash register and, especially considering the extra features, not that much more expensive<br /><br />Pros<br />- Easy enough for my 3 year old to play with as is, but with enough added functionality that the toy will easily grow with her<br />- Scanning function is a blast!  As you scan an item over the button (play food works great for this), the register rings up and speaks a price.  Randomly, things are on special and the register says, “Weekly Special” or something like that.  She gets a kick out of it.<br />- Comes with a pretend coupon card and credit card which adds to the reality of it because she can shop just like Mommy.<br />- Ability to use both real and fake coins and the register says what each coin is as they are inserted into the coin slot.  The display also shows the value of the coin.<br />- Four learning games built into the register that each have three levels so that play can grow with the child.  There are really only one or two games she could play right now, but this will be nice to have as she gets older.<br /><br />Cons<br />- When used correctly, the scanner doesn’t beep when an item is scanned.  Instead the internal voice quotes a random price (for example, “5 dollars and 35 cents”).  The only way to get the scanner to beep is if the drawer or the coin bank door is open (and it’s beeping to indicate the drawer is open), but then it doesn’t “ring up” the items being scanned.  This is disappointing because my daughter would really like the beeping noise – we have to make our own beeps or not have the ring up voice!  It would be nice if the manufacturer added the beep in addition to the voice quote.<br />- As other reviews have mentioned, the drawer flies open with a lot of speed, which results in the coins flying open.  We’ve taught our daughter to put her hand by the drawer to catch it as it opens, which she does most of the time.  This isn’t a big deal, but would be nice if this were improved on by the company.<br /><br />Overall, I am very happy with this cash register and would highly recommend it!  It’s a great make believe and educational toy that I think we’ll get many years of play out of.es she could play right now, but this will be nice to have as she gets older.<br /><br />Cons<br />- When used correctly, the scanner doesn’t beep when an item is scanned.

1.0	My boys and their friends were so excited to get this delivered to our house. However, that excitement quickly waned as one of the figures got jammed and would no longer shoot the marbles. We were able to fix it by pressing the inner arms back into place with a precision screwdriver, but honestly we shouldn't have had to do that after only one round of play. The figure works now, but not as well as the other one in the box.
5.0	Seriously, this is a great Expansion. My only complaint is that with the plethora of choices for X-Force characters in The Marvel Universe, another Wolverine was chosen. . .<br /><br />:-/<br /><br />I would have preferred Gideon.<br /><br />However, the new mechanics like Critical Hit, Teleport, Bribe, and Versatile are very useful and Cable is a powerhouse!
5.0	I got this as a gift for my BF since we travel so much. It's adorable and classy looking! He LOVED it and it's great to have the places for the pieces so it doesn't rattle around and the magnets seem to hold pretty well. A fun buy :)
5.0	these are great and if you got a good set of eyes and a small file you can sharpen plus very easy to change
1.0	Oh well - my inlaws bought this for my daughter and we were all excited but she only used it once and not for very long - aside from the screen being too small for me to view is properly it just didn't work unplugged at all ever.  It was probably defective bc it should be able to be viewed with it's own battery life but it wasn't.  We tried using it several times but never worked.  It's been sitting there for months and just collects dust.  What can I do with it if we no longer have the box and I never had a receipt for it?
1.0	We have had hatching eggs before and they are great.  Unfortunately mine too came broken.  The shipping box itself was intact, and I did not even have to open the package to see the broken piece.  You could see it right through the package window.  Was extremely disappointed as my daughter was specifically looking for the pink flamingo.
5.0	My son loves it! Afordable, great quality and lots of fun! This RC car is not a cheap toy like most rc cars in the market, its a very good product. We're very satisfied with our purchase.
5.0	our second playmobil purchase!amazing detail and quality made!great price!shipped fast!we will be ordering more in the near future!the little trash men are so cute and it even comes with toy mini garbage!
1.0	I also bought this for my 5yo daughter and I bought the Lego calendar for my 8yo son. My daughter enjoyed the idea of the calendar and was excited, but it was not worth the money. Yes, you get 3 Pet Shop figures with it, but they were not the best quality. The other items that came were just junk. Little cardboard boxes that look like little gifts with nothing in them, little accessories that aren't easy to fit on the the pet shops. Very disappointing especially when comparing to the Lego one. Please don't waste your money. I think next year we will make our own.
5.0	Great product, would deffinetly recomend to purchase.Battery lasts for hours of enjoyment, and is usable on various types of RC vechiles.
5.0	It's what I expected very good product
5.0	I bought this helmet for my 9 month old son. I replaced the pads with the larger extra set that was sent with the helmet. It took my son a few times to get use to the weight, but now it's not a problem at all. My wife and I think the helmet is really cute and enjoy the &#34;chick&#34;  design. We have been using it a few months now and hope it last a lot longer!
5.0	Bought them for my daughter but I like to do them, too.  A great gift for a little or tween girl.
5.0	Bought for my passport. Huge marvels fan. Eye catcher. But I hate I have to take my cover off my passport so much.
5.0	Very nice and just the right size.
5.0	Product as expected, it took some time to arrive from China, but I was aware of it when I ordered.
5.0	For my son, it's never too early for him to think about what he wants to dress up as for Halloween. This Iron Man light up mask is definitely different and a fun alternative from the paper/plastic masks that are often used with a costume.<br /><br />This mask is about 8 inches long, and 6 inches wide. It weighs roughly 2 ounces and it's rather light feeling while wearing it, but does stick out a bit, so while it's noticeable that it's on my face, it's not bothersome. It has a thick, black, non adjustable elastic band that goes across the back of it that stretches enough to fit my head, my sons head, and my husbands head comfortably. I have long hair, and this elastic strap does not get caught in my hair like some other costume masks that have the thin white elastic strap. This Iron Man mask also has three small slits located at the middle bottom half of the mask to make it easier to breath while wearing it, and not feel like I am suffocating underneath.<br /><br />Around the eyes on the outside of this mask is a thick white band that has LED lights that shine really bright. This feature can be turned on by pushing the blue button located on the upper right part of the inside of this mask, or turned off by pushing the blue button again. The lights are powered by three watch style batteries, and the battery compartment is located in the center (about eyebrow level) of the back of the mask. I did not feel the need to squint with the LED lights on while wearing this mask, either in the day or at night. The slits to see out measure 1/2 in x 1 1/2 in so it's somewhat like having tunnel vision while looking out through them. For that reason and as with any mask, I would recommend being careful while wearing this mask so you don't not run into people or trip and fall.<br /><br />The entire mask is made out of hard plastic, and it's fairly durable and has held up well to my son wearing it for a few days and playing with it. I gave this mask a 5 star rating because my son usually does not like wearing masks at all, and finds most uncomfortably hot to wear after a period of time, but that wasn't the case while wearing this mask. He is 11 yrs old and this mask fits him just fine around his face, he thinks it's really awesome, looks cool, and has worn it every day since we've received it a few days ago.<br /><br />Purchased at a reduced cost for the purpose of inspection and honest, unbiased review.ks at all, and finds most uncomfortably hot to wear after a period of time, but that wasn't the case while wearing this mask.

5.0	This quadcopter flies very well. It's a great first quad for begginers. Great quality for the price. Camera is also ok for the price. Would recommend to anyone.
5.0	Chunky pieces are great for little hands
5.0	I bought this as a gift for my close friends.  We later took the game on a getaway trip with about 10 people.  Game was a huge hit.
1.0	"When I saw this product, I thought that getting a box of balloons was a \\""clearance special\\"".  The writing of the description describes the item;         * It spins and spins and hummms as it spins !      * 72 individually packed per display box      * HOURS OF FUN !      * Great for Pary !    this implies that you will receive a box of balloons!  IF I had known that what would be sent was ONE (1) item........ I would have NOT purchased this garbage!!  Also, the size of the item is such that it could have been sent in a 1st class letter envelope, NOT in a $4.49 brown padded, USPS 1st class mailer!!!!    I for one, will NEVER do business with NORTHSHIRE BOOKSTORE again! ONE RIP OFF is my quota!!!!!"
5.0	Very nice diary.  Made well , lots of pages and 2 keys.  My granddaughters were very happy with the diary.
5.0	We've only been using it for a week, but so far we have no complaints. It looks really nice, better than the picture, and was not too complicated to put together. My toddler likes it a lot. It is also very sturdy, where a 130 pound adult can sit on the chairs, though I am sure it is not recommended by the M&D.
1.0	The helicopter randomly falls from the sky when farther than four meters from the controller! It is fully charged and there are new batteries in the controller. The landing gear broke when it fell on the driveway. I would return it if the landing gear was intact.
5.0	My son loves this monkey. Seemingly durable and very cute.
5.0	0-12, each set is there.  Could not find these in stores around home.  If they are held individually in the light, she can see the answer om the back, as others have said, but if held in a group, no way.
5.0	"Before I tell you why I was impressed, I want to be sure you are aware that this is...<br />#1 A Toy<br />#2 Only 7.9\\"" H x 2.1\\"" W x 8.7\\"" D, 0.4 lb<br />#3 Supposed to resemble the actual writing from Dr Who<br /><br />I got this for my 13 year old son, who recently became a huge Dr Who fan, and is about to undergo some serious foot surgery next week. I thought this and a few other Who things may cheer him up!<br /><br />So many were disappointed by the size of the book or the plastic ring and the \\""faux\\"" leather cover. But I read the description and knew what I was buying. The pages are extremely realistic, with scratch marks and sloppy handwriting (Dr Who himself tends to be irratic and sloppy, so this stands to reason) and hold an old worn out look to them. However, it's interesting to look at and try to decypher the words and match up events to the shows. Concidering it's \\""faux\\"" leather, it's decent quality. Should it ever rip or break, it wouldn't take much from a hobby store to replace it with real leather binding and make it look that much better. I love the fact that there are so many pages! It seems to go on and on... And yet, there are blank pages at the end for writing in your own thoughts etc. I saw a post where someone paid $50 for this... I wouldn't pay $50 for it! I wouldn't pay $40 for it! I'd make one myself for that amount of money. But $22 was well worth it.<br /><br />There is a choice between getting this one with the ring, or the same book but with the sonic screwdriver pen instead. I got the ring because the size of the book would make it quite difficult to use a bulky pen to write it in with. And, I already purchased a regular sized sonic screwdriver so there was no need for two. However, I read the reviews about it and it seems everyone is in love with the sonic screwdriver pen - very detailed and cool looking. I highly reccomend getting that one if you don't want a plastic ring. The ring is kinda cool, but it is plastic and doesn't light up or glow. As soon as my son see's this and looks through it, I'll update this review with his thoughts on it. For now though, I think it's pretty cool!"
5.0	NICE INCENTIVE FOR MY STUDENT.  THEY DO NOT ALL WORK THOUGH.
5.0	What a gas, it's now been over a couple of months and my grand-daughter still is playing with it
1.0	Stopped working 2 days after getting it. The horn is not rainbow colored it is gold and my daughter who desperately wanted this stuffed animal no longer wants to play with it because it doesn't make the sounds anymore. Didn't mind paying almost $30 for some thing that made noises but now it's just a huge stuffed animal.
5.0	we chose this because it had a cup holder which is hard to find. Works great! Would recommend for kids
5.0	My 2 1/2-year-old daughter loves Melissa & Doug puzzles.  I think doing these puzzles builds her confidence as well as other skills.  We have 3 of them.
5.0	Item exactly as described! My aunt loved her gift. It is very life like and soft. Very happy with my purchase!
1.0	Okay, I don't expect a whoopee cushion to last a life time but after 5 minutes of playing with it (not blowing it up too big, and sitting on it gently) both of the ones we bought for our boys tore open.
5.0	No complaints.  Works!
5.0	Perfect in quality and delivery
5.0	Good size. Can see a kid spending a long time playing win it.
5.0	very good puzzle for kids over 2 years I have all wood Puzzles In A Box by Melissa & Doug and My son likes to play with puzzles
5.0	Our three-year-old granddaughter loves it, and keeps it with her all day.
5.0	An inflatable pirate sword,what a wonderful idea. These seem to be if good quality and the size is great. We have had one inflated for over a month with no leakage, and it is a ton of fun to play with. I highly recommend for pirate themed birthday parties.
5.0	My nieces specifically requested the Barbie mini fairy's with the ponies.  They love them and have thoroughly enjoyed playing with them.
5.0	I got this game and tried it out on my family. They immediately loved it, even the family members who I'm usually hard-pressed to get to play. I bought most of the expansions that go with it that increase it from a max of 6 to 8 players. The game mechanics are very simple to teach. You will never play the same game twice with all the alien races you can be in the game and each of their own skills and abilities really change the strategy and game play of each game you play. I can't say enough good things about this game and I highly recommend it to anyone! This game has been around a long time and its gotten better with age seems like.
5.0	More fun than I imagined. I like this nano quadcopter better than the bigger versions. This is more responsive and harder to break. That soft plastic guard around the propellers is super nice - it doesn't interfere with flying.<br /><br />On a full charge this flies for about 10 minutes, that's a lot of flying.<br /><br />The controller uses two AAA batteries not included in the box. The copter charges via a special USB cable. You'll need to supply a computer port, AC adapter, or a powerbank battery. It takes around a half hour to fully charge the battery. Be very careful plugging in that cable - there is a tiny tab on the top of the cable that has to point upward. The copter power switch is just below the charging socket. The white rectangular USB connector glows red while the copter is charging. Once fully charged, the red light turns off.<br /><br />I like that this uses 2.4GHz instead of IR. That means you don't have to point the remote at the copter.<br /><br />The white LED on the copter flashes rapidly when the power is first turned on. It then flashes slowly looking for the remote control. After turning on the remote control and the copter is paired, the LED stops flashing. When the battery is low, the blue and green LEDs on the copter flashes.<br /><br />The left control when pushed forward or backward is the speed control. Pushing that lever left or right rotates the copter. The right control makes the copter move left and right, forward and backward. There is a flip button - press it once, and the next time you move the right controller, the copter will flip 360 degrees. The two shoulder buttons are for trim.<br /><br />Yeah this is a lot of fun. It does make a buzzing noise - so you can't really sneak up on somebody. The box includes a full set of replacement propellers - each propeller is unique to the corner of the copter.<br /><br />A free sample was provided for review.
1.0	My Mom and Dad purchased this for my four year old and it was a huge disappointment. To make the paint you are provided strips to peel off and put in the paint before mixing. The strips were near impossible to peel from the plastic. The paint did not mix well. I anticipated helping since my son is below the age range but the paint did not mix well even when I was the &#34;power&#34;.
5.0	It's my favorite kit , and boy how awesome it turns out!!!!
5.0	hot wheels collectors did you really think they'd make the flintmobile? i didn't but now i got it and yabba dabba doo for reals!
5.0	I love playing Dominion, and my favorite part about Dominion is building up a strong economy.  This expansion has many cards that increase the economic power of a side, so it is exactly the style of play I enjoy.<br /><br />I played it several times already, but one of the friends I played it with said that he thought this expansion made the game too nice.  He likes the intrigue expansion better because there are more cutthroat cards.  So if your favorite part of Dominion is attacking the other players, this is not the expansion for you.  But it is probably my favorite expansion.
5.0	Santa managed a last minute order so Chica was under the tree for our 10 month old. What a hit! I was one of those parents scouring the planet for Chica around Thanksgiving and was perplexed as to why I couldn't shop a full store of characters and games on Sprout's website. Sprout merchandising strategy aside, days before Christmas I re-checked Amazon.com and was delighted to see a few were available. Now our baby beams every time she spots Chica in the house, just like she does with the TV show. The doll is soft, durable and well sewn. She's a good size for a doll - not too small, actually perfect for baby to see and grab ahold of. The squeaker is pretty darned cute too. While not the professional squawker their puppeteers use, it's fine for home and similar to what you'd find in a pet toy. The only reason I didn't rate this a 5 for educational value is because I think it's the caregiver's involvement that takes that from a 4 to a 5. If I could rate value, it would be a 5. So for all you Sunny Side Up Show fans, if you're looking for Chica, breathe a sigh of relief. Sprout TV and Amazon deliver with this one!
5.0	I bought Think-ets when my son was 3 and a year and a half later we still use them all the time.  I keep them in my purse and pull them out when we need something to pass the time.  There are suggested games from guessing which one was removed to making up stories incorporating each thing.<br />When we lost our first set my son kept asking for them and I thought I would make my own but I never got around to it so I decided the price was reasonable for a simple toy.  I am purchasing a couple more sets to have on hand as small gifts.
5.0	It is a wonderful desk and easel for young kids 2 yrs to 5yrs. It is very small. But my grandson love to set and play with things. His daddy is an artist and paints so he can too. Good product you should purchase it.
5.0	My 9yr old Sun was very pleased with this product, and delivery time! He stated that were several surprises, and that it was the BEST set EVER! :-) Thank you for offering a product that made me a hero with my son! :-)
5.0	This is a very easy game to learn and a lot of fun.  Play weekly with a number of ladies from the neighborhood at our &#34;game day&#34;.  It is one of our favorites.  Fun for all ages.
5.0	I love dominion and recently got this expansion. It adds the time delayed cards (play it and they stay in play until the next turn, orange colored) along with some interesting other components that you will have to see for yourself. Great expansion!
1.0	I did not receive my order. Century Novelty claimed it was returned to them. I had given them the correct address, so I assume they printed it wrong on the pkg. They charged me re-stocking and a return postage fee which amounted to all but .47 of what I had paid. When contacted, they provided no customer service and told me essentially it was not their problem. I will not do business with or recommend this company.
5.0	How can you have a child ant have this timeless favourite toy? Great play value, we all remember this toy
5.0	So cute. My one year old looks adorable
5.0	If you (or the person you're buying this for) likes cute plushies that aren't too big, or too small, this one is a good one. It can stand up well on it's own (although on mine, the right front leg is a little crooked), and it's fairly soft, making it ideal to play with, or just have on a shelf.<br /><br />Okapis are also endangered, so it may also be good for a classroom where they want to teach kids about endangered species.
5.0	Yeah, so I found my old yo-yos from when I was a kid and always wanted to be good at doing some tricks with them and now I'm older nad slightly more coordinated I can do them. These strings work great and should last a long time like the others did. 10+ years and a few of them weren't falling apart. Nice price and fast service.
5.0	Im the Juggernaut *%$#@!!!  Great Figure!  Under Shown Xmen Character!
5.0	I bought this for my 12-year-old for Christmas.  He's been having a ball with it, and learning a lot.  My only complaint was that it didn't come with something to organize all the little pieces.  But I noticed that ahead of time, and was prepared with a small tackle box for him to put everything in.  So far, he's been able to do most of the projects with minimal assistance.
5.0	Bought for my son. Pretty sure cards had been used, but they were in excellent condition. They came in one package but we're wrapped in plastic separately in 2 stacks of 50. The packaged contained common cards as well as some more rare or special cards, according to my son. I don't know Pokémon stuff bt he was very happy with what he got, so I am too.
5.0	Not gonna lie but I thought this was a storage box CONTAINING 800 card protectors. The box is nice, yes, but I can't believe I just spent ~$5 on an empty box when I have so many regular cardboard boxes from online shopping.... -_-  Not the seller's fault in any way, shape, or form, obviously. I guess I just got too excited thinking that I would be getting 800 protectors for ~$5 and skipped reading a few words. Yes, I'm such a dunce.  I gave the box 5 stars because, like I said, it is a nice box and now when I do get actual card protectors, I'll have something to store my extra Pokemon cards in.
1.0	It came out of the package with his arm snapped off. Would not buy again from Coast City Styles. Horrible
5.0	"Can't beat this deal!  Purchased these for a group of theater camp kids performing \\""Aquarius/Let the Sun Shine\\"" and they fit the theme perfectly without breaking the budget!  Fairly well-made - not much to it - tie-dye peace sign on a string :)"
5.0	I purchased this puzzle for elementary classes for a Vacation Bible School with a &#34;Who is my neighbor?  Everyone in the world!&#34; theme.  It was perfect for occupying the early arrivals, reinforcing the theme, and building cooperation as the children worked together.  After VBS I introduced it in desperation to my inquisitive, bored 4-year-old granddaughter.  It occupied her for several hours!  The theme of children around the world, the circular shape, and the costumes that provided good visual cues for piece placement kept this hard to entertain child challenged but successful.  This former preschool teacher and current childcare provider highly recommends this puzzle for Pre-K through early elementary ages.
5.0	A little smaller than I thought.  But my son loves it.
5.0	My eight year old grandson and I also had a great time working this puzzle,  It was not difficult at all.
5.0	Very excited to receive this awesome limited edition Snuffles!  Fits right in with my collection, LOVE IT so soft and cuddly.
5.0	Always good from Lego, but kids are going for the little characters.
1.0	My mother bought the whole shabang for her first and only granddaughter.. the bed and dresser drawers. This was something that we all wanted her to have for years to come. The metal part of the base of the crib was put together wrong. The dresser didn't make it 6 months before the VENEER came up on the dresser. The crib had a dent in it but since we signed it we couldn't take it back. I fought for 2 months for the company we bought it from to send it back to the manufacturer and then we had to wait for a new one to come in. I also tried to talk to Munire employees through e-mail and never got a response till I threatened to go above the person's head that I was sending them too. They did refund $60 for the driving to replace the dresser. We bought the slats to convert the crib into a bed (over $200) and the places that are supposed to be screwed in were stripped. My husband has to redo the holes now. If I had to do it all over again I would invest in REAL WOOD. Not veneer. I encourage you to do the same.
5.0	Very soft, flexible, and I believe perfect for a baby girl turning one.  She seemed to like our cat who is similarly colored, so I figured this would be a good substitute, with no feeding or clean up!
5.0	He is creepy. The only thing I would add would be a light from below so he is easier to see in the dark but easy enough for me to get a flashlight under his face. Spooky!
5.0	Cool POP, great condition!
5.0	Funny little glow in the dark hexbug. Amazing movement and was surprised that even the adults thought this was cool.  Kids ages 3-7 all loved it too.
5.0	exactly as describe would buy from again!
5.0	This stuff is the best, it doesn't run like the cheaper brand
5.0	Very awesome. It adds a lot of options to the game.
5.0	This is one of the best McFarlane products in a true pose of Schmidtty. I watched this man play his whole career while growing up in Pennsylvania, and the pose truly represents his swing. The detail of the image is better than most McFarlane products, which is a great compliment to McFarlane products that generally have excellent image detail. I'd highly recommend this for baseball fans, especially Phillies fans.
5.0	My nephews lost their Ninja Turtle color book.  This was not an exact match, but it made them smile and provided hours of entertainment for them.
1.0	I purchased a Password Journal when they first came out around 8 years ago for my oldest daughter. It came with a key then so you could open it when your password would not work...I WISH this new model had the same thing.  My youngest daughter got Password Journal 3 and she could not get it to recognize her password.  I listened as she recorded it and she said it the same way everytime and it still would not recognize it.  It is very durable though...I ended up throwing it against the wall!!!!  They should give you another way to enter without having to open the back and reset over and over and over and over!! Bring back the key!!!
5.0	The owl puppet is beautifully made and turns his head and eyes open and close.  Very realistic.  His fur is well made and feels like a real owl.
5.0	We had so much fun at my son's 4 years old birthday party thanks to these balloons, kids were having a blast blowing their own balloon then decorating them by creating faces and else.<br />A must have for all the 3 to 8 birthday party!
5.0	Got this for my grown daughter. She and I have been looking for years to find a chuckles &#34;anything&#34; besides the little figurine. This is the perfect size and I can't wait to give this to her for Christmas, she will be so surprised!
5.0	Bought this for my 4 1/2 year old for Christmas.  WOW!!  They don't make toys like this anymore! Very sturdy!! Much better then all those plastic match box sets we have that fall apart about every time he plays with them.  He loves this toy and I can seem him playing with it for years to come!!  He plays with his cars on it and even his action figures!! This is a must have for a little boy!!
1.0	Was very unsatisfied with this item.
5.0	Used for r party gifts
5.0	Awesome card LOOKS LIKE A MAGIC THE GATHERING MONSTER!!
5.0	I love it!  It came sooner than promised and was the perfect accent for the occasion.
1.0	Everything sticks to it, you need a lint remover if you want to have to doll. I would not recommend this toy.
5.0	Just as pictured.  Great quality.
5.0	I have as much fun with these as my girls.  They aren't something you'd play with for hours and days, but intermittently they are entertaining.<br />My daughters like to make elaborate moving trails with them.  I like to think they're learning some basic mechanics through using them.
5.0	Happy with this. Beautiful!
5.0	I bought this Moroccan Barbie for my 8 year old daughter. She has an Extensive Barbie Princess of the World collection. This is not from the Barbie Princess series, but my daughter is half Moroccan so we decided to sample this series as well. It is not as elaborate as a Princess Doll, but it is very beautiful as well. Something I would hope for is that Barbie does make a Princess of Morocco Doll. My daughter does not play with these dolls, so I can't say that it is fun or not. It is fun when she reads the nice story on the back of the box. Now her dress is not what I would consider traditional Morrocan folk costume, which is what many dolls of the world come in. She looks more Turkish in style. Formal Moroccan Atire usually consist of heavily embroiderd design in 2 layers (a solid layer beneath an elaborate and intricate top layer). There is also a wide belt that fits sunggly around the smallest part of the waist (usually right under the bossom). This keeps the long dress from dragging on the floor. Also, if the woman wears a scarf it would fit more traditionally, like most Muslim women. She would probably not have a scarf just laying on top of her head like this. Now a Princess would be dressed formally like what I described. In the past, she would not be seen outside the harem uncovered. She would be veiled. Within the harem in the presence of her immediate family and other women of the palace she would have no need for a veil at all. Her hair would probably be down or loosely braided and if she is the Kings daughter she may wear a small circlet/crown (but not necessarily so... seeing that crowns are usually worn on state occasions, and not until the new present King of Morocco, were the royal wives, daughters, and sisters, publically apart of these). A folk costume would be much more vibrant in color and have ebroidery all around the hems of the gown. She would also be decked out in colorful beads and a colorful scarf (especially if she is from the desert areas of Morocco where many Berber tribes live). Folk Morocco is very tribal like. They also decorate their bodies with henna. It would kind of be a little like the Mayan Traditional Dress (sort of). They use similar tribal design and colors.f Morocco where many Berber tribes live). Folk Morocco is very tribal like. They also decorate their bodies with henna. It would kind of be a little like the Mayan Traditional Dress (sort of). They use similar tribal design and colors.
5.0	This was high on my granddaughter's Christmas list and she adores it! The face is very sweet and realistic! Very, very pleased!
5.0	I am a diehard Scarface fan, and when I saw this product, I absolutely had to have it! I have the other Scarface Funko POP! item, but when I saw this one in the car, I flipped! It's almost identical to the car in the movie with the tiger-striped interior! My husband and I have nearly fifty Funko POP! products, and this one has got to be my favorite! It was received very quickly (within two days, I believe) and undamaged. I would definitely repurchase from this seller. Thank you so much! It made my day!
5.0	"I bought this locally for one of our daughters who likes \\""Rainbow Dash\\"" of My Little Pony. This plush version of Rainbow Dash is complete with her \\""cutie mark\\"" and is really sweet, soft and a fun change from the little plastic figure collection of MLP figures that our daughters have acquired. This plush is stitched well and the legs are sturdy enough so that she stands on her own nicely. Our daughter likes it and I'd recommend this as a great little gift for any Rainbow Dash fan :)"
5.0	Let's just say my daughter is an even bigger Star Wars fanatic now
1.0	Was the size of a small leggo set  very disappointing  Looked much bigger in picture.  A lot of money for so little
5.0	"I'm shocked at reading these reviews. What did people think they were buying? Did you think you'd open it and it would automagically start levitating on it's own? It's a skill based activity that takes practice.<br /><br />This is like buying a guitar because you think it sounds great when someone on the TV is playing it, then getting upset because you can't play dragonforce as soon as you open the box.  I've been practicing contact juggling for 3 months now and it is a highly addictive side hobby. I highly recommend it for both it's meditative as well as it's physical benefits. I had somewhat of a retarded left hand (being very dominantly right handed), and contact juggling has pretty much made me ambidextrous, which is awesome. Plus it is very relaxing and a great time waster.<br /><br />As far as this product, it is exactly as described. A great ball for contact juggling, especially for beginners. It may look like just a \\""ball\\"", but the weight, material, and glossy coating make it perfect for contact juggling.<br /><br />DO NOT buy this product if you do not intend on spending hours upon hours upon days upon months getting good at it."
5.0	My son wanted these for Christmas they were a late gift but he loves it and chose to share the rings with his closest anime loving friends. Of course he chose to keep the one with the stone and wears it almost always. Only thing is if you have an allergy to certain metals it may turn your finger green where it is worn. this happend to one of his friends so she wears it on a chain around her neck. Thank you for the great item!
5.0	As soon as my son opened this gift, he put it out and wore it for the rest of the day. He even wore it out to dinner with his aunt. It is a fun gift for a child who is interested in aviation or space exploration. The quality and sizing was decent for the price.
5.0	This is exactly what I was looking for when I bought it.  This is the original card game.  I don't really care for the new editions they have now.
5.0	This is a terrific addition to our family game night. It's so simple to learn and the game can be played in 15 to 20 minutes. Everyone had a lot of fun. The dice have a combination of the letters that spell BUSTED and point values. You keep rolling and gaining points, but if you roll BUSTED before you stop and bank your points. well then you're busted and lose all your points for that round. We used to play Farkle all the time, but I think we'll be playing Busted from now on. Amazon has this listed as a card game, but it's not. It's a dice game.
5.0	It is fantastic. Clean and simple.
5.0	The Magz products are great ways to keep minds and hands busy creating! My son creates 3-D designs, while I read to him.  They are perfect for ages 12-99!
5.0	Used in combination with Tomica Sets to creat a model community. Serves its purpose although the minifigures are a little too big for the Tomica sets, but on the other hand, they are not architechtural models. Very educational for young toddler.
1.0	When it arribe the box and airplane has a damage
5.0	My daughter is going to love this when she opens her presents in 2 weeks
5.0	This was perfect for our little prince's first birthday! There is not a chin strap, but it does have an adjustable strap inside the hat. The hat fit perfectly and stayed on the entire time! Great quality too. I could not have been happier with my purchase.
5.0	I cant wait to see it all put together, my 9 year old has dozens of the Halo kits and is excited to get to it
5.0	This is a perfect addition to a Christmas village, especially if you don't want an electric or battery-operated train. One of the cars clearly has the 1998 year on it. I don't think this detracts from the train, but others might. If you don't want to use the car that has the 1998 date on it, there are still four other cars that can be used. I thought I was going to use this with my Christmas village, but I ended up purchasing a batter-operated train and used this as a decoration on my fireplace mantel, which worked perfectly.
5.0	Great, a must have accessory set for any forklift or cargo truck. I know I was wondering about the measurements so here they are. The boxes and baskets are 3 3/8&#34; x 2 1/4&#34; x 2 3/8&#34;h. The pallets are 3 3/8&#34; x 2 1/4 x 1/2&#34;h. I love these to go with my Bruder toys and I use some of them for candy and other things on my desk.
5.0	What can I say, the double back cards are exactly as described and work well with all illusions that are performed
5.0	I want the 100 coworkers in our office to feel special on their birthday but I don't have a great singing voice.  I take my little bear with me to sing Happy Birthday and give them a custom made card with their picture on it.  Have only had him for a few weeks but he is already a big hit!  Everyone gets a big kick out of him even mentioned  how cute it was to see his mouth moving while he was singing.  He sings very clearly and just the right volume.  Would definitely suggest him to a friend. August 17, 2015 - Have had Birthday Bear for 9 months now.  Still in like new condition and same batteries he came with.  Definitely a hit in our office.
5.0	Very pleased. Fits together well and is easy to use.
5.0	My grandsons love it so I love it!  ;-)
5.0	This collection of wordworld is perfect and best of all are pull apart animals soft and cuddly made of leters.  It is just amazing how quickly my baby learned letter recognition and puting words together in order thanks to these animals.   The whole family was amazed how those little hands could put togehter the dog, cat, zebra, cow, etc.. all animals in the set   together in a snap.  We started with the dog as it is her faforite animal, obviously - like most kids :) and then we gradually were adding on   animals untill we ended up with the whole set before we knew it. It is so rewording to see your tinny treasure to   be able to do words!!! that it is jsut breath taking.  We did not need any foring techinques, flash cards or anything, she was just grasping the concept from my taking apart   the animal, sounding the letters and puting them together back for her few times and then she got it like   in the same day and from that day on she knew.  I think this should be every paretnt's every baby first educational toy. It is so baby friendly, perfect for the sens of touch,   soft and cozy - what actually is said to develop brain faster.   It is sucha pleasing design and there are places to chew on if you need ha ha ha..   We take the animals everyhwere we go and she does not only have fun she is reinforcing her reading skills and preparing   for future writing without knowing it!   We were lucky to get the animals that were issued in those white boxed packaging with DVD inside. Not the other version in   the orangy cheaper packaging and without DVD. Difference is really apparent. I got the animals as a gift to my niece   but I could not find anywhere the first edition in white packaging with bluish background and DVd included in the box   so Igot the other set on e by and apparently they are not the same. Similar and all but the quality is not the same.   The original edition animals are more plumpy, solid, and have better and more baby friendly feel and touch to themwhereas the other - not the white box- edition has cheaper feel to it.   Overall we are very very pleased with the set. I have heard that this design got so many rewards and it is so popular among parents   and I totally agree with the notion. It is great for the baby and it teaches something useful for life unlike so many toys   that do nothing. It is good to see your baby having so much fun and stay engaged for good while with them.   It is amazing how long attention span the baby has while playing with the animals.  As she grows I marvel how she can put together the simple words from different animals for fun.. as in she would take   different letters from different animals and still spell the word dog or cat or cow correctly and giggles   that each letters is from different animal.. like for instance she will take L from the lion with the head,   then put i from the fish and then o from the dog and n from the lion again and she is so proud to do that.   It shows me that she is not only putting animal together, she is actually aware of the letters..   and to prove it she can take just the letters without heads and not color coded and at random   pull the letters and put together a word that is independent of characters..   soooooo cooooooooool   I am shopping for the original set now to get it for Christmas for two beloved babies in the family   and they are so hard to find, yet I won't stop till I find them. This is THE gift of learning and   I wont' settle for less :)
5.0	What a hit for my 9 year old Grandson. There are so many details on this. He screamed when he opened the package. He LOVES it.
5.0	I allowed my grandson to order the minifigures...at checkout we discovered they will not ship these tiny little toys via USPostage. If we had ordered all that he wanted, the $15 order would have had a $82 shipping and handling charge. The figures like all Lego toys are perfect in every way and durable and fun. I was simply surprised to be hijacked at checkout.
5.0	It was The Greek Olympics at m daughters school and we picked this out on a Tuesday night and it was hereby Thursday! Fit and looked just like we needed it to!
5.0	I bought this for my grandkids last month, had i known that they would<br />love it the way they do I would've gotten it awhile back. Love it.
5.0	"I gave this toy to my almost two niece.  It was an instant hit.  When her mother put it away, she would point to the shelf and beg: \\""Puzzle, puzzle\\"" to get it again.  The variety of pictures to fill in is impressive, and the statement about lead free paint very reassuring.  I will definitely buy it again for other wee relatives!"
5.0	Received 400 Lands<br />80 Island<br />80 Forest<br />80 Plains<br />79 Swamp<br />81 Mountain<br /><br />Ideal for beginners!
5.0	Finally, a plastic model for two of the most indispensable units in the Tyranids codex!<br /><br />Venomthropes are support units, granting a cover save to nearby allies and wielding powerful poisons for taking down high toughness enemies.  They are one of the best choices for the elites slots.<br /><br />Zoanthropes are synapse creatures with powerful psychic attacks and an invulnerable save.  Their psychic attacks are subject to mishaps and negation, so they are not quite as reliable as other choices such as Hive Guard.  Zoanthropes are the only things in the codex with anti-tank attacks at range.
5.0	Bday gift for my grandson and he put it on right there at the birthday party. He doesn't want to take it off.
5.0	This Elmo is exactly what it's described to be! Super fluffy and my nephew couldn't get enough of him! Thank you!
5.0	My grandson gets a lot of use out of this toy.
5.0	This toy is a huge hit. It's great - it changes color when you smack it, it's easy for the baby to hold and has a little mirror on the bottom. Plus it takes a beating. I highly recommend it!
5.0	Looks just like he does in the game. Awesome addition to my son's Minecraft items.
5.0	We've had this set for a few months now.  It has held up very well.  I love that the pieces aren't that thin hard plastic that breaks the second you step on it.  Most items are a soft, flexible plastic. My almost 2 year old daughter loves her food and plays with it daily.  I love the basket and bushel it comes with so everything can be stored nicely.  It contains a very nice variety of foods - lots of fruits and vegetables, snacks, drink, main entrées, and sweets.
5.0	Over all this item is perfect. Even though had to throw away 6 of them, it wasn't no big deal. Probably just got too hot. Other than that I have no problem with them.
5.0	A very cute, very soft and plush toad.  It's what my kid wanted for his Mario Collection and it fits in perfectly.
5.0	We love our solar butterfly.  This is our second one.  We bought the first in Lewes Delaware and I was heart broken when I wacked it with my hoe and broke it.  This is exactly like the first one and once I figured out to push the switch to solar power, it worked great. In fact I just had a friend comment on it and told him how to find it on Amazon!
5.0	We bought this item for our daughter for Christmas and she loved it out of the box.  She recognized some of the letters and used matching for the shapes in order to decide which piece to use to make the words.  Highly recommend this item.
5.0	She is very pretty. Shipping was fast. Daughter is happy!
5.0	We absolutely love these! We had the name brand of these first and enjoyed them but got very little for the price. We were able to get these on here for a great price and my kids were so excited. We played nonstop with them for weeks. We are not playing as often anymore but they are still a favorite. I definitely recommend this brand and they work with our name brand ones. I would also suggest whichever brand you go with, get the clear colors like these, not the solid ones. Our name brand ones are solid colored and not as much fun as these. These colors are so pretty and look great on our diy light table we have.
5.0	Awesome glow srarter for those deep in the heatsink engines. Makes starting your nitro models an ease. Its nice to find a company that has the right product at a fair price. Ill be checking this place out for other stuff for my hobby.
5.0	I bought two of these remote planes (the other was the Bravo) for my three year old twins.  The remote is very easy to understand and it fits in their hands really nice.  These planes actually move on our carpet, which surprised me.  Of course they do better on hard floors but the fact that they will even move on carpet is a good sign.  They have a great range from the remote to the plane...maybe too good :)  My kids were upstairs and I was downstairs, alone standing next to one of the planes, when it started moving.  Scared me pretty good but it turns out my son had the remote in the room above where I was standing.<br />I like the El Chupacabra one because it has a working propeller.  Although, I have to watch it when they play with it because it is only a matter of time before it gets stuck in my daughters hair.  I got these for a really good deal $6.70 each and I am more than happy with my purchase.
5.0	This Lamborghini is awesome. I would not expect it to come so soon. It has openable doors, trunk, and hood. If you are looking for a detailed Lamborghini Aventador, this is for you. Enjoy your new AVENTADOR.
5.0	The baby loves this and I love that it teaches him things!! This is one of his favorite toys!!
5.0	My wife is a big fan of the Rodent... She loves this little guy.
5.0	High-quality, stainless steel cookware.  The only concern is the metal handles on the pans - if used to cook with they could get very hot.
5.0	I'm a puzzle junkie. Once I start a new puzzle, it's hard to stop until it's done. When I was a teen, I seemed to get really sick every other winter holiday, and this puzzle was my go-to puzzle. Really surprised it's still around! I just purchased it to have in my own home, and can't wait to put it together after 15+ years since the last time I did it...
5.0	Amazing detail, totally legit. Got here really quick. Kind of a bi*ch to put together though .
5.0	I love this tumbler! It is fairly quiet and you can fit quite a bit in it.
5.0	What a great expansion pack! Adds so much more to the base game, and the cards and extra helipad makes it a lot more interesting!
5.0	Awesome product. Son loves it. Nice colors. Very durable.
5.0	I enjoy creating my webkinz-world house, and this cow came with a really cute  'virtual' bed!  The tag and code were intact, which is what I really cared about. The actual cow is cute and high quality too.
1.0	Due to the very limited description of this toy on the package we believed it included an actual spinning beyblade.  IT DOES NOT.  It is only a flashlight.  Pointless and useless.  Would have returned the item if we had discovered this before my 5 yr. old ripped the package open.
5.0	These are great toys for my daughter she is 5 and she loves them.<br /><br />5he loves the show and all she wanted for her bday was some of the dolls.  i ordered her 3 of them and it was the hit of the day.<br /><br />Great toy and if your kids don't watch the series then find it for them.
5.0	These batteries have worked great so far. I have only used them about 4-5 times each, but they last longer than the OEM 500mah batteries and they are only slightly bigger. The protective wrap the batteries are sealed in are really nice (much safer if you have a lipo melt-down or potential fire.)<br /><br />So far, a great product!
5.0	I own the full version of Cat in the Hat I Can Do That and I love it, but sometimes the kids are really rough on the pieces (especially the trick-a-ma-stick) and the game can get a little out of hand. The Card game has a matching twist to the original game which I love and the only extra piece to keep up with is the foam fish. All the kids I've played the card game with seem to have just as much fun as playing the original. I have given this game to a bunch of kids as a birthday or Christmas present.
5.0	I picked this up for my Aunt. She has always hated the flying monkeys from Oz. I really think she will love this though. I can't wait to see her face when she opens it.
5.0	Great gift! My son got this as an infant and played with this for years! Fun to play with and helps them learn letters!
5.0	I absolutely love it.  People think it's real!
5.0	This product comes in a nice box. Upon opening the float is very durable feeling. Didn't take long to blow up with my vacuum. My children LOVE this float and play with it daily now! I highly recommend this product if you want your children to have some fun in the pool! I received this product in exchange for my honest review.
5.0	I bought this for my son.  It arrived with the stickers off and he had to use a hot glue gun to keep the stickers on. A few minutes, he dropped it and it broke! He was very upset with the product. The good thing was that when he hot glued the stickers on them, they stayed on better than sticking them on. I would recommend buying two other old style beyblades before buying this. The good thing about it was that he got different beyblades than what it showed, but I got even better ones they were Dranzer f and dragoon f. I would recommend buying this but buy two beyblades first.
5.0	Awesome. Tons of sticks for waxing for little cost. Would buy again.
5.0	Ravensburger produces high quality and durable puzzles. Can be put together and taken apart numerous times. This motive is challenging and took more time than expected to put together.
5.0	It was Awesome thank you Amazon from jacob Garrett
5.0	I think mom is going to end up making this her little helper!
5.0	got this for the grandparents and the grandkids love their special table. it is extremely durable and sturdy and holds up to lots of wear and tear
5.0	My grandchildren loves this,they have not stopped playing with them. They even bring it to our house in Florida when they visited.
5.0	We were introduced to this game at a friend's game night and couldn't wait to get our own copy. This game is complex. Do to the complexity of the game, it's best suited to teenage and adult players. There are a variety of strategies and tactics that you can use to win the game and you can make your own path to victory. The game is too involved and complex for me to describe it in this review. Suffice it to say that this game is a long game, a complex game, a cut-throat game (like Monopoly), and very fun!<br />* 2 to 4 players<br />* Lots of little wooden pieces and cards<br />* playing board is cardboard so it's not durable or waterproof<br />* In the box, the game is large--close to the size of 2 shoeboxes.
5.0	Good table cloths and great for just a princess theme
5.0	i can't get enough of this game.  It is not for everyone.  Both of the additions are super I have really enjoyed them.  I highly recommend it!!
5.0	My kids love their big dinosaurs. They are great for small and older kids. I used them as center pieces for a party and everyone liked the idea.
5.0	Fun music and a great activity to do with my Grandchildren.
5.0	My son is over the moon for this!!
5.0	This is our grandson's favorite toy.
5.0	One of the best building/creating/engineering toys out there! I first started collecting them from Wendy's kids meals as Smart Links, but tried to find more at Christmas when I realized how much my 4 year old loved to build with them! After looking on eBay for them and losing bid after bid, I Googled them and found them by the name of Color Clix. I ordered the Intermediate pack and couldn't be happier - with free shipping on Amazon, they were cheaper than ebay collections! We love to build with these - they open up the imagination!!
5.0	use this track to make things easy and simple. A little dressup later and it looks as good as the hard to do hand build track systems. Won't be any of those dead spots and derailments etc.
5.0	I remember having this when I was 10..and my 10 and 13 year old love this still. Just fun to twist around....addicting.
5.0	Gave these to two colleagues that are retiring soon and they were a hit. Reasonably priced.
5.0	I got this as a Christmas gift and I love it!! Now I can travel with my Mahjong set and my lady friends are so jealous....The case is light and the tiles are just like my heavy set.
1.0	Aweful looking knockoffs.
5.0	Grandson loved it--especially the carry along part
5.0	Awesome transformer! BUT....don't get frustrated when you cannot figure out how to transform it back and forth at first (yes, even with the instructions). And be gentle when transforming it in the beginning until you get the feel, we popped Bumblebees arms and head off in the learning process, our son freaked out a little, but he is ok.  Luckily they pop right back on.  Just today was the first time I was able to transform it without the directions! Feeling pretty proud of myself! And my son is thrilled too! (It was his Christmas present but mom is loving it too.) Lol.
5.0	Totally works.  I was so tired of fishing dead critters out of my pool.  I don't think I've had a single death this year with animals.  Frogs have been my hardest in the past but not this year.
5.0	My granddaughters, ages 2 and 4, love LeapFrog and this book is perfect for them.  It holds their attention and they will &#34;play&#34; with it for a long time.
5.0	I've been palying with rubiks for many years, if you want to be fingering them all the time the where off and fall off. THis cube is way better, solid colors, great spin! Would def reccomend to everyone!
5.0	Great picnic table for toddlers. It is the perfect size and height. Clean up is quick and easy with it. The umbrella is a great addition during the summer when we use it outside. For now we keep it in side and it is his personal table for eating and doing crafts.
5.0	This barbie is definitely a collector's must- have and a collector's dream !  Nikki is stunning !<br />Really no words to describe her ..if you're a collector you MUST get her .....also amazon has THE best price .Love her !
5.0	Very well made. Colors are very bright . Love the quick delivery.
5.0	A lot of bands for little money!  They are great quality, and dont smell terrible.  My kids are loving them!
5.0	Our Grand Son greatly enjoyed this toy.
5.0	The order arrived on time and as advertized.. . . . . . . . . . . . .
5.0	I purchased this indoor soccer ball for my active 8 year old girl.  She and her sister, 10, played it in their grandparents apartment hall.  They love it and it kept them busy for 45 minutes.
5.0	My granddaughter loves these shoes.  Her favorite thing to do is  wear one pink and one yellow.  She mixes up the shoe colors..  why I do not know. But they  make her smile and feel like   the princess she is.  I have bought these twice.  Once for my niece and once for  my granddaughter. They are very  durable and fun to wear.
5.0	I received this as a shower gift. At first, I used it over the bassinet. My baby loved it; he would play with it and start grabbing onto the items before he was two months. I was so upset when he no longer fit into his bassinet. I did not know where to use it. I found two places, the car seat and his stroller. He is six months old and he especially loves the toy in his stroller. It keeps him occupied while I shop around.
5.0	Great collector's item! My 11yr old son loves this. The cape fans open and close. It comes with many small pieces to change the look of Batman such as his weapons.
5.0	My grandauther loves her lite brite, it was priced just right and received it in two business days.
1.0	Super cheap, super flimsy, piece of crap. you could probably get a better one out of a quarter machine.
5.0	this game gives us countless hours of laughter and fun. I bought this as a contribution to the creator of the game
5.0	I got this for my brother for Christmas and it is his favorite
1.0	I was shocked with how few logs came in this set for the size of the tin and for the price.  It is also a strange mix of logs with only one long log - what are suppose to do with that.  You can really only build one simple cabin with this set or one intense cabin with this set, not much more.  This set will only leave you wanting more to fill up your tin, which I guess you can do through ebay or garage sales because it doesn't sound like any of the new sets have many long pieces.
1.0	Barely moves.  Falls over a lot.  Piece of junk.  My cat doesn't even bat an eye when I turn this on for him to play with.
1.0	Terrible purchase - one of the two toys was broken within an hour of arriving and both officially no longer worked within a few days.  I should have returned these but 'time is of the essence' - not really worth the effort for shipping and cost to do so.  I certainly would not recommend this purchase.
5.0	Good experience will order again
1.0	Way to small for an older child<br />My daughter has to bend down to push it<br />Want to return it
5.0	Great price , gift for my precious grand daughter for Christmas!!
5.0	My son is now a puzzle master in the class (4 years old). He played this wooden storage box puzzles since he was one year old.<br />I think the box helps little kids to learn how large the puzzle should be and gives an idea where they need to start.
5.0	Yes, the Sunday School teacher was well pleased.
1.0	This toy/topper breaks into at least 5 pieces...all the time.  Every time we went to use it, Sir Topham Hatt's head was missing, or an arm was missing.  Then, we found the missing pieces, we would have to take apart the body, and try to get the arms and head in place while, simultaneously, snapping the body halves back together.  We eventually gave up, and he &#34;got lost.&#34;  This would be fine if you were just buying it to sit on tip of a cake...one time.  But any use beyond that, and you will be doing a lot of hide and seek with some pretty tiny pieces.
5.0	A+, very happy with purchase
5.0	this product was great and i will recommend to all people to shop at this store you will like thanks
5.0	Grandma didn't have to push or help balance grandchildren, also didn't have to worry about them falling off a regular bike. They said it was the best surprise yet. They loved them so much that the big wheels went back home to Maryland with them. Now what is grandma to do now? I guess I will have to rob the piggy bank and order two more for the summer of 2014.
5.0	Title says it all.  I bought these for all my nephews for Christmas, and had to get one for myself.  We've never had so much fun, and all other more expensive presents were ignored for the whole of the vacation.  Would and will buy again!
5.0	i love the game and It was better than I expected! great game! have already played with friends and family and they also got thrill with the game
5.0	I SAW OTHER TOYS BUT THEY WERE UGLLYS AND LOOK CHEAP, AND THE PRICE WAS ALMOST THE SAME. THESE (DARTH VADER, STORMTROOPER, BOBA FEET) ARE GREAT!<br />I RECOMMEND THEM!
5.0	Bought this for my granddaughter. She has always wanted a marble run. She has lots of fun playing with this.
5.0	My daughter had this exact same doll when she was younger and the movie had just came out. Its one of her favorites. She had lost it, and, I wanted to get her another one. She is 25 yrs old now and still talked about this doll. I had looked everywhere for it and couldn't find it. So happy I looked on Amazon!! The doll is the exact same one she had years ago. She was shocked when she opened the gift. EXCELLENT QUALITY! Shipped fast and packaging was great!
5.0	Perfect water toys for little ones, Especially if they love dino's, and they squirt as well.<br />Great colors and great shapes, very very cute.<br />Well made, great little plastic carrier. Perfect for indoors and outdoors as well.
1.0	Inhad to buy a second costume because the size chart was unclear.  I never heard back from them on how to return.
5.0	We have many of these costume sets and they have all held up wonderfully.  I love all the fun imagination sparking accessories!
1.0	I was really disappointed with this product.<br />I ordered it because it was a puzzle my family all did together when we were young.<br />I bought it and recieved the product about a week and a half later very damaged.<br />The box was torn all over and it looked like it had been in a garage for a long time...<br /><br />Still haven't done the puzzle, but I'm willing to bet that all of the pieces aren't there.<br /><br />Disappointed.<br /><br />Rachel
5.0	Work really well, both with legos, and off brand legos.
5.0	[[VIDEOID:86d44210bd85448de461312665693885]] For a more in-depth look of the product, watch my review video. I will list a summary of my experience with the product<br /><br />- Comes with an extra frame, battery, 4 sets of props, rubber feet, 2 motors, and 2 lights<br />- This is a great kit to replace broken parts on your Hubsan<br />- Quadcopters always break so having extra parts is a great way to continually have fun. I recommend buying a few of these to store for whenever you break a part<br />- You get props and a battery, for the price this is a great deal<br /><br />I received this product in exchange for a video review.
5.0	"Christmas evening this year saw my family gathered near the pretty lit tree, a Nativity scene atop the entertainment center and packages being handed out all around. Seven little mystery bags--one for each household--held these little critters.    The gathering quickly went from a happy peaceful time to all-out monkey warfare. Hey, who says only single-digit ages can have fun with Christmas presents? OK, my daughter was a little miffed that both her hubby and brother ganged up on her. But since they'd traveled across the country to be together, I opted not to shoot down their male bonding.    This is a fun little unexpected gift that makes faces light up with laughter (most of the time). The only problem is the \\""pockets\\"" on the monkey's hands where you place your fingers to shoot it just aren't very big--and I have small fingers. Apparently, everyone figured out how to use their monkeys anyway.    This gift also lent itself to a lot of primate fun. Before the party was over, we were subjected to monkeys screaming, flying and yes, being spanked.    As another reviewer mentioned, monkeys can start screaming before they're even out of their shipping containers. Our postal carrier had such a weird look on her face when she delivered the box. \\""What's that noise?\\"" she asked me. \\""Is somebody calling turkeys or something?\\"" I hadn't heard anything and concluded my poor frazzled mail lady had gone bonkers from the stress of the season. Then I heard the screech of the monkey and laughed out loud.    We ordered several monkeys and their masks and capes came in both red and black, so be prepared to take what you get. Personally it didn't matter to me at all. This was such a fun gift. Highly recommended for families with a sense of humor, friends, teachers or professors with tenure."
5.0	4.5 year old son loves this
5.0	This is the best for your small kid. Worth it.
5.0	A Great belt -- just 4 squares holds you up in the water!  I have found over the last 15 years that you have to find a belt that fits your body style.  This belt lets you adjust the squares to fit your body.  Jesus' Blessings and Peace
5.0	The Gorilla has a real look and it is adored and well liked.
5.0	My son saw this add on TV and wanted to order it for his sister (6) for her birthday.  She LOVES it.  The glitter and glue is high quality and stays on for a good week (with showers and swimming!)  The tattoos come out beautiful.  It is much better than the kits for girls you find in craft stores or Target.  The glitter is fine, not granular, and really sticks.  I was skeptical when I ordered but it really is a great product.  I'm wearing a Hawaiian flower tattoo now!  My son even loves it.  He has a dragon and a gecko.
5.0	I never thought this toy would keep my son occupied for months. He's a lego master, loves puzzles, but this seemed like the kind of toy he'd play with for 10 minutes and then cast away. In actual fact, we've had this one and its red companion piece on the kitchen counter for months and he loves to come home from school and just play around with both sets (they mix together, so if your child likes one, I'd get the X ball too). My son is 9 and hasn't lost interest in this toy even months later. Lots of mathematical beauty and a great book that comes with it, but he doesn't even need the book to unleash his creativity.
5.0	My daughter loved this!
5.0	Beach Head's real name is Wayne R. Sneeden. He was born and raised in Auburn, Alabama, living in abject poverty; this led to him being bullied and tormented by his classmates and peers throughout his growing years. In hopes of becoming more than what those taunted him believed he could be, Sneeden became an overachiever and ended up the valedictorian of his high school through hard work, unwavering discipline, and his keen mind.<br />Seeking the next challenge, he enlisted in the US Army, where he went through Airborne and Ranger school Ft. Benning, Georgia. After he completed training there, he went onto join Central America's Covert Ops as an Observer/Advisor. After his training in Central America, he returned to Ft. Benning as a lane instructor.<br />He was offered a spot in the G.I. Joe team as a Ranger and after he decided on the codename Beach Head, he joined, eager for the challenge being a member of the most elite force in the US military would bring.<br />His unwavering patience on and off the battlefield made him a legend - as did his intolerance of anyone not willing to live up to their full potential, something he makes quite clear to anyone he feels is a slacker and not working up to their potential. The consummate professional, he is determined and ruthless when needed to get the job done. However, his contempt for protocol and the chain of command have prevented him from being promoted. As it is well known, he would do things his own way by rushing headlong into things without consulting his superiors instead of recommending his ideas to the chain of command. Beach Head is the first off the copter laying down suppressive fire for the others and is the last back on the copter to protect the backs of his comrades.<br />Sneeden's habits include getting up hours before his teammates and going on a 10-mile run, then undergoing rigorous physical training that make the most gung-ho of his comrades weary - and all before breakfast.<br />[edit]
5.0	"This is the perfect game for toddlers and pre-schoolers. My daughter LOVES it! You can play with the red stack of cards or the blue stack or both together for a longer game. You spread your animal cards out in front of you and take turns reading one of your cards. One side says \\""I have...\\"" and the other says \\""Who has...?\\"" It's a race to see who can get rid of their cards first by answering the player's \\""who has?\\"" request with one of their own cards. It's great for learning how to take turns, simple sentences, and animals."
5.0	The pieces are high quality and are easy to integrate. It is a very good material and indispensable for those who like to play RPG with miniatures. It's a good choice
5.0	My two sons (6&4) love these sort of pop up structures. Over the years we've had half a dozen types, and this is my absolute favorite. It is the first one that has lasted out a full year without getting broken in some way. They have no problem putting it up or folding it back down themselves. And unlike others we've had, it doesn't collapse on them while they're playing. It fits nicely behind their bookshelf, but unfolded it's big enough for them to play in it together. The only downside is the tunnels are quite small. Neither boy generally gets them out, though my 9mo old daughter will play in them when I set it up for her. I would highly recommend this for kids under 6.
5.0	My daughter's first pillow pet met an unfortunate end.  This was a great replacement.  The size is great (not too small) and it is well made and durable.  This lives full time in her bed and has held up well to repeated washings.
5.0	Arrived in a timely fashion. Price was good. Packaging was good. My son loves the toy. Sturdy quality. I'd like to see a Clubber Lange doll.
5.0	super cute. high quality.
5.0	I love it-I have the ear rings to match.
5.0	who cant love silly putty?!?!?
5.0	My 4yo loves to change her dolls clothes and accessories.  They are very easy to put on/take off and give her hours of play time.  The quality is great too.
5.0	If your looking for a belly laugh gift give this to someone who really needs it, it comes in handy and big stress reliever have shared with several people everyone loves it!!!!
1.0	No paint, no logos or stickers....just a box full of balsa wood! How stupid.  Should have just purchased one already built. The directions say that you are to put a screw in the side of the piece of wood that the power panel attaches to.  Problem is that it is paper thin!  Impossible to do!  Will need to buy another piece of wood now!<br /><br />Take away....if you want a field box that looks like the picture you see here, DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!!!!.  If you love to build shit just for the sake of building shit then go for it.  I would rather spend time building (or flying a plane) than putting box together.
5.0	Christmas present.  looks like fun and a stomp up from our rocket balloons.
5.0	We purchased this as a gift for a 7 yr old but we do have one of our own that was purchased 2 yrs ago.  Easy to install and it has held up well over the years.
5.0	Needed more Imaginext figures to go with the Imagainext structures my grandsons already have. We needed more villians for &#34;Superheroes vs villians&#34;.
5.0	12 yr old grandson loved it.  Now he really thinks he's James Bond.  It has orange insert on end,<br />otherwise would be hard to tell from real gun.
5.0	As expected，this car is very good
5.0	Great product for little kids - don't expect it to sound that great, the notes almost sound wonky, but it's a fun toy for kids, and looks like a real piano - they love playing with it!!
5.0	My son has loved these for years, I was glad to finally purchase a set for him. Product arrived in a timely manner and in great condition.
1.0	*WARNING* The seller of this product is a scammer! I just bought this toy and received it and realized I had bought the wrong toy. I simply asked to return it and received an email back from the seller saying the would do the return but I have to pay $36 to &#34;restock&#34; the toy and I have to pay priority mail to send it back so they can have it available to rip off more people before Christmas! I've never dealt with a seller like this on Amazon. This toy can be bought on Ebay for $99 or a toy almost identical to it for $24.99 at Wal-Mart. This you DOES NOTHING spectacular, especially for $189! You push a button and the mouth lights up! This seller has the WORST customer service I've ever encountered! DON'T BUY FROM THIS SELLER!
5.0	"Killer Croc is one of my favorite Batman villians, right up there with Scarecrow, Joker, and Mad Hatter. This action figure is awesome! This highly detailed and artfully sculped figure is probably one of the most frightening representations of this homicidal freak of nature yet. It even comes with a human skull, (it that doesn't tell you something). This figure is based on the image of Killer Croc as he appears in the Batman story \\""Hush\\"".<br /><br />After seeing this action figure up close there's no doubt that Batman would need everything in his arsenal to defeat this killer. Every serious fan should one of these in his collection. Great durable toy for kids or just standing on the shelf in my office, a real keeper."
5.0	Came quick and looks very real.
5.0	I bought this toy for a child I was working with last semester and it looks just like the video game character.  I've seen some long legged ugly things in Toy R Us but this one looks like the cartoon and holds up well.  I cut the stitches holding the hands to the torso to allow more flexibility.  He loves it.
5.0	great birthday gift for son...nice toy
5.0	Love this version of scrabble, is durable, sturdy and convenient. I have 3 kids, 6, 8, 12 and we all play and enjoy it. The 2 drawers to store the letters and other pieces is convenient and also the pouch to store the letters. Also this board has wheels and you can rotate the board easily. Will recommend it to everyone.
5.0	I purchased this dress for my granddaughter's 5th birthday. She just loves it! Wears it all the time. Beautiful dress!
5.0	It is durable and it looks fancy and gorgeous. loving it so far. haven't use it as much but it double sided so you can do a quick or a long game
5.0	Great toy for the older children.  works great and keeps them occupied! ;)
1.0	I bought this helicopter at a mall for christmas. This helicopter starts up all by itself flew off and destroy itself dont buy this junk.
5.0	I'd buy from this company again.  They accidentally sent the wrong sized banana and when I called about it, they bent over backward to fix the problem.  In fact, they were probably the nicest, most helpful company I've ever dealt with.  Not to mention, the product itself was excellent quality, arrived promptly and delighted my little girl.  Next time she wants a stuffed toy, I will direct her to products from BigPlush.  I was very happy with the whole experience.
5.0	The purchase is for my halloween costume this year.  I will use the purse to carry my hotel key, phone and money in.  It has plently of room.  Aside from it being a purse it also becomes part of my costume as I will be being a  cat.  It's very well made and I am having a hard time keeping it out of the hands of my 2yr old grandson who said its &#34;his kitty&#34;.  It would make a great gift for any child.  There is nothing about it I don't like.  Its awesome.
1.0	The product is listed as new, but comes balled up with a rubber band holding it together.  This item is sold at Academy for $2 less and comes in a box.  If I had known there was no box (not in the listing), I would have bought it at the store.  If it was not a gift, it might have been ok, but how do you wrap a balled up inflatable with no label or picture?  I would rather not have to explain what the toy is to a 3 year old when I can get one with a box and picture.
5.0	This is an amazing item
5.0	GIFT FOR MY GRANDSON...HE LOVES IT. MADE HIS BIRTHDAY A GOOD TIME WITH HIM AND HIS COUSINS THANKS SO MUCH.
5.0	I have been using these excellent batteries for my UDI U818A Quadcopter and they are far better than the cheap 500mAh Battery that comes with the unit.  I will admit that these batteries are larger and I have to install them under the camera but they fit snug.  My flying time is roughly around 12 to 14 minutes.<br /><br />One more thing I like about these batteries over the cheap 500mAh batteries:  My quadcopter does not shut off and drop in mid flight - they lose juice and my quad drops in altitude and then I bring it home to cool and get a fresh battery.<br /><br />I have 3 of these and plan on getting 2 more  *** Great Buy ***
5.0	Great case and very nice quality. Highly recommended. Cars look great in it
5.0	I bought this chess set for my husband, he enjoys the game on a daily basis. The board came in excellent condition. I'm happy that he is happy. Thanks again Amazon.
5.0	Bought this bag as a diaper bag. Love it.
5.0	I bought these for my 10 year old that likes to make bracelets.  When I bought the bracelet kit Wonder Loom for $12 and only received 600 rubber bands.  This gave her the extra to make the fun last at a perfect price!
5.0	My 2 and 4 year old boys love this! I bought them each a shield and they are fighting bad guys and the winter soldier all day long. It has held up pretty good for about 2 months of almost constant use and rough play that includes throwing the shield like Captain America!  It does have a few chips and cracks around the edges but has held up great considering :)
5.0	Received product timely and as expected.
5.0	My nephew just loved this play set! He started rescuing people and pets right away!
5.0	I couldn't wait to assemble this product for my son. His dad is a huge yankees fan, and we absolutely love it! It works great for his towels,hats, coats, and it will get a lot of use as he older. The best part is that it grows with him and its easy to assemble.
5.0	Tough, sturdy, and heavy. Make sure you have stiff shocks.
5.0	Good Product.  Work as Promise  Great recorder and east to control. Great Value!
5.0	My 10-year-old daughter received this and was able to do it completely by herself. She thought it was fun and easy to do.
5.0	my 4 year-old daughter liked it, that is safe and can be fun, but also to learn.
5.0	arrived before and really new!
1.0	i hate this toy.  it turns evil with the slightest provocation and scared the heck out of my little girl.  it takes quite a lot of work to make it a good Furby again.  we ended up taking the batteries out of it and still my little girl won't play with it because she's frightened of it.  bad bad toy.
5.0	This metal die-cast model requires a small amount of simple assembly.  Great detail.  Not for small children to play with though.  They could probably break off the wheels and other small parts in short order.
5.0	Great paints, the only bad thing is that i got a cygnar base instead of the trollblood base :/
5.0	I bought this table and chair set today at my local TRU.  Before I opened the box, I called Little Tikes to make sure I could buy more chairs.  I have three daughters and watch a little boy, so two chairs just won't do.  However, TRU didn't have anything with more than two, and Little Tikes has rarely failed me in the past so I chose this set. ...<br />When I assembled the table, it was a snap...or should I say screw?  Literally all I had to do was screw the pink legs into the table top.  I think it took me longer to open the box than it did to set up the table.  The chairs are all one piece plastic.<br />The table is a tad wobbly, which is why I gave it a 4 on durability.  I have no doubt that one of my kids will attempt to stand on it the instant my back is turned.  I don't feel that it will collapse, but it will wobble enough, in my opinion, to set them off balance.  My youngest daughter is 18 months old and a little on the short side, but she has no problems sitting in the chairs.  <br />This purchase was a long time coming for me.  I considered for a time a nice wooden set, but in the end decided that the durability and fun appeal of a Little Tikes product outweighed the cutsie-sophisticated idea of a wooden set.  Plus there will inevitably be crayon and marker scribbles, jelly and yogurt spills, and toy hammer misses...I would rather my kids learn and enjoy themselves on a plastic set that can take it than worry and protect a wooden set and hinder them.<br />NOTE:  The extra chairs arrived today, one week after I called and ordered them from LT.  My experience with their Customer Service department was excellent and highly efficient.  Most importantly, there's no more fights over who's turn it is to sit in the chairs!
5.0	A beautiful set of tiles. Good quality and everything fits nicely in the pink case. I get compliments every time I use it.
5.0	My granddaughter has 3 or 4 sets of legos but did not have smaller sets like this. She loves it.
5.0	I love this figure. Her pose is so cute!!! She is well done for a lower price figure. She is worth every penny.
5.0	I bought this swing for my daughter & I love it so much, it's easy to get her in & out of.Easy to install. Makes me feel safe that it holds her in so well.
5.0	As the old lady on the block, I bought this pack so that I could hand out the cars to all the little boys on my block.  They're perfect little gifts for like today, when I congratulated Anthony on graduating kindergarten.
5.0	It's hard to find things for Loki fans, and this was a perfect gift!  Whimsical and it won't fall apart.
5.0	This map puzzle is beautiful and challenging. THere are lines under the pieces, but it only has the capital, not the name of the state. I work on it with my 2.5 yr old boy, and he enjoys it. The back of it has information on the states: bird, flower, population, size and motto. Nice job Melissa & Doug.
5.0	My husband and I just bought this toy for our little girl for Christmas and she LOVES it! It is great! The music is fun (I can see it getting a tad annoying over time though) and it teaches the letters really well. Obviously, our 14 month old isn't going to be comprehending all the letters for a little while yet, but she loves putting the alphabet blocks in the slot at the top of the train. The assembly took us about 2 minutes, it was so easy! and it seems like it will be really durable. Because of the plastic wheels, it rolls great on carpet as well as smooth surfaces. It is also a great walker for kids who are trying to get the hang of walking. My little girl just walks up and down the hall and is even strong enough (or the train is light enough) that she can maneuver it in whatever direction she needs to. Overall, we love this toy and so does she!
5.0	Great if you are going to the beach and need a spot for your little one to nap
5.0	Very nice toy it used to only be available via the Build-A-Bear at the Saint Louis Zoo. I'm very happy that Build-A-Bear is offering it online..
5.0	I have another puzzle with a Jane Wooster seen also.  It also has the larger puzzle pieces.  THis makes it a great family puzzle, as kids and adults can work at it together.  I have an eight and six year old.  It also doesn't take to long to complete a large puzzle.  We really like this size puzzle pieces.
1.0	It was very cheaply made - looked much better in the pics.  A few pieces broke even before they were used.  ie the fireman hat, flashlight and other cute items were little plastic charm like pieces.  The best part, the &#34;fire extinguisher (fo lack of what else to call it), did not work - we filled it with water and it did not do much.  The only thing my 5 year old grandson used was the hammer, it has a semblance of reality.<br /><br />Overpriced, underused, and not the way it appeared.
5.0	It was perfect and would have cost much more at a chain store!  Our daughter loved it and really really completed the costume.  We ordered it only a few days before Halloween and were worried that it wouldn't arrive in time, but it made it with a day or two to spare.
5.0	SOOOO SOFT!!!!!!!! I LOVE IT!!! BOUGHT FOR MY 5 YEAR OLD NIECE.  SHE WAS IN LOVE!!!!! SUCH A CUTE FACE!!! ADORABLE!!!  HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!!
5.0	My son has a blast using these! Family play doh time is awesome! Almost everyday he asks to play with play doh!
5.0	hardest to find, and yet.. the most gratifying.
5.0	This NERF gun will help you bring the heat in any NERF gun battle! With a reserve of 40 discs and the SlamFire feature, your lesser opponents will have difficulty attacking you. The only downside is trying to recover ALL 40 discs! If your enemies fire the same discs, you end up just supplying their guns.
5.0	My daughter picked this out for her Madam Alexander doll, as well as, her American Girl doll.  It fits both dolls well.  It appears to be made well...sturdy fabric and stitching to withstand the uncoordinated pulling of little girl hands trying to get it on a doll.  I do have to help her a bit to get it over the arms/hands, but the velcro makes it easy for her to finish the job.
5.0	I gave this Air Hog to both by grown son-in-laws.  They have never had so much fun at Christmas.  I believe in giving everyone a toy for Christmas.  Who knew that two grown men would have so much fun?
5.0	"This doll is very good looking by far he looks better than the other males in this collection. His hair is like Velvet his jeans fit to perfection. This doll is a must have he also looks good with \\""Any\\"" of the females in this collection!."
5.0	"First of all.  If your child is good drawer and you want them to do the artwork then you need not read further!  Or if you or the child would prefer that the entire project be truly from the child, then you need not continue to read.  However, if your child does not draw well and/or can't draw the story they would like to tell, then my review might be worth reading!<br /><br />With that said, here is a way to have a more refined looking book but still give the child majority of the creative process.  My concern as a parent of a 6 year old was that her artwork would be very, very bad.  She can do certain drawings, but when trying to draw specific items that would accompany a story might prove problematic.  So here is my solution.  However, you must have a scanner to do this!<br /><br />Go find a coloring book that is sort of \\""theme\\"" oriented.  I went to Dollar General and picked up a book for 1 dollar that featured princesses.  The book had pics of princesses walking in the woods and baking a cake and smelling flowers and a handsome princes, etc.<br /><br />So you get 12 pages for your story and 4 bonus pages. You can have your child look at the pics and sort of guide her toward a possible story.  Ask her what she thinks is \\""happening\\"" in each picture. Ask her how the princess feels in this pic or what do you think she was thinking in that pic.  Then you will have to finalize which 12 pics will go into your book.  Have the child color each pic and I am going to cut off the margins.  Then find a way to have your child write the story.  I am going to use publisher to create a text box that has horizontal lines spaced far enough apart that my child can do the written part of the story.  If you don't have publisher, I would recommend cutting out parts of a lined sheet of notebook paper and perhaps cut off the red line.  The good thing about what I am suggesting is that the colored pic and the text are seperate items.  That way if a child messes up on the written part, the picture will NOT have to be re-colored.<br /><br />Then, what i did was write the ruff draft having my daughter \\""drive\\"" the story.  I was careful to keep a balance between me helping with the wording and her having control of the writing. I wanted the story to be understandable but I wanted the book to be her creation.  I did help her with spelling.  The amount that you helped the child is totally your call.<br /><br />I suggest to make this a project over several weeks so that the child will do their best on each page.  We did the outline of the story and 3 pages and she was done.  For my daughter, I used crayons b/c makers made a worse pic.  Note: you are instructed to NOT use crayons with the hard copy pages, but I confirmed with customer service that if you are submitting PDF files, then colored pages are fine.  I just recommend doing \\""hard\\"" coloring so the colors do not get washed out.<br /><br />Finally, I have not done this yet, but I plan to scan each of the 12 pics with the appropriate part of the story underneath each one and submit the story.  I would definitely include page numbers on each page.<br /><br />I do not have the final copy yet, but I know my daughter was very excited about doing her best on coloring page and she really go into telling me the story.<br /><br />Just my 2 cents.  You might want to call customer service to confirm this before investing all of the time required. I will post again after the project is completed.<br /><br />I did run all this by customer support and they approved.  However, I am not guaranteeing anything.<br /><br />Keith"
5.0	I am mostly an RC pilot however I do own a few cars including an associated RC-10T.  I am fairly familiar with RC cars and their features.  For the money and value this car is just awesome.  People are buying the retail VXL and removing the electronics and selling the rest as rollers on eBay.  That's how good of a deal this is.  The car is a performance monster, waterproof and 4wd!<br /><br />4wd - This is very important and not for the reason you would think.  When I used to drive my RC-10T I was always disappointed with cornering.  No matter how hard you work the rear end has problem with corners.  There is a good reason for this too.  It is very hard to corner with a car that has rear wheel breaks.  The double advantage of 4wd is front wheel braking and additional traction.  It's a double bang that really pays of for the Mini Revo.<br /><br />Waterprof - Everyone takes their RC car outside in wet weather at some point.  Usually it's a short trip until some electronic part fails and you have to return home.  The revo takes this whole thing a step further.  This is probably the first car I can consider running on a beach and not worrying.  Everything is water prof.  The only thing to worry about is the batteries you choose to use.  Note: when I'm done playing with my car I rinse it under the sink to clean it off.<br /><br />Even with the 7v stock battery the Mini Revo has good performance.  Add a 3s lipo and this is basically a 1/16 scale corvette.  There is so much power you can't use it all.  I can have my car loafing down the road doing 10 mph and punch the throttle and the front wheels still come off the ground.  Two 3s 1550 mah lipos give you insane fun for 30min constant run.<br /><br />Advice:<br /><br />Get a real battery charger.  This will be usable with any RC hobbies and will be needed to have fun with the Mini Revo using either Lipo or stock Nmhi batteries.<br /><br />Get a Traxxas heat sink for the motor.  In a 14v configuration the motor gets hot andwill need cooling help.<br /><br />Batteries, this car uses a dual enclosed battery compartments.  It's hard to find batteries that fit and are not very expensive.  The best value for this car that definitely fit is the HobbyKing Rhino 3s 1550 25C batteries.  The dimensions of these batteries are 95mm long by 35mm wide by 22mm thick.  Even though this car is screaming with power, the 2 Rhino batters come out of the car totally cold every time.  They don't even break a mild sweat when you driving hard.  For this configuration you will need to build/buy a cable to run the batteries in parallel.  This effectively gives you a 3000 mah battery in a 1/16 scale car.<br /><br />For the money you can't beat the Mini Revo VXL
5.0	Bought for my niece who loves flamingos. She adores this little furry thing! So adorable.
5.0	purchased this for my nephew who loves all construction toys.  this is his second bruder.  probably a little too advanced for his age but he's enjoying it anyway.  the toy is very well made with ton of attention to detail.  i really can't say enough about that.  all the adults in the room want to play with this Bruder :)
5.0	Overall good quality.
1.0	Flat within a day. Very small. Unable to return as it was opened and used. Horrible. Do not buy
5.0	Keeps my three year old occupied without a mess
1.0	Box was all beat up wasn't package in another box it was re-taped motor in gun sounds like it's going to die not happy
1.0	Do not buy this is a scam you get 4-5 boosters per 25 and then you get 15-16 Collector chest. Complete waste of money
1.0	Too expensive for the dinky toy it turned out to be. I think the Nickelodeon, Paw Patrol names made the price high. Found better stuff at Wal Mart!
5.0	These worked great for our 3 year old's birthday party.
5.0	This was a great gift for my children! They loved it! Great teaching tool for coaches as well. Recommended. Buy for your children.
5.0	Bought these as gifts and fun for my daughters 3rd birthday! Exactly what I wanted! Children loved them! It was a great idea for the sword fighting also!
5.0	Excellent fun for family and friends. It's versatile format allows for a wide variety of strategies and always keeps the game fresh and challenging. And, if somehow you ever find yourself getting tired of the options, the available booster packs make for even more team combinations!
5.0	Very fun. Especially for a fan of Oz. Fluxx even worked with two people.
1.0	I want a new one. The one I got has a little rip in it and it keeps deflating.  How do I get a new one.  I don't want a refund!!!!!!
5.0	The Sneaky, Snacky Squirrel is a matching/sorting game for preschoolers, but fun for older children and parents as well.<br /><br />The Sneaky, Snacky Squirrel comes in a tree shaped box (a challenge to wrap).  <br /><br />The squirrel is a gripper, so players can refine their fine motor skills by using the squirrel to grab the acorns.  This can prove to be difficult for younger players (and some older players, too).  Sometimes we skip using  the squirrel or we just let the youngest play with the squirrel and we all use our hands to grab acorns.<br /><br />This game is recommended for ages 3-5.  For an educational experience (matching/sorting) it's definitely on the lower end of the age range.  My Kindergartener received this for her birthday and seemed far too advanced for the play pattern.  She could still benefit from trying to pick things up with the squirrel, though.  (Actually, I think the entire family can benefit from trying to pick things up with the squirrel.)<br /><br />My Kindergartener and 2nd Grader both enjoy the game and have made up their own set of rules to make the game last longer.  It's not educationally challenging for them, but we do like games that are just plain fun and The Sneaky, Snacky Squirrel fits the bill.  Plus the artwork and the entire concept is incredibly cute...unless you hate squirrels.<br /><br />All in all, a fun game for anyone to play with a preschooler.
5.0	So soft. My daughter fell in love.
5.0	Bought for a gift.. But I know she will Love it!<br />The actual doll head was much bigger than I expected!<br />And it has a button to push and she says something!<br />Couldn't ask for anything better!
5.0	My 3 year old got this balloon for his birthday.  It stayed inflated for week.  Seriously, like 4-5 weeks!  It's colorful and cute.  One side has Mario and the other side has Luigi (just like the picture).  Comes folded in an envelope.
5.0	This is a pretty cool way for kids to haul and store their hot wheels.  The only problem is my son has so many hot wheels I need about 10 of these!
5.0	My boyfriend's granddaughter loved this car.  Can't wait to see her imitate her dad this summer.  He's a police officer!
5.0	This was a hit with our grandchild.
5.0	I purchased this item for my granddaughter and she was very pleased. It's her first doll and I know she will love it for a lifetime.
5.0	Just fun , the kids immediately wanted to try this out, even the adults thought it was a lot of fun.
5.0	My Daughter loves it .
5.0	In general, I do not like games in tins. After having played this a fair number of times, I'm willing to make an exception. Builder takes a couple cues from classic Euro style board games and condenses it all down to a highly portable package. My only complaint is that it's not easy to remember how many actions you have, and which action you are on. Also, each game is truly fast, lasting no more than the 30 minute advertised game time. I'd like to see where else 'The Builders' franchise will go.
5.0	it a very well detailed model
5.0	I am reviewing this from the standpoint of the transaction as well as the product received only. (It is a Christmas gift for my two year old grandson so I can't go further for his response.)    I was astounded to find that when I ordered it one day, the next day it was at my front door--all with standard free shipping!    I couldn't be more pleased with the trike! It FAR excedes my expectation! Not only was it a snap to assemble, but in addition very well made. A great value!
5.0	I own the Fold and Go Jigsaw table and needed a larger board for 2000 piece puzzles.  This product was very well made and I place it on top of my fold and go table which allows me to still sit at the couch and put puzzles together.  It has a felt cover to place over the puzzle when not being used.  I was very pleased and would recommend the product for people wanting to transport 2000 piece puzzles around.  Great product and very satisfied.  Now we need one for 3000 piece puzzles??????  Thanks
5.0	I recently re-purchased this product. Mine is the older version that is black, red, and natural instead of the green, red, and natural pictured. I would not recommend this as a kid's game because there is one block where it dares you to switch an item of clothing with someone else, and one to kiss on a cheek. I know that isn't the worst thing in the world, me and my friends used to switch clothes a lot (HEY! I love your Batman shirt, can I wear it? SURE! And I want to wear your puppy shirt!). Sharing is caring. haha<br /><br />Anyway, I bought this because I had it in college, and LOVED it. It was a great party game. You can have all of the fun of Jenga, with the added fun of truth or dare. All of one colored block is dare, and the other color is truth. The natural blocks do not have anything written on them. THIS is where the fun begins. One can either them blank, (BORING!) or write your own truth or dares on them. Of course the dares on these (as well as the truths) could sometimes be more extreme.<br /><br />I was actually sad when I found out they stopped making this. I now have two of them. The one from college back home, and this replacement here with me in my new home. Totally worth the purchase.
5.0	awesome game. really teaches children. my kids always want to play it.
5.0	Soft, fun, squeezable delight that sits up tall for a fun time to be had by baby and toddler.
5.0	Honestly I would run 2 in the main deck and 2 in side board, for just in case. Honestly if you just run 2 your good. Because you pay out high for those lands. Most decks only run 20. Some with less. So honestly 3-5 Lands in a nice big hit.
5.0	The stickers I received are not identical to the picture, but close... they have a more colorful background (black and orange instead of white) and slightly different arrangement of stickers, but still feature all of the cars characters.  These are tiny stickers to use as rewards and my kids love them.  Only thing I dislike is that some of them have words on them instead of a Cars character.  Since my kids are too little to read, they don't want the words stickers.  Because there are only a few that have words, I still gave it 5 stars.  Still a great collection of Cars stickers including all the favorite characters.
5.0	The toy is made with Fisher-Prices detail for play qualities.  My grandson will love this.<br />It will be a Christmas gift.
5.0	A family classic!  If you don't own this game, buy it now.  One of our very favorites.
5.0	This little kitchen has been great for my daughter and other little friends of hers that come over to play.  Bought it last year when she was 2 1/2, and now at 3 1/2, she still enjoys it.  It's very well made,sturdy, easy to clean and we have had no problems with it once assembled.  As for the assembling part....there's quite a bit to it.  But let's face it - some of us just aren't cut out for that part on the night before Christmas.  I had a friend who enjoys that type of thing and is much more successful than I am, who did most of it.  Otherwise, great product.  I got it for $99 last year - and it's so much better and cuter than the plastic kitchens I have seen.
5.0	The design on the bottles make them extra cute
5.0	My grandson is sooooo happy. His father is too as he can help with the yardwork!!
5.0	This chess set was well worth th money. The board and pieces are larger than I expected. That was a nice surprise! I am very happy with this purchase!
5.0	GREAT FOR COLLECTORS. SUPER DETAIL AND QUALITY. GREAT FOR DISPLAY. NOT FOR LITTLE KIDS IF YOU WANT IT FOR COLLECTOR REASONS.
5.0	"Okay, My real name is Yasmin and I Love Soccer....People say I look alot like this doll lol... <br />However, As far as educational value is concerned in response to \\""a Kids review\\"" I would have to say this doll is, well; The girl is in a mini skort. I don't know how many girls play soccer in those. She isn't exactly wearing shin guards either, more like holey knee socks. They do match her cletes though. The ball is probably a size three, (way below standard size.)  <br />Since she is still in the box, I would have to take  a guess at her durability. Her overall frame seems strong, just her hair seems pretty delicate; it can easily get frazzeled. <br /> Overall, I think this doll is hot. Her soccer uniform is co ordinated and she does have the basic gear. Her make-up is pretty and her bag makes her appear as very professional.  As well, It doesn't hurt that she's like a mini me :p"
5.0	The puzzle material was excellent and I really liked the picture that I was to put together. The picture was sharp and focused. Also the pieces stayed together when you put them in the right spot. I glued it together, framed it and it hangs on our office wall.
5.0	I bought this for my daughter when she was 4 1/2 months old.  At first she was a little wary of it and just stood there looking at all the toys.  After I grabbed her legs and showed her what to do....that was it!!!  Now, I put her in the jumper and she starts wiggling her legs before I even get her in the seat.  She just has a blast and jumps straight up and down and even forwards and backwards too!  I think that this is much better than a doorway jumper because you can move it from room to room (although not too easily) and I have even taken it to grandma and grandpa's house!  Not only is it entertaining for her, but for all of us watching her with that great big grins and screeches of joy!  How could you not love it?
5.0	My 19month old LOVES this tricycle!!! His legs are a tiny bit too short to reach the pedals, but he has a ball pushing himself across the floor and his legs will be long enough in a few short weeks at the rate he grows!!! He also enjoys giving his toys a ride by pushing them around on the bike seat!!! Overall, this toy has already been hours of fun and will last for MANY years to come!!!
1.0	Cards were not as advertised - included none of the God cards. None of the cards in the photo were sent.
5.0	Exactly the same as the original and I had no issues installing or using it.
5.0	This Replica is really neat. My nephew is a Portal fan and loved it. It is strong built and doesn't feel cheap when holding it.<br />It is a perfect gift for portal fans.
5.0	Happy with the Product
1.0	The hat came shattered. It has no off button so it stays lit up. When the light bulb runs out, the plum bob is white.
5.0	Purchased for my granddaughter and she wears this everyday.  Best fit ever
5.0	As Betty collector it is hard to find items like this that look this good and yes I know I spelled her name wrong
5.0	My nephew love it! I bought Thomas the train for his birthday, he was so happy. He play a lot with it.
5.0	my granddaughter loves her Mini Samanatha doll!  she got the bigger doll from Santa.  ;)
5.0	my son loved it, it is resistent and it looks like the sword of the show, he plays a lot with this.
5.0	Works great.  Make sure the battery connector is plugged in all the way and it works perfectly. Each of the four LEDs goes out as each of the individual batteries are charged.  A must have for the Hubsan X4.
5.0	This is one of the &#34;favorite&#34; gifts my son got over the holidays - he LOVES it.
5.0	I love  all of it and so do the little  ones.
5.0	These are GREAT flashcards!!! They are very good quality and I LOVE that they have only one problem per card. The front has the problem without a solution and the back has the problem with the solution. This is so much easier for my kids to practice together, plus you can set aside the ones they've mastered and focus on the others without losing any problems.  The box they came in is nice and sturdy and will last a long time.  I highly recommend these to anyone!
5.0	"Our grandson is 22 mo. old but he's been playing with this at our house for 4 or 5 months, with supervision. The blocks are easy to grasp and he has learned to \\""push\\"" the sewing peg in with one hand and then to \\""pull\\"" it out with the other. Sometimes gravity works against him but he is very patient with it and enjoys getting all the blocks strung on. This toy has several levels of play...when he's older, he can string the blocks in a certain order and make up a story to tell as he's stringing. He is learning the words for each block right now. I am very glad to recommend this toy to parents and grandparents!"
5.0	I love this doll. Must have for Wizards & Selena Gomez fans, Boy or Girl. And the arms are supposed to come off , just like on monster high dolls it makes it easier to change clothes on the doll
5.0	I took them to a Christmas party and everyone loved them!
5.0	Super fun game. Simple to play.
5.0	thanks, man. came in a nice case, too. bloopbleepbblakn fdiejw fjdks hf dhdh 66 66 6 66 6 6 66
5.0	im loving building them i'm building the hole fleet plus the iss enterprise
5.0	I saw these for the first time on the show Big Brother - the producers gave the houseguests these to make for some interesting chatter.  It works at home too!  There are several versions - depending on the type of chatter you want to start.  Great fun!
5.0	I have triplets 2 year olds.  The love playing dress up.  They have such a good time dressing up as a knight slaying the dragon.
1.0	it does not speak English  and there is o way to fix it....
5.0	The boys love all the new ammo! They told me it shoots further than Nerf darts!
5.0	We bought this toy for our daughters first birthday. She is 16 months now, and is playing with it more than she did when she was 12 months. It is adorable.  It comes with a little family, beds and a table. My 3 year old son is always playing with it as well! Perfect size, and they enjoy pretending together with this toy!
5.0	I knew this gift was a hit when he started working with it immediately.  he didn't even want to go home because it would mean packing up the workshop
5.0	Was better than expected
5.0	These are small, as a key fob should be. I ordered four and cut them apart and sewed them flat onto a quilt.
5.0	Grandson loved this game!
5.0	I love it. It was perfect.
1.0	The cap was no fully sown,  It did not fit my 16&#34; bear.  One foot was smaller than the other.
5.0	My daughter loves it!!
5.0	Our son turns 4 this month and he loves the Design & Drill BrightWorks that he just got. He loves the colors and the fact he can use the drill just like daddy to put the bolts into the board. The back lighting for the bolts makes it fun to create a pattern just before bedtime so he can turn out the lights and see it glow. We love the fact that he is counting the number of bolts he needs of each color to create patterns plus he is recognizing shapes as he creates them with the bolts. It's also nice that if daddy is working on a home improvement project that our little guy can get his drill out and work to create something too! I can see where this is going to be a favorite toy as he moves from preschool to school age.
5.0	My godson loves this toy! It is really soft and life like.
1.0	The story is cute, but I was very, very, very upset that it opened with the issue of not believing in Santa.  For younger viewers, why introduce them to this idea?  For older ones, like my just turned 8 granddaughter (who still fervently believes), why reinforce the possibility?<br />There were many other plot lines that could have been developed.  After all, the elf is there to check on the child and report behavior to Santa.  He is not there to convince the child Santa is for real.<br />The book and doll are lots of fun, but this video is most disappointing.
5.0	I bought this to motivate my 12 year old daughter to do her chores and responsibilities.  We have tried several systems in the past and we, the parents, and our daughter could not stick to it on a weekly basis.  This systems has made a huge difference for our family.  My daughter would never keep her room clean and now that she started doing On Track! she makes her bed every morning and keeps her rooms clean, as well as her other chores without complaining anymore!!  She told me the other day &#34; Mom I like my room clean, I can't believe I used to like it the other way&#34;  I almost cried!  (Yes, her room was THAT bad)!  I would recommend this to anyone who wants a system that is easy to use and wants to help their child with  daily and weekly responsibilities and chores.
5.0	OK my daughter is Dyslexic and although she has gotten better at reading we could not get her to read a chapter book as required in school  She would only read books with short passages on each page and a picture.  During our parent teacher conference I explained to the teacher the problem we have and how reading a chapter book with alot of words per page can be very challenging for our daughter.  The teacher pulled out one of these and said they get lost easy so she has no more but she will give our daughter the last one so I can see how much it helps her.  I went home and it was like a miricle  this kid read her first chapter book without a problem! She loves the books we pick since for a 4th grader they are more age appropriate than picture books.  Anyway I ordered a package and the teacher is right they are small and thin and get lost easily but since the price isn't bad I don't mind ordering more I even ordered a package to send to the teacher to keep for other kids in the class.  So for anyone with a struggling reader this is definatly a huge help
5.0	I love toys that have more of an old school design.  This is a very simple toy but it's well made and very sturdy.  It can hold up to even the most vigorous play from little ones.  I've found it makes a great gift for any kid who likes Curious George.  It rolls well too.
5.0	This card is must have in any EDH deck containing 3 or more colors. It provides what you want and won't break your bank.
5.0	Item(s) received as described AND on time - thank you.
5.0	MY SON ADDED IT TO HIS COLLECTION
1.0	This product was such a disappointment!!!  The idea is cute, but breaks easily! You would think even mailing materials would have been more thought out! Not happy w/ this.
5.0	I bought this as a Christmas gift for my 2 year old nephew at the time.  It's very well made; and he loved it
5.0	My character is not an Elf but nonetheless they are very cool. The designs are great and the dice are well balanced and very fair. I've never had a finer set of dice. I always go Low Good on the Percentile dice and it always works for me!
5.0	A great figure, it's nice to have this figure from the cartoon mini series, and it's not a character that has been overdone.  He fits in well with the Eels color wise, so he looks nice to display with them.  The price isn't ridiculous either, so this is a great one to get.  The accessories fit pretty well, there is a hose that can slip out of the backpack, but mine stays on if you don't mess around with it too much.
5.0	so sweet - my daughter loves her! a great value for her first big doll....very happy with the quality of the doll.
5.0	My daughter LOVES this giraffe. She's a little over 3 feet tall and when she saw this it was almost like a 'My size Giraffe' instead of 'My size Barbie'.
5.0	My 5 yr. old daughter loves this. I was so excited to discover the games I had purchased for her LeapPad2 and LeapPad Watch could be utilized on this as well. Great educational tool that makes learning fun!
1.0	this is a bad toy I recommend Not buying this toy I thought the  bubbles came out of bubble monkeys mouth. its a waste of money I paid $30 for  this bubble monkey playset . this playset should be $5.
5.0	Product are really good packed!!! Love this care!! They are really cute!!! My daughter love them!!!
5.0	"Played this before and was DE-lighted to receive it as a gift. The sad part was that the train did not \\""choo-choo\\"" but they made getting a replacement VERY easy and very fast."
5.0	"Excellent.  Having fun is not always about an educational factor.  This is the best parent-son fun toy I have ever come across.  Sounds are very good.  I do prefer the cloth version, and these were a soft rubber material.  I had the cloth version when I ordered these and was surprised they were not cloth.  But they are an exceptional toy.  I gifted both together and they were the \\""hit\\"" of the Christmas celebration as soon as they were opened."
5.0	My daughter already had a plastic shopping cart with a lift out basket and seat for her baby dolls.  It was really cute but the wheels just never turned the right ways and she was always having trouble getting over varried turain.  I finally had enough and broke down and bought this one.  Singing nothing but songs of praise right now!<br /><br />My daughter LOVES this shopping cart.  It has a baby seat for her dolls but no lift out basket.  She doesn't seem to miss that at all since now this cart goes wherever she wants it to go.  It pushes easily over hardwood or carpet.  The leg supports to stop it from tipping are not too long so they never get hung up on the carpet.  If my daughter pushes down too hard on the cart the spring action in it stops the cart from toppleing over!  So far she hasn't even asked about the other cart or touched it since this one came in the house.  We love it!  You won't be disappointed.
5.0	This thing is pretty inexpensive and, as a result, it seems a little bit cheaply made. Due to the low price, I won't hold this against it. I did have to pull the wiring out of one of the motor support beams and re-splice it because it broke after a crash, but other than that, this thing has been a champ. I've crashed it many times and it keeps on going. The videos are really cool. I just took it to my family's easter celebration and everyone had a blast watching all the near-misses when I almost crashed it into trees and buildings. My mother loved the birds-eye views she got of her neighborhood.<br /><br />I didn't really understand most of the Chinese translations in this manual, but from messing around with it, I realized that if you hold the top right button on the control and press a direction on the right joystick, it will do a very quick flip in the air and recover as long as you're about 10 feet or more off the ground, which is really fun to watch.<br /><br />This thing has a few faults, but for the price, its a great deal IMO. If you can DIY repair minor electrical and mechanical problems, this thing should last a long time as long as you don't lose it in a tree or over water (would be sweet if it floated).
5.0	This card came in great time, and in wonderful condition. This card is great for mana-ramping, I love it.
5.0	The sound is crazy annoying but you cant help but to be glad that the kids are having fun. I brought 2...so each could have their own. And they love it.  great buy. Quality brand. Have other toys by this company.
5.0	Great combo gift for the girl with a AG doll.  I bought this set for my 8 yr old daughter because I also got her an amoire as well.  The hangers are durable plastic so unlikely they will break.  Brush is made specifically for the AG doll. Underwear fits but socks not so well unless a parent helps to get them on.  Overall, this is a great accessory item to buy for minimal cost.
5.0	Fits beautifully for my daughter's American girl doll.
1.0	I feel it is very dangerous for smaller children
5.0	Great service and gorgeous puzzles
5.0	Couldn't be more pleased with this toy! I am a grandmother of 4 wonderful grandchildren ages 7 to 3, 3 boys and 1 girl. I am always on the look-out for toys or games that lets their imagination soar. This did just that right out of the box.  It just happened that my 6 year old grandson and his 3 year sister were here when this box arrived. I couldn't get the packaging off quick enough and they were already playing with this. The 6 year is a huge Return of the Dragon fan, which is one of the reason's I purchased this castle. His little sister was almost as thrilled and was playing with the figures as I was battling to get this out of the packaging.  They both were finding all of the secret defenses and trying to play with everything right away. When I mentioned to him I thought he'd like to play with his dragons with this he said, &#34;That's a great Idea!&#34;.  Unfortunately for the kids, Mom and Dad came shortly after getting this set-up. This toy stays at Grandma's house, so they asked if I could keep it right where it was until they came again. Well, it was in the doorway because that is all the farther we got when it arrived. Needless to say, he also saw all of the accessories and is hoping to find more when he comes again.  I told him he just had Christmas in July! He thought that was a great idea!  Now on my part, Amazon has this at a great price. Wal-mart is way over priced at a over $40 and Target is better, but it is $30.  Amazon has the best selection of the accessories so we'll have to see what additional pieces are purchased! It's only been a short time, but so far it has been a big hit! I don't often get that lucky!
1.0	This toy nearly started a fire on my carpeting.  My 5 yr. old and 8 yr. old did not plug the battery pack in properly.  The plugs are not color-coded or sized differently to eliminate error.  Be careful!!!
5.0	Pink and glittery what's not to love! :) Easy to read numbers, durable. My set roll quite nice for me! :)
1.0	The Itza was flat when it arrived and I filled it with a standard pump as soon as my son opened it.  The ball immediately started hissing out air and is constantly flat. Holds air for maybe 10 minutes. I coach a ton and have filled numerous balls so it was not operator-error in the pumping.
5.0	These blocks are great. They are a good size, and there are enough of them to keep at least one or perhaps two children occupied for some time.<br /><br />All together in their case, they are HEAVY. Easily 20 pounds. (It specifies the weight somewhere, but it feels like decidedly more than I was expecting). Your child cannot drag this out by himself; if you want them accessible regularly, you will have to find them a home in your child's play area. You won't want to drag them out of a closet, particularly from a high shelf.
5.0	This might just be the most fun, most hilarious game i have ever played!! I almost wet my pants from laughing so hard. The only down side i have found is that although it says 2 players you really need four or more to get the most out it. Totally a must have for any party.
5.0	This is actually a lot bigger than I thought it would be. It fit a really good amount of toys. I don't imagine it lastly forever because it is made for value, not for quality. But for now it is a much better solution for my son's mountain of toys than the cardboard box that I had been using. Looks great.
5.0	My son loves his yeti, and sleeps with him every night. He is big, super soft and adorable.
5.0	Awesome game! My husband and I love to play it with other couples. It isn't overly complicated and is really fun!
5.0	These birds where very well made and were a great sucess with the children.  A good toy for a resonable amount of money.
5.0	This is a great game for 1-4 players. It says ages 8 and up and I agree with that assessment. It takes about 30 minutes per game and there's little luck involved, it is mostly logic and quick thinking, as well as strategy, which makes this a pretty challenging game! It's fast paced, mostly because all the payers play at once and try to earn the most points. It all sounds quite simple but really is challenging! Wonderful puzzle game that kids and adults will enjoy equally!
5.0	Purchased this for my 3 year old son's birthday and it was a hit. Great product.
5.0	I buy the good smile Nendoroid Snow Miku 2014 from Mount Fuji and it was the official. Thank you very much! The package was perfect and i had it early...
1.0	Don't hold light that well. They absorb blacklight well, but it fades quickly. Fun though!
5.0	I got this for my 5 year old daughter who loves Frozen.  I knew the puzzle would be easy for her, but it's Frozen and it's hard to find Frozen anything, so we got it - mainly for the tin.<br /><br />I've noticed a few people talking about using the tin as a lunchbox and that it broke fairly easily.  This was never intended to be a lunchbox.  Even the title just calls it a &#34;tin with handle&#34;.  If you're expecting to use it as a lunchbox, know that it won't last.  It's really just meant to store the puzzle in.
5.0	Very fun game to play with the family. My 9 year old figured it out pretty quickly.
5.0	I am not suppose to know I have this doll. I had made some notes about this brand of dolls and how much more you can poise them. When it came in mail I thought it was something I ordered but come to find out hubby read my notes about getting one of the Kidz N Cats doll some day and he got it for me for Christmas. He does not know I found it and opened it but taped the box back up and left it on the freezer outside where the postman leaves packages. Whew.....
5.0	I purchased this easel for my 21/2 year old grandaughter who is delighted with it.  The easel is adjustable, sturdy and should last a long time.  Highly recommended.
5.0	This copter is fun and is more responsive than my apache copter.But the apache is great also .The metal frame is nice and copter is very sturdy.You get a lot of helicopter for the money....I fly both every day!!!So much fun.
1.0	no metal parts and as cheap as they come.  Wheels dont move and rims didn't fit in tires.  Save your money
5.0	I kid, they hang wonderfully. I was lucky, I opened a pink sheep, the rarest sheep to find in the wild in-game! I love it. It has leg articulation and looks just as mindlessly derpy as the sheep in-game, and apparently defaults to &#34;flying pose&#34; when left on my bag. The pink is sort of a bubblegum pink with a touch of purple. It's very cute. I imagine the pigs are done the same colour. I watched a few unboxings on Youtube and there seems to be a rarity system of some sort. I don't want to state too many observations because kids read these reviews too and I don't want to ruin an awesome unboxing of cool hangers!<br /><br />The opening is fun and exciting as with most blind bags, but with the added coolness of something you can attach to a bag or something to show your friends!
5.0	Star Wars action figures are still the #1 selling toys among boys even 30 years after they first came out. When Hasbro went back to Vintage packaging, it was very pleasing to us older kids that was born in the 70's!    May the force be with you!
5.0	Adorable.  Looks great.  Needs it's back stitched up where the fluff was inserted... was disappointed with that.  It was probably made in a sweat shop somewhere so I'm not surprised and forgive the poor worker.  I can stitch it closed myself.  Would recommend and buy again.
5.0	I love Netrunner. It's my favorite game. Unfortunately if you don't buy a ton of expansions for it you aren't going to have enough cards to make a good Shaper, Haas Bioroid, or NBN deck. On the NBN side you won't get help here (I'm still waiting for a deluxe expansion that gives NBN enough cards to make a really great deck), but if you want to play a lot of Shaper or Haas Bioroid games, you need this expansion. Shaper cards in particular are hard to come by in a lot of expansions I've bought, so if you intend to play that faction this should be your first purchase after the core game. Haas Bioroid gets some decent cards here and there but this set will give you enough cards to make your ultimate deck and then some.<br /><br />I'm still trying out all these new cards, but every expansion I'm ever bought has had some great cards and some okay ones, so I expect to have a lot more fun now that I can finally play Shaper and Haas Bioroid decks. In fact, I'm so excited I decided to try a go as the Runner. You might want to buy this expansion as quickly as possible, because a lot of people realized it's pretty much the ONLY way to play Haas Bioroid and Shaper without buying a ton of expansions, and the price skyrockets when it gets scarce.
5.0	I recommend playing with at least 4 players, once you play you won't be able to put it away. You have been warned! : D
5.0	Got this for my wife for Christmas.  She is a huge walking dead fan and she absolutely loved this figure.  It was so detailed and lifelike. Even the individual arrows and knife in his sheath come out.  I have not had action figures since I was a kid and never did I have one of this quality.  Well worth the price.
1.0	It looks cute just for pictures but other than that, they are a death trap! Can't even stand up in them without sliding right out of them!
5.0	My daughter loves it!  She wants to collect them all now!  Was also cheaper than buying through Wal*Mart
5.0	Extremely huggable toy with educational features, such as learning about feelings, telling a story etc. Almost all parts of Scout has a spot that allows for the kid to touch and receive a response from Scout. The 'spots' are located on Scout's head, cheek, paws and back.<br /><br />It has 5 stories that come with it:<br /><br />1) Let's go Camping - Pattern Book<br />This book repeats a similar scenario and has progressive numbers i.e. 1,2,3,4 & 5 to introduce predictability to the kid<br /><br />2) Let's find Scout's Toy - Narrative Book<br />This is basically a simple story about Scout's toy.<br /><br />3) Let's have a Party - Concept Book<br />This book starts by introducing colors and have the colors combined to create a Rainbow party.<br /><br />4) Let's cheer up Eli - Rhyming Book<br />This is a rhyming book so that kid can learn about similar sounding words.<br /><br />5) Let's learn about the weather - Learn about Book<br />This is about the weather and has some answers to 'why' questions.<br /><br />This toy doubles up as a soft toy for the kid too! Great edu-tainment toy for kids!
5.0	This easily disassembles  and reassembles for transportation. The sides come off and reattach in less than a minute with no tools..
5.0	It's a Lego set, they are awesome.  How do you not give a 5 star review?
5.0	For the money you can't go wrong with Helicopter; Great starter or experience flyer.<br />This one can take a beating and can still fly with no issues. Very impressed with RC Helicopter. .
5.0	All my 7 yr olds Barbies were naked. We order this as it came with extra clothes and she loved iy.
1.0	"This product would be great, except that the Pooh saying on it has a spelling error, which for me is a pet peeve!  I don't want my daughter growing up thinking you spell disappear \\""disapear.\\""  I can't believe that this error would get by the manufacturers."
5.0	The best thing about this toy is that there are two of each shape and they are exactly the same color.  This is great because a parent can take one shape and the child can have the copy and they can see it is the same, then the parent can show the child where it goes and the child can copy the parent immediately. It's ideal!
5.0	Verry good, no problems
5.0	If you're into princesses, then this is an awesome thing to add to your princess collection. Our niece loved it.
5.0	Soo cute and soo soft. Got it for my boyfriend and he loves it!
5.0	High quality.  We've had others that split at the seams.  These have reinforced seams.
5.0	This was a huge hit with my almost 3 year old daughter.  She's played daily with her kitchen set for the better part of a year and I felt like she needed some new accessories to expand her play.  This totally did the trick.  All of the pieces are well constructed with plenty of realistic detail.  I was initially disappointed that the set wasn't bigger, but have since appreciated the fact that it doesn't take up more space than it needs to.  This set would make a great gift that isn't likely to be duplicated.
5.0	This walker is excellent<br />Used it since my son was just 10 months and he started walking on his birthday<br /><br />Here is a video of my son a few days before he began walking https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHFZk9toT9Y
5.0	Overall a fun build. The instructions had a couple of errors, but they were not too difficult to figure out. The train is a little fragile, but definitely looks beautiful. The Minifigs are another reason to get the train. You get most of the gang for a relatively good amount of money. This train definitely needs a motor and some track to make the playset a lot more enjoyable.
5.0	Seller chose the perfect one for my daughter. Very colorful and fashionable!
5.0	As expected. There were only a few cards that are unusable due to being a foreign language or the card being damaged. I didn't count duplicates but I don't remember seeing more than 4-5 copies of any given card.
5.0	With this toy we can enjoy the pool on hot summer days without the worry of carrying baby the entire time. She loves the octopus, and her favorite toy is the yellow fish.
1.0	"I wanted to purchase this as a gift for my grandsons after I saw the program on TV.  Unfortunately they saw it also and were dubious about having the elf in their house.  I tried to return the item, but after a very long time with many attempts to contact the seller, it was decided that I did not \\""qualify\\"" to return it.  The product may be wonderful, but it was not for my family, but now I am stuck with it, paying a much higher price than if I had purchased it locally.  An expensive and distasteful experience."
5.0	This thing is awesome! He loves it!
5.0	My daughter-in-law and I picked this out because it looked study and attractive, and it exceeded our expectations.  It looks like fine furniture!  My 18 month old grandson ran right past the toys to sit at his new table, and LOVES it!
5.0	looks good works well
5.0	Loved the turtle, shipped promptly
5.0	I wasn't sure if I would like this character, but I actually do.  Not only do you get a cosmic key with him, you get a decently sculpted figure!  While yes, it looks like He-Man in a burlap sack, it's still an interesting character from the tail end of the 1980's MOTU series.  Must have?  No.  Recommended:  Yes.
5.0	I love my dolphin it is so cute and love the color of it blue is my favorite color will order again in the future.  Keep up the good work would recommend to any dolphin lovers.
5.0	I didn't expect this product to be this giant at all. Some products says GIANT, but the moment you recevie it, it's not what you had visualize it. Well, this is exactly what I was looking for. It's a perfect size for kids and adults. The ring toss was big enough to use it as a floating device. Overall, this product held up pretting good in the pool, but however I did find one thing that was important to me and didn't come along with is an air pump. If you plan on blowing it up without an air pump, good luck. Luckily, I had an air bed pump adapter and was able to pump it up less than 10 mintues.
5.0	Gift for Grandson.  He said it was cool
5.0	this toy gun is awesome<br />great for display or for cosplay<br />love the toy and at a good price thanks
5.0	ITEM IS SO CUTE AND CAME IN EXCELLENT CONDITION I KNOW MY GRANDDAUGHTER WILL LOVE IT HER BIRTHDAY IS IN JULY SO SHE NOT RECEIVED IT YET, BUT I KNOW SHE WILL LOVE IT THANKS!!!
5.0	My son loves LBP! This was a greart gift for him, material is nice. Seems well made. You wont be dissapointed.
5.0	I bought this for a hotel I was going to.  I was afraid it was going to be to big because it's made for the river, but it actually fit even though it was pretty huge.<br /><br />The raft was amazing, the cup holders work decent (even though they do tilt inward), it inflates fast and deflates even faster.  It holds an adult person and even has room to tuck your legs in.  I have no complaints about this little raft, even if for the pool, I loved it!<br /><br />And a plus, it was EASY to get on unluck some other pool toys.
5.0	My 7 yrs old grandson loves it! Good Quality!
5.0	My 11 year old has never stopped using this. If not every day it's every other day! It's a great product- packaging is ideal for travel also!
1.0	THIS is exactly what we wanted.  Our grandson is a John Deere nut so we wanted a very simple rc vehicle to start.  Easy to use buttons and so on.  Looks perfect, right?  The turning button worked sporadically for the first couple times and then gave out completely.  Too bad.  Could have been a favorite toy!
5.0	given as a gift, my granddaughter loved it
5.0	This is Great  for game night or family  dinners  With questions such as things that make you go oh or something you would not want to yell in public  the more people the more fun  WAY FUN
5.0	bought this as a Christmas gift for my 2 year old grandson and its the first toy he chooses to play with.
5.0	Best thing I got my daughter. She knew the solar system since age 3 excellent buy. The quality was good too. Thick and sturdy.
5.0	got this for my nephew for his first christ mas last year, and he loved it. definatly as it is in the picture and one that i would get for my own personal collection.
5.0	this is the cutest, softest pink monkey ever.  My one 14 month old loves it and I might need to order a second in case we lose it.  Gund products are the best.
1.0	It was a waste of a lot of money. It does nothing but sit there. No noise, just some movable limbs. My son was excited to think about getting it and was excited when he actually got it, after two days.. it sits there in the middle of the floor. It's too big to throw in the toybox.
5.0	Had this as a child would like to reorder...the picture says Adam...does the bottle? Can't find anywhere else so I hope it doesn't actually say Adam on bottle.
5.0	I bought the ENTIRE set for my friend's baby shower and everyone loved it. Everything came on time, and I live overseas so shipping time is a big thing for me. All of the supplies were adorable and durable. I would recommend this for anyone throwing a baby shower. It's really a cute theme!
5.0	Item arrived quickly. It was exactly what the receiver wanted, the price was good, and he was happy all the way around.
5.0	I love this item is of very good quality, i wish they had the whole cast, I am very pleased price, shipping ,quality all 5 stars
5.0	I HAVE BEEN A LONG TIME 1960'S BATMAN FAN FOR WELL OVER TWENTY YEARS AND LIKE MANY FANS I ALWAYS WANTED TO DRIVE THE BATMOBILE.wE ALL KNOW THE CHANCE OF THAT HAPPENING IS NONE.tHIS IS AS CLOSE TOO DRIVING IT AS I WILL EVER COME AND IT IS A REALLY COOL TOY,SO I'M CONTENT WITH THAT FACT.  this is a really fun toy for people of all ages who love the show and the car.
5.0	I first saw the swearing finger in Las Vegas in a gift shop. I wanted to buy it but was hesitant because my bag were close to the 50 lb weight limit and I didn't want to chance going over. Once I got home I regretted not getting it. I searched for it and finally saw it being offered at a price comparable to what it was selling for in Vegas. D*mn it is funny. I got a kick out of it calling my mother in law &#34;lard a**&#34; as her fat a** walked to my kitchen to put her feet under my table. I almost died laughing. I set it out when the fellas are over to watch football. Go EAGLES!!!
5.0	This was an expensive float, and it has worked great. My 11 month old fit in just great, and it is constructed of durable material. Obviously you need to stay close to the baby, but it works wonderfully.
5.0	Loved the three prayer option. Each click plays a new prayer. Can click to next prayer early and 4th click will turn off the sound. Came with battery protector strip of plastic. Batteries kept fresh for longer play time once received, which is appreciated.
5.0	This is a nice size. We could not have been more pleased. The color is as vibrant as what the picture shows.
5.0	Hard to find these! Collectors should junp on this one. Bumble Bee has and always will be a mainstay in the Transformers line of toys.
5.0	This is a great product. Great for any little girl
5.0	This thing is the coolest! Ready to put together.
5.0	"This doll - the Corolle Fifi doll with blonde hair -  is bigger than I expected. Her facial features are very pretty, although for some reason I thought she had blue eyes and she does not, they are brown. She is durable, as are all Corolle products, and the clothing that you can purchase is adorable. I bought this doll for daughter's fourth birthday, although she wanted a \\""big girl doll\\"" like the Corolle Vanilla* which does not bend (see review of that product). This doll has just enough accessories and friends to make her a good fit for my daughter after all. Although she was dying for a \\""big girl doll\\"" she really loves this little cutie pie. I also got the puppy and carrier and the pajama party set and one of the other Poupette friends. A better choice than a doll that looks a bit older. Some of her pre-school friends actually have American Girl dolls, which are not really a doll for a four-year old. This doll is a much better fit for that age group."
5.0	I bought this item as a gift.  It was well liked by recipient.  Good quality item.  I would purchase again.
5.0	It is sufficient enough for protecting the iPad (fairly thick with padding) and showing off your team!  Go Steelers! :)
5.0	gave it to my 5yr old grandson for Christmas. He and his 8yr old brother both love it.
1.0	Maybe it seems like I'm nit-picking, but when I put that stuff on my face, my face was very very yellow. I was looking for gold. This product did not satisfy. :(
5.0	My son loves this thing. He is in the process of painting etc. I would recommend purchase, very nice quality Thank you.
5.0	This set is perfect for my daughter's wooden playhouse. I wanted something more modern with bright colors, and this is it!
5.0	I purchased this for my father for his birthday . My father is a retired Iraqi veteran so I knew he'd love it. We moved a couple of months back and he had a statue of a soldier that he became protective over so I got him this one to add a long with the other one. He love it , and so did I !
5.0	It is a good model with a lot of detail and it is large. It was fun to make. It was a good way to spend my time  Thanks
5.0	After searching for some time for a play remote for our daughter, we found this at a local Walmart store.  It's EXACTLY what I had been looking for!<br /><br />Looks close enough to the real thing that your baby shouldn't be too disappointed when you swap your real remote with this one.<br /><br />My daughter loves how the blue eyelids close.<br /><br />All the buttons makes SEVERAL sounds - the volume buttons on it actually do turn it up and turn it down in volume!<br /><br />Her favorite button to push is the number 6 because it plays cute music.<br /><br />Teaches numbers.<br /><br />I always bring this with when we travel in the car or shopping at the mall.  Small enough to fit in your purse, but big enough to occupy their time for a while!<br /><br />VERY durable - I can't count the number of times it's been thrown around and dropped and it works perfectly!<br /><br />I just love it!  The batteries seem to last forever in it too which is a huge plus!<br /><br />Buy it, you'll love it!  We've had ours for well over a year now, it's in perfect shape, and our 19 month old still loves it.
5.0	This card game is easy to play, fun, and an engaging way to teach children about anger. The durable and vibrant cards and box will last a long time. Definitely recommended!
5.0	I was delighted with this purchase...the storage case is a must buy when you purchase the Tag pen and books from LeapFrog...it makes carrying and storing them so much easier.
5.0	This Connor figure is amazing. The box is even sweet. It arrived a day early and I couldn't be happier
5.0	Fun toy for boys and girls. Easy to use, great to play with a parent. We enjoy it.
5.0	So cute and bobbly, I love it!
5.0	item was fine, just as described.
5.0	This is a cute chair. It does not have any moving parts so it will no pinch or topple over. The wood construction is nice. Had to force some of the screws in but overall for the price I think this was a good buy.
5.0	Bought this as a Christmas present and it is being enjoyed. Some help needed ut it is keeping everyone busy
5.0	One of the best board/startegy games I have ever played - Better then Monopoly! ever since we got this game last year it has been our families number 1 game of choice.
1.0	My two year old kept peeling these off the tub, she loves them, but doesn't want them on the tub, she would rather play with them. The glue gave her a strange rash, so I had to take them away. Probably not hypoallergenic or safe if your little one is going to pull them up.
5.0	My three year old is in love with the idea of being a doctor. She tells everyone to call her Dr. Bri.  This was the perfect gift so she can take care of everyone.
5.0	All items were delivered in a reasonable time and in great condition. All but one item were exactly what I wanted and expected. One item was good but not exactly what I expected.
5.0	This Bey is almost unbeatable. It's definitely my current favorite blade. And it shipped fairly quickly as well
5.0	I love it, the kid loves it. I bought it for my 15 month old thinking he wouldn't use it for a couple months.. He loves it.  Didn't understand how to play with it at first.  Because he was so young I bring it out when I can spend time and play with him, that kabob stick scares me but as long as you are watching the kid, great toy!!
5.0	BOUGHT THIS FOR MY GRAND SON , HE LOVES IT, GREAT PRODUCT.
5.0	perfect  for girls 4/6 years old
5.0	Fast shipping great price High quality. easy to use. and will actually wake you up. I would buy this for ages 12 and up due to the durability of the item
5.0	Great party favor!  The little wings didn't last long but it doesn't affect the function.  Both boys and girls loved this one!
5.0	Perfect! Speed delivery!
5.0	Imagine Apples to Apples, but NSFW.  That is Cards Against Humanity.  We've played through all of the cards, but the replay value has proven to be high.  Priceless, even.
5.0	This was a gift for my grandson's 6th birthday. He loves it. Enjoys the games a lot and really doesn't realize how much he's learning (which his parents really like). Good product - recommended. Also arrived in excellent condition and on time. Thank you
5.0	Compact is beautiful and has vibrant color. it's also very well made and arrived quickly.
5.0	Granddaughter's birthday present.  She loves Tink and Periwinkle - did not have one this large.  She was thrilled!
5.0	All kids and adults love the Etch A Sketch!  Fast Shipping!  It is always a joy to draw pictures and then erase
5.0	As I posted in my other review of the dice - great game!  Even if you are cheap and don't want to spend the money on the dice, get these cards to open up the game and increase the fun exponentially.
5.0	My Granddaughter who is 5 says Mario lives inside all girls hearts so I know when she sees this one she will flip!
5.0	My 4-year-old grandson asks me to play Lincoln Logs with him when I babysit. There are a variety of sizes of logs, as well as plastic doors and windows. The logs are well constructed without cracks or slivers. The notches fit nicely together. My grandson is learning to interlock the logs; he's learning what makes a design sturdy, and what doesn't. He's also learning the importance of following a plan, since there are illustrations of designs.
5.0	I just had to get this great bobblehead for my collection.  I just live the helmet with the 4 stars on it!!
5.0	The game is great and my 4 year old son really enjoys the product.  The games are educational, easy to learn, yet challenging levels are offered.  It is a wonderful product.
5.0	I purchased the Telestrations Party Pack about six months ago, much to the pleasure of my wife and our gaming group.  Since then we have not played another party game.<br /><br />I don't feel it's necessary to rehash the rules as a) they're simple and b) others have done it plenty, so let's get to the reviewing.<br /><br />Gameplay:<br />The game is utterly hysterical.  It's significantly more fun when things get screwed up along the way and the picture morphs.  It is exceptionally fun if the group your playing with has a good sense of humor and don't mind being picked on a bit if their drawing skills are below average.  We still talk about some of the most ridiculous things that occurred (one time we started with microscope and via some poorly chosen 'cells' it ended up being the Miracle of Life, which resulted in some very intersting illustrations).<br /><br />One caveat is that I've had a few people play with us who were self-conscious of their drawing and took the groups laughing at the transformations to be laughing at their drawing skills.  90% of people will have a great time with this game, but there are some people who will not enjoy feeling on display in this way.  I don't believe this is a fault of the game, however.<br /><br />Components:<br />This package comes with enough notebooks to support up to 12 players which is brilliant.  I see no reason to buy the original because the more players this game has the better.  The flipbooks are of high quality as are all markers and extra components.  The cards aren't anything to write home about, but they really don't need to be.  One thing to note is that the dry erase marker can be hard to erase if you wait until the next time you play, so make sure you always erase them after you're done.<br /><br />Child-friendy?<br />I would say an absolute yes.  This game can lead to some inappropriate drawings if your gaming group lets it, but none of the suggested words are bad.  At worst you may get something like 'belly ring.'  Kids can easily grasp the rules and have just as fun playing, though I think 9+ would be a good age to do it with consistent success.<br /><br />Overall this game absolutely deserves all of the accolades it has received.  It is the best party game I have ever played and I can't imagine it being knocked off its throne any time soon!
5.0	I purchased two different Britto stuffed animals for my grand daughter's birthday and she loves them. I also purchased two other ones as a holiday gift for my niece.
5.0	My 4 year old son loves his LeapFrog LeapPad! I think product is great for a kid this age instead of an iPad. The games that we can purchase for him also get 5 stars. With one of the free games on the apps, my son learned how to write his alphabets. I would recommend this to any parent looking for a substitute for an iPad.
1.0	I bought 3 of this but we can not play together because all 3 remote control work on all 3 cars.
5.0	"I purchased this item for myself to go along with the other Madeline dolls I've had since my childhood. This is, by far, the best-quality doll of the bunch. There are wonderful details, from the lace trim on her socks to the grosgrain ribbon on her hat. Her blue coat and plaid dress are removable, and underneath her apparel is an embroidered appendectomy scar.<br /><br />At 18\\"" tall, she's perfect for hugs. Little girls will delight in cuddling this Madeline doll while reading Ludwig Bemelmans' books about the adorable French school girl.<br /><br />Probably the only thing I'm not too keen on about this doll is the fabric with which her body is made. It's like the same material McDonald's uses on their plush Happy Meal toys. Sure, it's soft, but it doesn't quite match the quality of the doll's clothing and accessories."
5.0	These worked great for my Eastern Jungle Gym DIY set  I found because of some hard ground and roots, it actually helped to take a long 1/4 drill bit and drill a guide hole in the dirt first (Georgia clay). Made it much easier for the anchor not to get blocked and for the screw portion to bite into the ground as it got deeper. After a week of swinging, the swing posts had settled into the dirt and I had to move the metal clamps to tighten them up again (which is to be expected). All around this was much easier than concrete and will make moving my swing set later much easier.
5.0	Overpriced... yeah a little. But he's also sold out everywhere else and with Christmas coming I paid the price. His ear was perfect for me, I actually bought all the pups and there all perfect. My four year old is going to be thrilled.
5.0	This Justice League line is pretty cool. The modelling is pretty good. Fans of the cartoon aren't going to be disappointed. But....<br />Considering that there are action figures out there that are almost twice the size and twice the detail, Mattel could have definitely priced this toy a lot cheaper. It doesn't have a lot of articulation (only at the hip, arms and neck). Do I care if it has a stand that spells out Justice League when all of the figures are put together? Not really...especially if it's in that cheesy blue color.
5.0	The peg people arrived quickly and the assortment is nice. Shared with a Waldorf classroom, and used for gnome families and nature tables in the home.
1.0	Be warned! This is not a flotation device. We bought ours with weight range to spare and it will not keep our sons head above water. I'm not sure what the purpose of this is but it will not keep a child afloat.
1.0	It was cery flimsy and I was cery unsatisfied.  I found a better one at toysRus cheaper.  I recommend that you look around before you buy this item.
5.0	this is very cute.  I ordered to go along with the frog collection my son in law has. Thank you so much
5.0	My kids love this puzzle and like a lot.
5.0	This is the average twilight with some execs oriels and this is from the crystal empire cerise which isn't being made anymore so its wanted but at toys r us you can get this same twilight and applejack for 5 or 6 dollars each
5.0	Husband loved this gift, he is a big fan of The Walking Dead and this looks great on the shelf in his &#34;man cave&#34;.
5.0	I am destined to be a grumpy old man who drones on an on about how tough we drone pilots were back in...unfortunately, semi-tough ain't tough enough. For &#60;$40, these tiny drones would have changed the outcome of most battles, some wars, and I would be grumpy about something else like quality lube for....so here's the MONEY SHOT: These drones are a little like us, a dime a dozen, so be thinking about what you need if the whole Quad-Flopter goes into a 100ft Cedar or Lake Atlantic Ocean. The receiver seems to be the part missing from the kit for desert crashes only. We are boys with toys, and I for one am proud to be so shameless. Enjoy, and hold off on the big $ purchases if ya can.
5.0	Perfect!!  Thank you!!
5.0	I bought this for my niece ,shes 2 and she loves it.Just the right size.For a 4 year old youll want the next size,but for 2-4 this is their size . Its very sturdy,took about 30 minutes to assemble.Great buy!
5.0	My fiance and I love this game. It is very easy to learn, and can be played quickly or longer if you need to kill time. We are in our mid 20's and have even talked our friends into playing. However, if you get mad easily about people lying to you then this isn't the game for you. This is essentially a game like &#34;bull sh*#&#34;.
5.0	I bought this peppermint puppy for my granddaughter for Christmas.  When it arrived, I opened it so I could wrap it for Christmas.  I fell in love with it.  It is adorable.  She fell in love with it, too.  She has several Webkinz animals, but she is enjoying the new one!  It looks just like the picture you displayed.  Worth the price.  Such a sweet puppy!
5.0	I would recommend this product to anyone!  The dvd instructions are very easy to follow.  My little nephew loves it!
5.0	Its a Ellen game what more can you say. I got this for my daughter for Christmas she is a game player. This is one of her favorites they were all laughing so hard fun fun game. Keeper I want one.
5.0	Great theme for dinosaur lovers and non dinosaur lovers alike!<br />These puzzles are made to last and is a great puzzle for my class.
1.0	I'm not even gonna do the good points/bad points. This gun sucks,plain and simple. My dad got one to shoot at me and it sucks. You have to load ten darts in and then pump it like 30 times for what?For 2 seconds of fast paced 10 shot wimp action. This gun is hopeless.It doesn't,however,jam hardly ever.
5.0	"I just finished assembling this beast of a model kit and had quite a good time doing so.  It took me around 12 hours to assemble the whole thing with some decent attention paid to sanding/trimming each piece to remove the bumps from where they attach on the sheets.  The model has many extra parts to swap out with other ones already on the model in a different color (white and black options).  It also has various \\""modes\\"" such as raising heatsink-esque vents out of the arms, legs and other parts of the form.  Some actually just raise up and down while others are parts that need to be swapped out.<br /><br />There are probably hundreds of moving parts from small flaps and covers to the arms, legs, hands, head and more.  I really don't consider the figure a \\""toy\\"" because of how complex and fragile it can be (expensive as well).  The figure also comes with a nice display stand that can mount the White Glint, the V.O.B. or both fairly well, it also includes parts to swap out for covering the stand mounting hole if you want to keep it elsewhere.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Stunning detail (some detail parts are as small as half the head of a match)<br />Customizable (Vents on/off, overboost, normal, color swapping parts, black,clear and blue visor \\""glass\\"")<br />Very pose-able (full joint functions, transformations such as the shoulder rockets sliding on top of each other in  a stack or wide like wings)<br /><br />Cons:<br />fragile (pretty common with figures, it is very easy to knock small parts off (when not glued) or even snap a piece or two if you aren't very careful)<br />Stiff movement on some parts (especially moving the boosters sideways and up, I have to gently wiggle it a bit to slide it without worrying about breaking or knocking off parts)<br /><br />Overall it is one of the most incredible models I have assembled, it can be done about 98% of the way without glue though I strongly recommend using it at least for some parts to help with stability and combat the fragile aspect of it.  There are at least 2-4 parts that need glue to go on as they have no way to snap into place.<br /><br />Suggested tools (at minimum)<br />Exacto knife<br />Glue (I just used some super glue, model glue, etc.)<br />Sandpaper<br />Tweezers(must have to keep sane when moving or attaching parts towards the end, especially the little hoses all over the back)e aspect of it.

5.0	I love this game!! Defiantly worth getting the expansions!! Super inappropriate but worth all of the laughs with great company!!
5.0	Bought for a 2 year old girl whose not ready for a live one, she sleeps with it every night, enough said.
5.0	Granddaughter loves it!
5.0	nice in my theme party
5.0	We play a card game that requires holding several cards.  These card holders are a huge help.  I really like having multiple colors.
5.0	Amazon Warehouse deals are the best.
5.0	takes these along with him everywhere
5.0	This is the best game I have ever played. Wacky crazy awesome good time. I highly recommend it to all
1.0	3 pieces are broken and this is a Santa gift.Took me quite awhile to contact someone.The directions gives you a website that doesn't work..Now the trunk is no longer available and no one knows if there are parts availanle..Very dissapointed.Still waiting on an email whether they will ship parts.Its been 4 days
5.0	I was surprised that these were &#34;floppy&#34; (no wires to make them stick out like wings), but my granddaughter absolutely LOVED them, so I'm giving them the 5-star rating based on her reaction to them.
1.0	Shade came cracked and dented,
5.0	Great family game.  It works especially well when we have family visiting and we are all enjoying it together.
5.0	My four year old loved this set.  It has fun activities that challenge children to cut on the lines.  It helps with scissor control and teaches good skills for cutting various shapes.
5.0	Fabulous gift for an eight year old boy.  He loved it
5.0	Really small set, but a great little set for young lego builders, nice carrying case.  My kids like that the wings really move.
1.0	Ugh it's okay I guess but the cost is to much for one little
5.0	I bought this for my good friend's little one year old son, and he loved it! She said it reminded her of one that she had when she was a child. You can't beat Fisher Price quality and Amazon's fast delivery - a winning combination!
1.0	COMPLELY unplayable when  doesn't even move the ball and one botton got loged down in the base  immediately apon use
5.0	I bought this car for my 5-year old daughter's birthday. She has been riding it since her birthday. She really loves it. This car works great without any problems. Assembling it is not that hard either. Battery life is also superb. It is truly a high quality product.
5.0	Albeit these plastic guns do not last long in the hands of elementary-age kids looking to reenact WWII battles, the kids sure had a blast with it.
5.0	I saw a review of this game on YouTube and my roommates and I decided to check it out. We can't get enough of this game! The question and answer cards are absolutely outrageous and we have never laughed so hard. Definitely recommend this game for anyone who has a sense of humor. Great for large groups of people!
5.0	Absolutely great thing. Sadly no one wants to play it with me =( Played once. Over the top thematically great game.
5.0	Twiddle is so much fun I can't stop playing with it!<br />At first I got it and was playing with it in my hands, then I discovered the instructions inside the box. Once I realized that the pieces can pull apart to shape it opened a whole new world! I have made the coolest shapes and keep playing and playing. I own three of them and even connected the different colors as well. I also like it too because you can mold it.
5.0	These are fun and colourful recommended for any little girls collection
5.0	The game is wonderful! It's frantic and funny. One thing that did bother me was that there was no instruction manual on how to play. I had to go online (and we're on holiday with a bad internet connection, which is pretty frustrating) I didn't want to let that reflect on my rating of the game. I can really recommend it for a quick and easy game.
5.0	The perpetuator is an accessory to make a levatron fly longer and higher. It just takes patients. I have made it fly for days on end. The perpetuator does just what it is supposed to do: make the levatron top fly longer and higher. It is kinda expensive, but I love it.
5.0	"I purchased this figure, along with several others of the Schleich line, and was amazed at how amazing they truly are. The figures are well sculpted, well painted, and very durable - meaning that if I WAS to let my son have a go at them, they could hold up to the punishment.<br /><br />They are accurately detailed, with no traces of 'fantasy' or 'mythology' to them - no flaming swords, or oddly shaped weapons and armour here. The knights are superbly crafted and historically designed.  Everything about this figure screams 'quality'.  From the detail of his padded jerkin, to the crumpled look of his boots, and on into detail of his face.  This is a great figurine, and a fine addition to any collection; whether its as a solo figure, or as one of your 'army builders', you will enjoy this figure for a long, long time.<br /><br />If I may quote the previous post of EquisNiger: \\""The pieces come in two opposing camps: the Red Fleur de Lis, and the Blue Lion, and each piece has a corresponding piece in the other, with somewhat different design and graphics. This reflects an impressive variety in styles of armament and armor of the period, and vastly improves the educational value of the series. \\""<br /><br />In all, I give this line of figure and their accessories Two Thumbs Up!"
5.0	As advertised<br /><br />Excellent<br />Good range
5.0	Inostrancevia is not the typical dinosaur figure when I think of dinosaurs.  It's a fascinating figurine, with the fine details that Wild Safari is known for.  It is rugged enough for a child to play with, but in this case it suits me also, an adult interested in these ancient creatures.
5.0	Everything was excellent
5.0	this cement works great for model cars and other hobbies.  it took me awhile to find the one we were looking for which has the long metal tip for precision application not the plastic one.  this one has the metal tip.  great product would definitely buy again and will buy again.  shipping took a little while though.
5.0	This is absolutely incredible thing and made a birthday boy insanely happy!! Getting more for other birthday kids ;)
1.0	Hi.<br /><br />I am very disapointing because the cart arrived in bad condition, with scratches and damages in some areas. in adittion there are missing parts. the main part that allow to drive the car (steering column) is missing. I have pictures of the car.<br /><br />considering the price of the item, this situation is inaceptable.<br /><br />I will be looking for your resonse.<br /><br />best regards<br /><br />Karen
5.0	Had problem with one of the side arms but once I got it going my newphew loved it. can't wait for next year so I can add to his collection of spiderman
5.0	Bought these as gifts for friends, played the game with friends and they always were searching for the dice, dice were getting mixed up because they were all the same.  Saw this set and felt it would solve all those problems!!
1.0	I'll fitting parts don't connect - couldn't even get past step one. I can't imagine how awful the quality would be even if I could build it.
5.0	We were so excited to find Zou, as the &#34;Sprout&#34; TV program is a favorite. The toy is very well constructed and colorful and has become my grandson's go-to.
5.0	I love this game. Fun game strategy and fun graphics.
5.0	My 4yo has LOVED this house. She and I got tired of coloring it but she's had this house for about a year now and I'm kind of tired of looking at it in my living room but she just loves it so much I can't get rid of it. It's held up pretty well, has pink duck tape all over it and has really taken a beating but is still standing. Might have to invest in another one soon.
5.0	fat shipping..excellent
5.0	Great fun game for kids and adults.  We love it too!
5.0	The train noise is really loud and long!!  Put some tape over the speaker hole.<br /><br />Fun Family and Friends game.
5.0	My son is a super hero maniac & loves all the super heros and villians. This really made him smile.
1.0	did not run after two times  ..nothing l happened when running when went to use third time ..motor seems not to be working right ..only30 day  to return  :{  relly unhappy
5.0	The kid loved it! The remote is a cool added feature.
5.0	Have had this about a year.  It is really a great product.  My son has never gotten bored with it after all this time.  We get a new book once in a while. Only downside is that it holds about 5 books at a time.  Now I see they have one that has twice as much memory that I will consider getting if the price is right.  If you register on their website it will also email you progress updates... with information including how many questions were right/wrong, how much time spent on each book and so much more.      Another thing is that it is made well and durable.  We use rechargeable batteries, which I would recommend.
5.0	This Kratos is adorable. My favorite video game character.
5.0	Beautiful ! Cost more for Burnett color hair?
5.0	I was broken into and robbed about 8 months ago. They took everything. I mean everything. While shopping online for security systems, I came across this guy. Look at the face of that dude. He means business. I knew having him inside my house would work better than any alarm. So I snagged him up. Save yourself $400 on home security and score one of these little guys.
5.0	My girlfriend loves this and sleeps with it every night. :)
5.0	I took a chance and ordered these items on a Monday for a party that was for that upcoming Saturday. I sent a question to the vendor so, the processing was delayed a day, until Tuesday. Of course that made me nervous. I was pleasantly surprised and truely greatful that I received my product by that Thursday. Loved my experience!
5.0	This toy is pretty cool. Our 3 year old son loves it. The little backpack thingy is magnetic so it is very easy for him to take on and off. Great toy !
5.0	Beasley invite for the hardest forgetting I have ever played. Overall well worth it. Have played it almost 5 * and still have not want it yet.
5.0	Great battery! Seems to be the same as Traxxas. Always good to have extra fuel for when your friends show up!
5.0	This classic toy is a must for all little kids who love to pound away. They never grow tired of it. This is especially great if you have a basement to send your kids to, so the noise stays downstairs.
5.0	Purchased this item for my 2 year old granddaughter. She loves it! The bag holds many of her smaller toys and is easy for her to get on and off herself. Good value, great product.
5.0	These are great for young dogs learning to catch a fisbee.  They can get a little misshaped after being played with.  I buy extra due to the low price.
5.0	Great boxes! I'd classify these deck boxes as high quality. The plastic is thick and the design on the front is clean. Under the right conditions (as in don't submerge them in water or run over them with a car), these boxes will last a long time. They are durable, sleek, and stylish. The colors I received were true to the picture.<br />Definitely helps keep me organized and makes travel ridiculously easy. I use the black box to keep my Cards Against Humanity expansions safe.
1.0	Sadly, this product was not made very well. My grand daughters were invited with their brother (triplets) to a pirate & princess birthday costume party. The dresses began unraveling at the party and thank goodness we had play clothes underneath. The pirate costume wasn't made much better. We had to throw the costumes out. Probably won't attempt to order these sort of items again on line.
5.0	great quality.  it is small meant for kids hands... can be used on DRY erase board and chalk board.<br />Good for kids 3 to 8.<br /><br />Get an adult one after that.
1.0	My son received this a gift, even though we already had a similar toy.  We put it together when he was 9 months and he immediately tipped the thing over just by standing next to it and holding onto the side bars.  We put it away for a month, and brought it out again.  It has tipped with him in it, standing near it, and while pushing it from behind.  And yes, I was using my brain and sitting near him to catch his fall.  I'm sorry but if you have to literally be holding your child and the toy together, it really defeats the purpose.  You might as well hold him by the middle and practice walking that way.  The radio/sound part of the toy is loved, but does not even snap in.  It did at first, but came crashing to the floor on the first tip over and hasn't fit right since.  The snack tray on my Chicco travel system stroller had the same problem.  While all I have are negative comments about my 11 month old using this toy, my 3 year old LOVES it.  I do not think it is built to be stable enough for the age listed on the box.  Sadly, it will probably be sold for $5 at our garage sale next weekend.
5.0	Always impressed with Willow Tree. A great addition to my collection. My husband purchased this set for me to represent our growing twin boys. Which I am now buying for a friends twins' First Birthday.
5.0	I got this to go with my son's leappad 2 as some Christmas gifts. It feels nice and thick. It is not a dark blue but more of a darker turquoise or a blue with a hint of green in it. Still a great color for boys. Very happy about it.
5.0	My personal favorite, it's THE doll in my collection, i'm so happy with it
5.0	I bought this as a gift for my mother who is an archaeologist. She loved it and, therefore, so do I.
5.0	"This is a pretty big package. It has Optimus, Megatron, the kids, and the episode Masters and Students.<br /><br />Starting with Optimus, let's check out his vehicle mode. Optimus turns into a semi truck. Vehicle mode looks pretty good. There are a few paint differences from the SDCC version that make this one look better. It's kinda funny, since this is a retail version, and that's an exclusive.<br /><br />Transformation is simple and more kid friendly than Megatron. It definitely has some similarities to the Voyager version of Prime, especially the \\""fake winshield\\"" chest. (Again, CHEAT!!!!!!11)<br /><br />Robot Mode- Looks pretty nice. He's got these gorilla arms, but they don't bother me too much. I like how they made his gun so it looks like it's coming out of his hand. Very neat little touch. Possibility is quite good. He's definetly got some back kibble like the RID Voyager, but this mold has the wheels sticking out of the side, but that isn't enough to make me rage on the figure.<br /><br />Now that that's over with, let's go on to Megatron, shall we? Let's. Vehicle Mode- Megatron turns into a Cybertronian jet. It looks pretty good. It's got silver paint that makes me wish Hasbro did a better job at painting the RID Voyager Megatron.<br /><br />Transformation, for me, is not easy. It's a bit fiddly, and is, overall, a big pain in the @$$.<br /><br />Robot Mode- Looks awesome. I love how this thing looked. And the paint scheme- ooh, dat paint scheme. So shiny. I, unfourtuanetly (god, I can't spell that) , lost his fusion cannon, so I really can't display him. HE'S RUINED WITHOUT HIS FUSION CANNON! RUINED FOREVER!!!!!! No, I'm just kidding. But seriously, it's just not the same.<br /><br />Now, the package comes with the kids, Jack, Miko, and Raf. They look pretty nice, and they come with stands. They can only move thier heads though. And, to top it all off, it comes with the episode, Masters and Students.<br /><br />Overall, this is a nice package. If you canfind this for a decent price, go for it. Or, of you're patient, this and most of the FEs come out this holiday season, and you can get it then."
5.0	Very cute and lots of fun. Toddlers can play by themselves. Great for getting their attention when you need to ..
5.0	It was very hard to find a black poodle.  I Got it for my brother living in a nursing home. He had once had a real live little black poodle.
5.0	He's only 3, but my son LOVES these things!  Plus the DVDs that come with some of the larger ones aren't too bad either.  If your kid likes dinosaurs/dragons/airplanes/robots, Imaginext toys will be a big hit!
5.0	Ever since I got Pete the Cat for my 5 yr old, she carries him everywhere. She never leaves him behind. She loves him soo much. I'm planning on getting her the bigger one for her birthday. She is going to be super excited :)
5.0	It's easy to learn and a million times faster than the traditional Monopoly. It has a max of four players.
5.0	Outstanding! No binding issues at all with my existing transmitter, very little trim required out of the box. Would definitely purchase again if the need arises.
5.0	Perfect as birthday party favors for boys and girls!
5.0	CL did a wonderful collaboration on this doll with Mattel. The shoes come with their own box and dust cover. So much detail went in this doll. The lime green dress with the purple accent works extremely well on this Barbie.
5.0	I have a 2 year old, 4 year old, 10 and 12 year old.... Boys and girls.  The WHOLE family .... yes adults too, can get on board with this and have fun AND it doesn't take very long for all of us to go through a round.  We do cheat and don't let the clock run out of time towards the end... but that just makes it more fun for us.
5.0	Out of all the things my kids got for Christmas this is one of their favorites lol.
5.0	My daughter and her (college aged) friends love this game, and I think it's great fun too.  Be prepared to laugh.
5.0	Our three-month-old loves this mobile! Every time we put him under it, if he's feeling lively and not in a bad mood (i.e. wants to be held), he starts laughing and kicking like crazy. Here's a video of him, just to give you an idea of how babies react:    [...]    We received the mobile second-hand from a friend who no longer uses it, and even though it's made of plastic it held up pretty well. Most of the picture pieces were torn where they are connected, but not unusable. The plastic arm may look chintzy, but it connects pretty well to the crib. And despite the wholly plastic construction, our boy loves it so much I think it's worth it! After a few minutes he usually either falls asleep or gets upset (almost as if he's frustrated that the pictures won't come down and play).    My only criticism is that I wish it came with an alternate stand so that I could also set it up when he's in the bassinet or on his play mat, rather than only being able to use it in the crib. A brand new version may come with such a stand though, I can't say for sure.
5.0	This dolls are awesome,I just got mine and I totally love them,I got them at Wal-mart for 19.99 on sale but regular price was 23.99! which I think is a good price,just wait and look at the stores,they start to be on the shelves now :)
5.0	Una excelente pieza, muy bien detallada, si eres fan no puedes dejar pasar estas figuras de coleccion por el aniversario 20
5.0	"This set of 21 small puzzles (average size of each is about 4\\""x4\\"") offer learning to spell in a unique and fun way.  Made out of material similar to an adult jigsaw puzzle, each interlocking puzzle piece (size about 3x1.5) features a letter and a part of the object that the word spells.  For instance, in the pig puzzle, the letter \\""P\\"" also has the pig's head on it, the letter \\""I\\"" has the pig's body, and the \\""G\\"" has the pig's back end.  The puzzle cannot be put together incorrectly, assuring that your child is learning the correct spelling and associating the word with the object.  The 21 puzzles include 3 three letter words, 4 four letter words, 11 five letter words, and 3 six letter words.  My two year old who knows his alphabet is enjoying playing with these puzzles (3 & 4 letter words) and beginning to learn the concept that letters make up words and how those letters are arranged determines what word is conveyed.  The age recommendations on the box are 4-7, with a choking warning for those under three.  Obviously each child is different but if you are beginning phonics and spelling lessons, and your child enjoys puzzles (and does not put them in the mouth!), this is a great tool."
1.0	Don't waste your money on this book.  It is 180 pages, but with all the use of blank space, repeated information, and useless junk, the book probably could be written in ten pages. A total waste of money.
5.0	Our grandson loves this wagon. He can sit in it and pull it. We can buckle him for safety. It's easy to transport it in our car.
5.0	True to size and she loved it!
5.0	I bought this for my nephew who is totally into farming for his birthday.  Totally a great fit for the 5-8 year old active boy.
5.0	My Grandson Loves it!!
5.0	With all the high tech toys out there, it's great to get back to the basics.  Both of my son and daughter enjoy building houses, forts, 'space castles' and more.  This a great item for the kids and fun for Dad too.
5.0	I've been waiting for this card for a week and when it finally arrived, I was in awe. Now I have all Harpie sisters holo
5.0	This is a beautiful set. My (grown) kids have it on their desk and play it all the time.
5.0	"This is my first LEGO game purchased, and boy is it fun.  I played with my adult siblings and a preschooler.  We were laughing our heads off the whole time!<br /><br />The cards each have four categories/pictures that you can build from the LEGOs depending on what the die roll says.  How you build depends on the person - maybe you actually build the piece to look like the picture, or you build to illustrate a concept, or you use the pieces like lines to \\""draw\\"" your word.  It's basically charades, and the players decide what is allowable or not (like sound effects, motions with the LEGOs, etc.).  The best part about the game is that it can be very free form with the rules depending on the players ages and how creative they want to be.  Also, players can decide how specific/complex the correct words have to be (boat vs. sailboat vs. catamaran).  So, this game is scalable in complexity from grade school to adults.  This makes it a very inclusive game that the whole family can play together.<br /><br />Right now, the game price fluctuates a little, but seems to range in the low $30's.  That is not a bad deal since you get >300 pieces of LEGOs.  I try to get LEGO's &lt;10 cents/piece.  This is comforting in case you really dislike the game, and it's past due for return, you can just roll the pieces over into other existing LEGO sets.  There is a good variety of basic to specialty pieces.  You can also add pieces from other LEGO sets to enhance gameplay.  I suspect that if you don't keep tight control on the game set, a lot of pieces will get pilfered by the kids to augment other LEGO sets.<br /><br />My only gripe is that only one full figure with \\""guy\\"" hair and one super-tiny figure are included.  It would have been better to include a couple of LEGO figures in the set for those that want to play with multiple teams.<br /><br />Lastly, I have to give a shout out to my bro who guessed \\""windmill\\"" correctly when I only had three pieces put together!"
5.0	draw a little flimsy, but ovrall great desk. My toddler loves it, she sits at her desk and draws pictures,and does crafts projects...glad I bought it, also a space saver- its small and slim
5.0	This product provides a great grip for small hands and protects the leap frog.  The bright green color makes it easy to find
5.0	My grandson loves that he can make Spiderman fly upside down. It's one of his favorites.
5.0	Sturdy and very realistic.  Has held up for over a year and remains in mint condition.
5.0	Awesome product. Provides many hours of joy!
5.0	The product itself is great! I would consider this seller to anyone and everyone looking for a great buy. I used to constantly play Yugioh (Which is an AWESOME game) and now I am able to share my love of the game to my little brother. Having a seller like that who is there with the best products makes it easier. My experience has been absolutely amazingly! They are also in mint condition.
5.0	My Grandson loves this toy. It is sturdy and should last through many hours of imaginative play.
5.0	Great deal and price on these!  Son loves these.  Quick shipping and packaged well.  Recommend!
5.0	I bought this for my granddaughters 1st birthday which will be in August.  This is very nice and I can't wait to put it on the center of the table.
5.0	Perfect for little boys and girls.  Was delivered as promised in great condition.  Looks rugged enough to last.<br />Very Pleased.
1.0	I got this as a gift since I placed it on my wishlist. Big mistake.  Didn't work right off or after charging for 4 hours, steering doesn't hold when the wheel is turned, battery life is very short, usb charger arrived damaged, and instructions were lacking in details.  Well be looking in to exchanging it, if I can't I'll just trash it.
5.0	Very cute and we love it!  As with all of amazon's shipping, the grumpy cat arrived quickly and was packaged very well.
5.0	Love the pigments, the support, and the forums that are full of ideas and all around help.
5.0	This is a great game and loved by many ages. I work with kids who don't speak English and this is a great game for them. From this they learned how to play regular Yahtzee which is great for practicing addition, multiplication and discision making.
5.0	The stamps worked well for my craft project and they have stayed moist for a long time.
5.0	We love this tent....... my 2 year old received this for Christmas and it exceeded my expectations.  Very durable and easy to put together.  Definitely worth it for the price.
5.0	My daughter loves this game. It has a dance feature which works with her dance pad- very cute!
5.0	This is a great addition to the series and it has large shoes to fill with the it's predecessor Civilization 4 (which has had 5 YEARS OF BETA testing under it's belt).    So I would say give fraxis some time to polish this game out like it has will all previous games in the series and yes they all had serious flaws and issues when they first came out.    Well I guess what I am trying to say is that don't let the Civilization 4 fan boys make you think that this game sucks...this game is a lot of fun and has many great improvements over the previous civilization games.    PS bottom line is if you not sure about this game then download the free demo.
5.0	it came early, it was as it was suppose to be, and it worked great it all its a great investment
5.0	The original KH2 was my favorite game on the PS2, and this takes everything that was awesome about it and ramps it up.
5.0	Was in the exact shape I had expected. The controller was in tip top shape. Quick delivery. Very happy with this sale. Thank you.
5.0	Its plot is cliche, the gameplay is almost like a dumbed down version of Secret of Mana, it can be very grindy at times, its music is forgettable, and it's only meant for 1 player. Despite all of that, I absolutely LOVE this game! I can't tell exactly what it is about this game that made me fall in love with it so much. It's by no means original, and it's definitely not for everyone, but this is one of my favorite SNES games of all time. One thing I think this game does brilliantly is its use of ambience. No other SNES game has perfected that aspect like Secret of Evermore has. In fact, the ambience is done so well in this game, it even rivals some of today's games in this aspect.  From the moment you boot up the game, to the time it ends, you really feel completely engrossed in this world like you actually are the character you play, lost in a big unfamiliar world. Exploration is a key factor of gameplay as it is very fun to explore every nook and cranny the game has to offer. There are few things in video games that I love more than being dropped in the middle of a foreign land and figuring out the directions on my own. Because of this, the soundtrack is filled mostly with ambient noise rather than actual music tracks, but combined with the world you run around in, this works beautifully.<br /><br />If you want to play this only for the story, you won't be impressed. If you're wondering about the gameplay, it's an action RPG very similar to Secret of Mana (and no, it's not a sequel to that game). This game is all about feeling lost and exploring the world at hand. If you play this game with that in mind you will have a much better experience.
5.0	"My first Amazon.com review. I'm not too big on a lot of things, but I've found the collecting of DS games to be an amusing hobby, one that I sincerely hope will pay off much later in life when I can unload everything on some poor chap that decides to relieve me of my collection ... at a nice price.    You'll find that (if you bother to read any of my reviews) I'm much more critical than the average person, because it's in my nature to be that way and because there's almost NEVER a perfect video game out there (I say video game because I think it's the only thing I'll be reviewing).    So here goes, my first review.    Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney was the first game I picked up after I bought my DS. True, I had heard from a friend of mine about this game of law and evidence and whatnot that was out for the DS. But at the time of my purchase, Phoenix Wright had stopped production and was actually quite and old game, one of the DS originals. I had relegated to buying it on Ebay for more than it retailed for. At least I have an original.    PWAA (I'll state it this way from now on) has received praise and excellent marks, both from the consumer side and the media side of reviews; and deservingly so. The availability of a touch screen platform allows for much more imagination on the side of the game production industry than on any other platform. PWAA is revolutionary in that sense, bringing a genre (law??? in a video game??) that appeals very much to the masses, even incurring a re-release of probably one of the most praised games available on the DS.    In my honest opinion, PWAA receives its praise from it's undeniable originality, the introduction of an almost alien genre into the gaming world, and not much else. In this sense, it's difficult to detract from the overall value of the game, simply because there's no precedence to base that upon.    I would have given it perfect marks if every other person that has come across it at some point in their lives didn't worship its existence. I'll admit, I was bananas over it too. But we'll take a look at the negatives, since you can read about the pros of the game in just about every other review available.    For one, the game is short. This is most likely in no way Capcom's fault, because you'll find this to be true with almost every other DS game that is addictively playable. I think the only way it can be solved is in data expansion in those tiny little cartridges. Then again, they did make two sequels, and there's a 4th in Japan, so that could explain it.    Two, innovation only goes so far. If you've never played the game and you've read the other reviews, you'll most likely know that you can adamantly declare \\""OBJECTION!\\"" when you have an objection in court. But, come on. If you were in a Starbucks waiting to get coffee and some kid (or adult for that matter) is sitting somewhere playing PWAA and you all of a sudden hear him/her scream \\""OBJECTION!\\"", wouldn't you wonder what was wrong with that poor person? Then again, it's a really small detraction from the game, because every person that has played the game has yelled \\""OBJECTION!\\"" or \\""HOLD IT!\\"" into the microphone .. in the solitude of their room when no one's around; even me.    Thirdly, the details. Some things are just ridiculously subtle and piecing the puzzle together at times can lead you to feel a huge \\""What on earth...\\"" after you've figured it out. You only get so many mess-ups before you fail a trial. But, again, another small detraction, since making it too obvious would make the game too easy, which would end the game even faster.     Fourthly, guide-gamers, this is not for you. Because of the way the game is played, it seems to me that it would be incredibly hard to make a spoiler free guide to this game, although it may be possible. Writing a spoiler free guide would take an extremely long time, and I honestly don't see a way around it. Sort of like Touch Detective ... you read the guide, then you feel like you'vemarred the game by moving past a stuck point by just getting the answer without figuring it out yourself.    Finally, I don't think you can clear the data on a pre-played Phoenix Wright. Maybe you can, I haven't been able to do so, and I don't see why they don't make that option clearly available, because you can jump ahead to any chapter you like without having played any of the previous chapters.    That's all, the cons to this game are very minor, and while I feel that PWAA is an overly hyped, extremely lauded game, it is in fact a very good solid game. And EB Games is clearing out the re-release at a very affordable, very modest price of $19.99, a 33% knockdown of the retail, brand-new. I wouldn't be surprised if it comes charging back into the stores as a Greatest Hits copy, as I think it'll have the same effect on the DS as Final Fantasy VII did on the Playstation. A collector's must, and a good buy for everyone else."
1.0	It starts to open then comes up with a error sign !!!!<br />I just can not work out how to get it operate with out a error sgn
5.0	I love the game. It is a good way of passing, It feels like controlling your main character in some of your favorite movie.
5.0	YOU WILL NOT REGRET BUYING THIS!!!! Im very glad I bought the ps vita!!
5.0	So far, after a couple of months, these are working great! I was tired of my daughter going through so many batteries with her daily xbox game playing. This is saving me a lot of money over buying batteries and thus is also good for the environment!
5.0	Great fun for moving an old body ;)  Highly recommend it to get you moving. If you haven't moved for awhile and need to sit down while doing it, you can still get your upper body moving easily enough.
1.0	This card didnt work .
5.0	Excellent product. Was able to get 1080i. Looks great and also had good sound. Recently got a hdmi cord and can't tell the different.
5.0	"This is the second arcade stick ive purchased.  I have the original TE as well.  The S model is a comfortable downsize.  There is actually more room to rest your palms/hands/wrists in general.  Its built very sturdy in fact if you plan to mod yours, be prepared, its a bit tougher to get into than the original TE.  The buttons and stick of course are great quality as is.  Overall I like the size and feel of the S here. Its still solid even though its smaller than other models.  Very well built, high quality and worth the investment.     If you're thinking of making the switch to a stick just remember these important things.  It will require time, effort and practice.  You will not just suddenly be better at Street Fighter.  In fact you'll probably be terrible.  You'll feel awkward using it, you wont know how to hold it \\""right\\"" and you'll get your butt kicked a lot.  Don't go back to the controller.  Tough it out, its worth it.  You will get better.  It just takes time, effort and practice."
5.0	I find this to be a solid 5 star RPG, something that you just don't see too often these days--for any gaming system. I will just run down a list of why I like the game so much:    1) The graphics are fantastic!    2) The story is interesting and never gets dull or boring.    3) The difficulty is just right.    4) The battle system (turn-based).    Brave Story is a very open-ended and engaging game with tons of side-quests. Even so, you are never left clueless as to what to do next to proceed in the story. This means you can take your time and complete everything, or just play it straight through to the end--the choice is yours. If you complete 100% of this game it will likely take you 40 hours, or more. Also, there is lots of replay value as having different characters in your party unlocks different combined abilities (unity skills). The game does require you to level your characters quite often, but that is part of the fun as you are always learning new abilities.    With newly released rpgs running in such short supply, this game is a fantastic welcome to the PSP library of games. I can only hope that more rpgs of this caliber are in the works.
5.0	I really enjoyed this game and collectors edition was even better. It's a must buy for anyone who enjoys old rpgs and anime.
5.0	Squarenix is always good with RPG games. It's just a remake from the game on SFC(super nintendo)  they add animation and better graphic for the game, so I totally buy them because I love the old version  and the new one just improve it so it's good
5.0	The NES has worked perfectly so far.  Zero complaints from me!
5.0	On the surface it is a Japanese horror RPG game, it is very creepy and disturbing especially if you put yourself in the right atmosphere at night. It actually has a very interesting story that will keep you intrigued and guessing gradually. Has great characters and is a very dark and emotionally moving game. I could say so much more but it is a game that is meant to be experienced first hand and as someone who isn't into anime or video games all that much I feel that this game has a lot offer and was alot of fun.
5.0	This game is the most fun game at advanced I played on the same level stage and had fun doing it.
5.0	This game was purchased for my daughter and since the cover of the image online was a bit different, we were concerned that it might be the wrong game. We were so pleased that it was indeed the exact game in the description and my daughter is in love with this game. The game was shipped on time and no issues with the packaging.
5.0	"Even though this is a \\""kids game\\"" my wife and I can't get enough of it. We have lost hours of our lives playing this game, and I'm sure we will lose a lot more! It's not something you can play from start to finish in one sitting because it has no real end and the game progresses in real time."
5.0	"In Micro Commandos, you control these tiny alien creatures who want to take over the \\""world of the big\\"".<BR>There are three types of commandos, Collectors who collect food and resources, Soldiers who you can send out to keep enemies away, and builders who manufacture new buildings for your micro village.<br />There are many different missions set in a variety of settings including a house, underground train station, art gallery, museum, haunted house, pizza restaurant and nursery.<br />The aim of the game is to build a village in these locations, and collect resources. All they realy want to do is take over planet Earth.<br />This game is really addictive and fun. It's a strategy game that doesn't get tedious, and it's quite challenging. The characters are funny too.<br />I would recommend this game, especially if you like strategy games."
5.0	I got this 1 day ago and today I couldn't stop playing it. It is a great game for multiplayer and the nintendo wfc mode. You can keep playing this game with all the new bikes, carts, and characters. The graphics are one of the best, and out of all the mariokart games, this is the best. The wheel in my opinion, makes it really fun. So far, there are no negative concepts in this game. The race action was adrenaline pumping, and you couldn't get enough of it. Nintendo really has done an excellent job on this game. There are lots of other types of gameplay like ghost races, tournaments, grand prix mode, time trials etc. This game can be challenging and at the same time easy and fun. Even though I am not a big Mario fan, I like the games but this stood out the most. Whoever out there, who is looking for a good game, get this one.
5.0	Thank you. Excellent service and I love the game. Just have to make more time to use it.
1.0	I didn't buy this game through Amazon - Maybe if I had looked here first I would have seen all the terrible reviews and saved myself $20.00. The graphics are the only improvement over Lords II, and as has been stated by others, they're still below par.    Here I was, oh-boy all excited to play the next Lords Of The Realm game, and boy-oh-god what a dissapointment. Really, Sierra, how can you justify releasing a game in the Lords franchise that mocks everything that was good about its predecessor?    I want my money back. I want my money, and the 2 hours I spent trying to get into the game. I suppose if I complain enough I might get the money back, but that two hours is gone. Forever.
5.0	The only thing that I have no idea clue idea what I do want to be in
5.0	This was actually a gift for my son. He absolutely loved it. Said it was a lot better than what he thought he was getting.
5.0	For the price and what you get it was well worth getting at least the hardened edition, I didn't really want to get the prestige as I didn't need a camera but the wrist strap is really well made and the extra content and season pass is always good for a seasoned vet.
5.0	If you liked the original Kingdom Hearts, you'll feel right at home with Square's HD remastering. Relive the RPG classic as Sora, a charming but oblivious protagonist, who fights along side Disney icons Donald Duck and Goofy Dog.<br /><br />Also, the HD remastering of Chain of Memories shouldn't be missed. However, be forewarned that CoM uses a card-deck system, rather than real-time inputs. Many have labeled CoM the most difficult KH game, because its difficulty is unforgiving. However, to understand the saga overall, completing it is recommended.<br /><br />Finally, enjoy the DS exclusive 358/2 Days, as a set of interactive episodes. 358/2 disappointed many KH fans, because of filler. 70% of the game consists of revisiting maps, and accomplishing tedious tasks. However, Square salvaged the breathtaking narrative into an interactive drama, which finalizes the collection.<br /><br />No filler, no fuss, just tears of joy.
5.0	I finished this game and I love it! Working on the Revelations now as final game for Ezio...So sad to hear there's no more installment for Ezio after Revelations but also looking forward to the newer AC Series
5.0	puzzles were great and made you think. the story was well thought out
5.0	My son, 11YRS, abosultely loves the game genie, the codes help him get through some of the difficult games he originally tossed to the side. This is a must have for serious gamers. We purchased the NES game genie to use with our Hyperlink Retron 3 game system, the game genie works great with it no compatibility issues at all. Cheat codes are all online, so if you can pick a game genie up cheat without the code book its not a big deal.
5.0	This portable version it's good for me because has Multiplayer compatibility with the old Guitar Hero On Tour (and with the last title: GH On Tour Modern Hits), offering more songs to play and better experience playing with friends. In sinlge player mode, each song-set contains songs of different decades (Modern, 2k, '90, '80, '70) making well differenced rythms and rock styles.
5.0	Wow!<BR>Wow!<BR>How can you say this is worst than XBOX? <BR>WOW!<BR>XBOX only has Halo... duh!... only good game for XBOX!<BR>But Hey... I would go with the GC and PS2.<BR>Who cares if it dont have a DVD... people should have DVD players anyway by this time.<BR>You always expect good quality nintendo and sony.<BR>Wow!<BR>Just Trust Me... Keepin it Gangsta-&gt; not just for the kids
5.0	Awesome, I don't have to buy batteries anymore!
1.0	Was very excited to get this product.  After dancing on basic for one half of a song, the up arrow key began to stop reading my steps.  I figured that it was just me being clumsy...until I got to the main menu and the options kept scrolling up independent of me.  The only way to get it to stop was to shut the console down.<br /><br />Because this is a bundle pack and not sold by Amazon: returns mean sending back the entire bundle.  There is no exchanging just the pad.  Because the item did not cost much, I am debating whether or not it is even worth sending the bundle back.<br /><br />Lame.
5.0	awesome game. Each zone is incredible looking. great art work and scenery, really wanted to screen cap so many moments of it because it was that cool. Characters are very unique adding to the story. cut scene add a lot with how well they are done and give the story that extra touch. If you love warcraft and liked their previous expansions no reason to pass this up. worth every penny so far.
5.0	Just like what the title said, it is fun to assassinate with the great arsenal of weapons Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory stunningly brings. The enviroments, enemy's, weapons, are amazing. Some of my favorite elements are that your enemy's talk to eachother casualy. Like in Hokkaido, Japan, two enemy's are talking about ninjas raiding a oil rig. This is a definite refrence to Splinter Cell 1. While I have yet to play versus mode, coop is great. I like the dependancy on the teamate to: Human Ladder, Tomoe Nage, Jamming Electronics to silently infiltrate, etc. THIS IS AN AWESOME GAME....BUY IT!
5.0	"OK.  most of you reading this review are familiar with the previous installments of the series.  So all I am going to do is touch on the points that make this game Soar above all of the previous ones.      1. The graphics.  Of course we would expect this out of a 360 or PS3 as compared to the previous versions,  but I should tell you exactly what makes it different.  Wreckage.  Far more realistic than before,  the wrecks seem far more fluid, and realistic than before,  If a wreck is pretty bad,  the car just stops working, rather than bursting into flames,  which is not very realistic.  When you wreck into things,  the damage that occurs is more realistic than before.  For example in previous games running into bushes was like running into a wall,   yet running into a  light pole at a slow speed was quite destructive.  Not the case here. When you run into  a light pole something actually happens,  the light goes off and live wires spark upon the street.  (No,  you can not get electricuted buy the wires,  but still its pretty cool.) You will not just barrel over trees either.      2. Save points.  Finally,  after a mission is over it saves the game,  no more running back to the \\""safehouse\\"" and getting in trouble for something minor and ruining it all,  that is a GREAT advantage of this game.      3. Losing a warning level over 2.  It was really aggrevating that if you managed to get to a 2 level warning,  you were done for, unless you made it to a safe house,  now,  there is a radar range meter that lets you know where to go and how far to go to start hiding from your warrant level.   That is brilliant addition to the game.     4. Taking the taxi:  If you dont feel like driving to your next mission,  then dont,  just take the taxi.  While it is a little tricky to get in the taxi without truing to steal it, it can be done,  and it is a great feature.    5. Going to the hospital: You dont lose your weapons.  Also another great addition. No more going to the hospital and having to load the previous game to get back to where you were.  Just take the Taxi and be on your way.     6. Realistic car handling/better \\""dash view\\"".  For most cars,  instead of the old bumper view,  which is hard to navigate around on,  this view includes the hood and looks just like you are driving the car.     7. Body reaction to pain.  there is no more just running out in front of a car to stop it...If you do that you will be run over and it looks very real, your body flys about in a random manner.  (It does affect your health.)  Also, there is no jogging down the street faster than a car is driving,  if you miss your chance to take it, then too bad,  better look for another.     8. Weapons and explosives:  I cant say enough about how much better the sounds of explosions, and bullets firing sound.  It is far more polished and realistic than any other installment.      In short,  its the same game you are used to loving,  just much more polished and realistic.  Check out new york city vs GTA IV comparisions on google to see what I mean.  There is a tremendous attention to detail in this game.  So much that I think It would rival many major motion pictures.      Have  fun my friends, its a helluva ride."
5.0	This game is fantastic.  CAVE, the Japanese company known for their manic shooters, released their first U.S. game ever, Deathsmiles.  Deathsmiles was released in Japan in April of 2009, but U.S. gamers without an imported Japanese Xbox were not able to play it.  Luckily, Aksys Games released it here for everyone to enjoy.  The game itself is instantly addictive, devilishly difficult and incredibly addictive.  The crisp, colorful 2D graphics shine through the waves of bullets and enemies and even with hundreds of bullets on screen, everything is easily visible and highly detailed.  The music matches the feeling and mood of each level, from pumping metal to eerie classical.  The game's dark lolita theme is brilliantly captured by CAVE...each level has its own life and personality.  The gameplay is where the game really shines.  This is CAVE's second horizontal shooter (the other being an arcade game from the 90's--Progear) but they have really shown their versatility with it.  The character can shoot both left and right.  Enemies attack from both sides of the screen, a formula that is very unique and very entertaining.  It's the kind of game you can play in an hour but spend a lifetime perfecting.  Highly recommended for any shooter fans, vertical or horizontal.
1.0	Where to start? dead ends, no help, not enjoyable to play for sure. It is a far cry from COD; Wish I had never bought it. May put it in the trash for next pickup. Never buy another Cryss again....
5.0	It worked well, but after a few minutes of using it, it became unresponsive by a second
5.0	To be honest im writing this review to find out if this game is a download key or full install from CD/DVD because I am currently Deployed and have very little to any internet so I would love for someone to post again to let me know if this is a full game install or a down... Thanks
5.0	Farcry 2 is a definte must own.  The landscape is breathtaking as well as the combat and the game is very entertaining and will keep you playing for many hours.  If you are deciding on what game to get this holiday season you can not go wrong with this game.
5.0	Even though I'm not really good at them, I enjoy flight sims. Space based ones are pretty good too. This one is great. The mechanics are smooth, the scenery looks beautiful. The missions are far from short too. There, of course, are a handful of short ones but those are necessary to carry on the plot. One thing, and the only thing, I dislike about it, is the game is feeding you so much information at once, its hard to grasp whats going on. Then again, I'm kinda single minded so, it could just be me.<br /><br />The characters are likeable, and the voice acting is pretty good too. So, I give it 4 out of 5 stars.
5.0	It is just a superb game with action thrilled. it is a sure game to buy who love action games.it is better than the medievil 1. <br />i love playing it. so i recommend you to buy it. only disadvantage is its controlling
5.0	This little thing is seamless, it just works. I read some complaints about the bright light but mine is behind my tv. A little electrical tape would solve the problem if it bothered you I guess. My son was concerned if he was playing a game and someone turned on the Apple TV for example, he would loose his game. I am not sure if that would be the case and no one has done that to him yet. Automatically switching is great. Just power up the device you want and it works. Problem solved. Turns one HDMI port into two.
5.0	Keeps your remotes charged at all times and it will save a fortune in my house just on batteries alone! :)
1.0	without the code its useless.
5.0	axis and allies cd-rom is better then the board game because you dont have to set it up and you always have someone to play with (AI) although it is kinda buggy make sure you get the latest patch 1.33 then you have to find out what makes it all of a sudden exit the game when it freezes you have to wait a minuit usually it comes back up also you should not buy it from ricmiester he lists it as new but it really isnt and the game came to me barely playable full of scratches and it was incredibly over priced buy it from some one that says the game is in the origanal jewel case and is unopened
5.0	I ordered this game for my 6 year old grandson. My grandson thinks the game is super and awesome.  He really enjoys playing the game. Thanks for making him happy.
5.0	This game was surprising a blast to play. I was actually bummed when I finished it. I think this game might have ruined me for other games. Graphics are great. Very smooth game play. I loved the comical comments of some of the enemies. Definitely not for younger players. A ton of side play was a bonus. This game will keep you busy for weeks if not months.  Many thanks to all involved in creating it, JOB WELL DONE!!!
5.0	had the game on another system and so i had to get it
1.0	I was looking forward to Spore for many months now.  The closer I came to the date of it's release the more I heard about the DRM.  So, for the first time, I will not be buying a game specifically because I want to make a statement to the publishers.      Right now there are enough good games out there to play.  I am mad as heck and I don't have to put up with their foolishness.
5.0	Yes, I can finally use my wii on my big screen television.  I was running into the same problems as other people except when I got my new tv my component hook-up never worked.  I was super glad I got a tv with 4 hdmi ports....my wii is now hooked up to one of them.  Played it the other night, did some bowling and it's great.  Definitely 2 thumbs up on this product.
5.0	Great old game at a nice price.
1.0	"Epic Mickey is full of glitches there have been several quests that have been attempted a dozen times only for it to randomly work (it was an easy quest that anyone could do)  The horrible camera angles make it unnecessarily difficult to accomplish the easiest of tasks along with fights which make it downright frustrating.Like many good games it has been ruined by bad camera controls, angles, and forced shots. Being unable to reenter areas to complete quests you unknowingly did not accomplish makes it annoying.<br /><br />I am glad I got this is a Christmas present because I would have hated to waste my money on this poorly executed game.<br /><br />And really the cheapos at Disney couldn't even give mickey a voice? It all sounds like the adults from Peanuts. \\""wah wah wah wah\\"" I mean really?"
5.0	as i said best controller ever i say that because it work good and it look more cooler in person so you shloud get this controller.
5.0	I am a beginner and this was a great way to start. Characters are realistic and fun to play with
5.0	Just cause I love Pokémon
5.0	How many of us have often wondered what it would be like to suddenly veer off the man-made roads winding through the allure of natural surroundings, and (in a non-green impacting virtual reality manner)trek hell-bent-for-leather wherever our gut drives us (even over a cliff if curiosity prevails)?  This is that game...  For those of us unable physically (via logistics or the progress of too many years, or other such irritating and limiting factors)to commune with nature via the backpack and sturdy shoe, this provides a welcome sojourn into a world,prohibited us in 'real life' in (most certainly) vehicles and ballistic gas pedaled frenzied impulses which would otherwise land us in the local county jail, the hospital morgue, or the object of disdain amongst the ecologically minded caretakers of mother nature.  Here you can rip, snort, and crow; and not even leave footprints behind in the pristine centers of life's natural preserves, while conversely impacting profoundly the digital topography and virtual community's grin factor for those who choose to ride along for fun.  For those who have been forced to be couch potatoes due to lacking resources or the course of mother nature's hand, this is your chance to fight back or simply just 'get away form it all'...and be politically correct at the same time!
5.0	My daughter is very happy with her purchase. She saved up her own money and bought the DSI.  When it came I checked it over and it was brand new as promised. It actually delivered on Monday June 1st. Which was early she was super excited about that.
5.0	My son received an Xbox wireless adapter for Christmas - I didn't realize then that he would also need this membership in order to play his games online.  The card came as ordered and within the time promised.  My son loves playing his games online and is able to meet up with his friends online to play together.  It would have been nice to know the membership is a requirement in order to play online before spending the money on the adapter.  But, since he's happy, I'm happy.
5.0	The 4Shot is everything you could want in a lower-end headset -- Sound, comfort, ease of use, and decent voice capabilities.<br /><br />Sound -- top notch, lots of control for volume.<br />Comfort -- Easily the most comfortable headset I have ever worn; can wear for hours on end and not feel any pain whatsoever, which is a huge upside to it.<br />Ease of use -- I know this is weird, but the set up was a breeze. Usually, headsets of this caliber are not easy to set up, and I appreciated that aspect of it.<br />Voice -- the only downside is that you have to add the plug in mic, which they provide. It works well!<br /><br />Get this if you are looking for a starter headset that will improve your gaming experience immensely!
5.0	Purchased sometime back for my Older Grandson.  I did not play it but I am gathering that he enjoyed it.
5.0	This was my first game for PC and I feel there is no difference in playing on a console system.  The grafics are amazing. For example, you can pretty much read the tattoos of the players.  The presentation of the game as you play is just like watching it on TV.  It is the Best Basketball game I have ever played. Doing business with amazon was a nice and easy transaction. I will do business with Amazon again.  Keep up the good work Amazon!!!
5.0	I spend more time than I should driving ships and other smaller boats on this great simulator. I love the sea and ships, and this is how I feed that passion. Its physics modeling is very realistic, and the detailing of the imaging is really good.
1.0	I have enjoyed other titles of this series. But, since no one can figure out if a game that is clearly labeled &#34;Mac&#34; will run on a Mac, or not, I  can not event get this game to load. This is not the first time I bought a game which says Mac compatible in the ad and on the box that will not load. I will go back to reading for enjoyment.
1.0	The 'A' Button Sucks. You have to jam it Hard to make it work - Terrible for game play.<br />I tested it on 'Star Fox 64' (on Wii) and before I was half way through the first level I knew I was going to return it. Lame....<br /><br />The price is tempting, but its NOT worth it. Go with Nintendo Products.
5.0	I bought this to use with the evga tegara note 7 and works flawlessly. comes with usb charger but no wall connect, stand and a nice compact travel case to put everything in.
5.0	Bought this controller a year ago after my original one started to die. It was packaged well and worked great when I first bought it and is still working perfectly a year and month later even after a few throws to the ground in fits of gaming rage. Girlfriend also just bought a pink one of the same type and hers is also working well although only a few months old.    This is a little expensive compared to some of the generic ones but I'd rather pay for the quality. I couldn't handle jumping from roof to roof in Assassin's Creed II with my character always veering slightly to the left thanks to the original controller.
5.0	This is one of the first games I have bought where you can visually tell the difference between PS3 and PS4. The graphics are so detailed, the teams have accurate rosters, the game modes are fun, and now you can carry your save from game to game, making the replay factor very very high!
5.0	I didn't like this game in the beginning, I actually kind of hated it, but once you get to Helios, the game gets a lot better. The beginning feels &#34;off brand&#34; and janky, and I HATE the maps. I absolutely abhore the one level that has you out in space jumping from platform to platform using the vents, but overall this game has some amazing dialogue, a good storyline and some subtle improvements over BL and BL2 that I hope they keep for upcoming additions to the series.<br /><br />One of my favorite things is that your character actually responds and interacts with people based on their personality. This makes the game feel more interactive and gives you more immersion into the character you're playing.<br /><br />Another detractor for me was the whole oxygen and gravity addition. I found that running out of air constantly while be swarmed by enemies or trying to explore was really annoying; and while jumping extra high/far was fun, having items shoot around in an even more crazy, uncontrolled way was frustrating. My number one complaint with all three games is the item drops - why do they need to fly across the screen?! Just make them drop on the ground so you don't miss ones or lose them to the abyss.<br /><br />Anyway, I digress. Overall, this game is a great addition to the series. I'm very happy with my purchase and looking forward to all the DLCs!<br /><br />I truly hope that the next BL game takes place on a lush planet, I'm so sick of these dreary landscapes!
5.0	As advertised, shipping was fast
5.0	I can plug it into my car adapter or my wall charger. Just what I needed for my dsi xl.  I have no complaints, perfect.
1.0	"This game shows a fair bit of promise but fails to execute. For the 'no DRM' guys its pretty intrusive constantly trying to phone home according to my firewall logs not to mention the online registration requirement tied to a specific install. Runs fairly slow on a fast machine which would be more understandable if the graphics were anything special (a step back from [[ASIN:B000PCLBE2 Sid Meiers Civilization IV]] IMO), but they are not. UI is non intuitive and a bit buggy sometime you can click sometimes you can't. Another gripe is you can't see where the tech trees are going until you go as there is zero visibility 'up the tech tree'. This makes the occasional onscreen messages like \\""learn shard harvesting to harvest\\"" which tell you what you need but not where to go, yea after a play thru you will know where to go, but the online help is pretty pathetic. At some point a fan site will likely put together the tech-tree which should have been packaged with the product. All this plus complete crashes until patched 1.06 and still crashes a few times per hour particularly if you micromanage a tactical battle. Indicates a deployment significant deployment failure.    All that said [[ASIN:B003BJ09GM Elemental]] shows promise with a always a 'new' world and significant customization capability. Its possible that the designer got it right and engineering dropped the ball, at any rate I am going to put it on the shelf for a bit as the bugs are really too obnoxious to put up with (ALT TAB to windows will wreak havoc on the UI fonts forcing restart as I found when writing this review.) This game needs a LOT more QA before it ready for release. I prefer to get paid to beta test rather than the other way around."
5.0	all better than what expected, I arrive all in perfect conditions, just the I gave that tapeworm that to arrive the things arrived
5.0	This game is a blast, it does get kind of old after you beat it so many times, but its fun always trying to find new loot, and they need more golden keys with out face book, twitter, etc....
5.0	The best RPG I have ever played..better then Diablo I &amp; II. It is like playing a great novel...lots of playing time. An RPGer must. Very reasonable at 29.95.
5.0	Just as a introduction I will say that The Last Of Us was the best game on the PS3 (period, at least for me). Ever since selling it off and purchasing a PS4 there's always been a thought in my mind to buy the remake. This game has filled this void for me after playing for 6 hours straight. Everything in the game is just so well-done, from the upgrades, to the crafting system, to the movements through the environment, to the environment itself. Sure the graphics are mediocre (but still good), but what's not to love!<br /><br />I was on the fence about this game since there were no real reviews to go on... regardless I bought it on Day 1 and have no regrets. Worth every penny and I still have over 90% of the game to go!<br /><br />UPDATE 2/29/15: I've put in well over 10 hours into the game at 28% completion and I have to say I am still loving every aspect of the game. None of the missions have become repetitive, nor the gameplay tiresome. This may be a GOTY.
5.0	Awesome game. The graphics are fantastic and so is the game play. Character customization is fun--the whole thing is just a blast. Lots of missions, lots of hilarious, dark humor. (And ten times better than Saints Row 3.)
5.0	I started racing with a momo red, then the G25 To the G27, hands down the TX is the best wheel i have owned to date
5.0	I started the game about a week ago and now i'm ignoring all my other games.. This game is hours of fun, battles and jobs! Pick it up to experience it yourself.. It's not the best RPG game for no reason.
5.0	Comfortable, loud and clear sound. People on the receiving end have no trouble hearing me.
5.0	Such a fun game! My little one and I own all of the Just Dance games that have come out and 4 is our favorite! :)
5.0	If you've got an Atari 7800 you need to own this game.  Not only for the wow factor of the title, but because it's one of the few exclusives to the system that is flat out AMAZING!  The Golfing is ok, I've never played Video Golf before so I don't have an opinion, but hte Side Scrolling action part of the game is very fun and the combination of the two makes for a very unique game.  At the end of each stage, on the green, you battle a magical dragon with shuriken.  It reminds me of the bonus rounds of Shinobi on the Master System.  This game is funs and having it on your shelf to show to your friends is also pretty fun.  :D
1.0	This set of pinball games is terrible.  The flippers are sluggish, the graphics are dark and hard to see.  The 3D effect of the tables is poor, and makes play confusing.  The box claims 27 tables, but there are not 27 DIFFERENT tables - there seem to be about 15 different tables, and the rest are just duplicate tables on another CD.  If you like the graphics and feel and play of the Space Cadet pinball table that comes with Windows, don't buy this.  It's not even close.
5.0	My son received this for Christmas and seems to enjoy it thoroughly! He played the earlier versions so he likes this one also!
5.0	All the triple packs are great value and good to get three characters in one go. This packs characters were an excellent mix of abilities and element types.
5.0	"My son actually had a \\""Dogz\\"" and \\""Catz\\"" game similar to this for our computer some years ago. Very fun...very cute but wow, how far the technology has come in a few short years! First of all, the images are amazing and very crisp and clear. Secondly, he'll play it for hours on end (if I let him) and really seems to be doing something constructive rather than just shooting things and running in circles finding coins. The voice recognition is really genius, he's the only one that can train the dog he's chosen, even if his friends decide they'd like to try the game. It also teaches  responsibility before the fact if you are thinking of getting a pet. No...it's not \\""real life\\"" but it's the coolest virtual thing I've seen in a long time! It's not a bad price as games go, and it really will keep the kids occupied for a long time. I just think it's really neat and hey, it's not annoying like a Furby."
5.0	I have big man hands... I'm a man! A 6ft5in manly man with big man hands but I love to play my 3DS XL.<br /><br />This eliminated cramping! Perfect for manly men!
5.0	[[ASIN:B000LFJNF2 Wii Charge Station]]  Just as advertised.  A real game saver.  keeps you contollers always ready to play.
5.0	Who could resist a game that combines great anime style fighting machines with beutiful overall 3d gameplay?  This could be one of the best titles to hit the PS2 so far.  and done by the creator of the metal gear seris any serious gamer should know to buy this game!!!  the weapons and controls are easily mastered which makes the game even more of a great overall experiance.  The only thing that was less than amazing was the character design (you know, inside the mech.)  the main character is a small boy and is later accompanied by his friend.  this often becomes annoying during story sequences.  the enemy chracter, however, was very well done and fits perfectly into the anime style game.  If you like action, than grab this game as soon as you can
5.0	Works great.  Just what I needed.
5.0	This will definitely surpass the Xbox 360 as the best console in history!  The future is here!  The controller that comes with it is amazing as well.
5.0	Great game. COD is what got me into FPS games in the first place. I prefer battlefield these days, but still a classic
5.0	I love this game because I love build a bear! Try it because its awesome! Love it! Please buy it!
1.0	The game was for the pc and it was a 1999 game. Very bad graphics from the 1999 game. fake
5.0	I don't think anyone can wait. It was a good move by Rare to put secrets in Banjo-Kazooie that Mumbo shows you pictures of, but he doesn't tell you what they are for. That way almost anyone that beat B-K will want B-T to get the secrets! There are new moves, new worlds, new tranformations, characters that are now playable, partly first-person shooter when Banjo holds Kazooie like an assault rifle and shoots eggs, Banko and Kazooie can go their own ways, multi-player mode, probably worked out a bunch of bugs, new types of eggs to shoot, having a reticle so you can aim your eggs...!
1.0	"I wanted to love this game--the way I love Westerns, FPS, and PS3. This is an unbeatable combo I've been waiting for since the PS3 hit the market. Finally we have an entry in this genre, and to say it was phoned-in would suggest that someone made the effort to pick up the receiver and dial...which in my opinion they didn't. This game is, as the title of this review suggests, lazy and uninspired. The gameplay sucks. The technical glitches and annoyances are too many to list. This would have been an acceptable entry two years ago, at the dawn of the PS3, but at this point I'm starting to think game developers will never get it right. The PS3's potential is being pissed away by games rushed to market, and this one was especially disappointing given its potential to define the next-gen Western FPS genre. No wonder there's no demo available for download. Run from this one, wait for the upcoming \\""Red Dead Redemption\\"" later this year."
5.0	i wanted to no if the destroy all humans is really out for ps3 because i have one and iv been waiting to buy this game. also i want to no how much this game will cost at any game stores, Iv played the game D.A.H 1 and 2 so is this game just like the D.A.H 2 or is it a newer version like on a hole new level and that's it thx.
5.0	Extremely enjoyable and addictive game.  Like many games of this type, you must patiently raise your monster's battling statistics and gain new techniques through training drills, etc. Unlike other games, you get to &quot;play&quot; with your monster and treat it well, praise it, or  otherwise raise or lower it's like or dislike and loyalty to you.  You may  even gain an emotional attachment to your monster (my seven year old did).   On major drawback to this game:  The monsters only live a very short period  of time.  Usually three &quot;years&quot; or less.  The harsher you treat  your monster, the lower the lifespan and vice versa.  Be sure to look up  info on the WWW for this game.  Not everything is explained in full detail.
1.0	I got the dance mat and I was so excited to play it. I only used it 5 times and then it stopped working. I was so mad. I returned it and got a new one, but it did the same thing. I got the dance mat by konami. I paid more money for it, but it was worth it because it really does work. I even lost weight playing this game.
5.0	Once you start playing this you won't stop.<br />Animal Crossing is so much fun and you get to do so much from; fishing, catching bugs, building a house, making friends, etc.<br />There is no end or storyline, you just get to live in a town and do whatever you want.<br />There really is no flaw to this game except for the fact that it is so addicting that you might not put it down.<br />A great title for the D.S definitley recommended.
5.0	Sharkk Wired Gaming Mouse:<br />Adjustable DPI up to 3500<br />6 Changing LED colors.<br />Has a long wire that can connect to the computer.<br />You can Adjust the mouse's weight.<br />Has a left and right button that can be adjusted<br /><br />This Mouse is Good for playing MMORPG games… It has many controls and is only $12.99 USD. MMORPG = Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game.<br /><br />My opinion on the product is that the product is good but It could be better if you can program it on a macbook air 11 inch.<br /><br />I do recommend this product for others… it is good use for a very great price. I have really enjoyed using this mouse.<br /><br />The mouse is high quality and would be good use for serious gamers.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Can be programmed onto a PC.<br /><br />Can change DPI.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Cannot be Programmed onto a Macbook<br /><br />Does Not have as many controls as other mice.
5.0	If you like racing games, there are few better. I wish they'd make another! Everything about this game is great and addictive.
5.0	I bought this expecting to get a Gift Card for Xbox worth USD50.<br />When I unpacked it I discovered it was indeed a Gift Card for Xbox worth USD50. Amazing!
5.0	"Our whole family loves \\""Just Dance\\"".  From my 3 year old daughter to my 35 year old husband.  It's something we can all do together, the four of us, and it gets everyone off the couch and makes them active.  Even Grandma & Grandpa come over and join the fun.  Me & my sister-in-law use it as a workout video.  Pump Up the Jam works really well for that!  I would recommend this to everyone!  On a sidenote - some of the lyrics aren't age appropriate for my 3 & 5 year olds but I just make sure I'm in the room with my kids when they play and don't pick those songs.  Their favorite is \\""Who Let the Dogs Out\\"""
5.0	I got this for my XL and it is much bigger than I expected!<br /><br />That's actually nice, the 3DS fits well and it comes with space for games and the AR cards, maybe even other cards too.
5.0	Love it use it everyday thanks! Never have had a problem with it at all works great gets me to play my best
5.0	The game did not come in damaged and it was brand new, and it looks great and works great. Very happy with this purchase.
5.0	this game is so awesome. The graphics are great and the levels are challenging and whole lot of fun. I recommend this game to anyone who likes good adventure/action games with a deep and involving storyline with great  graphics.
5.0	My father, John, is a family physician and i trust he knows what he is talking about. I had him take a look at this game(s), and he told me that it was truly realistic. If you want a challenging, but one that gives help along the way so it is fun, this is your best bet. Don't let another bad review spoil what is guaranteed to be a great time. i'm only thirteen, and i think is a best buy.
1.0	Unfortunately<br />Not so good<br />Some of the buttons do not work<br />Wire and shipping is good
1.0	I got it in pretty good time, but only one side of the charger works and only half the time. They only hold charge for like an hour so its annoying to charge it all the time. I wish i had got a different one.
5.0	This is a great game, it blends real scenes from the movie into the game. Sometimes you don't even know you have started! The graphics are amazing and so is the gameplay; the controls are great and blend perfectly with the game. The levels are directly from the movie; there is Weathertop(where Aragorn,aka Strider, fights off the evil Nazgul, the robed guys) there is also Moria(where they fight the troll and Orcs)and many other events from the movie. The final level is Helm's Deep; Helm's Deep is in The Two Towers movie and it is where the Riders Of Rohan and Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli and Gandalf all fight the Uruk-Hai(they are the evil orc-troll things that come from the mud). Trust me, this game has amazing graphic, excellent gameplay(controls) and I  recommend it. Please get this game when it comes out on January 1st!
5.0	Although I love to get outside and exercise by running, hiking, biking... this is a great way to get a little sweat going during the rainy days of the week, or when it's too dark outside.  It is also a fun way to encourage my non-outdoorsy friends to stay in shape.  With the multiple levels of activities, I'm happy to say that I can also break a sweat.  Definitely worth the expense!
5.0	Great product, work great.
5.0	This game is a masterpiece from Quantic Dream, the story is really deep and well made and the characters based on real actors make it more engaging. The game must be a little short but, as far as I know, it have alternate endings depending on the decisions you make.<br /><br />If you like the drama games, like Heavy Rain, I highly recomend it to you.
1.0	sands of time has its moments, warrior within has a bug when u get the water sword, the 3nd frezzs to much
5.0	My son absolutely enjoys this
1.0	Unfortunately out of the box only one charging spot worked consistently, although with careful wiggling, the others could be made to work, but not at the same time, and not for more than a few minutes. And after a few weeks, they wouldn't work at all. Customer service was good in issuing a refund, but please save yourself tr hassle and avoid this product.
5.0	I am very happy with this case to say the least. It provides the needed girth for my large hands, the material feels super comfortable, and it contours to the openings for the charger, headphones, and stylus. I strongly recommend this to anyone wanting a great case.
5.0	console works perfectly as do the wires.<br />the r1 button on the controller was a bit faulty but i picked up a new ps2 controller from gamestop.<br />the games are super cheap these days (but you get what you payed for)
5.0	I received my product in time, and now I'm trying it out myself and with friends. I would've wrote something before, but school has me busy. Thankfully I have this to work at in my spare time. I like the new updates on this one and the older one is awesome as well. I guess I'll make a better review on the other one... Anyways, 5/5!
5.0	"FIRST For Those of you who reviewed This In 2008 or 2009, The FC pictured ABOVE, Is the OLD version. HYPERKIN Has A New 2010 version & this Is what youll get now. Its Much improved And CLEARLY STATES On The Box \\""PLAYS ALL ORIGINIAL NINTENDO 8 BIT CARTRIDGES\\"" The Box Above Wich Was The First US Version DID NOT STATE THAT, So Yes It SAYS NES & NINTENDO All Over the Box! It Now if you look Folks Above says Colors of Console are Now in RED,BLACK & SILVER. No longer Are the 3 ugly looking 2 Color versions.Its The Smallest FAMICON NES CLONE YET! And the best one. I Got the BLACK one, & it makes the original Nintendo look Lame!<br />REMEMBER, The Cartridges ARE OLD So You Need to CLEAN The Contacts On the Cartridges With a Q tip FIRST, Dont Insert A cartridge until Thoroughly Cleaned, Use Rubbing alchohol! On the QTIP, Squeeze Out the excess alchohol On the swab Just A lightly MOIST Swab with rubbing Alchohol Does It mint. Make sure the Cart is Dry Blow On it and your ready To Game!<br />THE GOODS:<br />The Games Look Better than The Original, The AV inputs instead Of the Coax cable Old Nintendo Hookup Make it CLEARER Especially On an HD TV. I did Not have A problem with any Games, They all worked Better than ever! If You experience Problems with a game Its Your CARTRIDGE Not the console. make sure If you collect & buy used games wich i do that the CART is in good Condition, Clean them good First & Store your Games In Shoe boxes Away from dust. Game cartridges Have To Be cleaned Ever Since ATARI games. I have ATARI, sega genesis, & I still Need to clean My carts every once in A while, no biggie.its Not a Problem If they are Cleaned.I garantee If you buy An original USED nintendo that is 25 years old You'll have alot more problems than ever & the prices for those are Not worth it a bit."
5.0	If i went to school and hit my teacher would i get 1 star jk this is the shet excuse my language but why not waste hours getting hookers and killin sucks
5.0	It's a perfect gift for my son(5and half years old). we really enjoyed almost all the games! we highly recommend to all parents who has a young child.
5.0	I ordered this a while ago and forgot to write a review.<br /><br />Fast Delivery and been playing this game for a while. An awesome game to add to your 3ds library
5.0	Sneaky, sneaky! Some aspects of this game are pretty easy, especially if you've played Arkham Asylum and have familiarized yourself with some of Batman's basic functions. Some scenarios are just plain hard, but determination is everything! One groovy thing about the game is being able to enjoy the scenarios with other villains besides the Joker. I enjoyed being able to knock the Penguin out, and Harley Quinn deserved the punch I gave her on first sight. Catwoman is fab. No game is perfect, but Batman: Arkham City makes a really good try at it.
1.0	"It was great when it first arrived despite having overly stiff button presses as mentioned in other reviews. After about 2 weeks though, it began to \\""spaz\\"" out while playing. Single button presses would count as two, the directional pad began making up movement paths that don't exist in the realm of 2d video game physics...     You should find a used and collectibles shop and buy an Original."
1.0	I had placed this order and it shipped over a month ago and I have yet to recieve it. Still waiting to hear back from anyone on how to handle this issue.
5.0	Great product for games.
5.0	I ordered this game for my husband for his new 3dsi and the kids have taken over the game! they say its very fun!
5.0	fantastic for flight/space sims. I'm playing Elite dangerous with it. Warning, its a bit sensitive if you sit with your back to a window.<br /><br />Now you have no need for camera bindings.
5.0	They are pretty short cables, but they do work well.  No problem using them at all, surprisingly enough, the HDMI cable is even capable of carrying the sound, if your TV supports it.  I didn't even have to use the other part of the adapter, except to plug headphones in.
5.0	"This is one of the best computer games ever, and the best single-character role playing game. <br /> <br />After the first few hours of playing Deus Ex, I was impressed the complexity of the combat system.  The tactical maps reward exploration, the hit point system is body-location specific instead of general (so a critical blow against a head is much different from one against a leg), and there are so many ways to approach a probem that it makes the \\""multisolution\\"" system of Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic look like Tic Tac Toe.   The options of long-range sniping, getting up close and personal with melee weapons or unleashing with automatic weapons and grenades also contribute to a great first person shooter experience. <br /> <br />After the first day, I was impressed with how the game went out of its way to set the mood of another world, the fact that if you wander into the women's restroom an NPC will make a sarcastic comment, and how almost every non-player character has something to say.  I was particularly blown away by how experience is awarded not for killing things, but for \\""exploration bonuses\\"", \\""progress awards\\"" and \\""achieved objective awards\\"".  Too many games reward the entirely unrealistic activity of looking for danger, while in Deus Ex there is little point to looking for an unnecessary fight.   <br /> <br />I moved the game from the \\""really good\\"" to the \\""ridiculously good\\"" column after it passed the 'toilet' and 'Asian languages' tests.  Have you ever noticed that people in computer games almost never have to go the bathroom, and that even large buildings don't have any toilets?  And also that games that have a lot of toilets, such as the Fallout series, tend to be really good role playing games?  Deus Ex has a lot of restrooms, with toilets that you can flush.  The second test is one that I've never actually seen in a game - the use of an actual Asian language rather than a bunch of scribbles.  Having spent about 6 years of my life studyingJapanese, the fact that most games don't even try to use a real writing system for signs supposedly set somewhere in Asia is really annoying.  Deus Ex does in the chapter set in Hong Kong, and it is so well done that I was able to tell stalls in the market apart by their Chinese-language signs.  Major respect due to the designers for their attention to this detail that everyone else ignores! <br /> <br />Finally, when NPCs began to give in-depth speeches on the nature of the relationships among society, the individual and government I decided that this game was off the charts.  It is the rarest of computer games - a first-person shooter role playing game that builds its foundation on ideas.  The graphics are a bit dated, but the graphics are not the reason to play this game.  Unless you need your games to be non-stop explosions and gunfire, you need to get this game."
5.0	I was originally going to buy the Turtle Beach P11 for the gamer in the family however I was swayed to army headset because its universal and considering she games mainly for the ps3 she also games on the comp and xbox so the fact that we could use them for all of those was great. She loves the fact that you can take of the mic off and use it as regular headphones. I also have to say that I tried it myself, it has noise cancelling, I mean you cannot hear a thing while you have them on. the ear padding is well padded  and perfectly fine. They are comfortable and they work very well you can hear everyone coming up behind you. Great product.
5.0	This case is simply perfect for the vita. Great materials, great protection, great size, room for power adapter and usb cords. Looks great too, almost business like. Best way to bring the Vita along with you.
5.0	Exactly what I wanted
5.0	Developed exclusively for Nintendo GameCube by Nintendo and Left Field, NBA Courtside 2002 taps into the power of GameCube to deliver authentic NBA action like never before. Up to four players can hit the hardwood simultaneously and talk trash to their hearts' content as they bust sweet crossovers, first-step jukes, and monster dunks. <BR>NBA Courtside 2002 delivers a one-two punch of slick graphics and tight gameplay. Precise face-mapping ensures that your favorite ballers are recognizable, and fluid player animations bring the game to life. Why do the moves look so good? Because Left Field spent two days with NBA superstar Kobe Bryant in an intense motion-capture session. Unique to NBA Courtside 2002 is an adrenaline button that can give players the extra juice they need to turn a normal lay-up into an ankle-breaking reverse jam. Lively commentary brings the action to life without becoming repetitious. <BR>    Out of all the basketball games ive played this is definitely the best. Why? The graphics are ok but the dunks are what makes it good. The arcade mode is AWESOME but i wish there was a dunk contest, o well...
5.0	This is THE Rpg to get for gba. The puzzles are awesome, mind-boggling at times (I had to look online multiple times for solving the puzzles). The combat system, though simple, is flashy and entertaining, and random battles aren't too bad as they are usually very quick. But I am not as big a fan of the story. It's a bit confusing and you don't see where GS is going (Some of the bosses have little to do with the story). Also, at least graphics wise, this game really is just the same as GS:1. BUT if you liked GS:1, which I did, you will love GS:lost age, as the locales and storyline, though confusing at times, are relatively entertaining. This is probably my favorite game of all the GBA games. BUY IT!!!
1.0	Wow.  That was... Honestly, I don't even have the words for how miserable this game was.<br /><br />Normally I have a pretty high tolerance for miserable games, but this one is beyond the pale.  In this day and age, if a developer is going to make a racing game they need to go and play Forza or Gran Turismo and then use that as the yardstick.<br /><br />First lets talk graphics.  The HUD on screen is tiny.  The gear indicator is about a 12pt text on my 40&#34; screen... I know I'm an old fart, but nobody can see that.  The cars look pretty... but it feels muddy.  They tried to throw to much detail so that it gets all lost into itself.<br /><br />Controls.  They are vague.  Like driving a bus vague.  I was wondering if there was an issue with in my controller when i first started playing!  The button lay-out is awkward, theres no appreciable tutorial, but the way the cars handle makes the button issue elementary.  But the missions are all built around precision driving and the physics can't match.<br /><br />Last we have the interface...  Theres a miserable map with awkward zoom features, over small icons, slow response to input requests, illegible menus.  Actually the over-small theme is featured throughout.<br /><br />As for the story line, it could be good.  But I just don't care.  The rushed intro and the way the campaign gets forced down your throat make me so totally indifferent about the hipster that I'm supposed to be playing that I just cant be bother to give a frack.<br /><br />Watch the preview video again.  It's the only good thing about this game.
5.0	"I recently purchased Just Dance 2, and boy this game is wicked fun! You feel like you've done a complete cardio workout after playing for 30 minutes to an hour but at the same time you don't have to have that \\""Ugh...do I have to workout?\\"" feeling. You move a lot more in this version, including more leg and body movements rather than just flapping your arms. Try \\""Iko Iko\\"" by Mardi Gras or \\""Dagomba\\"" by Sorcerer these two are my favorites by far. Proud Mary is also a blast, even you can be Tina Turner!"
1.0	Received item, it was not as described, did not work. Was very disappointed.
5.0	I recently got this game for Christmas on my Playstation 1.  Some of the games were fun to play.  Las Vegas Blackjack and Casino, Shark! Shark!, Astrosmash, and Snafu are my favorites!!  The other games are really fun!!  If you're a huge fan of Intellivsion, you'll love this collection of Intellivision Classics!!
1.0	game cube game on a wii wow big deal is that the best nintendo can do game is unfair and too hard every ti me you aim its too hard with wii mote village boss is too hard if you climb a ladder he knocks you down  he is on top you hiting before you can aim game is crappy and unfair
5.0	Being used to first-person &#34;shooters&#34; I purchased this game knowing it would be more like &#34;Gods of War&#34; than &#34;Battlefield:Bad Company&#34; so I had some reservations. I was wrong. This is a fun game to play and very challenging mentally. My overal evaluation of the game is:<br /><br />Pros:<br />  Simply put, the game is fun.<br />  The graphics are excellent as is your ability to move around in different environments.<br />  Controlling Batman is not as difficult as I expected (especially at the beginners level)<br />  Fighting opponents, repelling around structures, and using Bat-skills (Detective mode) adds extra fun to the game<br />  The game &#34;challenges&#34; are cool, but they ARE challenging.<br />  The story line and ongoing plot(s) keep you interested.<br /><br />Cons:<br />  Fortunately, not too many.<br />  Trying to access &#34;trophy's&#34; in areas that seem inaccessible can be frustrating.<br />  The environment is HUGE and sometimes leaves you wondering which direction to go in next.<br />  The map(s) could be designed to zoom in even closer than they do, and have trophy/treasure marks<br /><br />In final review, I put off playing this game because I like different venues. Now, I have three new games that are gathering dust because I keep coming back to Batman.
5.0	My son had the Lego Star Wars II game and I thought I would get this one to change it up a bit. It seems the games are very similar, but have a few differences in the little 'adventures'. I can't comment on the exact differences because I haven't played it myself, yet. If you are looking for a gmae for a young child, this is a good one. There are a few things that are a little difficult for him to do, and he gets a little frustrated, but, I don't think it would be as much fun if he could easily do everything right away. I think he would get bored more quickly. As with everything else, I tell him he needs to keep trying. He eventually gets it. My [...] daughter also plays along with him. She enjoys it as well, although some of the things you have to do to open doors, etc. are a little more difficult for her, but, again, it's always good to have something more difficult. Something to work for. My two year old is determined to play this game as well, but unfortunately he is just barely figuring out how it works, but sure tries! I hope this helps. I know it was difficult for us to find a nice, non violent game for our eager son to play. This is one of them. I think it's really cute/funny that when a lego guy is hit, rather than some bloody stuff, all of his lego parts fall apart into a pile! Good luck.
5.0	"I'm having such fun with the Wii even though it added 15 years to my actual age and tells me I'm \\""unbalanced\\"". It's motivating because I'm only competing with myself. It's gotten me off the couch and moving again! I've lost weight and gotten \\""younger\\"". I'm now 5 years younger according to my Wii age! I highly recommend it."
1.0	As a teacher of educable mentally impaired middle school students, I can only say one thing, &quot;Your CD version of Who Wants To Be A Millionaire&quot;, is extremely insulting.  I brought it to class for game day and the kids were thrilled!  We sat down to play and didn't quite get the two or more player directions displayed on the screen.  It was then  that Regis started calling us &quot;dummies&quot; as well as  &quot;pathetic&quot; and then shuts down the game!  Can you imagine the  reactions of these kids who already suffer from low self-esteem.  What is  the deal with Regis firing these abusive names and coments at the players.   You should be absolutly ashamed at this type of name calling which we  absolutely discourage at our school as well as in the home.  &quot;Get rid  of the degrading comments, Regis&quot;.  The kids are writing a letter  today in composition class.  I think an apology is in order.<br />Sincerely,            Debi Ruggeri
5.0	Very solid figurine! Fox is my main and will always be
1.0	I ordered item and when I plugged it in it started smoking and wasn't connected to the item I purchased it to charge so I know wasn't the item that caused the charger to short out. Luckily I had it plugged into a surge protector. When I tried to return it to exchange it, said it wasn't eligible for return.
5.0	I absolutely love Zombi U. Don't expect a game where you'll be immersed in some incredible storyline and lovable characters-this game isn't really about that. It's all about creating a terrifying atmosphere where you feel really alone and where you get legitimately scared and panicked when a group of zombies comes out of nowhere. Sometimes I find myself fumbling through my inventory haphazardly when I'm caught off guard by zombies because I wasn't prepared for it. It's a rush! I even start shooting poorly because I'm so panicked. It's just plain creepy and unpredictable. Best part about it is that once you die, you start as a new survivor with hardly any supplies (I'm sure you knew that). But that makes me try SO HARD to stay alive, making any zombie encounter terrifyingly realistic. Most first person shooters can't create those types of emotions because you know you'll just respawn again in a location right near where you died and you don't have anything to lose. Not in Zombi U. Survival means everything. Highly recommended.
5.0	As far as controllers go, this is it for true compatibility. Nothing else without software matches it. Love the feel of it and look.
1.0	The screen didn't work and it caused my DS to shut off almost immediately after turning on.
5.0	My son loves sky landers he plays it all the time
1.0	Should have listened to the reviews!!!! Bad aim, lags and button on the back is badly placed.
1.0	i haven't receive the product yet...it takes long time since i purchased this..PS3 intercooler TS[[ASIN:B001CP0Q8S PS3 Intercooler TS]]
5.0	Had a great experience with the Playstation move.  Although the Robin I received has a broken hand. Very disappointed.
5.0	This controller is awesome, works perfectly, looks great, and shipped fast. My son loves it for mw3. Highly recommended for anyone who wants an edge in any shooter game.
5.0	My daughter who is 23 loves the Sims games. She has to have them as soon as they come out. She and her aunt talk about it and share ideas.(so there's not an age limit)
5.0	Best fantasy RPG around that even rivals Skyrim in my opinion.  I am falling so far behind in my other games because i cannot put this game down.
5.0	absolutely enjoy playing this.
5.0	awesome game, fits the anime.
1.0	I took my chance on this battery from someone of the marketplace and pretty much word for word all the symptoms are there:  Made in Japan, barcode missing, doesn't retain the charge much at all.  I've had mine for about a month or so and slowly the battery indicator has begun to flicker as though I had the charger connected.  Do yourself a favor and buy legit from your nearest electronic store.  I payed 17 bucks for mine here so it wasn't a big loss but avoid the hassle of waiting for your order just to be disappointed about your purchase.  I'm on my way to fry's right now to buy me a legit battery.
5.0	Beatiful game,the graphics...EVERYTHING
5.0	Does what the description said it would do. The prefect gift. any child would love it!! The glow light stays on as long as you play!!
5.0	Beyond Two Souls is a great game; Great history, amazing graphics and good gameplay! I like the fact that it is not like other games, but it shows us a different idea of ​​playing and experiencing a story.
5.0	Wow! This game rocks. You pretty much pick up from where you left off in Assassin's Creed II. You do have to regain some of the same or similar skills acquired in II. The movement, the flow, the graphics are just incredible.<br />The story is kind of weird, but fits well with the game play. There is quite a bit of game time, and of course you can continue to play after you finish the story.<br /><br />Complaints: None.<br /><br />Can't wait for Assassin's Creed Revelations.
5.0	My daughter was the one asking for the cable when we changed our old TV for a flat panel. She was the one doing the installation and the product upgraded our old Wii image.
5.0	IF YOU WERE HAVING FUN, WAIT TILL YOU GET BEHIND THIS NEW SET. WE JUST LOVE IT.
1.0	"Microsoft had one heck of a job to do when creating a sequel to AC1, my all time favorite mmorpg ever.<BR>I anxiously anticipated the release of this game and thought I was going to die of anxiety while waiting to get into Beta. Then I log into the new and improved lands of Dereth and needed to take some aspirin to relieve my headache of the graphics. The landscapes are very pretty and so are the character avatars if you adjust your camera view (zoom way in) and adjust all your settings (high)to pose for a screen shot , but you can't play that way for optimal game performance. What a disappointment, it looks like the Saturday morning comics with shadows and texture.<br />They did fix some of the negative issues in AC1 with this sequel and made a lot of improvements, but unfortunately at the sacrifice of some of the best features AC1 had.<br />I remember fondly the good times  standing in Eastham or Ayan camping the shops for the treasures the higher levels had sold. The constant crowds of people and social atmosphere in the towns due to the frequent trips you had to make to town \\""for milk runs\\"" that are no longer required. Those times are gone in AC2.<br />I also got an immediate reminder of how AC was the worst game ever for \\""kill stealing\\"", this has not changed and still as aggravating as ever.<br />So after much anticipation, I will sadly be leaving this game on the store shelf."
5.0	This is the first workout game for the Wii I've had that really gets my heart rate going.  The assessment alone had my moaning and groaning, but just a week later and I feel much fitter after keeping with it every day.  The music is good and well in rhythm to the workouts.  The game asks for your feedback on how you are feeling before and during workouts, and adjusts to your needs.  There are many locations and styles for your workouts.  What's even better is the trainer will have you warm up and cool down for your workouts - a feature sorely lacking from most workout sims.  Highly recommend.
5.0	Nice and responsive. Happy with the purchase. Should have bought it years ago.
1.0	Very disappointing.  Did not work at all
5.0	The game arrived packaged well and is exactly what I expected.
1.0	Terrible. DO NOT get this on a PC. It is I'm possible to play due to its slowness and bad graphics
1.0	VERY sporadic contact for charging.  I have placed both controllers on the charger and the front one never had any problem ... but the back port - forget it!  You have to press down on the charger to maintain contact.  If you very carefully remove your finger pressure ... SOMETIMES it will continue to charge.  But MOST times contact is lost and the charging indicator goes off.  Basically what I have is a single port charger for the PS3 controllers.  Pretty lousy quality control!  What SEEMS TO BE a well-made dual charger has an obvious design flaw.  Don't waste your time with this one.
5.0	This is one of the best and my personal favorites from the Zelda franchise! The story was fantastic, the gameplay was amazing for the time, even compared to todays gaming this game showed less problems or glitches.    There was hardly any serious problems with this game. The playtime was a very good length and it offered a some side quests to do. Each dungeon was well constructed and were not something you walk in and leave unhappy. Some parts were frustrating sure but when is a game just so easy and you feel happy beating it?    Puzzles in this game were I suppose challenging for  child but they were not impossible. This is a great game for all ages and a great buy as well.
5.0	another birthday present for my son, his favorite color is purple, no more slips from sweaty hands and it's been holding up to lots of gaming. good product and fast shipping.
5.0	Great game.My toddler loves it.
5.0	I wish I had bought a PS3 years ago.  I'm not a big gamer, but I love the integrated Blu-ray / DVD / music storage and playback..  I just feel like it's been a huge help in getting all of my digital media organized, consolidated and easily accessible.  We also own a Wii (which we haven't used since the PS3 arrived!) and feel that the Move wand is much more responsive and intuitive than the Wii controllers.  Though, as I mentioned, we are not big gamers.
5.0	I had a fatboy years ago and had one of these units before, I used it to transfer all my files to my PS3 to play my ps2 and ps1 games on it, my fatboy died a slow death but i was able to use this to trnsfer the files back onto memory cards to play them on my old ps2 again.
5.0	Probably one of the best games I've ever played. The story actually follows a plot… The graphics are pretty good, and the gameplay is easy to pick up yet challenging. I probably have at least 10 hours into this game so far and I'm not finished yet. Definitely worth the money it is listed for.
5.0	The part is working great, and I am so glad to have my Playstation 3 working again.  Installation is easy.
5.0	I picked up a used playstation system model 9001 with a dualshock controller..The graphics are great for the time  back then.Already 3 hours into Final Fantasy IX and it rules! .I have had no problems with the system running 3 hours straight  of gaming time!!If you missed out on this 5th gen system and  games pick up  one for sure to have fun!!
5.0	Very impressed used but great quality be5tter than expected
1.0	The thing is carp and they owe me money! The case melted and warped! DANGEROUS! It is noisy and will probably catch fire.
5.0	These component cables were the best deal and an excellent value for my Wii. Easy hook-up and produced a perfect 480p picture. Awesome!!!
5.0	The most in-depth and arguably the best star wars game to date! This game packs soo much detail, it's phenomenal! I am soo far about 19 hours into the game, currently on Manaan (a water world) trying to find a star map for the republic. Well anyways the game is very expansive, you can travel between many planets and do a ton of quests and you can choose to lean towards dark side or light side, or a lil of both. It's super fun! The game is very long though, I heard it could take 40 hours or more to beat!!! And some of the fights in the game can be frustrating to loose over and over, soo make sure you save frequently!! It's worth it!!
5.0	The small problem I had was NOT sellers fault. Item came as advertised. Happy customer
5.0	I've owned early 2K versions of HBG and loved them.<br />This edition is the best yet.<br />Graphics, interface and games are right there with the best of the PC based board & card games.<br />Try it, buy it and have fun!!!
5.0	Works very well, comfortable in the hands and well-priced. It doesn't look like it in the pictures but the Note 3 fits into the claw just fine and never felt like it was going to fall out. There are rubber grips on either side to keep the phone in place without scuffing/scratching your expensive tech. (Also, SuperGNES + Moga controller = nostalgia-on-the-go. Now leave me alone I'm playing Chrono Trigger.)
5.0	Loved it!! It's a great buy money well spent. If you do decide to purchase this item you will not regret it.
5.0	Doom 3 is the best shooter I've played since call of duty first came out.  The fact doom 1 and 2 are now more easily controlled with analog sticks even makes the Retro classic a must keep. Thanks amazon.  Love it
5.0	My son loves this. He says the sound is awesome!
5.0	Works, great, crystal clear sound!  You can't lose witht his product:)  We have been Living Room Rock Stars every since it came out of the package and you don't have to belt out to get great sound from your voice!
5.0	My 12 year old son got this for his birthday.  He loves it.  It is fun while being challenging for him, but no so hard that he gets frustrated.
5.0	"Just as the title suggests, this game has come a long way and keeps getting better. The Cryptic Team has been working overtime addressing the needs of it's player base and they have not disappointed. They have added new content, expanded the level cap, introduced weekly Featured Episodes, reworked some of the original episodes, added new ship designs and uniforms and now they are poised to release Season 4, complete with a revamp of Ground Combat. This release has too many new features to list. I recommend browsing the forums at [...]. With the addition of \\""The Foundry\\"", players can now write and publish their own missions. This User Generated Content tool is still in it's infancy, but the results are stunning. As a lifetime subscriber, I am ever impressed by the creativity and talent of the players themselves, not to mention the vigilant hard work of the developers. If you're a Star Trek fan, play this game. If you have played it already at launch, come back and play it again. It's twice the game it was at launch and gets better everyday. Awesome."
1.0	This sucks it's just a sticker that messes up your controller.  Do not ever ever buy this. It is a rip off. I wasted my money.!!!!
5.0	Son was thrilled to have replacement game.
5.0	Crazy great game! Others give a more comprehensive review - I'm going back to playing this amazing game. Depth, twists, a gaggle of bad guys working against each other, Batman cutting deals with some bad guys for his own survival. This game has it all. Woot! Viva Rocksteady and Batman!!!!!
5.0	Bought this for my 14 year old daughter for Christmas, she already has the 1st Epic Mickey.  She loves it and has spent hours playing it.  Not sure if that is a good thing :-) but the game is good.
5.0	I like sonic boom he's a great character. he didn't came with the box or the online code. I just got the card and the character. I love his wing ability.
5.0	There was a lot of trepidation when 343 Industries took on the Halo series, but they've done a fantastic job shepherding the Halo canon and game. I'm impressed with what they've done, and still haven't found another co-operative shooter that I've enjoyed nearly as much. No one seems to make games with co-operative multiplayer experiences anymore!
5.0	I am loving this game and the cost was reasonable.  Try it and you will have so much fun.  If you love puzzles you will love Peggle.
5.0	The quality was everything I expected and works great. Everything was in tack and  even got a 48 hour xbox live pass which I wasn't expecting.
1.0	Do not pay this, this is not going to be the experience you will want to get from Xbox Live.
5.0	There is a lot of stuff to do. Never played any other PC game other than this. So far, I love it.
1.0	These batteries are not worth the money. They do not hold a charge. Spend the extra and get the name brand ones.
5.0	Hori usually does an awesome job with their accessories. This is one of my favs. There are a lot of cases out there but this one is the best one. It's not some cheap slick slippery piece of plastic. The material has a slight rubbery grip to it which makes it special. I was stuck w/ a red 3DS XL which I didn't like. This blue cover fixes it. It still made it blue instead of purple. Another benefit is that it's slightly clear. You can put a sticker, printed art, or a photocopied art in between the 3DS XL and protector. It still shows it faintly in which I'm fine with. Great price too.
5.0	I bought these because I work 3rd shift, so on my weekends I game during the night time and my wife hated hearing the games all night. The sound in them is very nice and the headset fits my big head quite well. Only after about 4+ hours do my ears hurt a little, but taking a 30 min break makes it ok to get back to gaming. Very good for a budget set! Only con I have is that if my cell phone is in my pcket and the volume box is on top of it I get a kind of static in the headphones. Easy to fix though, so still 5 stars!
5.0	Bought these for my son and he loves them and I have pre ordered some of the others he cant wait to get them
5.0	I'm serious. If you don't have this game yet, get it. It is the best game in the world by far, and you won't be disappointed if you're into soccer in the slightest. If you think soccer players are foot fairies or something, well nobody really cares about your opinion, but for those of you who like soccer even a little bit this game is the greatest thing in the world. Also, your friends probably play it, so there's just some added value.
5.0	Good game, very processor heavy. I'm glad they continued to add content but it's sad to see Microsoft scrap their gaming studio.
5.0	Such a fun time with the family!  Great gaming system...only downside is the limited number of games available for Kinect, but I'm sure that will change soon.
5.0	If you are a soloist, a Rambo, a loner, this is probably not the game for you. The majority of people playing video games now days, are multiplayers. They play online for that extra challenge. This game involves not only multiplayer but teamwork on a high level. That high level is set by the players. Once you immerse into the land of Arma II, you will find yourself talking as if you have been in the military for years. This is a military simulation, not the average arcade game. You will not hear people talking about face rolling, and total pwnage and all that crap. You will only hear the calls for close air support, transport and long ranged artillery. If you are that role playing, military game guru, you will love the multiplayer associated with this game. However if you are into points and worrying about your kill to death ratio, find a server with Player Vs. Player. Some snipers pride themselves on taking out those loners. The Delta Force will work together on special operations missions, the pilots will be in their own group, and don't be surprised to see a Shooter and a Spotter acting as one Sniper. This is an incredible game, if you play it the way it was intended to be played.     If you are considering picking up the game. Check out the guys at 7th Cav, they always keep a populated server, and they really use that teamwork you are looking for.
5.0	No game has made me laugh as hard and as often as this one did.  Gameplay is on par with most normal action games, nothing spectacular, but it's about the experience, and that experience is just a riot.
5.0	I liked the stock silver molding but it showed scratches easily, and I love the look of carbon fiber. This looks great and perfectly compliments the shield. It does have a subtle textured finish and doesn't show scratches easily.
5.0	I have used this for several months now. Arma 3, BF3, Bioshock and many others!<br /><br />You simply cannot find another gaming mouse out there with this level of customization or quality.
1.0	You can't plug a headset in
5.0	Bought it to disguise the controllers in the house so everyone knows at first glance which one belongs to them. Great option if you have multiple gamers with hot tempers in one place. &#34;Use your own controller!&#34;
5.0	When I got my Ps2 system I wanted to play this game so bad its awesome. Meet sexy women, do drug deals, shoot those cockroaches, battle Sosa, Gaspar, and all of Tony's enemies. My first time playing it from another used disc it stopped playing after North Beach missions, not a problem when I bought it new! Buy this new if you want a great game!
5.0	black is a awesome game a classic the best of the best buy this game you wont be sorry
1.0	"You are better off buying a game like WoW of Guild Wars where you don't get bonked so much by the \\""nerf\\"" bat.  I urge you to look elsewhere for an online game."
5.0	I played the game on Normal the first time, Survivor the second time, and am now working through my third run on Survivor+.  I normally play a game while I watch a movie on another TV, but this game has required me to focus all my attention on the battle at hand and keep the other TV off.  Plus, the graphics and story really bring you into the game, enough that I am still happily watching the cut scenes on my 3rd play through.  On normal it is not too difficult once you get the hang of the game, but the complete lack of supplies in Survivor ensure that every encounter needs to be handled with great care to make best use of whatever you have available.  I appreciate that not every encounter can be navigated simply by shooting your way through a room and some encounters are better handled through a combination of stealth, making your precious shots count, and running away as fast as humanly possible.  Even better, despite this being my 3rd play through, I can still feel myself getting nervous when stalking an enemy in a dangerous location or preparing to engage some infected in a dark-enclosed space.  Very well done!  Several people have complained that the game is too linear and short, which also happens to be a big part of the reason I love it.  There is no part of the game that feels like &#34;filler&#34; to me.  It is a story that takes you on an incredible journey from A to B, gives you an ending that makes you think long after the console has been switched off, and doesn't throw in a bunch of levels just to kill extra time.  Definitely recommending this one to my other gamer friends.
5.0	awesome game, also the set of things that bring the colector's edition its so cool, most of if you have a issue of have and like the final fantasy serie music, its short the issue of buy the music collection box, the concept art is good, but i think is to little amount of concept art o call it a book like the box description but i can complain a lot.<br />it value each cent spend in it.<br />in game issues, the game is well balanced, its strange to play a the first because the gameplay its totaly diferent from the previous XIII serie, also the rol of players are reali unique, if you have played FF in the old school(that mean from FFI to FFVII) you can se the character real class in the game, also the unespected for the game, Omega Wearpon its like i remember it XD. also the 4 players party its back somtimes in game, so thats nostalgic. the onli disapoint its that you dont have a lot of characters to use(i can say more of this, I dont want to spoil the game issues, you must play it :D).<br />the last i can say if you are a true fan of FF series, you must buy this and the cristal edition, well see ya!!
5.0	thank you very much!!!!!!
5.0	I ordered the MTV Music Generator-Music Creation for the Playstation for a Christmas present.  The one who received the gift was very pleased with this game.
5.0	Assassin's creed 2 is one of those games you cant stop playing. It has long lasting gameplay, good graphics, good controls, and a excellent storyline. I give this *****.
5.0	This game is really something else, it almost makes me feel like I'm playing a really good Predator video game, but this better, you get to customise your weapons on the go, and you basically get super strength, super speed, very powerful armor, and Predator like cloaking ability, and the single player lasts for over 10 hours, thats right not your standard five hour FPS campaign, but a fullflidged single-player experience. The story for the most part is good, those of you who have never heard of the first Crysis, might want to brush up on the story on wikipedia. The multiplayer for this game is pretty kool, and from the Dev's behind TimeSplitters, but they only developed the multiplayer part of this game, the campaign is done by Crytech Germany, Crytech UK does the multiplayer, anyways an overall amazing package, a must buy.
5.0	Product works very well.  We had two guitars and added this mic.  It is good to have the mic for people that aren't skilled enough to use the guitar and to create a band.
5.0	This is easily one of the best GBA games I've ever played.  The gameplay is fun and addictive, the play control is great, and the level design is awesome.  The only complaints I have is that I thought it was a bit short, and a little easy, and that they hid secret stuff TOO GOOD.  The game has a great story, but i'm not giving it away.  Everything was thought out extremly well, and it's never so hard that you want to give up and return it.  The replay value is very high considering I don't think anybody will ever find everything.  Overall I think you should go out and buy this game, I garauntee you won't be disapointed.
1.0	Slightly too small. Ps4 sits crooked on it
1.0	Letter buttons have numbers that are typed unless you hold down FN, even though there is a number only row. Makes typing words laborious and company no longer offers US tech support.
5.0	Let me first state that RE4: Wii Edition is my first introduction to the RE video game series.      I have had a blast playing this game.  The action is intense, the controls are precise, and it's simply addictive.  The $30 price is a bargain, considering the amount of gameplay this game offers (Separate Ways, Assignment Ada, Mercenaries, in addition to replaying normal and pro mode).    Just get it already, you won't be disappointed.
5.0	I don't know why this device has such bad reviews! I have had no issues with it and plug it to my NES and SNES simultaneously. I only have one of the systems on at a time and I have had no issues. Power has been consistent and it clicks in to place to give power to my systems and doesn't slide out. I would recommend this to someone looking for a new power source for their NES, SNES, or both.
5.0	this is a awsome game for those who have not played the two thrones. its fun and a little challaging and for those who compain about the camera view you can change it to the d-pad at the options menu
5.0	Final Fantasy X is a classic.<br /><br />While most of the game is painfully linear it eventually opens up, allowing you to explore the world at your whim.  If you're a completionist you can try to 100% the sphere grid with all characters, defeat the Dark Aeons (new in the International Version), grab the three secret Aeons, head over to the Monster Arena, collect all Jecht Spheres, collect all Al Bhed primers, unlock (and max) everyone's Ultimate Weapon, etc, etc, etc.<br /><br />There's at least 100hrs in here if you want to max everything.<br /><br />FF X-2 is just gravy.<br /><br />If you like RPGs and you've never played FF X, this is an easy buy.  It's a massive masterpiece of a game.  I'd pay the price of admission just for FF X, but when you consider that you're also getting X-2 it's basically a no-brainer.
1.0	I have bought two of these charging stations and both have the same problem. Only one side actually charges it and even that one side is unreliable. The batteries don't last long either.
5.0	Great quality. Looks great
5.0	Works well. Have had it for almost two months. Perfect thanks
1.0	I bought this controller at a Gamecrazy and took it home with me.  Busted it out and couldn't play Guitar Hero 2 with it.  The fret buttons (The buttons on the neck) don't work. Even with the adapter. Oh, and the strap doesn't stay on for me.  Every time I try and use the star power, the strap breaks off.  (I don't thrash it around too like others when they try and use it.)    Tried Guitar Hero 1 with it and it works fine.
1.0	This is the first time I have ever entered a review on this website (or just about any other for that matter), but I wanted to warn people to stay away from this seller as the HDD Transfer Kits they are selling are 100% fake.  The ship you the cable, but then send you a home burned CD with horrible instructions that are only for connecting the hard drive to a computer.  This is not at all for transferring your information from one Xbox360 Hard Drive to another.  This is the second one of these I have purchased (I got the other on eBay) for about the same price and have been burned both times.  Don't try and save a few bucks on this one (as I tried), just go ahead and purchase the official Microsoft version and save your self the headache of dealing with sellers that ship fake software.    <<Signing off and heading to Best Buy to get a REAL transfer kit>>
5.0	"I could not put down this game for the life of me. I told myself to do the Nebulox and Yerek, and then stop...but I'm all the way to Igliak.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I realized that that is the last level. And with that, I'm listing my pros and \\""wishes\\"".<br /><br />The \\""wishes\\"" (with perks mixed in): stand back viewers, cuz there's quite a few.<br /><br />I wish this game was longer. If you had 24 hours, you can complete it in 6. It was advertized as \\""longer than q4b but shorter than acit.\\"" But I didn't think it was that short! More planets, make things to find elsewhere instead of in the next scene. More zero grav! More Clank puzzles!<br /><br />I wish we had more time, and bolts, to get or upgrade all weapons. The inventory is shrinking! At least all weapons are useful, though. And Destructapalooza gives you hefty cash prizes.<br /><br />I wish we could've gotten more insight of new or old characters by the end. Vendra was a true witch, but she also wanted a friend. Neftin wanted to be heard from his twin. That was good insight, just should've been more. With Ratchet, we hear that he has this inner darkness with how he's wanted to find the Lombaxes no matter what it took, no matter who was left behind or hurt. He more or less just admits it with a \\""yes,\\"" but I would've liked to see him go into detail with why he made certain choices over selfish ones. Tal is in four scenes, provides good help, but I wish she got to fight. And, sorry for spoiling, Cronk and Zeph die. Which almost seemed for no reason. Looks like we got a three-man squad for future games, which seems interesting despite. And egotistic Qwark only gets one scene and flies off.<br /><br />For gameplay, I wish we got grav tethers with multiple streams with a limited time period. It didn't exist. I was waiting!<br /><br />Phew. Sorry people. Pros!<br /><br /> It's fun,fun fun to play, the color palette is beautiful, the voice acting is killer. And the cutscenes are freaking hilarious begining to end! You'll wanna snapshot faces or rewinds certain lines cuz you laughed so hard. Take your time with the map and bask in the beauty of the landscape. Silox was the best planet, nice and long. Get this game ratchet and clank fans, complete your collection. I'm happy I did."
5.0	Amazing, Nintendo is doing a great job!
5.0	(Note: I have this game on N64, and as far as I know it's the same on playstation.) I remember playing Earthworm Jim on Super Nintendo, when I was 9 years old. Now Jim's back and he's better than ever -- in one of my favorite games of all time. <br />This time Jim has been hit by a flying cow, and you're inside his unconcious brain, trying to collect all his marbles. The more marbles you collect, the smarter Jim gets, until finally you find all 1000 of his marbles and he's as smart as a &quot;smart super hero&quot;. There are 4 main levels (4 sections of the brain- memories, happiness, fear and fantasy). In each level you have to obtain a certain amount of marbles &amp; golden udders (kind of like the stars in mario 64) to beat the boss. If you have a sense of humor, I guarantee you'll like this game. <br />Here are the pros and cons. There are a few cons, but not many. <br />PROS: - Engaging storyline, with fun characters, weapons &amp; bosses - Levels are challenging but not impossible - Game has a high replay value<br />CONS: - Sometimes the controls are irritating-- you can get stuck behind a wall or at a strange angle. But this problem isn't that bad, most of the time the controls are fine. <br />I wouldn't recommend this game for little kids because it might be too difficult. If you think that this game won't be interesting because it's about a worm, trust me-- it's great. Thanks, I hope you try it out!
5.0	If you like war FPS type games, then you'll LOVE this game.  The story line and game style make you feel like you're actually fighting.  The graphics and sounds coupled with the type of battles you're engaged in are very intense and exciting.    I beat the game on Veteran, and although sometimes it seems impossible, I was fortunate enough to have the patience to finish.  The enemy kills you SO fast if you stick your head up or if you move too fast in the foliage.  The AI is nuts.  If you sit around they actively coordinate and out flank.  If you're sitting in a room waiting for them to come in, they'll breach and flashbang the room and kill you.  If you have a sniper rifle and trying to pick someone off far away, you'll have to anticipate their movement becuz the kill is Not instant... you have to account for distance and their speed.    The only thing I don't like is that there is No co-op for the campaign.  Other than that, it's amazing.  Graphics, sound, missions, AI, music is too real!
5.0	I ordered this game for my brother he got good grades on his report card.. he was happy and surprised..
5.0	I have been a fan of the RE series since its inception for the original Playstation back in 1996.  Resident Evil 2 (1998) was my favorite game in the series until this one came along.  Although some aspects of the original story, (if not all) have been lost in translation, and the now defunct zombies that have been replaced by psychotic cultists sometimes make you ask, and why is this called Resident Evil 4?  Still, if your not a die hard zombie fan who is easily disappointed, then this is the game for you.  Some older fans such as myself, may miss the old spookiness, and impending doom you always felt from being surrounded by zombies, however this game has its own little perks, the bad guys for instance are far more intelligent NPCs then the original games, they can follow you almost anywhere once they have you in their sights, and they are not afraid to open doors, I had a lot of fun waiting for a bad guy to walk through a door, and blow him away with the shotgun. The bosses are almost all unique and original, except for the first boss, I can't help be reminded of the boss from Resident Evil 2 in the sewer.  The bad guys are plentiful and can at times be a challenge, but never to the point of frustration,  the sequences are strait out of a Hollywood horror, from being surrounded by freaks in a house, to death defying maneuvers that must be preformed almost precisely to win. This is the first mature game for the Wii that I can honestly say is one of my favorite games of all time.  The controls are great, with the ability to switch between classic and Wii makes the game 10 times more playable especially when fighting certain bosses.  If you only buy one mature game for Wii, let it be this.  Quite possibly the greatest RE game of all time.
5.0	If your child love to draw and color this is a great game. Directions are easy to follow by the kids themselves. The Mini Games last long enough to keep them interesting.<br />Age range varies depending on the child but i will say 5-6 y/o.
5.0	This item met all my expectations, I have no problem working around me very well satisfied with this purchase I recommend
5.0	Myself..my grandson and my friends absolutley love this game..it has brought a ton of fun to us here in Alaska during the cold dark snowy months! I am gonna buy 2-3 more
5.0	this is a great buy for the price it has a huge range of customization with =out being too complex and it is sleek and comfortable at the same time
5.0	This little adapter brought my Black Ops and overall gaming experience to a new level once I was able to again use my headset and an HDMI Cable.  This works perfect, easy to install and much less tangled and messy looking than the standard red white yellow AV cables install. Literally plug and play.
5.0	When Applied Correctly, you don't even notice it's there.<br />I'm completely satisfied with it, far better then those one time use screen protectors.<br />The best part is that it's reusable and washable.
5.0	I love the Sims! I am very pleased with this purchase. The case was in good condition, manual was included, and the CD was in good condition as well. I didn't have any problems installing the game and it runs smoothly. The shipping was quick as well.
5.0	I play this with my 5-year-old and 9-year-old boys. They love it, and I enjoy playing it with them. The levels are challenging, but not too difficult for the boys. The storyline is creative and all the characters are fun to play. This game is everything you would expect from Nintendo.
5.0	A very great game indeed, I am pleased beyond words as the quality of both the product, and the quality of the seller. I will will buy from the seller again in the future, and wish for all to have a pleasant day.
5.0	To be honest this game was better than grand theft auto V. There are tons of side activities, a good story line and just plain fun. I still have not put it down, and I can't comment on the online gameplay I really dont do that too much.
5.0	I absolutely love this game, and sure the main idea is set on a specific principle, regarding that this is a computer game, yet you don't kill anyone here and you don't go to different levels, and I love my crazy games, yet this one gives ms me the satisfaction of making something while I play rather than destroying it. <br /> <br />Right of the bat, I must say I love the music, at times I leave the city running and growing on the slow speed, just so that I can listen to the jazzy cool tunes. I have been a fan of anything that has to do with the Sims since I was in 7th grade when I discovered Sim City 2000 on a computer in my computer class, yes in 7th grade. I'm almost 25 now and I am still crazy about the Maxis ideology behind the city games, as this grew and evolved into a marvelous game. I seriously don't know how they can improve this, because the graphics are phenomenal, you get to sculpt your land, and you can seriously choose from a whole globe of land to play on. You can plant your trees and wild animals, and then the zones, buildings, the natural disasters, the people who need you, your taxes, community programs, ordinances, and really fun decisions on where to plop your park, and this time you can choose from a huge variety of building and entertainment centers for your Sims. <br /> <br />I this game takes a bit to get used to and figure out how to play wile actually making money instead of spending them, and they sure give you enough at the beginning, and while you can Google for cheat codes, it's really fun to roll up my sleeves and really get my brain pumping while I manage my city. I love how many things I can be in charge of, the style of the buildings, where I want a farm with fruitful trees and orchards, what neighborhood I want the bus to stop in, what schools and museums I want resting in the shade provided by so many kinds of tress I can choose from, and so on. <br />I love this as it's a game you can play forever, I wonder how old I can grow mycity to be and how I can sculpt it to perfection. Really fun game with gorgeous graphics, and the zoom button is amazing, you can get down to the street levels you build yourself and observe, just like watching ants on the ant hill, but 10000 times more fun!
5.0	This game is terrific. There are lots of Challenges and Side Challenges to unlock. You can go back and repeat challenges over and over. Its fun and you can play with one or two people. If you play alone, you can switch between Tak and Lok. We've had it for 2 months so far and we STILL haven't finished all the challenges. It never gets boring.
5.0	Got this as a gift for my husband, he loves it and has been glued since Christmas. Not suitable for kids, lots of mature content hence the mature rating.
5.0	Thanks so much on the dsi it was an awesome deal and is in great shape! I'm very pleased. Have a wonderful christmas and a happy new year :)
1.0	R.Kyser, Same thing happened to me, I took it apart and the connector that mounts into the wiimote is held in by thin plastic within the guns housing, it will break if you mis-align the wiimote.  I glued and duct taped it back into place, but now broke the orange plastic thingy which holds the wiimote in place. This thing is not designed to last, it looks chunky on the outside but the internal supports are week, and the orange thing has just ridiculously thin pivot posts. My advise is duct tape and gorilla glue until it falls apart !
5.0	I haven't finished yet, but Apollo Justice stands up to everything that Phoenix Wright was before him. Quirk characters as well as surprising turns in the trials is just as prevelant as it was in the original three. Although the characters from the originals aren't in there (or most of them anyway), Apollo has a lot of new characters to offer that are just as entertaining. Don't be fooled though, Phoenix is still in the game, but in a decidedly different role. The gameplay is very similiar to Phoenix's games while also introducing some features that only a DS could bring to life, such as examining the evidence from all sides, as was introduced in the fifth case of Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney (Rise from the Ashes. The features didn't follow through to any other game until now).<br /><br />Although my favorite characters from the original three aren't involved, Apollo Justice is a lot better than I thought it would be, and I would be extrememly happy to see another come out as a sequel to this game.
5.0	I couldn't believe this product was so cheap.  I figured something was up.  Well, turns out it does exactly what it says it does.  Comes with a charging station and rechargeable battery packs that fit in the back of the WII controller.  Never change batteries again--just put on the charging station when done and batteries are fresh for next time.  Charge indicator lets you know when full charge has been reached.  Plugs into any device via USB.
5.0	My son says the graphics on this game are terrific and he has even encouraged some of his friends to download the game so that they can play together.  When you purchase this game new, it comes with a code so that you can play using more levels and have more weapons.  That is why my son purchased this game.  Otherwise, you can play the basic game online without the additional levels and weapons.  My son felt that the additional cost was definitely worth it and is very happy with this purchase.  Beware of purchasing this game used anywhere because if the code has already been used then you cannot use the code again.  Be sure if you are buying a used copy to ask if the online code has been previously used.
5.0	I was skeptical of one of my favorite series taking a new turn, it all felt like they are giving into the new franchises but i love croft so here we go<br />I was wrong to be critical<br />Game play<br />The game play isn't like older ones one bit but that doesn't mean its bad in fact its truthfully down right amazing its fast paced and requires you to be on edge I swear you almost feel your own adrenaline go up during some scenes and replay value is good since the game play is on edge game play so you may get use to it but you cant drop guard or anything<br />Graphics<br />Eye candy gets new meaning everything is well detailed and well thought out when you shoot a deer if it doesn't die right away it will limp away if things are on fire the fire spreads realistically and leaves behind real ashes and chard items and things croft can get dirty and bloody but will wash off in water and even torch's go out from to much water its the little things that get those first couple of wows in this game<br />Plot and characters<br />The plot is the thickest I have seen from tomb raider and great characters I would go in depth but I don't wanna ruin it all for ya ;) and with all she goes through Mr. Indie and Mr. Drake will feel like lessor's forever more by comparison<br />Conclusion<br />Get it worth every penny and a heck yea deserving game this game I'm sure will revive the franchise and put tomb raider back on top in its genre of games where it belongs so yea I highly recommend it to everyone
5.0	I was using my PS3 game controller for everything which caused me to run the battery down all the time. That can be a pain in the rear if you want to play a game and have a dead controller. So, I bought this remote, and programmed it to my TV and PS3. Pretty slick.
5.0	Excellent product, recommended 100%.. Great graphics and games.  I like the wireless control, ability to download games and lots of  500gb memory no end. :D
5.0	Wasn't expecting too much in terms of quality with the game-play, but I wanted to give this purchase a shot because this was my favorite game system ever. THIS IS A MUST PURCHASE FOR INTELLEVISION FANS!!!! I don't know any other way to say it but set-up out of the box was easy, and being able to play this on my 55 inch flat screen was incredible!!!! First game I put on was my all time favorite, &#34;Horse Racing&#34;! Yes, not much strategy or thinking involved, just fun and it played and raced the same as the original system! Then I played &#34;Football&#34;, and it's hard to believe that it took just a few minutes to remember how to set the offense and defense and run a play, came back like riding a bike 30 years later!<br />I am saving another favlorite, &#34;Baseball&#34; for another day and will enjoy same of these a little at a time! I was lucky enough to purchase the Dollar Value store edition with two player baseball, so I can play with my family. These games were not only less complicated to play, but just plain more FUN. Today you need to be part rocket scientist to play these video games and you must constantly be playing if you want to keep your level up.<br />This systems has games that are fun and easy to play and will give hours of enjoyment, so do not hesitate to buy one!
5.0	The game plays nearly flawlessly. The code worked perfectly and since it was a code to install it the load times are shorter than with a disc.
5.0	- so immersive... i found myself holding my breath whenever the hordes were alerted. this happens alot. they just pour out like water!    - who knew zombies could be so fun to kill. they crawl out of your surroundings like cockroaches and are found in every nook n cranny. they can climb in places you cannot (for a change). when they flood you'll yell out four letter words. its that overwhelming at times. by the end of the game you'll have killed between 1,200-2000 zombies among four players within 30-45 min.    - best co-op by far... that's just what it was made for. it's fun to play single player, but better than that is playing with others online, but better than that is finding people you like to kill zombies with. you'll find yourself talking, planning, help each other at the edge of death.    - this is the steam engine at it's best! visually this game has nothing to complain about(except on xbox). in combination with a dark room, your flashlight, and a splattered zombie via shotgun, this is a perfect screenshot. when you finish off a whole horde indoors, it's really a satisfying site in a creepy demented way.    - my girlfriend likes gaming, but she's addicted to this game. she says she hates zombie games cause they scare her. after 10 minutes she was hooked. i hear her screaming and laughing throughout the house, and making L4D friends when she plays. me and her raked up a total of 39.3 hours  in the last 2 weeks. yeah, we like this game!!!    - i'd pay 150 bucks to have this much fun, man this is great! can't wait for future installments via download-able content :)
5.0	A great fighting game to kick off 2015. Coming from P4AU im really enjoying the game.
5.0	Love it! Great price as well!
5.0	I played ME 1 and ME 2 back to back, and if nothing else it showcased how much better ME 2 is.<br />Everything about the game is more polished; from combat mechanics, graphical rendering, level design and dialogue. And thank whoever they got rid of the Mako tank (ME1 players will know what I mean)<br />Judging it by its own right, it has an interesting story, well rounded characters, and a universe that is truly immersive.<br />Playing Mass Effect 1 will really help you appreciate the scale of the narrative, and it will give you a greater appreciation of how good this game really is.<br />A full 5 stars!
1.0	So I have owned 4 xbox one consoles. I bought every single one of them with the intention of loving and playing the crap out of them. Unfortunately all 4 xbox one consoles I have bought have had issues and defects. I am going to list in order the defects that I have experienced. 1) The first xbox one I bought was the month after they came out. I put in my first disc and as it read the disc it made a terrible grinding noise. Many people have had this issue. I returned it. 2) The second xbox one I bought was about 5 months ago. Unfortunately that console would not even read discs. I put multiple discs in and it did not recognize any of them. I exchanged it for another xbox one the next day. 3) After I exchanged the xbox one, I set up the new one and it would not read discs either! I returned that one as well. 4) I bought the advanced warfare bundle on monday. During the initial setup it starts making this very loud grinding noise like it was going to explode and then it stopped. After that,  the fan was making this loud whining noise that is not normal. I look this issue up and apparently it happens to a lot of people when they buy the xbox bundle without kinect. Microsoft has to be downplaying some of these issues. If there weren't major issues with the xbox one hardware how could somebody end up with 4 defective consoles. Honestly I want to play some Microsoft exclusive games but I cant get over the fact that the console is so terrible. I want to play sunset overdrive, and halo Mcc but the system they are on is not worth buying. Save yourself some money and dont buy an xbox one. I want to love the xbox one but I just cant.
5.0	Seriously one of the most rewarding games I have played. Difficult but completely worth it. Smooth game play and unique plot-line.
5.0	First of all, I'd like to say that I grew up with the SNES. I was a 90s kid and I played the heck out of the console with games like Super Mario World, ClayFighter, Donkey Kong Country and Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers. However, it was my brother's system and now that he has a kid of his own he's taken the system along with some of the games. While looking for a used to system to buy online I came upon this. I was instantly attracted to this because it's not only portable but it looks just like the SNES console I had.<br /><br />Anyway, on to my review.<br /><br />The sound - Good. But not great. And the little sound everyone is talking about is there. It's this annoying little buzzing sound. But you don't even notice it once you start playing.<br /><br />Visuals - Great. It's like having a huge Gameboy Advance SP but having it be compatible with SNES games. And it's not region locked, so you can play PAL and Super Famicom games. It works with the Super Gameboy, too. It has an AV port so you can connect this bad boy to your TV and play it just like the original console.<br /><br />If you have an emulator and play your SNES games on there and love it, I really wouldn't bother with this. This is more for people who like the authenticity of being able to play their games on an actual console. It's for people who feel nostalgic for a decade long gone. But the best decade nonetheless.<br /><br />Hyperkin also makes a portable console for the NES.
5.0	Perfect for me and my wife to play together.
5.0	"(...) <br />I have seen all of the trailers, and it looks like a great addition to the series.  The game is set in the jungle somewhere in Russia in 1964.  A Russian scientist working on a Metal Gear wants safety in the US, because he has become, \\""afraid of his own creations\\"".  Snake's job is to infiltrate the jungle and get the scientist out.<br />We can expect some twists in the story, because its a Metal Gear game.  The trailer hints that snake will defect, but the trailer is extremely random and confusing, so I could be wrong.  Anyways, the game will be based on stealth, like other Metal Gear games.  This means that if you run into a room with your guns blazing, you won't do too well.<br />There will be a great camoflage scheme, which shows how well you are camoflaged from 0-100%.  0% means that you will be seen from a mile away, 100% means you will remain hidden unless you move or someone bumps into you.  There will be many different costumes you can switch into to better blend with your surroundings.  You can also use face paint.  For example, if you are against a tree, you will have 100% on your camoflage meter if you use tree bark pattern and black face paint.<br />Anyways, I think this game will be great, and I can't wait to buy it.  I hope I helped you make your decision to buy this game, and thanks for reading my review."
5.0	I just bought the actually game for the founder status that is similar to the 14.00$ per month membership, this is a really good game their is not as much scripting as others but its a fast growing game that is slowly improving.
5.0	Cute game for kids. It's fun and brings a lot of movement.
5.0	if you want to play a powerfull 3D game, this the right choice, BUY IT!<br />graphics are amazing!<br />3D is soo strong
5.0	That was the main thing my grandson wanted  me to get him for Christmas
5.0	This is the only game I've played on the 3DS that made me want to use the 3D and actually impressed me.  Usually it gives me a headache and makes me queasy after five minutes.<br /><br />I've loved this game since I was 8 and it's still one of the greatest
5.0	great for 6 and under
5.0	"This is a good \\""chat\\"" headset that lets you hear and talk using the chat feature of many PS3 games.  Like an earlier reviewer indicated . . . this headset only allows you to hear the \\""chat\\"" part.  If that's all you want or are interested in then this is a good headset.<br /><br />If you also want to hear the game through the headset you will need a different headset.  My recommendation is the \\""PS3 Ear Force P11 Amplified Stereo Gaming Headset.\\"" I purchased one of those about six months ago and my son loves it. It is more expensive--but this way he can put on one headset and hear everything he needs to--the chat part and the game sound.  This comes in handy when he wants to play, but others in the room don't want to listen to the sound of his game.  One headset and he hears everything he wants to . . . and we don't have to!"
5.0	I got this edition for my boyfriend for Christmas, I gave it to him early and he loves it so much he will be done with it BY Christmas!
5.0	A great game of stealth and tactic. Actually, 3 games, not one, since it's a trilogy. This game will satisfy the average player shooting everything that moves but it's a real delight if you like action games, but you'll have to find the best tactic to terminate your targets without blowing your cover.    Kill silently, change cloths at the right time, have a disguise, plan your escape accordingly... Awesome!    S.
5.0	I've played this multiplayer than any other game in a long time. Definitely recommended. I can't speak for the single player as I haven't gotten into that very much, but it's hard to beat the FFAs in this game.
5.0	Much Better than I thought it would be. 5 Smiles. Plays well the items in it were worth it to me.
5.0	This has to be the best game that is going to come out for playstation!!!! The creaters are very smart!!!! Sweet graphics!!!! The best I have ever seen!!!!
5.0	Chanukah gift for my granddaughter and she loves it.
5.0	My husband is the ultimate God of War fan, so when I saw this had been released I ordered it for our anniversary to replace the older ps2 versions of the game. My husband was thrilled with the enhanced HD graphics and how the collection was all in one case. I don't notice any other difference between the ps2 versions and the HD versions other than the graphics.
5.0	So far, I'm very pleased and excited about the possibilities this device promises.  I just got mine yesterday and have only tried a few things so far, but it can do so much more.  My only worry is that they won't continue supporting it with updates, but barring that happening, the future looks great!  The first task I wanted to use this for, was to accomplish something in a game that otherwise would have required me to sit and press a single button over and over again for about 3 hours.  With this, I was easily able to program this to be done automatically.  It still took 3 hours, but I was able to walk away from the game and come back with it finished, instead of wearing a hole in my finger, or giving myself a repetitive motion injury!  Yay for my saved fingers!  I would warn you though, if you are anything remotely resembling a &#34;technophobe&#34; or in any way &#34;computer illiterate&#34; or lack patience at all, this is not for you.  It does require some knowledge (even if it says it doesn't) and a lot of patience to read, and read, and study, to figure out how to use it.  But the more tech-saavy you are, the less time it will take.  Fortunately there is a lot written about it online .. lots of stuff to read.
5.0	Excellent purchase from a great seller! Came early, no complaints here.
5.0	I'm not sure what it is about a teenage boy's video games, but they seem to hate shelves. Little shelves, big shelves, book shelves, all of them. It's like the moment the games get put on shelves, the earth's magnetic pull shifts and they fly off and land everywhere else. This makes walking through the room like navigating a land mine field filled with explosives costing $60 each, just waiting to break and go off with one wrong step. They hide mostly under dirty laundry and missing permission slips.<br /><br />This storage ottoman turns out to have been so much more than a place for xBox and PS3 controllers to get placed. As it happens, the material this box is made of appears to be resistant to the random polar shifts of the earth's magnetic field. Video games go in and stay in. They don't fly about and land under last weeks homework or on tables waiting to be use as coasters.<br /><br />For months now they go in and out only as intended. My suspicion is that there is something xBox discs are made from that pulls them down from of high elevations such as book cases, and they find their natural level nearer to the earth's surface. Either that or teenage boys don't know how to take care of things. But I can't imagine THAT would be the case. Polar shifts must be the cause, and this storage ottoman...the solution.
5.0	It was an easy swap, took about 40 minutes total, and maybe it's just my imagination but IMO my PS3 now works better than new.
5.0	"I recently bought a PalmOne PDA solely for the purpose of entertainment when travelling.  Since I love Scrabble, I was ecstatic to see that it was available for the PDA.  I bought this four game combination in case I ever get bored with Scrabble.  I have read other reviews that voiced various complaints about Scrabble for PDA.  They may have been based on earlier versions.  This version is the full 15 x 15 board.  I have only played one game (I beat the computer) but I did not run into any incidents of the computer \\""cheating.\\""  The graphics are incredibly sharp and legible - this was my biggest concern. <br /> <br />All four games appear to be true to the originals and wonderfully legible. <br /> <br />All in all, a great purchase for anyone on the go!"
5.0	Absolutely blown away by the xbox one.  Got mine from Best Buy, it worked perfectly fine out the box.  Have installed 3 games from disc and a couple downloaded titles.  Enjoying the integrated cable television more than I thought.  Smartglass is a must get app for your smartphone or tablet.  I also own the playstation 4 and while the graphics card may be slightly better on Sony's console, Microsoft takes the cake when it comes to online services and features.
5.0	"We purchased Epic Mickey for our 10 year old son for Christmas. He's an avid gamer and has played through almost all of the Mario games, as well as a few Link games, so we were very surprised to see our son have such a difficult time with the game. The reason why he's having a hard time with it isn't because it's difficult to control - on the contrary, it's very easy. It's because it's the type of game where you really need to take your time.<br /><br />Epic Mickey isn't a \\""rush through and finish it out to win it\\"" game, but is, rather, truly an epic adventure. You get to be Mickey in an entirely new (or old, depending on how you look at it) world, where he needs not only to save himself, but to help many others. The game changes depending on how you play it. If you help out a lot of people, for instance, they'll be there to lend you a hand when you may need it. Or you can skip helping others and can just rush through the game yourself, but if you do this the game is a bit more difficult.<br /><br />PROS<br /><br />- The controls. You get to run around and paint and thin things. How much fun is that? Granted you can't paint or thin everything, but there are a large number of things that you can paint and thin, and what you choose to do changes the way the land around you looks, truly personalizing the game.<br /><br />- The sheer size of it. It's huge. It's a game where you can run all over the place and still not see everything, much like Disney World itself.<br /><br />- The sentiment. We just got back from Disney and seeing some of the same things, like \\""Mean\\"" street and the Disney statue, are so sentimental for me. And watching Mickey's animated face when he sees Walt's statue - priceless!<br /><br />CONS<br /><br />- The camera control - you don't have full, complete camera control like you do in some games, and I can see where that would be frustrating to some people. To me, however, it's just another challenge to the game, and it doesn't bother me too badly.<br /><br />Epic Mickey is a great game - not the easiest game, but definitely great. It actually got emotion out of me whenever one of the characters were unremembered by Mickey, and when they talked about being forgotten about by the world. Any video game that can not only challenge you and intrigue you, but also make you feel emotion, is a good one to me.e, but definitely great. It actually got emotion out of me whenever one of the characters were unremembered by Mickey, and when they talked about being forgotten about by the world.

5.0	I love this game. If you liked Tomb Raider you'll like this game. There is more shooting but over all it's the same idea and graphics. I think the controls are OK. The acting is good and not cornie. I have an old low spec. computer and it loaded and runs fine. Most of the Indiana Jones games will not work on my computer as the requirements are too high. I suggest trying the demo's first, where ever possible, before buying anything. Save often just as with Laura Craft. The game is quite long and has lots of places to visit and do things in. I wish they had more games like this. If anyone knows of any please include them in your reviews. I like reading reviews that include peoples likes and dislikes about other games so that I may have an idea what game I might want next.<br />(This part I added after the above review.)<br />I got about half way through the game when I got to a part I was not able to get beyond. I most admit I'm 70 years old, retired and handycaped and I play games for the therapy. My eye/hand skills are not as good as a younger preson. I wish they would make some of these games that you have the option to get passed the harder objectives for those of us that really need to do that. It's not the first time this has happended to me and I hate it when I fine a really good game but cann't play more then half of it.
5.0	I love it.  Great present for my sons. Great price too.
1.0	Within an hour from ordering this on the amazon website it locked me out from canceling it after I determined the item is not needed. More money down the drain to return it...
5.0	bang boom bam wack slash kick jump run and repeat LOL wonderfull!!! no let downs just plain fun nuff said
5.0	WHY THEY TAKE THE ONLINE COMPATIBILY OFF? I WAS LOOKING  FORWARD TO SMOKIN DUDES IN THIS GAME!!!!! DOES ANYBODY KNOW?? BESIDES THAT ITS BEEN ALMOST 2 YEARS SINCE IT WAS SUPPOSE TO BE RELEASED I REALLY HOPE THEY DONT DISSAPOINT THE FANS WIT IT, TOO BAD NO ONLINE THO ! OH WELL I CANT COMPLAIN CUZ THE FIRST AND SECOND GT DIDNT EVEN HAVE THAT OPTION SO ITS ALL GOOD BUT IT COULD OF BEEN BETTER *sigh*!.
5.0	This is targeted at guys like me who have never owned a gaming headset or surround sound.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Compared to sub-par tv speakers, these have amazing sound<br />- Great to hear bass in your ears<br />- Can definitely hear direction, from left to right, front to back. In Dead Space 2 I spun around slowly while listening to steam spewing out of a pipe and definitely heard the transition as the steam changed direction.<br />- Way more immersive than tv speakers. Sounds similar to a movie theater.<br />- Also works on my 5.5 year old laptop that is ready to kick the bucket. Can't wait to Skype with it all over my house!<br />- I went 2 rooms away in my house,over 20 feet away from my PS3 and laptop and only had slight disruption when using it on my old laptop. Worked like a charm with PS3 from far away.<br />- One person can be using the PS3 in the same room as someone on the computer and they don't have to disturb each other.<br />- Watch a movie, play a game, listen to music, do it all late at night without disturbing anyone trying to sleep<br />- Set up is impossible to not understand. Just plug in the USB and turn it on.<br />- These turn off and on quickly without a delay, unlike the headset I got with Warhawk.<br />- Volume controls are easy to adjust without looking. Not so loose you accidentally turn up too high by accident.<br />- On-screen alerts are helpful and not very disruptive to gameplay<br />- Microphone is said to be flimsy by some, but I think it being retractable and not obtrusive makes them unlikely to break<br />- Style fits the design of the PS3 if aesthetics is your thing<br />- Retains charge very well. Doesn't have to be plugged into the wall like more expensive, wired headsets.<br />- Very comfortable for long periods of time<br />- Can change the ratio of volume you hear between chat and the game's sound<br />- Easy to mute and un-mute the mic quickly<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Takes up a USB spot for the dongle<br />- A little bit bulky, but the lack of wires more than makes up for that<br />- Limited ability to adjust audio<br />- You don't get the same quality sound on netflix or Blu-rays as you do on games, but still good.<br />- Doesn't come with a USB charging cable, but wires that work with the Dual Shock 3's will also work with the headset<br />- Probably not as high-quality as more expensive headsets but likely a much better value<br /><br />I'm obviously happy with my purchase. I don't think I'll want to play without these very often unless I want to talk to someone in the room at the same time. They are even very useful for the computer. For the record, I bought this for $65, but feel that it's worth much more than that. Amazon hooked it up with this deal. Thanks, Amazon!dio  - You don't get the same quality sound on netflix or Blu-rays as you do on games, but still good.  - Doesn't come with a USB charging cable, but wires that work with the Dual Shock 3's will also work with the headset  - Probably not as high-quality as more expensive headsets but likely a much better value    I'm obviously happy with my purchase.

5.0	Incredibly fun trivia party game. Up to 4 players.
5.0	As ordered is a perfect review. Why? Because the picture shows exactly what I get and because of that I recomend this product and this saler for everyone.
5.0	This is a great game. My son loves it and he is only 3.5yr old.  The buzz controls are great for little ones and also fun for adults. We have had many party nights with this game.
5.0	Great single and multi-player game. I never tire of it and always good to get online and skirmish with friends!
1.0	This was a fraud!  I received mine scratched entered the code and it wouldn't work.  I called xbox customer service and was told the card expired and the code had already been used!
5.0	Works and was what I need. Was shipped in a timely manner.
5.0	Gotta Love Playstation
5.0	First Final Fantasy game that I have played and this was pretty good! Storyline was very different than expected because it was better! :D So much fun! ^_^ A little difficult on certain parts of the game, but not a big deal.
5.0	I've played the Japanese version of Gran Turismo 3, and I've never played a racing game that has ever been this good. GT3 easily raises the bar so high, that there is no way that any other company can produce a better racing game than this. (Aside for Gran Turismo 4, but that's another story)<br />The graphics really show off what the PlayStation 2 is capable of. In the Seattle circuit, you can actually see little heat waves coming off of the pavement. The sun looks so real in this game that I automatically started to squint my eyes while looking into it. The brake discs actually heat up when you brake for a long period of time!! Now that is realism people.<br />The gameplay is also really realistic. The handling between a Ford Mustang and a Honda S2000 is very different, just like in real life. If you tailgate a driver ahead of you, you can actually use the suction behind his car to sling shot past him. Just like in real life.<br />Needless to say, if you love cars, then by all means buy this game. Trust me, you won't be disappointed.
5.0	This is a really good game i play it everyday there is so much stuff to do collecting bugs and fish is really fun i love it i have wi fi so i can play with my friends i love this really much i cant wait for the 3ds one i aways desigh my own clorhes me and my friends on it play alot we play hide and seek tag fishing i really like the city i can change my hair and my shoes my house is really fun to decorate i have a mansion as my home which is big the holidays are really fun two
1.0	When I received the cable it was packaged well, but When I tried it on my Tv It didn't work I had to wiggle the Cable just to get a picture on the screen of the Xbox. Its a shame, It might just be a gamble Buy it and see if yours works but thats the risk. I think spending 5 more bucks a gamestop might be more worth it.
5.0	this was a gift for our grandson for Christmas and he has played it and he loves it he is only 4 years old thanks
5.0	The package comes with two microsoft wireless microphones, which is already worth more than the $25 I have paid for the entire package itself.  My son and I love to play SingIt and Singstar on PS3.  The Microsoft wireless microphone takes it up another level.  The colored LEDs at the bottom of the microphone that changes colors to the beat of the music is a really nice touch, and makes my son gets the concept of beats even more.  The song choices are excellent.    The only complaint I have is that the visualization of the pitches is not as sensitive as Singstar, so even when you are offbeat and off pitch, you are still scoring well.  It is much harder to get better on Lips than Singstar.
5.0	Really enjoyed this game. If you have a PS3 the download is only $19.99 for the 5 episodes and theme. The game is brutal, full of difficult choices. Well done, well acted and worth the awards and nominations it's received.
5.0	I am extrememly happy about this product. It came the very next day that i ordered and the minute it landed we started playing it. There are tracks like Pokerface, Souljaboy, Funkytown to get you in the groove. The dancer look so real. Its total fun for the whole family and gets your heart rate pumping fast. LOVE IT!!!!
5.0	Great item.  Perfect for my needs
5.0	The product arrived on time and the game has great graphics aside from having great frame as the saga of Assassins Creed, exceeds my expectations
5.0	excellent product, thanks
5.0	Exceptional effort from Naughty Dog, Uncharted 2 is probably the first game to perfectly blend the gaming and movies media. From the first opening scene and to the ending 15 hours later - this is a game that starts on a very high note and never misses the beat. Uncharted 1 was a very good effort too and it's good that Naughty Dog didn't just create a quick sequel, but actually went back to understand what they did right and what they didn't. Story has been developed more, hand combat is actually useful and - as mentioned earlier - gameplay has been changed to fit a movie script more than a game.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and buy this game! If you ever played Tomb Raider or watched Indiana Jones movies, you will enjoy this game!
5.0	I, as an adult, love playing this.  I'm not good at video games, but enjoy this.  I also play with my 4 yr old who really likes having the characters she knows.  I like that we can play together in the same world without having to 'stay' together on the screen.
5.0	My son enjoys playing this game.  He spends hours playing it with his friends.  The product came in good timing because he bought an Xbox with his own money and then the game to go with it.  He was happy when he got the game so that he could play it.
1.0	was unable to read game.....pissed off
5.0	I'm really glad i went with this kollector's edition, the statue is very detailed and well made and the steel pack is made from a high quality material, and of course the game is super fun, i recommend this edition to all Mortal Kombat fans =)
5.0	"I still use all my old nintendo systems so I always appreciate any hybrid game. I wanted something a little cheesy and fun at my halloween party this was perfect with hits like \\""Sweet Caroline\\"", \\""Play that Funky Music\\"" and the all-time cheese fest of \\""I Will Always Love You\\"", if you don't take yourself too seriously everyone has a great time. I used this on my wii so I already had a memory card, everything came brand new packaged well, the seller note says I need a game cube controller but it Included a Brand New Gamecube Controller! i only wish they said that it's also compatible with a dance pad then I could have bought it all at once, luckily i found one at the game store-not a big DDR fan but had a blast watching people try to sing along and follow the arrows at the same time (there is no 'just dance mode' on the game) So a little more info about the product would've been helpful just to know what I was getting-but I'm super satisfied, everything was great!\\"""
5.0	Worked like a charm on my retro collection of NES, SNES, & N64 games. Its a handy tool if you like to keep your games in good condition. Usually don't even need to use a bit screwdriver the screws twist just out using your hand.
5.0	I have probably seen 100 games in my entire life. My personal top 3 are: Uncharted 2, God of War series and Castlevannia. Now are Uncharted 2, Red dead redemption and Castlevannia. The game is almost perfect, uncharted 2 is still better, but is a amazing game. It should be played by anyone who loves the long, original and funny games.
5.0	"If your one of the few people who never picked up Rockstar's mega-hit Red Dead Redemption last year then there's no excuse now! Red Dead Redemption (inspired by the movie \\""The Wild Bunch\\"") is one of the most immersive, gorgeous and rewarding games out there. The story is intriguing, the main characters are memorable with John Marston being one of Rockstar's greatest protagonists, the action is endless, the controls are fluid and the multiplayer is addictive (breath of fresh air compared with all the fps multiplayers on the market). The gorgeous sandbox is teeming with life and loads of NPCs as well as plenty of side missions such as meeting unique strangers, clearing gang hideouts, completing challenges, all which help you to become the legend of the west. Plenty to pull you of blazing main trail of the story.<br /><br />The GOTY edition is well worth the price if you have never brought or played the game. It is packed with everything that has previously been on the xbox live marketplace while the second disc contains the fantastic Undead Nightmare dlc add-on which the wild west is turned into an apocalyptic fight for survival against zombie hordes, it is well worth your time!<br /><br />Like I said, this game is a must for anyone who is a fan of GTA or sandbox games in general it's a fantastic game... nuff said!"
5.0	If you love to murder things, You must get this game. I still play the first one and second one to the max! If you don't own this you have problems and shouldn't own a game system go back to playing with your wii. lol<br />Edit:<br />Just bought the dlc Ramms showdown and all I can say is wow get this game. It works well with the story and you get to play ramm what else can you ask for. So epic I played this through and have to say money well spent it shouldn't take you more then 5 hours to finish it. I like to look around and find things so if you rush, you can finish it in 2 hours
5.0	Great game! I absolutely love this game if you are a big fan of the first dark souls and want an awesome case to then you will love this game the gameplay is amazing and I love the combat!
5.0	This is the best game ever!!!
5.0	Bought this for my 7 and 5 year old grandsons for Easter.  They are loving it!  The 5 year old is now playing the guitar behind his back.  This is wonderful training on the use of a guitar and lots of enjoyment and entertainment-  Beats just sitting in front of a TV or Video watching- with this program they can be INVOLVED!
5.0	Great game. Only way to buy this is the Ultimate Edition.  Comes with all the DLC wrapped into one game.
5.0	I know. lame title.<BR>BUY!!! BUY!!! BUY!!!<BR>You are sooo lucky to live in America. Once it gets released, dont get anyone get it before you!!! Tekken goes into a new generation of fighting; finally its a complete, fully 3 dimensional game. The side stepping has been tweaked, and new walls have been added... perfect... ;)<BR>BUY!!! BUY!!! BUY!!!
5.0	Ah, it's all coming back to me.<br /><br />A timeless classic made modern - and believe me, it's worth every bit I paid for it, whether it's reliving the best moments or discovering the new additions, I've enjoyed this thoroughly.
1.0	This got extremely hot upon charge and did not work even after charging on my computer for 16 hours! The wii still said &#34;batteries not charged&#34;.<br />So back it went !
5.0	Works great on any race game, its wireless, no lag. you cant beat the price for what you get. I use it for all my race games even my 4 year old son loves it!
5.0	Great game- easy to learn and very robust!  very balanced abilities from each of the kingdoms.. very similar playing style to warcraft II(excellent game).. Age of Kings is worth buying and checking out.. a challenge even for the serious player..
5.0	Perfect! Really good product!
5.0	Arrived on time.  Works well.
1.0	This game for some reason was made completely revolving around the boxer Felix Trinidad (by the way he is a boxer I like the least).  I cannot believe that under CPU vs. CPU Felix Trinidad is going to beat every other boxer in this game including Sugar Ray Robinson, who was the best Middleweight boxer EVER!  Don't get me wrong, I did play this game and it always appears that after knocking down Felix Trinidad once he right away knocks you down twice before you realize the third time you are on the canvas.  By then you have lost the fight.  You just know this game is completely unrealistic when under CPU vs. CPU Felix Trinidad defeats Mohammud Ali, who is a Heavyweight, with a knockout.  Realistically speaking, Trinidad could never defeat Ali even on his worse day.  But I guess this is only a game.  Oh!  And have I forgotten to mention that it is very difficult to throw body punches in this game?  Or that when in the ring there is no particular style to each fighter.  It is nothing but an all out brawl to see who punches the hardest.  Oh! and how easy it is for Felix Trinidad to throw those hard punches to knock you down, but it takes FOREVER to knock him down right!  Let's face it folks!  This game has no satisfaction for the avid game player, but for a first time player it will prove fun for a while then gets boring.  It is too easy for the avid gamer and too hard for a beginner.  Two extreme results does not make a game worth playing.  Nuff said.
5.0	I was a big fan of the Lego star wars games and this seems so far to be different enough from those to be 'new' and still has enough of the old to be just as much fun.  Only complaint is that in the first day I did manage to lock it up when my son tried to drop out at the same time I pushed pause.  Also the puzzles seem to be more involved and harder to solve than in the star wars series.
5.0	I love this game.  It was done very well.  I am so glad that square decided not to change it too much.
5.0	I have 3 collectors edition controllers ( a Halo 4, an blue chrome and a tomb raider) for my xbox 360, and these make them look like showpeices on my wall. it looks really good in my room and it makes a place for my collectors peices to be able to sit proudly on my wall
5.0	my 10 year old son loves this game. It is very entertaining and can handle several cars of the most famous brands that my child likes
1.0	Disappointing. While this offers great sound, bass, BEAUTIFUL design, and surround sound... the &#34;hissing/buzz/static&#34; drove me crazy. I bought this at Best Buy and I returned it the same day. Even when I updated to the latest firmware, the issue still persisted. It gets even worse when you extend the microphone and it detects noise of any kind. I had the A40s back in the day and I would definitely recommend those over this pile of crap if you must choose a &#34;MLG pro 420 blaze it headset&#34;. Would've been a 5/5 if the static/hissing/buzz was fixed. It's a known issue, avoid this like the plague.
5.0	Great price for this game and my son loved it.  This is what he wanted for Christmas.  Very surprised as he thought it was to much money for Christmas.
5.0	Grandsons enjoy it. Play it often.
1.0	WAS NOT EVEN FULL GAME. &#34;SPECIAL EDITION&#34; MEANS HALF THE LEVELS. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT EVER EVER EVER EVER.
1.0	"I popped in the game to play the first mission. My initial impressions were that this was reasonably enjoyable. Then I got to the \\""boss\\"" plane of the level and fired about 100 missiles (not an exaggeration) over the course of 15 minutes. I watched at least a dozen missiles hit it (not get hit by chaff). I went online and realized that you have to be in \\""Dogfighting Mode\\"" to actually trigger some fights, otherwise the enemy is invincible.   During this whole 15 minute charade, the same 45 second riff of music was playing over and over and over and over.  Glad I got this from Amazon for 21 bucks and can trade it back in for 19.50, otherwise I would feel cheated out of more than my 20 or so minutes of time spent with this piece of crap game."
1.0	Total Lack of exclusive games other than couple of last gen titles with a bit more color , hardly any media capability's other than subscription based, to noisy to watch movies, very noisy on the drive when playing games like COD and the system is hardly ever updated it's been one big let-down this year.
5.0	"Having been a long-time computer gamer, my biggest concern has been the graphics.  My son has been an X-box player for years (mostly because of Halo)and I've never been impressed enough with the graphics to make the switch to console.<br /><br />However, with the new generation of graphic-intensive games, it became necessary for me to upgrade my computer system with a new video card.  Unfortunately, the price of the one I wanted was only a little less than the cost of a console!  So, I began to consider moving to a console.<br /><br />I ultimately chose the PS3 because I preferred its game selection over the X-box.  But, let me tell you, the day it arrived and I hooked it up, this little console blew my mind!  The first game I put in was so crystal clear, it looked like I was watching a movie!<br /><br />Of course, I'm used to seeing eye-popping graphics on my computer.  But I'd never been impressed with console graphics.  Until I saw the picture on the PS3.  It is visually stunning, to say the least.  Absolutely beautiful!<br /><br />I'd heard the warnings that the controller is small, and this is true.  I have small hands for a man and the controller is small, even for me.  I find myself fumbling to reach \\""inward\\"" to push a button.  It's a bit awkward, but I know I'll get used to it, because I'm not accustomed to anything else.  I can imagine this controller would be a deal breaker for someone accustomed to the larger X-box controller.<br /><br />Overall, I am thrilled with the PS3.  The games are awesome, the graphics are stunning, and I'm no longer taking up much-needed space on my computer hard-drive.  HAHA!  Life is good."
5.0	The product went on easily and stuck very well. The cut-outs were perfect for the 3DS. My son loved it.
5.0	This is the first time I have ever written a review on here so bear with me. Despite the fact the I love this game I do have one minor gripe but it is not a game killer. The story is phenomenal I love the fact that Naughty Dog grounded their game in some form of scientific proof. This definitely helped set itself apart from other zombie games. The character development was excellent and really felt a connection with Joel and Ellie and the cohorts they met along the way. The biggest thing that I felt really set the game apart from others despite the story was the world that Naughty Dog created for Joel and Ellie I actually enjoyed exploring what I could and scavenging for what I could find in the desolate world. The world was very beautiful in all its decay and very detailed and colors really popped. The combat was excellent I found myself using stealth more than my weapons when I could and the stealth mechanics worked out wonderfully. The gunplay was also awesome but the way they created it to where you could use stealth in most situations was my foremost choice but when I did use a weapon I found myself on the edge of my seat with reloading and aiming it really created even more tension. Creating items in-game also added to the tension the game created. In the end everything about this game was solid my only complaint was that your AI partners while really helping killed the realism and authencity when I was sneaking around and they were running around clickers and all other enemy types without alerting any of them to my presence. Despite that though I would recommend this game for anyone that loves to play games. If you have a PS3 play this game; if you don't have a PS3, buy a PS3 along with this game as well as Naughty Dog's other awesome series the Uncharted Trilogy you will not be disappointed.
5.0	Great game and super fun to play. Feels a lot smoother than Black Ops and much more balanced. Great new game modes(Kill Confirmed and Team Defender)Favorite game so far.
5.0	What can I say it's Donkey Kong. I've always been a fan of Donkey Kong and all the games have had to offer over the years. This one is no different and it's a great addition to the Wii. A must have for any Donkey Kong Fan.
1.0	"To their credit, they didn't price this as a premium game, so you figure it's not really much. . .but this is still pretty terrible.<br /><br />First off, they made no attempt to make Sam the Snowman sound anything like Burl Ives.<br /><br />Then on to the game. . .<br /><br />You play 4 mini games and that's it.  The first one involves an elf tossing something at your character from atop a ladder, and your job is to use your head to volley the object to its rightful place.  Maybe it's a decoration for the tree.  Maybe it's a present for under the tree.  Maybe it's a misfit toy for Santa's bag.  Either way, for some reason, your job is to soccer-ball head it to its spot while the timer runs down. Whee.<br /><br />Next, you're painting toys in the toy shop by flicking your controller as toys make their way past on an assembly line.  Kind of like a shooting gallery, but you don't actually aim your globs of paint.  They just seem to find (or not find) their targets on their own.  Oh yeah. . .Good times.<br /><br />Next, you're in the cookie bakery, where you're got to move your controller back and forth, up and down, etc. to go through various baking steps.  Again, with the timer, though by now, you're just hoping the time runs out so the game will end.<br /><br />Finally, you're an elf, riding with Santa, whipping toys out of the sleigh as houses pass you by.  There's no penalty for missing a house, and you get a bonus if you hit the chimney directly. You have an unlimited number of toys to toss, so it's really just an exercise in flailing about.<br /><br />I know that the Rudolph gang have been going on a product licensing binge over the past several years, but this should serve as an example that you can't just slap a picture on the cover and create a winner.  This game is a loser.<br /><br />After completing this game in 25 minutes, my 6-year old daughter said, \\""is that all?\\"".  Truer words have not been spoken."
1.0	I ordered the xbox 360 version but instead i got the ps3 version. What a waste of money.
5.0	Awesome controller has just about any mod you could want. My favorite is the akimbo rapid fire its beast! I would recommend these controllers to anyone looking for a competative edge on fps  games at an affordable cost!
5.0	The new Xbox 360 Slim is a very good game system. Not only does it look really nice, it has a number of upgrades from the previous models, which include:  1.New touch sensitive buttons which are really cool. My old 360's power button was actually getting worn out to the point that I really had to push it to turn it on, won't be having that problem with this console.  2.New 250 GB Hard Drive. Also it has a cool new storage compartment. Instead of sticking out of the console and giving it a bit of an odd shape, the hard drive is hidden. It actually took me a while to find it. There's a cool removable piece that you can barely tell apart from the rest of the console, containing the hard drive, which is in a protective slot. The hard drive itself is very very small, which is really cool.  3.The new power brick is much smaller, too. I laughed when I was setting up the console and the brick was by my other brick because of the size comparison. It also doesn't heat up as much as the old power brick.  4.There are 3 more USB ports in the new console, located in the back.  5.It's smaller. Much more compact, and it makes it easier to use it vertically. I used to use mine horizontally, but I like this one better vertical.  6.It runs much quieter than the other models  7.Supposedly it's impossible to kill the machine by overheating, because it has a feature in which it automatically turns off when it's overheating. I love this, I really love this feature.    There's only 1 problem I have with the console, and that's how hot it runs. After about an hour and a half to 2 hours of playing, if you put your hand over the vent, it's extremely hot. At first I was very worried about the console dying really soon because of this, but then I read about the feature that automatically turns it off when it's going to overheat. Now, this does suck because you lose any unsaved progress in the game you were playing, but I think it's better than your console breaking.    So far I'm loving the newsystem.
5.0	It works for my N3DSXL.
5.0	WAS JUST AS THEY DESCRIBED IT WAS, IT HAS GAME AND TWO GUNS, IT IS FUN RELIST GAME, GOOD HUNTING GAME
1.0	Everything but the head phones worked and was as described. Fast shipping didn't pay extra for that which was Awesome. But the head phones sucks.
5.0	All across the board... this is a very fun game.  From the graphics, to the music, to the game play, to the story, everything about it is great.  The only bad thing about it is the fact that there's no sequel of this game. This game totally has Ace Combat and all other combat flight games beat, so hopefully Microsoft will make a sequel to it some day.
1.0	Those who follow my video game reviews know that I have a very hard time with games that are jerky.  I dislike Bethesda games simply for that reason.  The jerky camera motions make those games virtually unplayable for me because along with the jerky motion comes vertigo and a headache.  I really wanted to like this game, but the jerky camera motion nauseated me.  I played for several hours until I just couldn't take it anymore.  It seemed like too much work.<br /><br />I think that the back breaker for me was the horrible animation and acting.  Add to that the fact that there is no immersion value, as the story itself didn't interest me in the slightest, and we have on our hands a great big flop.
5.0	My game came in within a week, it was perfect. My childhood thanked me.
5.0	Very fun game and concept. I haven't had time to play much of it, but I enjoyed what I've played so far. I look forward to beating it at some point.
5.0	My 7 year old daughter really enjoy's this game! She has fun with the cooking games and traveling as the frog.
5.0	I switched to these from the X31 Wireless set which consistently annoyed me.  These work great and make the game seem a lot closer.    Can't beat these for the price.
5.0	if you don't want buy or pay for those expensive gaming headsets, this is a product you should definitely get. after trying it on the first day i got it, i loved it. I usually play CALL OF DUTY and now i can hear the game sound even better. i don't have to leave a long review for you to try it out. JUST GET IT and you'll love it!!!
5.0	This is basically Mario Brothers set in dinosaur land.  I highly recommend it if you have 4-5 year olds who want to play with the game boy.  The introductory levels are easy enough that my kindergartner can enjoy it, and the later levels are very challenging for older players as well.  It's really a lot of fun.
5.0	Works great, got here no problem, and definitely an improvement to the default power cord (Especially for the price). I no longer have to abandon my couch, 5 feet or so away from the tv, just to charge my controller. So, I'd recommend it!
5.0	To me this is THE controller. It's perfect, not too weird, perfect amount of buttons, great build quality and looks. Can emulate NES and SNES no problem.    Only downside I'd say is Sonys 90 day warranty on it. The dualshock 3's have 1 year.
5.0	"This Game is a great game you should get yours right this second this is so good I could have this for my whole live I also reccommend speedy gonzales game boy and Taz Mania Gameboy TazMania\\"" Taz Mania 2 is my favorite game Tazmania 2 these non spacing words can help you find your item. I am A 100% seller on Ebay all of my games work My seller name is Nintendad I sell my stuff on ebay Don't listen to the bad sellers like wom4bmmm they have a 50% positive ratings on amazon trust me I look At all sellers ratings."
5.0	This game is probably one of the best highlights of my game collection. The multiplayer is one of the best I've ever seen and played. The frostbite 3 Engine really makes the difference from battlefield 3. 1000 energy drinks can't even give me the excitement of one multiplayer game.
1.0	My husband is an avid golfer was very excited about being able to &quot;design-in&quot; our brand new Municipal golf course &quot;The Meadow At Peabody&quot; so he could play golf at home And the old fashioned way. Well, the game didn't arrive for Christmas and then it didn't arrive for our March anniversary, and then it didn't arrive for the opening of the full 18 hole opening of the Meadow in May.<BR> It really should be a pretty fine game...because we've now waited through Fathers' Day, and his birthday is coming up and then it looks like Christmas again.
5.0	Bounty Hunter is one of the best star wars games i have ever seen. It has so many weapons to choose from. And the game is not short at all. Each level is about 15 minutes and once you die you have 5 continues so don't let it frustrate you. The graghics in this game are better than they seem on the cover. The villians in this game are countless. There are so many different types of villians. Villians are not that hard to destroy but trust me there is more to it than it seems. It is really easy to control. Hope you found this interesting.Go out and buy it. It is awsome
5.0	This game is the best!  I got it when I first got my Game Cube after playing the N64 version.  This one is ten times better.  I've never gotten bored in over two years.  It's got great one-player challenges, but the multi-player part is the real reason you buy the game.  It's best if you have a sibling or someone you can play it with a lot because it is primarily a multi-player game.  If it's just you, you might want to rent it--a lot.  HAVE FUN!
5.0	Awesome! Love it, fast and timeley delivery!
5.0	I got this game for christmas of 2002 along with ps2, which was my first game system. After palying 2 other games (crazy taxi and stuntman), I put Jak and Daxter in the ps2 and immediately i was blown away. The graphics are great(not as good as jak 2)and the story is interesting and kinda funny. Here's a list of pros and cons I made up...<br />Pros...great graphics<BR>       great story<BR>       characters are funny<BR>       no loading scenes in between levels<BR>       if a challenge is to hard you can skip it and come back  <BR>       later<BR>       not even the bad guys at the end are too hard to defeat<br />cons...only one<BR>       the boggy swamp level of the game is sooo boring. Whenever i get to it I just do it fast to get it over  with<br />the first time i beat this game it took three months of playing for ten minutes before bed every night. The second time i added an extra challenge of collecting all of the precursor orbs in every level. That made the game twice as hard.<br />         Overall jak and daxter is a great game and is deffinitely worthy of a five star rating!
5.0	"Like many games in the \\""Backyard\\"" series this is very enjoyable but flawed. The main problem is the stats. The list of top ten players doesn't track blocks. Rebounding is so difficult that your team and players will never appear in the top ten.  The end-of-season awards for top player on team and in the league don't work at all. And please see the reviewer below, of all the Backyard games, this appears to require the most computer power.  If your computer is not very powerful, the game will play in slow motion--very frustrating. Finally, there are only two pro players; hopefully, future versions will include more.<br />There are many positive points that we've come to expect from manufacturer \\""Humongous Entertainment,\\"" including trick plays, offensive and defensive strategies (Offense: Crash, Normal, or Fastbreak; Defense: Tight, Normal, or Loose), decisions about which players to pick and at what positions, when to sub, etc. Except for the lack of rebounding and outside shooting (especially in the most difficult level), game play is fairly realistic.<br />My player recommendations include the always-speedy Pete Wheeler, defensive specialist and inside shooter Keisha Phillips, all-around threat Lisa Leslie, Reese Worthington (great ball-handling and speed)and outside shooters Kenny Kawaguchi and Pablo Sanchez.  Our current team features Pete, Lisa, Reese, and two players whose skill distribution and build are determined by the player.  The skill points of these latter players increase after one season; they become among your very best players.  The game requires quick responses; I recommend it for older grade school kids (maybe around 3rd through sixth grades) and adults who enjoy this series of sports games.  Others may enjoy the somewhat easier-to-play Backyard Baseball or Football."
1.0	Do not purchase this game.  This is terrible and the second player option does not work.
5.0	Excellent game, shipment arrived safely, I GET ORIGINAL PACKAGING, the game ran smoothly on the console, I recommend buying this shop
5.0	Everything has been improved from Dragon Age Origins.  From combat, to talents, to cutscenes, to visual style, to animations, etc.  it has all been redone for the better.  One thing I extremely love about this game is that Nightmare (Hardest difficulty setting) is actually... a nightmare.  You will have to micromanage your characters to the fullest extent to survive and be prepared to reload your game often. ;p    I am using the High Res texture pack that BioWare has provided to PC users and am using a Radeon 6970.  The game looks beautiful on max settings.  Best looking PC RPG out at the moment!    If you have not played Dragon Age: Origins, you do not need to worry.  It is not a sequel to the character you controlled in Origins.  You will hear exploits about the Grey Warden while playing Dragon Age 2, but it is taking place in a different country.
5.0	I have DC1, DC2, and DC3.  I love them all.  I was a terrible dancer and I couldn't figure out how to boogie.  After dancing to so many songs, I cannot wait to show off my moves at a wedding this coming July.  All three games are helpful if you want to stay fit or lose weight.
5.0	Bioshock 1 is a masterpiece of a game. Story, character development, level design, attention to detail, make it among the best of the games I've played. I am partway through Bioshock 2 and while the story is weaker, everything else is there. The DLC included is only OK. Great gaming value.
5.0	"So much to say, so little space (and time).  Quake3 embodiesthe greatest deathmatch action period.  For me, this is the best gamearound.  I will give you some pros and cons for this game.  First the pros:<BR> 1) The graphics engine is top notch.  Written by the man himself, John Carmack, it possess the best graphics engine created, up until Carmack creates his new engine.  Unreals engine does come close, but I believe the Quake3 engine would win in a \\""duel of engines.\\"" (I just hate the water effects in the Quake3 engine!)  2) The player models are the best.  Period.  There are models for everyone's tastes: monsters, humans, one-eyed cyborgs, the whole 9 yards.  Each one has its own animation and sound.  Very cool when \\""fragging\\"" (killing) someone.  The level of detail up close is astonishing.  My hat goes off to Paul Steed, the creator of the models in Q3..  3) The gameplay is the best around.  Unlike Unreal Tournament, I feel like I'm in control of the environment.  Games for Q3 are designed for less people (around 10) than in Unreal Tournament, in which about 20 or so would work well.  It's pretty hard to explain the gameplay, but the best way to put it would be to say, &quot;it just feels right.&quot; The control, weapon firing, is much smoother. I also like the stability of Q3 more than in Unreal Tournament.  4) The MOD (modification of the game.  To add depth to the game that was not originally added) community for Quake is the best in the business. So many great MODS are being released, with many more to come.  MODS like Alliance CTF ([...]) Quake3Fortress ([...]) and JailBreak ([...]) just to name a few, are cropping up to make the Quake3 experience that much more enjoyable!  The teams spend months adding to Quake3.  They add models, sounds, textures, and just about everything to essentially change the game.  I am, however, looking forward to more great MODS in the future.  (one note: Unreal Tournament has great MODS lined up, but Quake is the clear leader inthe MOD community.)  5) The network code is top notch.  Players with 56K and...EGAD!... 28K modems will love the new code.  Obviously, having a cable modem makes the experience much better, but the game is very playable with dial up connections. <BR> Now for the cons: 1) Gameplay types.  With Domination, Assault, and Last Man Standing, UT is the clear winner in the variety category. In a nutshell Q3 offers straight deathmatch, with 4 CTF maps, for kicks.  I believe more attention should have been made to CTF.  2) The bots: boy are they bad.  I know a lot of time was spent by the Quake team, but it just didn't work.  The bots in UT are much better.  Try playing capture the flag with these bots.  You'll be heading for the Multiplayer arenas in no time.  3) There is no classic style single player in the game.  There is a &quot;ladder&quot; match, but I completed that in about 2 hours.  Playing this may help beginners, but there is nothing like playing online, with other human players, and ping times in the 200's.  As they say, you'll need real life experience.  <BR> In conclusion, Q3 is by FAR my favorite game.  With great deathmatch and CTF (it could have been better, but hey, it's still fun) and the MOD community hard at work to essentially add to the game, I give this game 5 stars.  I do believe Q3 is geared towards avid fans.  If you are a beginner, check out Unreal tournament.  That too, is a great game.  But for me, I will always be a Quake aficionado.  To finish the line in the subject area: 5 Stars for me, for others.......... 1 star.  END"
5.0	Received game very quickly in mail.  Was packaged and in fantastic condition.  Will definitely use this seller again in the future.
5.0	I'm a huge fan of the FIFA series, very big into football but I'm not the gamer that looks for the most extreme challenge, and that's what I love most about FIFA 14 as opposed to the last one in the series that I played, FIFA 12. The Be A Pro mode has been modified in a very simple but effective way, instead of having to earn accomplishments by playing on the ridiculous for me level of difficulty World Class, you can gain all possible accomplishments on any difficulty level. To me that's huge. I've only managed to master Semi-Pro right now.<br />I haven't explored the other modes, Ultimate Team would be next, but given what I've seen so far, this game is awesome.<br /><br />It's also become a lot more realistic with the passes and dribbling skills. I'm struggling with scoring from corners right now and heading in general seems a bit more challenging.
1.0	I am hoping that I get my credit to my account before much longer.<br />when I placed the order it stated it was a video game, not a game boy game.<br />I returned it 1 week after I received it for full credit to my account less shipping charges.  this was on July 18,2003, certified mail.<br />to day I have heard nothing.<br />I would like to give the supplier a good report on the promptmess of shipping out my order, but will have to wait and see.(I can not rate this game as my granddaughter does not have a game boy. I had to put something in the spot)<br />thanks<br />Betty Lloyd
5.0	It has the best story I've ever seen. Great drama. I have to add that I'm addicted to post-apocalyptic stuff :)
5.0	Played for hours on this. Made the Purdue boilers natty champs 10 years straight lol. Then I made FAU a powerhouse football school. Great game.
5.0	Super cute control!!!
5.0	Kids favorite game- I like that you can &#34;save&#34; one another.
5.0	This was one of my favorite video games. I love Legos and Star Wars, so this is a win win. A great game and very hard to outgrow.
5.0	well sonic is back with this exelent version produced by sega.<BR>this game is the best sonic game i have ever played, the graphics are out of this world and themovement of the game is very smooth.<BR>this game carrys on the HERO&amp;DARK system and is very good.<BR>i rate this game as oneof the best on the cube so far and you all should get it if you have the chance. <BR>this is a must game for all you americans as i have the game in the uk. hhhhahaaaaaaa
5.0	If you still have access to a PS2, this is a must have! Most vast content of any Soul Calibur to this day! Most elaborate move sets (Not my fav for all the characters, but great!) Soul Calibur never had so many moves or characters: Not Before; Not Since! Best Create-A-Soul so far. It Will Inspire You! Not only do you get to utilize the standard and hidden characters moves on your creation, you get about 10 unique additional move sets to apply! And CaS has an entire game to itself with a substantial story! This edition made a break-through when the 8-way Run (the movement system –for the uninformed) was consistent with all the other movements: no hesitation. Evasively side-stepping is as effective as backing up, the same as moving forward!<br /><br />Many modes to enjoy, including the signature challenge scenarios. The intro sequence must be watched with reverence! Turn the lights down, don't blink! Get this if you are a content player. Get this and SC2 if you are a tournament player.
5.0	Bought this for Christmas for my kids, who are 14 and 16, and they both love it..the graphics are awesome and the game is the best Madden yet
5.0	Since the release of the first Alice in 2000, I have been waiting for a sequel for a very long time. This game does not disappoint.<br /><br />There are some reviews that state that the game quits unexpectedly, but I have not experienced one problem in 3 hours of playing. I am using a computer with an Overclocked GTX 460 and an Intel Core i5 processor, and it has been flawless fun since the beginning. I did try playing the game with a mouse and keyboard, and it is overly sensitive. I would recommend either the wireless adapter if you already have wireless XBOX 360 controllers, or invest in the corded USB version. It plays much better with the controller in hand versus the keyboard and mouse set-up.<br /><br />Seeing as I do own the other two consoles that the game was released on, you may be inclined to ask why I purchased it for PC. That is a simple answer: graphics. PC versions of games always best their console counterparts in this department, and this one is no different. As I have explained, I do not have a powerhouse of a PC and it still plays great with nearly maxed-out graphics. The world that Alice explores is varying and beautiful. You have to keep in mind that the graphics are not meant to be perfect and beautiful. The grit and imperfections are what Alice experiences in her troubled mind. There are points in the game that I do stop for a moment and take in the disgustingly beautiful world.<br /><br />If you think you have a computer that can handle the game, then go for it. I will say that you will get more out of the game if you have a card that is PhysX compatible, as the game harnesses this technology much of the time. I think they did the first game justice, and would purchase it over and over again!
5.0	I had it unwrapped, a quick software update, and was up and running.  The only thing that might be helpful for this game, is they have a energy level , but I've found even in the beginning levels some with lower energy are harder.  I haven't tried harder levels yet.  But this has a wide range of options, single, double, party, and includes an exercise and create your own.  I've been a bit disappointed with the MOVE games , except sports champion.  But so far, this one is really worth the money.  I just wish the additional songs packs were a bit cheaper.
5.0	I cannot stress how amazing the customer service was from this seller. I had a small problem during the delivery and he went the extra mile to do everything he could to help. Product works great. Just fantastic!
5.0	Really happy with the purchase. Superb service, prompt delivery and fantastic product. After plugging it in I had it up and running within minutes. I really love my Ouya so this key has made it that much more enjoyable.
1.0	There is no wording or text to be able to play the game, don't buy it, don't buy it, don't buy it.
5.0	For some reason, Nintendo decided that a composite video output will satisfy all users and forgot to include an HD capable cable with the product.  Once you connect this cable from your Wii to your HD set, you will have a much better picture and have a better gaming experience.  Kudos to Mycarryingcase for providing this excellent product at such a low price.
5.0	I used to play Street Fighter and Street Fighter 2 Turbo in college. I never played tournaments but played with friends. Once I figured out how to do a HA-DO-KEN and SHO-RYU-KEN, I was hooked! I also remember hours and hours of playing these games in the college dorms. :) The system was SNES and I had a few joysticks. A few years went by and the popularity of arcades and 2D fighters went on a decline (at least in the USA). I thought to myself, all good things come to an end.    Now, Street Fighter Anniversary Collection comes out and I'm completely pleased with it! Street Fighter 2 Turbo seems to be perfect from the arcades. Now I did notice that they turned up the AI so that the computer is more challenging than the arcade version. That's always good so you don't get bored with it. I'm glad the other versions are here too so that I can try them out. This is really a gem of a game. If you like the Street Fighter Franchise and like 2D fighting, pick this one up. You won't regret it!
1.0	From story mode - online mode, this game is riddled with crashes, freezes, and glitches, and at the end of the day, is just a nuisance!
5.0	I bought this thinking it was the same as the xBox version. It is not; however, it is still a fantastic game.
5.0	I did not buy this product through amazon because they have been out of stock for like ages, now of course they have a few but that's not relevant. I bought this product and it is awesome. Kind of sucks that you can only charge the battery when the controller is in the charger unlike the 360's option of a separate battery charger you could charge batteries while in use. anyways, I own two controllers and this keeps them both charged and a place to put them. It has charge indicators which is very nice Red meaning charging and Green meaning charged. It has a rubber stop on the bottom to keep it from sliding. I am unsure what people are doing that causes this unit to fall over but I have no problems with it or battery life. I played a few hours od assassins creed black flag which no battery issue. The back is not smooth it has a little notch to expose the contacts for the battery to charge but it does not change the feel of the controller. I am very happy with this product and would recommend it. so much so, like I said I bought outside of Amazon and saw negative reviews and wanted to contribute helpful information.
1.0	Man, this sim is completely unreasonable. Even some of the in-game text from the mission briefings was written in broken English. Right out of the box I encountered problem after problem with this bomb of a sim. First, it took my system (Which was well above the recommended specs) forever to even recognize the AutoPlay on the CD. Once I forced it to run, it took near about an hour and a half to get it installed. (Had to disable fire-wall, but no mention of having to do that in the instructions.) Once installed, there is no help setting it up. Through trial and error, I finally got the controls configured for my joystick (Saitek ST290 Pro) even then, at BEST, the game would randomly obey the settings that I had selected. The MOST I could get it to do was switch views and fire weapons. EVERYTHING else was not functional or did different things each time the same button/key was pushed. This was a total let down after waiting 4 days for it to arrive. I absolutely love chopper sims, but this one doesn't even get off the ground for my hard earned $29 plus S&H. (Figuratively and literally) Maybe I can get a refund...? I would've given it less than one star, but the box is probably biodegradable...<br />Sincerely<br /><br />John
5.0	Great game! Takes me back to the original, except with way more cool stuff.  Still learning some things, but the game is a lot of fun and addicting!
5.0	Got here sooner then expected and satisfied with the product:)
1.0	A vast majority of people who write to Black and White's official website with suggestions have found that they are misinformed by the media and otherwise about the quality of this game. These people are not looking for improvements but fixes for problems that rarely come up in such well made video games as this, during saving and &quot;out of the blue&quot; the program crashes, which may freeze your system all-together. There are no work arounds that operate constantly and they failed to make two expected patch (game fix) dates so far to rectify the issue. This game can be described in many positive colorful ways, all of which is true, but there are serious issues within that somehow failed to surface. This game's important functions like saving your work (work which can be agonizing to some) is less than operational, if at all, and, in most cases reported, will crash your system. The final product has fallen short from the beginning, I would put no trust in this product's proposed functionality as of now. I must although say that there will be a patch sooner than later, but do to the information and the lack there of, I regret I cannot say when without misleading you.
5.0	I've played the entire Resistance Trilogy and have not been disappointed at all. These are some of the 3-Best games for the Playstation 3.<br />I'll start my review discussing the 3 Games Separately and will strictly discuss the Campaign portions of the games, as I believe that the Multiplayer aspect will change depending on how each of you perceives it (good or bad).<br /><br />Resistance: Fall of Man<br />The first game in any trilogy should be able to set the tone for how the rest of the games will be played. It should also create a solid and complete opening story to draw the gamers into the world. This game has done that and more! The first Resistance sets the tone which is continued throughout the trilogy. It also gives a very solid story line which does not break or seem incomplete in any way.<br /><br />Resistance 2<br />The second game in this trilogy keeps the tone and mood going. It has an enhanced story line that picks up where the first Resistance leaves off, and continues to a great (yet somewhat sad) ending. By far, the 2nd Resistance is the best in the trilogy.<br /><br />Resistance 3<br />(Trying not to spoil the game), The 3rd Resistance starts out with a new main character who you play as the entire game. The story line in this game seems slightly askew from the other games, but then again it takes place much later than the previous 2 games. As the final game in the trilogy, I do not feel as though it made a good solid end; however, the story in itself was very good.<br /><br />Since Insomiac's contract with Sony has ended and there are no talks about renewing it does not seem as though there will be another Resistance game (or at least one made by Insomiac). Due to this, I feel that Insomiac did a good job leaving the game such that another developer could pick up where they left off.<br /><br />Overall<br />As a trilogy, I think this is one of the best out there. All 3 games offer great stories and amazing gameplays. Also, for the $39.99 Price Tag, this is a very good deal, as Resistance 3 retails for $20 alone.<br /><br />I highly recommend this series to anyone looking for a nice solid Trilogy to add to their Playstation 3 collection!!ag, this is a very good deal, as Resistance 3 retails for $20 alone.<br /><br />I highly recommend this series to anyone looking for a nice solid Trilogy to add to their Playstation 3 collection!!
5.0	the code is good and unused and idk how he get all of those codes.<br /> i had been searching the recon code for almost a year but thanks to this guy my search is over, now i get to show off
1.0	the controls are completely different from all the other dragon ball z games.  the fights also were very different more video and a whole lot less of the gamer doin more work. Counters in the game arent very effective if your not at a high enough level you basically have no chance what so ever.  A big thing that makes me think this is so bad is that there is barely any characters compared through out the game the story gets skipped around and only gets to the main fight i dont know what the producers were thinking by not giving people the oppurtunity to be super saiyan 4 goku or vegeta. This game is very disappointing.  The only very good part is the hero mode where you are able to customize your character to how youd like him to look.
5.0	Fallout 3 Game of the Year is one of the Best Video game I've ever played, but it took me a while to finished it because of the common problem...It Always Freezes every few hours...I hated that part.<br /><br />That's why, I'll probably abandon the Fallout Franchise. I'm sure New Vegas would be fun, but I will never want to go through the same problem again.<br /><br />At first, I thought, it was my PS3 that has the problem, I didn't know it was actual game.<br /><br />Well, I managed to finished  Fallout 3 G.O.T.Y....after so many Restarts...Finally! That's enough for me. It was Fun Fallout 3!<br /><br />--F<br />[...]<br /><br />I'm still giving this Game 5 Stars & Zero Star for Freezing to Much(=
5.0	Completely satisfied!
5.0	This a great protective filter for those who want to protect the whole front face of their Vita. You may want to get two as I had a little trouble placing it, so of course something got under it.
5.0	I had just purchased this in store for the same price as it was on Amazon.  I would suggest buying this as apposed to other classic controllers out there because it works off the batteries in your wii-mote so you don't have to buy more batteries, and the controler works real well as should everything that has the nintendo brand on it.  Don't buy any other brands that are wireless unless you don't mind shelling out extra money for batteries and having to turn the controller off and on to reset it.  You want quality?  Buy this.
5.0	ive seen no difference between this type of hdd and a licensed microsoft brand hdd. same speeds and everything. works great
5.0	Bought this as a gift for my Grandson.<br /><br />Hope to give it to him in a few weeks.<br /><br />Blah, blah, blah....<br /><br />Too many words are required...
5.0	great skin for my 3DS XL fits great and looks amazing. it leaves a little bit uncovered where you can still see the original blue, but in my opinion it makes it looks better that way.love the blue/black stile.
5.0	I got to play both systems for a week and I have to say ps4 is the better console. I spent half the time on Xbox one yelling at the kinect to get it to recognize my commands. Not good for games.
5.0	I love Goldeneye when it was on Nintendo 64. Then they put it on the Wii. I had to get. I was really surprised with the graphics. Crisp & smooth!
5.0	This is probably the best controller I've used to play retro games with. Fantastic d-pad and nice, clicky buttons live up to the original NES controller, it's super lightweight, and it's pretty much universal... even works with Ouya. So long as it proves to be durable, it's keeping this five-star rating. I might have to buy another as a backup!<br /><br />Hoping these guys give the same treatment to the SNES controller at some point.
5.0	It's one of the best first person shooters out there,I've played most of them and this one never gets old,online gaming takes a while to get used to especially target acquisition and flying the helicopters,but playing against my friends and strapping c-4 to their tank is just a riot,of course watching them crash the helicopters over and over again is fun too,get the premium edition for free map pack upgrades
5.0	My grand-daughter loves this game she has about seven DS games and three advance games and this game is her favourite. she never gets tired of playing this game and the price is also great.
5.0	Very well made game with very engaging story line. Good buy!
1.0	I can't say if the game is good or not, because The case came empty! Yes, you just read this correctly. THE CASE IS EMPTY!!! There was NO game inside the case!<br />The look on my daughters face was so heart breaking....
1.0	This game is incredibly annoying and repetitive I regret wasting my money and purchasing this game. Should of got marvel Lego Superheros.
5.0	I love these things, It came in just 2 days, and they work pretty well. Whne you first use them, you are going to feel weird when there on, but over time, you will see a improvement :)
5.0	it was great, but what disappointed me was the lack of controllers but everything worked like expected, now I'm playing my childhood system
5.0	This was cool because it has the better screen and cellular data capable. The only thing I dislike is the limited memory it came with and the price of buying a higher capacity memory card which has to be SONY.
1.0	This game has no plot or anything. It is nothing like basketball an very boring. The game is a discrace to nintendo. The graphics are not fully taken advantge with on the gamecube. My nintendo 64 could do these graphics. Another sport game on gamecube however, brings out the full potencial of the graphic processer on GCN. Don't buy this. It's the same as th one for nintendo, just a small step above. To wrap it up, this game is really bad. Don't wast your hard earned cash on this crud.
1.0	the controllers weren't wireless. there isn't a difference between the controller PS2 and those you sendedto me.
5.0	This game is a lot like the computer game released by BLizzard Entertainment, Diablo II(one of the best games ever along with Starcraft, Starcraft: Brood War, and Warcraft III Reign Of Chaos) and is a must have for anyone who enjoyed Diablo II. I feel that this game was well made and has very nice graphics and is enjoyable to play. Also when you lose you don't get frustrated in this game, instead you want to try, again, and again till you get it! I highly recommend purchaseing this game it is a must have for a dedicated gamer.
5.0	My son loves this game and he plays it all the time. Can't get him off of it. All of his friends love this game too.
1.0	Bought this today becasue of like everyone you think WOW! Jillian Michael.  WRONG! It sucks big time and was a total waste of money. I have now learned my lesson check out the reviews before you buy. I cant believe she has her name on such a bad piece of work.
5.0	Im glad i got this. It really makes me feel like im in the game. Its also small and fits perfect into the controler pak, and its excellent for any games, though please note that some games won't allow it, but any way, worth buying.
5.0	Awesome. Product worked perfectly. Perfect customer support and answers all my questions.
1.0	Already not working 👎🏾
5.0	I love Psvita a great portable gaming device😄
5.0	Takes a few games to get used to it, but it makes your accuracy so much better once you get the feel for them.
5.0	My brothers cant stop playing this game. I recommend this for anyone who likes video games. i love it .
5.0	i love this its amazing and the blue lights are nice too. it was easy to put together but the dvd drive lids didnt work at all but i dont really care i cant see through it anyways.
1.0	Junk dont work right handles are junk it made of nothing they made the thing as cheap as they could
5.0	Looks great!  The gamepad portion is seperated into four pieces-right, left, top, and bottom.  this actually made it much easier to place and adjust onto the pad.  My kids will love this as part of their new Wii-motes.
1.0	I've watched  this sim over the years touting it's self to be superior to Flight Sim and I can't for the life of me see what it's supporters find so good about it.Except for the flight physics,it just sucks in comparison .The scenery sucks,the aircraft models suck,and so on.  Can't wait for Microsoft Flight.
1.0	This game's puzzles are too hard it killed any fun that might've come out of it.
5.0	Excellent and worked as expected
5.0	When I bought this game I really didn't know what to expect. I've only ever played xBox and all that comes with it, so I wasn't entirely sure I'd like it.  But it was an awesome game and I love it! :)
5.0	The cable works great for a PSP 3000. Kids are playing games and watching shows in the car using the PSP as the source.
5.0	For those who don't know, the Harvest Moon series is an Animal Crossing-like farming sim game.  You raise crops and animals to get money, build up your house, make friends, and even date/marry one of townspeople.  Rune Factory adds in dungeon style caves, complete with monsters!  You have to fight them Zelda/Secret of Mana style, though admittedly the combat in this game is a tad rough but still quite passable.  You can even tame some monsters and have them work on your farm!    Besides the adventure/combat abilities, they really improved the controls over previous versions.  The inventory is much easier to cycle through now, and you can use the touch screen to tap on your crops to water or harvest them, which is much quicker than the old-school method.    Even without the adventure elements, the controls are so well polished that this game would be superior to previous Harvest Moon games on the farming aspect alone, at least in my opinion.
1.0	The controller broke after only a couple of uses. I definitely would not recommend this product - buy a different controller!
5.0	Game came in perfect condition without a damage found on it. The game runs fine and I can get back to playing what I used to play on a Gameboy.
5.0	This game is the best i have ever played. My sister was playing it one day, and i thought it looked really dumb. But then i started playing it and i was hooked. I don't have the game yet myself, so i have to go down to my sisters. And i litterally play it for 3-5 hours, at least. I love it. I would definetly recommend buying it. My parents are getting it for me soon...then i don't have to go anywhere! ;) But as you can see from the rating...5 stars, very very few games get that rating from everyone! All of you will wind up hooked with it and you will play it for hours on end!!!!!!!
5.0	I really hope Square Enix continues to &#34;remaster&#34; the previous games for the newer consoles (PS3 and PS4). My PS2 was burned in a house fire years ago and I've been yearning to revisit Zanarkan since then. The remastered version was just what I needed. Note, some of the &#34;remastered&#34; graphics don't really fit into the game and actually highlight a few &#34;lack-of-details&#34; that weren't noticeable in the original (Tidus signing autographs with no pen comes to mind). Still a great marketing idea. Recommend for all FF fans.
5.0	I have owned every expansion pack for The Sims 1 and 2, as well as most of Sims 3, and Late Night is THE BEST!!! If you are only going to buy 1 expansion pack, seriously consider Late Night. It has so much to keep you busy and not getting bored! Check out the description and watch some videos on U Tube as well. I have had this game for a month now and still haven't met a vampire! There is so much to do. I also recommend World Travel as they go well together!
5.0	I love the way that the PS3 is better than the others systems.  It has free Internet and the controllers are wireless. This system has the best graphics available.  The bad thing is you have to update your system. The updating takes a long time. I recommend this system because it is awesome.  The 180 gigs are I the best because it holds more information and accounts.
5.0	My 12 year old grandson requested this gift and he is very happy with it.  This was the very edition that he thought that he wanted!
5.0	10 year old grandsons loved this game!
5.0	PRODUCT IS AOK. ONE MINOR ANNOYANCE IS THE KEY CLICK RECORDER THAT SHOWS UP AND INTERFERES AS I HAVE TO GO TO TASK MANAGER TO CLOSE IT.
5.0	Muy buen producto y además es justo lo que necesitaba. Llenó por completo mis expectativas. Lo recomiendo para todos los compradoresItś a good game
5.0	I'm a big fan of games like Diablo II and Neverwinter Nights, so I logically was inclined to buy this game.  However, Asheron's Call 2 is a much different game than Neverwinter or other D&D games.  This doesn't mean it isn't fun and very stimulating though.  Just a warning for those who buy it wanting another Neverwinter Nights.<br />Asheron's Call 2 is beautiful in every way.  The sound is amazing!  Music is wonderful and doesn't get on your nerves.  The graphics is best of its kind at this point in the game.  And, there is little lag or drop-outs like you get in games like Earth&Beyond or the [bad] Everquest.<br />There is a huge land to explore. It can take hours to walk from one area to the next.  In this way, it reminds me of Morrowind.  There is so much to explore - you never get bored. <br />Finally, the best part of the game is the lack of documentation!  I love that someone finally understands that we like to figure things out on our own.  I'm discovering new things every day.<br />Buy it and enjoy!
1.0	Charge only lasts for a couple weeks
5.0	the games pretty fun but it's lacking one of the main races courses the costa Christo rally race I would have loved to drive that race plus I would have loved to drive the mach 5 or racer x's shooting star in that race, that being said the game reminds me of driving in the hot wheels world race game so try is out u might like it
5.0	Everything as expected. Thank you.
5.0	The gameplay is better in live 15 than  2k. It makes sense and if you play smart you can be successful. Fouls are actually called in this game as opposed to 2ks inconsistency. Its Not like 2k where in 2k beyond the eyecandy its all stupid random chaos. Live is real basketball logic. Live 15 is more fun and more about the user input not canned animations. What live needs to fix are menu options; too slow and cumbersome.  Overall it's a better game in gameplay(since 2k patch 3 made 2k15 worse), but you have to give live 15 a few games especially if you've been playing 2k for the last 6 years like me. Once you get used to it, way better game and way more fun.
5.0	This Xbox 360 Slim Vault is simply amazing. It's everything as it looks but..better!..the color has a glossy shine so when a light hits it, you will definitely see it!.. Score: 10/10. Since you are already considering buying this, ask yourself, Why not?
5.0	My only complaint was updating the firmware. I ended up doing it on my computer instead of my Nexus, because it just wouldn't work from the tablet. I play GTA:SA all the time with this, and my tablet battery runs out before this does. The controls aren't perfect, but I haven't tried it with any other games, so I'm not sure if it's the controller or the game. For how little of a &#34;gamer&#34; I am, it's totally worth having this instead of a more expensive model.
5.0	This game is so much fun! It gives anyone with an imagination the ability to create music that sounds great! Don't let other reviews fool you it isn't really that hard.  It is a bit confusing at first, but once you get the hang of it, you'll be putting songs together with your eyes closed!
5.0	"I picked this game up at the time of it's release.  Since then I feel I need to attend weekly meetings due to my addiction.  <br />that was many years ago.  Since then Picross has become a way of life for me, it's right up there with breathing and eating.  Yes, I'm a nerd.  The puzzle grid is small, due to the small screen of the GBA, so some may experience eye strain.  Again, owing the the small grids in which to solve any given puzzle, it's easily suited to the newbies to this type of puzzle gaming (some of the earlier puzzles are really lame-- but they eventually progress in complexity). <br />Since I first discovered this game I've moved onto getting the imported version of Mario Picross 2 (a great game!), purchasing Japanese monthly puzzle magazines w/ hundreds of puzzles per issue, getting World of Puzzles magazine for their similair \\""Paint-by-Numbers\\"" puzzles, and importing all the titles I could afford which contain there titles. <br />Also, if you are a big fan of picross/nonograms,  <br />you may want to visit your local Japanese bookstore (here in NY I go to Kinokuniya) and ask for their \\""Illustrated Logic\\"" books. <br />"
5.0	It's a Sega Saturn RCA connector and it WORKS. (not for Genesis or Genesis 2-- this is for the SEGA SATURN!!)<br /><br />Took a little bit of effort to stick in the saturn. It almost SEEMED like it wasn't the right size. But you just gotta push it in kinda hard. Once you do, it ALL WORKS PERFECTLY!!!!!!
5.0	There were problems with the PlayStation 3 version, but nothing to justify the some of the negativity that is being directed at it. The 360 version runs fine. The game looks gorgeous, has great sound, and the games themselves (Silent Hill 2 and 3) are absolutely unique and wonderful classics. Hand the High Definition treatment has made them better and and more beautiful than ever. Don't listen to the hate that is being directed at this game. It's not justified. It's basically just exaggerated fan anger over changes in the voice acting and new textures and so forth, but the claims against this game in some of the more negative reviews have no bases in fact. The game is wonderful!
5.0	Fantaastic ...My kids love it
5.0	I received a set of pedals that doesnt work. The people at Thrustmaster have not responded yet so the customer service is very poor they dont answer at all. I prefer to have it fixed than doing the process of returning the product and just having my money back.  UPDATE: THE CONNECTIONS WERE FAULTY AND NOW THEY WORK!! AND STILL NO ANSWER FROM THRUSTMASTERS. THEIR CUSTOMER SERVICE DESERVES A MINUS 10 STARS.
1.0	DO NOT buy this from the Digital Gadget Store. In my copy, from Digital Gadget Store<br />It DIDN'T START up until I WASTED an HOUR of My TIME trying to to turn it on.<br />Second, when the game started, the SPRITES WERE ALL BLACK BLOCKS<br />and third, the game WOULDN'T SAVE.<br />Do not buy this, its a waste of time and money. I am very disappointed I had my dreams so high.
1.0	Purchased this fightpad for the PS3 after very positive experiences with my 360 Wired fightpad. Buyer Beware: The PS3 fightpad is absolutely terrible. Sticky buttons, long delays, poor inputs in downward motions on the d-pad, and a clunky, heavy, battery-dependent controller with shoddily designed wireless.  This is my first review on Amazon. I have been a street fighter fan since the age of 7. Do NOT buy this pad.
5.0	Still getting used to this sim, but so far....5 stars. Haven't figured out the map details yet. Love the P-47!
5.0	I am so glad i took my time in looking for a rack and ran across this rack. Such a simple and great idea to hide the components behind the TV. I will be buying more racks in the future...
1.0	Update:  And it looks like Bethesda knew about the issues and still released it anyway.  [...]    I should've known from the fact that Bethesda withheld review copies that this version was terribly broken. Buyer beware. If you are able to, get the PC version instead!
5.0	Nothing beats the classics, especially one that was never released in the US originally. This definitely helps to stimulate my mind
5.0	In response to the first review.... your review sounds suspiciously biased against CLS. All of those problems you mentioned do not exist if you PROPERLY install the service pack. There was never a problem with clicking sounds or GPWS??  I'm sorry you did not like the product and I'm glad you got a refund. However, there is a problem with your computer if all of those things you mentioned did not work. I'd personally stay away from PSS since they closed down. If you want the best of both worlds, merge the Wilco Panel with the CLS Airbus. Wilco's model is JUNK and is not deserving of that panel.
5.0	Feels great in the hands - very comfortable. It's good quality silicone rubber with a nice texture. It has no odor whatsoever. No real issues with blocking ports, but you do have to tug the power port a bit to plug in the power adapter. It's really not a big deal. As other reviewers mention, you will have to use a straight plug headphone cable.
5.0	This is the best pokemon ever in the history of pokemon games. I'd caught the rare pokemon Jirachi all the pokemon in the game and I'd can't wait to transfer them to &quot;Pokemon Colosseum&quot; to battle them on the big screen. My favorete pokemon is Treecko a beginning grass type pokemon, which fully evole into the grass pokemon Sceptile because there cool pokrmon to train with.
1.0	have had this item for 4 days now, have sent 2 emails to tech support still no resolve, they keep telling me my anti-virus  was blocking it even though I could down load saves. shut off anti-virus same problem the box says uk region and I am in us told them that when I sent over first message with all the info they asked for. I could not recomen this to anyone unless they were willing to spend a lot of time with it and there is a free progam out there if you want to do that
1.0	The Ipega felt cheapt. the set up was simple i suppose but took a little figuring out. The silver buttons under the left D pad are way too small and hard to push. could see those jamming easily. The best thing was the analog sticks. All the other buttons and the controller itself is made if very cheap plastic. The shoulder buttons are probably the worst part. they feel very loose and my right trigger eventually broke and fell into the controller. controller is very cheap and not intended to last. Not worth the price.
5.0	My kids favorite game now they all want their own for christmas.
5.0	This is absolutely the best fighting game on psp.  The graphics, the characters, and the games are awesome!
5.0	I got this game about 2 months ago, and seriously, I have played it almost every day.  It is SO much fun!  You ride to your town you create on a train.  You then move into a tiny house (it is small to start off with, but if you pay back your loan, it can be made to be pretty big).  Each town is different.  The fruit on the trees is different, the townsfolk are different, and the items you find at the town store are different.  On some days, different people will come to your town to sell exclusive things.  Also, things happen on different days, like the dog who plays live music on saturday at eight o'clock.  That reminds me, the townspeople are all cute little animals, like Vesta the lamb, Quetzal the bird,  Carmen and Penny the mice, Lulu the hippo, and Puck and Aurora the penguins, to name a few.  Each town can have up to 15 different townspeople living in it, and they can move away at any time.  New people move in after they move away though.  Sometimes, people will camp out in your town.  Also, you and three of your family and friends can have a character in your town.  During the day, you can visit the post office, store, police station, mueseum, dump, wishing well, or the townsfolk.  You can earn money to buy furniture, clothes, stationary to write the townspeople on, tools, roof paint, flowers, trees, special items, rugs, and wallpaper.  You earn this money by selling items you no longer need, doing favors for the townspeople, and digging up buried treasure.  You can also design your own clothes!  This is a lot of fun.  On holidays, the mayor will give you a special gift.  During the day, you can also go fishing, catch insects, dig for gyroids (little robot thingys) or buried treasure or fossils (which you can donate to the mueseum), or you can chop down trees, plant trees, or plant flowers.  You can also change the town tune, mail letters, shop, and pick up items from the dump or the lost and found at the police station.  And to earn extra cash, you can catch fish, and insects and sell them (one fish I caught sold for $15,000)!  There is also this turnip trading thing, where this warthog comes and sells turnips on Sunday for really expensive prices and you can sell them for a profit at the store, if you are lucky.  You can also sell fruit, eat fruit, and collect fossils, gyroids, rare furniture, sea shells.  The time changes like in the real world (not like the sims)!  You and the townspeople can wear different clothes and use different umbrellas.  Something always happens, whether you are there or not.  The seasons change and it rains occasionally.  Special events and merchants come to town a lot.  Watch out for Crady Redd who sells a rare piece of junk for $11,000 (normally worth like $2,000).  Saharah sells carpets and Wendell sells wallpaper.  Katrina the forune teller tells fortunes.  Oh yeah, and the shop owner's name?  Tom Nook.  Nice dude.  He's who you pay your loan back to.  I love talking to the townspeople.  They sometimes give you things for FREE.  You can shake trees, but watch out for the bees.  Mosquitos and cockroaches are annoying too.  Well, I think that about covers it.  Oh yeah, you can write letters to the townspeople, and even attach a gift.  They might write you back and send you a gift.  They show your letter off to the other people in town.  Also, you can write things on the bulletin board, and be sure to check it to find a rare gift buried in the ground.  That about covers it.  I reccommend this game to anyone!  It's AWESOME!!!  Sorry for writing so much!
1.0	I have played a few rotten games but this one was ridiculous.  It was one of those games that I would not buy if it was to have cost a penny.  I have played the N-64 version and it was great so I figured that it would be just like it man I was wrong.  I wish it would have just allowed you to not have a timer trust me this game is not worth it.  The graphics are not all that great nor is anything else.
5.0	Plugged one end into the Wii then the other end into the TV, worked perfectly.  Price was great. Thank you very much
1.0	We ordered this without realizing the format is NOT correct for our US-based system. This is a PAL (Phase Alternating Line) format game and will NOT work in your USA game system! The standard for US-based systems is NTSC (National Television System Commitee). This should be pointed out to the buyer in a more conspicuous manner, although it DOES show in the image posted, so I give it 1 star. I'm sure that most people are no longer buying PS2 games anyway so it this helps just one person then mission accomplised.
5.0	If you're a fan of Assassin's Creed games this one falls right in line. The story is pretty good, but the gameplay is incredible.
5.0	After I got the first DJ Hero years ago, I knew I'd have to complete my collection when DJ Hero 2 came out. Not only does it have more modernized music (the first had lots of mixes involving older songs), but it includes famous DJ's like Deadmau5, David Guetta and even Tiesto. It has over 80 new mixes to play, and even when you've beaten the games career mode (known as Empire), there are STILL mixes in the quickplay mode that are new and weren't featured in the career mode. If trophies are your thing, about half of them are online related, but I was still able to get most of the offline-related trophies rather easily. If you're a fan of rhythm-based games like the Guitar Hero and Rock Band franchise, then this game is probably for you. It's a bit different as you're using the three buttons on the record, a crossfader, and an equalizer, but overall, the tutorials bring you up to speed rather quickly and with true devotion, you can beat almost any song in the game on Expert. The only possible bad thing I can think of is the fact that I haven't seen too many people online. This isn't Call of Duty, so people aren't exactly lining up to battle here, but if you stick around long enough, or try to find a match again after playing another set or two, you can surely find someone that's willing to play against you. This is a great game, and in my opinion, even better than the original. Enjoy!
5.0	Came waaaaaay faster than expected! Works great, though, i was hoping the controller would be wireless as the description clearly stated, but oh well. Great system, great price!
5.0	I have a home theather system that has a PS3 attached.  It is now so much more effective to just do movies and other none gaming content with using the game controller.  I worked on al three Sony TV's the first time.  Excellent product.
5.0	I love this game because the game has so many things to do! plus you can actually be bad or good!
5.0	Ordered this for my 10 year old daughter.<br />It is a challenging game, but that keeps her interested.<br />She really enjoys it!
5.0	Purchased these as a gift.  They were perfect.  Shipped quickly.
5.0	I got this as a gift for my nieces and they loved it.  So did the rest of the family - in fact the parents are playing it more than the kids!  Originally I thought the only decent game for this was the included Wii Sports but that's not true.  There are several other games out there that are also fun to play.  I would recommend this for everyone.
5.0	It is a good company. And good cover
1.0	This battery was selled to me like if it was new. It function 2 weeks and not anymore, very dissapointed! It thought it was new but it seems refurbished.
5.0	This has got to be one of the best games that I have ever played.  There's hours on in of action/adventure/stealth.<BR>There's aliens, mutated homo sapiens, pigs and other futuristic cross bread creatures.<BR>Take a picture of some of these creatures and get some units(Cash).<BR>This is probably the best game ever besides The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker
5.0	I was looking for a fun way to get myself back into exercise.  I was previously an avid exerciser, then just got increasingly bored with working out.  Of course, time constraints, work, and family put exercise on the back burner.  I thought this game would get me to enjoy exercise more, and it has.  It is a surprisingly tough workout and has a variety of exercises to keep you interested.  It is more sports-oriented, which is great for me.  I have been using it for a week and have kept on track.  I hope to continue on the same pace with the 9-week programs.  You can definitely feel that you have worked out the following day or two.  I look forward to EA sports coming out with NFL training camp for the PS3 as well.  Overall, great game to restore motivation.
5.0	This game can be a bit challanging but it's not that hard. Really chaotic which makes it great. Build buddies, guns, vehicles of all sorts. If you have a multi-adaptor for 4 player and friends to play then your all set. This game is a master piece and worth buying. The only thing that I must say as a downfall is that it's hard to attain except through online which most places charge an arm and a leg like $70 which no game is worth. But if you find it for a cheaper price somewhere buy it! It's worth it and will last hours for fun.
5.0	These came nicely packaged and are fully charged and ready to use right out of the box. Note: a software update has to be installed before these will operate properly. Otherwise, this set is pretty much plug and play, after plugging the dock into your Xbox One word of caution, don't fly by the seat of your pants, follow the directions, do the update, and follow the link up directions to the letter.<br /><br />The headset itself was easily adjustable. I like that the arm that holds the headset in place makes a small tick tick sound as you size them, so you can control expansion without making giant changes and then having to readjust all over again. They still grip your head and feel like they fit a little too tight, but they aren’t broken in yet. Still, they were a bit uncomfortable – I was continuously aware that I had them on. I’m assuming that will change when they are broken in. The headset has a bendable microphone, so you can place it exactly where it is best for you.<br /><br />I found the volume a little loud and the tiny volume wheel is not intuitive while the headset is on - it was easier to turn the headphones down while off. I come from the 70-80s rock generation where loud was the way, so my hearing isn't as good as it could be, but I still found these a little on the loud side.<br /><br />For completeness, I also did test the plug and play capabilities with other audio devices. When I plugged the headphone wire into my Galaxy Note 4, the music output was stereo, picking up high and low notes. Sound quality was very good. While I did get stereo sound through my phone with these headphones, it wasn’t the case when hard-wiring to my computer – sound only came through the one side of the headset. To be clear, the sound quality for music wasn't the greatest, certainly not on the level of a good pair of audio headsets made for music listening. But for gaming, you could hear a pin drop... or someone coming up behind you in the game.<br /><br />This is a good, solid set of headphones. and it was great not to be tied down with wires between the headset and the gaming console.is a good, solid set of headphones. and it was great not to be tied down with wires between the headset and the gaming console.
5.0	My daughter is almost four and loves these games.  She needs a little help once in a while, which is fun for me, too.  It has three difficulty levels that will probably make it interesting for her for years to come.
5.0	These things work like the original feel good and responsive.  I am playing on a Retropie on a Raspberry Pi2.
1.0	The game does not work.
1.0	This is the worst headset I have ever purchased!  Do not buy this!<br /><br />I bought mine right from the Turtle Beach website.  It's a little more than I normally pay for a headset, but I figured it would be a good quality item as it's a name brand.<br /><br />Boy was I wrong.  Out of the box the headband was tight, and did not really adjust well.  The mic feed was also very low, no matter how I adjusted the settings on my computer.<br /><br />After having it for a month the right ear piece fell off.  The part that swivels and connects the ear piece to the head band snapped off.  The were kind enough to replace the headset for me for free.  I've had the new one for a month and a half now, and the same thing happened on the left side now. Same break pattern as well, the swivel part that connects the two cracked and snapped.  It's such a poorly made design for a well known brand name, it's such a shame.<br /><br />Hoping I can get my money back / a credit to get a new style of head set... or else I'll be returning the one they replace this one with in about another month.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and don't get this headset.  It's not worth the money, it's uncomfortable and falls apart easily.
5.0	My 6-year-old enjoys the game and it arrived in time. The game was bran new and unopened. My son was excited because he likes ninja turtles.
5.0	Great case.  I have big hands and previously my hands would get cramped when I played for an extended period of time.  Not any more!
5.0	I like this game alot. Once I start it, it's hard to put it down,lol. It's a fun shooting game. Beware: If you buy this you will be glued to it,LOL. Just like this game alot. It's the best of it's kind I've played sofar. What is Call of Duty up to now, I wonder? They have so many titles and yet this to be the best. Well good luck with this game and don't let it wear you out when you get hooked,LOL!
5.0	Epic all i can say came very delicately wrapped and shipped very speedily i got a bit worried because i couldn't find the CD key at first but then i found it behind disk 3 lol THANK U VERY MUCH
5.0	HOLA, QUEDE COMPLACIDA CON ESTA COMPRA MUY BUENO EL PRODUCTO...DE BUENA CALIDAD, EN CUANTO AL VENDEDOR TAMBIÉN  FUE BUENA LA ATENCIÓN.
5.0	So far these are excellent. The sound is amazing. Background sounds are so clear that they've made my gamer husband jump a few times. They are also comfortable. We've had them for 3 months. We're hoping they last as we haven't had much luck with other brands of headphones, which have all stopped working in less than a year.
1.0	This game is a sad excuse for a game;(.  It takes Lords of Magic and goes backwards several steps.  If your intrested in a game of this type try Lords of Magic, or freeware Masters of Magic.
5.0	Perfect for sports game and theres so much you can do with it. Easily mounts on the top of my TV. The whole fam loves it
1.0	the worst console in history not recommend
5.0	Excellent game!! Awesome graphics and gameplay. Perfect for guitar practice and for skill development. I recommend this game to anyone who wants to learn the guitar or to improve guitar techniques, just buy it if you have an electric guitar!!
5.0	Was a birthday present, the bday  boy love it
5.0	Good replacement cable at a good price, if you need a power cable then i recommend this as it will fit just like the one that came with the system
5.0	The game works perfectly and came in a hurry!  I'm very satisfied with not only the quality but also the bargain!
5.0	"Well first of all, please don't read the other review(s) and panic because Nintendogs been compared to \\""1984\\"".  That's absurd, honestly.  It's a simple game, and like many things in life you get out of it what you put into it.<br /><br />First off, you don't need to spend hours & hours with this game.  Just 20-40 minutes a day will do.  But it is best when played several times a day, every day.<br /><br />Our journey begins at the kennel, where you choose your starter puppy (intial breeds vary upon which Nintendogs version you buy, but eventually all breeds become available).  Once you choose your puppy, you buy some basic supplies and head on home, where you begin to train it.<br /><br />Training utilizes the DS microphone function.  When training, you need to speak clearly and about 6 inches away from the microphone, and because of this, I'd say skip this game for kids under than 8.  It's also important that you don't yell and speak in the same tone each time you talk to your puppy.  Your first mission is to teach your puppy their name, then you move on to teaching them commands & tricks (sit, shake, wag, beg, lay down, and so forth).<br /><br />In Nintendogs you will also need to provide our dog with regular feedings, waterings, walkings, and bathings.  In the beginning, your dog will not walk very far, but as you progress in the game the walks become longer, and can take a bit of time, so it's best to have some patience when playing this game.  And in this game, your patience can be rewarded with prizes that your puppy finds for you.  The gifts can be sold for money (used to buy more supplies and puppies), or used with your puppy (hats, glasses, wigs, collars, and so on to decorate your puppy with).  Bathing your puppy is also fun, and a necessary chore to have your pup win in certain competitions.<br /><br />Competitions are the way you earn money in Nintendogs (used to buy supplies for your puppy).  There's a frisbee tournament, an agility tournament, and an obedience tournament.  Each one has practice areas in the game, and the competitions are all very short (there are 4 levels of mastery in each area of competition) and fun to do.  They are something you have to do in this game, to buy things to keep your puppy happy.  Besides that, competitions are a good way to raise your trainer points.<br /><br />Trainer points are bascially experince points, and once you collect a set amount of trainer points, certain things become unlocked.  These things include new puppy supplies, new environments to buy, and previously unavailable breeds.  This is really your incentive for playing the game.  For along with unlockables, your dog will also begin finding more rare items in the game, you can sell these, as they worth more money than the regular items in the game, or you can keep them to put them to use later in the game.<br /><br />This game is really innovative, the kind of innovative that Nintendo is known for.  And while it will have it's naysayers, the game is fun for those with time, paitence, and a fondness for puppies.  The game is more complex than I could ever get across in an amazon review, but is really pure and simple joy.urnament, and an obedience tournament.

5.0	I'm 39 years old and have been a gamer all my life. Thieves in Time is a great addition to the Sly Cooper series. I really enjoyed this game from beginning to end. The story was great, i enjoyed using all the playable characters and since I'm a hound for treasure and hidden objects I was we'll satisfied cuz there's plenty of it in Thieves in Time. The overall gameplay was awesome and the portability of my Vita made for a delightful experience. If you haven't played any of the other Sly Cooper games its ok, this is a great place to start. I highly recommend this for anyone of any age.
5.0	excellent product at an excellent price, couldnt have made a better choice, i recommend it to anyone looking for an HDMI Cable
5.0	With Disney's entry into video gaming, Skylanders left in the dust due to the engaging creativity of the players and the mixed realms of movie genres.
5.0	Pros    * Very, Very comfortable ear cushions.  * Durable, braided cable is a nice add and the adjustable part bends without breaking well.  * Adjusts well to all head sizes  * Amazing sound quality  * Easy access mute functions  * Separate game volume and chat volume controls easily accessible    Cons    * Microphone quality isn't amazing  * Livemix feature, frankly, sucks    All in all, this is a very great headset for the money. I've never personally used Astro A40's but I've spoken with people who have and they claim the 5XB rivals them. As far as the cons go, the microphone sometimes bugs out and makes my voice sound real quiet and choppy. It's enough for my teammates to tell me to fix my mic but it doesn't happen all the time. The Livemix feature is a really good idea but it gets pretty annoying. If a teammate breathes into his mic just a bit it lowers the game volume very low for longer than necessary. What could have been done was to lower game volume based on how loud your teammates/party members are talking on some sort of scale, not just lower the game volume to a certain point everytime someones mic opens up. This isn't a big deal though because you can easily turn the livemix off. These flaws are too petty to hinder the greatness of the headset and if you are in search of a new one, I would recommend to anyone trying this one out.
1.0	This is truly a great concept for anyone who wants to play their NES and SNES games, isn't it? It'll work, sure. Although, you should know - this console is poorly made and WILL easily break after a short time of continuous use. If this console works perfectly for you, great, but it's going to blow up in your face one of these days. No joke, my friend owned this console, and after playing it for a while (a few months of ON/OFF gaming), the console seriously started smoking, sparking, and after a few seconds, literally exploded (not like a bomb or anything, but you wouldn't want this small-scale Hiroshima - I know, not nuclear - in your house). The console literally exploded, and he's never played it since. Would you trust it after it nearly blew a hole in your wall? So he took the game he was playing out (which he says still works), grabbed a fire extinguisher, and put out the fire on his floor. This console is CRAP and you won't like it after you get a month's worth of use out of it and it starts deteriorating. All I can say if you buy this console is be very careful NOT TO PLAY IT, UNLESS YOU WANT A MINI EXPLOSION IN YOUR HOME! Just DO NOT BUY THIS CONSOLE! DON'T BUY IT! NADA! NEIN! NIET! NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
5.0	I purchased earlier versions of flight simulator.  This one is the best so far.  I used to fly single engine aircraft years ago.  This is as much fun as actually flying.  I got my private license but with the cost of fuel I gave it up.  I flew Cessna and Beechcraft aircraft.  If you want to learn how to fly this software is a good start.  I use a logitech joy stick but you can use a yoke with rudder pedals to simulate actual flight.  Find your local airport and fly out of it.  If you can afford it learn how to fly.
5.0	This product help repair and clean my old video game consoles like Super Nintendo,Nintendo 64 and I also open my Nintendo GameCube easily with out breaking anything I recommend to all who owns any type of Video game console like the ones I have or this others like DS and microsoft xbox and xbox 360 and ps3 and more. if you want clean or repair your systems and even you can repair your own cell and this tools will not be found on hard ware store and I recomend this Product Console Toolkit for all your repairs and cleaning also for upgrades.
5.0	Got it on time no damage and it works fantastic
5.0	Using this cd key with the current version of APB will grant you two free lifetime weapons and premium for a month.
5.0	This is one of the only games that my family has all enjoyed playing on the computer.  It is a very simple concept compared to today's computer games, but it has some historical facts in it, and it can be completed in a short amount of time.  We did not like to newer versions of the game, only this one.
5.0	I bought this because I remembered most of the great things that where on this game. It is so fun playing and solving the puzzle and getting trough the obstacles. Highly recommend.
5.0	These are fantastic headphones. The cost is just a bonus!
5.0	Quite simply, this game is impressive. It could be described either as a puzzle-solving/adventure game with shooting, or as an action game with plenty of puzzles to solve. I found myself continuing to play just to see how the story would unwind; the characters and plot have more depth than the last couple of Indiana Jones movies (I kept thinking what a great movie this would make as I was playing it). And I'm not a big online player, so I appreciated the fact that this game gives you about 12 to 15 hours of play in storyline mode. I'm now playing it for the third time, on the hardest mode (which is only harder because your character doesn't recover as quickly from injury during fighting; none of the puzzles you have to solve--whether aligning artifacts or finding a way to climb across open spaces--seems to get more difficult as you increase overall game difficulty). And I haven't even gotten started on the graphics or snow effects, which are amazing.
5.0	I played this game as soon as the mailman dropped it off! I played the short version and loved it.  The graphics were clear and fun.  I am going to enjoy playing it again.
5.0	Gkids love it. Just wish we could find a reasonably priced Kaos crystal ...
5.0	Great item-Great price. Super fast shipping!
5.0	Great game, works perfectly (:
5.0	I bought this for a present and it was pretty cool. It glows good in the dark and fit like a glove on the controller.
5.0	I gave this 5 stars because of the rigidity of the cymbals. I play pretty hard on them and they haven't failed me yet. One thing everyone should be aware of is how to install. For the first few days I couldn't get them to stay clamped, but later realized I didn't have them snapped into place ( should be no gap in between the clamp). I'd recommend this to anyone who wants to add a realistic feel to the game.
5.0	Cheaper price than Wal-Mart, Target, Game Stop, and Best Buy.<br /><br />Not a bad price and works perfectly fine for the 3DS. I say go for it if you are in need of an extra charger.
5.0	Gives you lots of ports to charge from.  With a camera and all the controllers you run out quick.
1.0	Game could be fun,  but thanks to crappy uplay, it won't let me play the game. Glad this was only $10.
5.0	Game was delivered on time. Great product
5.0	"When u get an xbox the 1st game u have to get is Halo, it is the high point of the system, the graphics are absolutly beautiful and and seamless and the back grounds do not look fake at all like in other games, the enemies actually talk and yell and scream at you, its totally believable.<BR> <BR>You can play through the game as a single player, or (and this is the best part) you can play through the whole game with a friend side by side, it rules!<br />Another cool part is you are not just limited to human weapons, you can pick up dead enemy weapons like plasma rifles and plasme grenades that stick to the enemies and then they run anround screaming \\""aaahhh! get it off me! get it off me!\\"" its awesome!<br />The finaly best part is that u can pilot both human vehicles and enemy vehicles both of which have awesomely powerful weapons like fuel rod cannons and 90mm hyper velocity tank guns. You can pilot tanks and jeeps and alien hovercraft and assault flyers.<BR>Theres also alien tanks and drop ships and human dropships and fighters, its defiatly one of the best parts of the game.<br />In all i know i sound like a crazy game fanatic but i know what i am talking about when i say this is the best game you can get for the xbox."
5.0	Great seller, will use again.
5.0	Love #3. The quest games and improved graphics are a blast. I also like the secret games. I tend to play Butterflies or Diamond Mine the most but all are enjoyable.
5.0	My son LOVED this game
5.0	If you grew up on the original Street Fighters like I did you will not be disappointed by this sequel.
5.0	My grandson's favorite Christmas gift!
5.0	"This is a great game for the whole family.  The games and challenges are well thought out, and it is difficult to break away from.  Go Vacation is from the makers of \\""We Ski and Snowboard\\"", (which is also a must have game).  There is much beautiful scenery to explore on jetski's, ATV's, snowboards, horseback, etc., and you might just find yourself getting distracted from reaching the next activity you are trying to find!  I would not hesitate at all to get this wonderful Wii game.  If you are not convinced yet, check out the games website at govacationgame.com and also search YouTube for:  Go Vacation Wii"
1.0	My 13 year old son pounced on this product like a ninja.  It's been four hours and we've not heard a peep out of him in the game room.<br /><br />After wafting a slice of pepperoni pizza under his nose, he surfaced to give me his review.<br /><br />Good sound quality and compatibility with Xbox.<br />Due to the design, it eliminates background noises as well as a parent's plea to empty the trash.<br />Snug fit ensures this.<br />He loves, loves, loves the microphone.  All of his friends said there was no static or mumbling<br />It's comfortable<br />Likes the wireless aspect<br />Easy to start using right out of the box.<br /><br />ETA:  I have downgraded this from 5 to 1 stars. This microphone broke with no apparent reason. The actual earphones stopped working a two weeks ago. We have tried several times to contact Turtle Beach customer support but there has been no response. Save your money and buy another brand.
1.0	the only good thing about this is that the shipping was very fast, got here in 3 days but alot of good that does when IT DOES NOT WORK. followed the directions word for word, picture for picture AND my dad did it and hes a construction worker so he obviously knows what he is doing with a soldering iron. wasted about an hour and 15 minutes of our lives because there is so much soldering to deal with. the wires suck they rip all the time. oh and i cant forget that the button broke within 10 minutes cause its worth about 5 cents. DO NOT BUY. yes i want a mod and i dont feel like spending 70$ + for one but its worth saving for, 1 you know it will work for sure and 2 its already together so it wont take over an hour of your life away.
5.0	Great story, great gameplay ,I loved this Game When I was  in third grade and as a high school student I still  I love it now. The story will last you a long time and want you beat  it there will  still be many things for you to do and explore.
1.0	"This is the PS2 - PS3 scenario repeating itself ALL OVER AGAIN. The same way to the PS3 will never measure up to the PS2, the Vita is milestones away from its predecessor. The most powerful systems have never been on top through out gaming history, & history repeats itself once again. What did the PS2 have that the PS3 didn't? God-like 3rd party support! But not just that! It had the most important aspect of all, BALANCE! Power means nothing to a game console. Games mean everything. Attracting people with power instead of gameplay mechanics and games is the easy way out, & it's the route Sony is taking. On The PS2 you could get ANY type of game, literally. It had all the different genres, & the best in their respective fields. It's why the PS2 was so successful, it appealed to everyone. Western styled gamers got their fix of sports, shooting, and racing, while us Eastern inspired gamers also got our fix of jrps, strategy, & weird over-the-top japanese games.<br /><br />PS2 had it all, as did the PSP. Heck the PSOne had it as well. Nintendo had me by the horns in handheld gaming til the PSP showed up. Best portable gaming system ever made. The PSP had the same support PS2 did. ANY type of game you could think of, in abundance, & top quality at that. The PS3 however instead of staying 50/50 like it's predecessor did, it went something like 85/15. Could even be worse than that. The eastern-ispired library for the PS3 is so tiny I could count it on my hands and feet. Sony has gone almost full-swing westerner, over flowing their systems with the same type of games over and over. They've realized the average westerner is narrow minded and would play the exact game over and over if it had a gun in it or followed up on sports. Western gaming ain't going very far in terms of variety, & now you have the biggest franchises over here being shooting and football games etc, with Sony putting out statements on how \\""that's the market now\\"". It's not that the market for eastern-inspired games ain't there anymore, it's that Sony's following the money trail.<br /><br />The Vita is the same thing. Compared to the PSP it fails hard. Yeah it's powerful, Sony's stuff will always be powerful, but as we can see, they won't always be the best. The Vita could rightfully be called the best portable media device ever made, but not the best portable gaming system. The good games are so few and variety is as dull as the PS3. It's a portable replica of the PS3's mistake. I had high hopes for the Vita but it let me down big time. There aren't enough good games to go around. No wonder it's jam packed with all that other non-related gaming stuff. Now as a result devs are getting lazy/sloppy knowing they can do the same things over and over and make a fortune. Go back to your roots Sony. Push for variety. You're dominating one market but you're failing severely in the other. This is not the Sony-way we have all gotten to know & love.red games ain't there anymore, it's that Sony's following the money trail.<br /><br />The Vita is the same thing.

5.0	Disassembled my old 360 hard drive and placed it inside the housing. Worked like a champ. Its been about 3 or 4 months and still holds very strong. Bought a second one for my brother in law as well. Highly highly recommended.
1.0	1) Game will not run under a 64-bit OS.  2) Game requires activation to function.  If I had known that I would never have gone near it, I flatly refuse to own software that I need special permission from ANYONE to operate.
5.0	"Have you ever spent a Saturday night watching old Disney movies or spending hours playing Final Fantasy games? Well if you said yes to both questions (or just one) this is the perfect game for you. You play as a young boy named Sora living on Destiny Island. Even though he lives on an island most people dream of, he wants to leave his little home, along with his pals Riku and Kiari, and discover what mysteries are waiting for him. One day, while working on a raft that they hope will get them away from thier floating prison, Sora falls asleep on the beach and you step in and help discover the adventure that will keep you playing until the credits roll. That same day, there is great hubub at the Disney Castle. King Mickey left and left behind a note telling Donald to take the Gummie Ship and go to Traverse Town, find Leon, and get him to help find a \\""KEY\\"". The Gummie ship is the space ship you take from world to world. That night a storm hits Destiny Island and Sora goes out to find out what is going on. He finds Riku, but all he has to say is \\"" This is our chance Sora. We may never come back to this island but it's our only way. I'm not afraid of the darkness!\\"" and he dissapears leaving Sora with some wierd sword called the \\""KEYBLADE\\"". His island is destroyed and Sora ends up in a place called Travese Town and meets up with Donald and Goofy. What starts out as a quest for three friends ( Mickey, Kiari, and Riku) turns into somthing much more when Malifecent makes a plan to unleash all evil."
5.0	It's just what I wanted, thanks
5.0	This worked out perfectly! It was in-stock and shipped in great time. With a bit of prompting from a family member I knew this was the right one to buy. Everyone is happy!
5.0	This product does exactly what I bought it for, To protect my 3DS XL from scratches. Now this wont protect it from any drops, but it does protect it from any nasty scratches.<br /><br />If you are looking for something to protect from drops then you might wanna consider buying a wrist strap. Otherwise if you are very careful and are just looking for hardcore scratch protection then this is what you want.<br /><br />Secures to the 3DS XL really well and also has a nice felt looking material to cushion your 3DS XL from the case itself.
5.0	Very fast shipping good item good good good
5.0	perfect fit and feels much better.<br />after getting use to the feel and comfort, you don't wanna go back without them.
5.0	I personally don't use this, but the kids do and they are happy.  It isn't broken yet.  That's saying something.  Good price here on Amazon.
1.0	They completely fell apart after very little use. Can not recommend this very cheaply made and poorly designed item. Even duct tape and super glue are no match for these. DO NOT BUY!
5.0	It is what you buy! Nothing hidden. Although it tends to drift to the left a little... nothing to much. Nice quality and it comes on time and well padded. All in all a good buy.
5.0	"I've played this game a few times now and truly believe it is the best of all the installments.  <br /> <br />The graphics are amazing. The characters look so life-like, even their clothes move along with the wind currents and the fabric looks so real. Tha backgrounds are among the best in Tekken as well. 5/5 <br /> <br />The game's music is... well, Tekken like. They set the mood with the backgrounds and fully immerse you in the fight. I love! the intro theme's.  4/5 <br /> <br />The story line continues after Tekken 4. If you've played all the games, you truly feel like you've been a part of everyone's adventure personally. All the fighters have their own reasons to fight and make you emotionally attached to them. This is one of the best fighter franchises' out there, right along with Street Fighter and The King of Fighters, even though they haven't had any SERIOUS games out for a while. (Capcom, where's CVS 3!?) 5/5 <br /> <br />The gameplay is outstanding. SOooo much better then Tekken 4. They took what was great about Tekken 3 and tag, and intergrated it with the pro's of Tekken 4 fighting. No more cheesy unlimited combo's like in tag, but not the bland fighting from Tekken 4. (even though asuka revives juns cheese, but I dont mind, you wont beat me anyways  ;-)  ) Every character has fantastic moves all their own. You have to master your own person to truly appraciate what they can do. Moves are easy to do and controls are excellent. This is my fav. reason for getting this game. Everyone has a chance without having to learn how to cut the cheese. Great for new-comers as well. 6/5! <br /> <br />Extra's are an \\""extra\\"" reason to keep playing even more. :-D With lots of unlockable characters and mastery chain to climb, you'll be fighting your little heart out. The changable outfits are such! a plus. Even though it's the first time they do this, I already want more outfit choices, lol. This game also includes Tekken 1, 2, and 3 along with an added game for Jin. 5/5<br /> <br />Overall, Namco tought of everything they could to please the fans, and we greatly appreciate it! <br />"
5.0	This reminded me of the feeling of awe I got from the N64 Mario.  It's just perfect.  I've played some of the 3D Mario's in between and they haven't been as satisfying.<br /><br />The graphics are beautiful, and game play tight and very satisfying.  I really don't know how they could improve.<br /><br />A negative:  All the crazy camera angles feats of gravity make some people sick.  I feel sorry for those people because this really is a masterpiece.
5.0	Witty, irreverent, and full of solid gameplay throughout, this holds up to this day as one of my absolute favorite GameCube titles, and the best Mario RPG ever made in my book. I would recommend it to anyone.
5.0	Not expensive and arrived reasonably quickly. Had no troubles with it thus far and hope not to. Looks nicely constructed.
5.0	Bought his at amazon due to the lower price than at electronic stores.  Has worked great so far with no problems.  We have used it for a couple of weeks now and couldn't be happier.  The wireless range is about 6 six and is awesome so you don't pull the cord our or sit to close to the tv, but it does need to be charged a little more frequently than I expected, but we play quite a bit.  I would recommend getting the charger, we plug into our laptop's USB for charging and that can get to be a hassle.  Overall it does what it is suppose to.
5.0	Works like a charm.  Might be expensive, but it is small and easy to use; pretty much just plug it into xbox and it auto installed it
5.0	Rock star has done it again!  They've knocked the game out of the park. The graphics are amazing and the world they've developed is second to none.  Bravo!
5.0	Timing was good and it p u t a smile on my son's face. Will b u y from again
5.0	awesome!!! great shipping time and received in great condition.  we love using it.  so much fun.  makes us want to play ps3move more! great price!
5.0	"This game is brilliantly fun, incredibly addicting, super rich, and the best multi-player experience of any console game.  This is the best game I have played in 20 years and ranks in my top 5 games of ALL TIME (on any system or computer).  This game is incredible.  Buy the \\""Game Of The Year\\"" edition t o get all the DLC included...  They are worth it."
5.0	My son says it is awesome...I am glad I bought it for him. The chargers are always charge up. No need to wait anymore
5.0	"hated what i called the title \\""OMG\\"" thing but is was fast and great, no complaints. thx"
5.0	I have been playing The Sims from the beginning and thought they had done just about everything but, The Seasons expansion pack is great fun. I love that they change into winter clothes and can have snowball fights and make snow angels. The new greenhouse and gardening skills are fun as well. What else can I say, this is by far my favorite expansion pack and I have them all.
5.0	I'm autistic so this is a must have
5.0	honestly , I couldn't resist the price ! and it's really good and hard , made from good materials , but I had to cut the inside hold thingies , cuz I thought it could scratch the screen !
5.0	I've only owned the PS2, as Gran Turismo is the family video game since the PS1. Being a moto nut, I got Namco's MotoGP2 and 3, and while they're better than nothing, I kept wishing they could've been more like SBK2001 for PC.<br />I was aware that Moto GP for the Xbox had gotten rave reviews, but there was no way I was going to spend $300 for another console, so I tried to ignore its existence. I couldn't help read the reviews anyway, but they're pretty generic and avoid comparisons between the Xbox and PS2 games (don't want to bite the hands that feed). The few remarks I could find on the net that directly compare the games were brief, and sounded like the usual console partisanship. Anyway, my curiosity (and the $179 price) got the better of me and I finally got an Xbox just for Moto Gp 2.<br />I realize now why the comparisons are so brief: there's no comparison.<br />All the best stuff from SBK2001 is there, with better graphics, sound and control. The common thread between Moto GP 2 and SBK2001: Climax developers (THQ is the publisher). There seem to be some serious moto fans in the company, and the result is a real joy to anyone who has any interest in bikes (or an appreciation for apexes). You really have to hand it to Climax--they've managed to create a game that is true to the sport and is also very accessible to the unfamiliar.<br />At first, I was reluctant to learn a new controller setup for the Xbox game, but I can't imagine playing Namco's game ever again. At identical prices, the Xbox is a steal compared to the PS2, if Climax's Moto GP 2 is any indication of the quality of Xbox titles.
5.0	This is one of the best games I've played in a while. Note a few things:    1. You need a good computer to run it (at least a good video card). You don't want to run this game at minimum requirement. My computer is about 3 years old and had AMD Athlon X2 4400+ 2.2GHZ, 2GB RAM, ATI Radeon X850GT 256MB VRAM and had to play it on low video settings. The game is still fun but I had to put up with annoyances like invisible enemies shooting at me (they're made to fade if far to boost the game's performance). Then I decided to buy a new mid-range video card (ATI 4850 512 MB RAM) and viola! can run the game at high video settings, no more problems and strikingly more beautiful graphics and effects.    Yes even with ATI HD 4850 512MB i can't run the game smooth enough at ultra(highest setting) in 1280x1024, this game is a beast. But high setting is good enough for me.    2. If you experience crashing. Make sure you get the latest update from Bethesta. if that still doesn't work, most likely you have conflict with a program called ffdshow. look it up online.    3. If you experience skipping music from your pip boy radio (radio music are supposed to play smoothly), most likely it's ffdshow conflict again. look up solutions online.    4. Patches are released periodically so most bugs are fixed since its release. This is a sign of a dedicated game company.    5. I've played the original fallout 1 and 2. I was skeptical about fallout 3 but the game has thus far exceeded all my expectations and leaving me hungry for more. Buy this game, make it a commercial success, so Bethesta will make more expansions and, eventually, Fallout 4.
5.0	this is a must buy!! It has full 360 degree, 3-D, exploration (movement). You ve seen the playstation version, well here it is again, better than ever, becuase its the same graphics, possibly even better,  but on a handhled, amazing!!! if this doesnt keep you occupied for hours even days, possibly months... THen nothin else will, guaranteed. Overall, fantastic graphics, unbeliveable gameplay, and good value.
5.0	It just takes a bit to get used to using it because any slight move makes a difference but still a lot of fun.
5.0	Love the game! Disk was in perfect condition. No scratches, marks, or fingerprints. Would recommend!
5.0	Keeps your interest, puzzles make you think. The Babysitter game is the most interesting, not the usual seek and find.
5.0	WOW I bought the XLC's a couple months ago and the inability to adjust the chat volume was a deal breaker that I did not find out until I actually got them in the mail. The X11 are a VERY great deal. The mic on this thing is spectacular. I love the feature were you can hear yourself when you talk into the mic. Its like talking to a brick wall in a tiny room. The audio quality vs the XLC's are superb. You can hear many more tiny little sounds in the background much more than the XLC's.
1.0	The game is awesome! but I couldn't play at all because the cd didn't work, it had scratches and my xbox couldn't read anything. The worst part is that I live outside the U.S. and couldn't do anything for return it. I lost my money.
5.0	This game was bought for my son. He anticipated the release of this game forever. He loves it. He got a new steering wheel and pedals for the computer at the same time, and he plays this game all the time... It rocks!
5.0	I raise so many animals.  this is something for you-- everyone will like it and like to play.  I have a farm what has cows and pigs, and then I have a little baby!  I know some people say this is not a good game but man, i don't know i think it is really good and fun.  This might be a good to get if you want to have a little baby too and pigs and have a wife.
1.0	Advertised as being released in 2008 but it was Version 2 which came out in 2002. Works on my PS2 but when I enter in a code it freezes every time. I've been through too much hassle over all this GameShark nonsense so I'm trading in everything to a local game store. I'm sick of it all. Would not recommend it.
5.0	Couldn't have a better story or graphics put over 100 hours in this game and it still amazes me
5.0	great game not too difficult but take some time to play
5.0	Before you judge my title, just realize I've had since October 20th, 2009 to think this through. About a week after that date I determined this was my all-time favorite. Still is. If it's any reference, some of my other all-time favorites are Shadow of the Colossus, Halo 2, Metal Gear Solid, and a number of other treasured classics.     A big part of Borderlands is it's style. I love movies, so everytime I caught a reference I smiled to myself. Though most people don't play their games for the style. Borderlands plays like Call of Duty. Controls are identical if memory serves. The gameplay is satisfying, as is acquiring the latest in-game loot. The constant stream of better weapons, shields, and so on keeps things motivating. I don't want to know how many hours I have on the game...     If it is a game you like, it will give you your money's worth. And for $15 how can you go wrong! Seriously! The add-on content is also worthwhile. While I enjoyed the second installment (The Underdome) it may not appeal to most gamers. All in all there's no reason to pass this up. It's cheap, it's good, and there is so much content here! Loot away fellow gamers!
5.0	This game is stealing all my sleep!  As a fan of Civ and Civ2, I should have expected this... Alpha Centauri's improvements have added many new dimensions to the game.  One of my favorites is the modular style of unit  design.  In the past games, new technologiess simply allowed you to build a  new type of unit.  Now they give you the ability to create a new type of  chassis, weaponry, abilities, etc. that you can use to design your own  units. Your engineers give suggestions, but you can customize to your  heart's content. <br />In addition, the interface with other factions feels  much more real. Part of the screen scrolls through pictures from the other  leader's life, making you feel like this is a real person with a history.   <br />But probably the most outstanding feature is the overall thought that  went into creating the technology tree.  Most of these are futuristic (or  state-of-the-art) technologies so there is impressive blend of logic and  imagination here.  (e.g: Non-linear Mathematics, Machine-Mind Interface,  and Homo Superior just to name a few.)   Anyone familiar with mathematics,  physics, or philosophy will find their interests stimulated greatly by this  game.
5.0	Bought this to replace my old, non-functional copy.<br /><br />Love this game. Good condition too. No more frozen cutscenes for me
5.0	Ok people let's get serious! This game rocks and this game sucks!  1. Take off the red crosses and put the game on hard. Then you got yourself a real World War II shooter. It will be more like Brothers In Arms: D-Day but with alot better graphics. If you keep the crosses on and put it on easy you can probably run through it in about 4 hours and then It won't be any fun.  2. Nothing new. Same old run and gun. Has only colt 45., a luger, Thompson Machine Gun, MP 40,and a Grewher Sniper Rifle. And guess what boys and girls you get to use a bazooka!!! Lame!  3. Horrible Story. Wait?! did it even have a story? I seriously doubt it. The music is just the same from the orignal games. It's good music but now it's just getting annoying.  4. Strong Multiplayer. Good Idea. No Vehicles?   5. Whatever Happend to Stealth and Strategy? Does Tom Clancy on the rights or something?  6. There should have been some parachute landings like Vangaurd and Airborne. That would have kind of made it more interesting.  7. Where did Battlefield 1942 Go?  8. I felt pushed all the way through it. I wan't options people! OPTIONS!!!   9. If you wan't a World War II game with options try Commandos Strike Force for the PS2, but just warning you it is difficult.  10. I love Medal of Honor and I really can't get enough of it. I know i was hard on it but i still gave it 5 stars. It was just helpful criticism. Hopefully EA can take it. It is fun though for a handheld. and it has great graphics. I wish they would remake Medal of Honor and Medal of Honor: Underground for the PSP. Those were great games and awsome stories!
5.0	Bought two of these for my son's computer.  they loved the blue light and according to them it is very responsive.  Bought this back in December 2012 and both are still working.
5.0	I picked this up for $17.99. I didn't want a full stereo headset, just one that I could hear in game chat on PS4. This did not dissapoint. It's  very well constructed, light weight, and extremely comfortable.  All of my friends say it is crystal clear on their end, and the voice communication  on my end is very good. I did a comparison with my Playstation bluetooth set, and this sounds better for chat, and the mic is far superior. I tried it out with the full Gane audio, and everything was very clear there as well, I just prefer my surround sound. The earpiece is ventilated, and you can hear everything around you clearly as well. The earpiece fits around your ear, and this will fit anyone's head, even if you have a giant head. It has mute, and volume, and will work with anything that has a 3.5 jack. I highly recommend this, you won't find a better deal, or more bang for your buck.
5.0	I'm completely in love with zumba! Amazing workout, they are so much fun to do, you will have a blast while getting yourself into shape! What more can you ask for! this is my kind of workout!!
5.0	This was a great gift for my son.  the mic is great, other people can be in the room and talk!
5.0	I like the black and gray scheme and the new 3.5mm headphone jack works great with my Turtle Beaches
5.0	Best purchase to date!
5.0	My wife bought this from Amazon for my birthday present.  Overall, this is a good AC game. There are plenty of side quests and optional objectives to help counterbalance the somewhat under-developed main story that is presented. Albeit the story is not bad, it lacks deep character development and genuine likeability of the main character as compared to the previous games; say compared to the Ezio trilogy.  However the pirating, naval battles, and fort battles help counterbalance this. One of my favorite things to do is to collect the sea shanties,  so my crew will always sing a different song while aboard the ship.  The mechanics are very similar to the old games,  most closely resembling AC3, although the movement is slightly more fluid. Overall, this is a wonderful game to test out your new PS4, and a great game to keep you very entertained and engaged.
5.0	"This game certainly lives up to the standards it set up in the first two games. In Ecco The Dolphin: Defender of the Future, Ecco must once again save the day, but now the game is up to 21st century expectations. If you have ever wanted to be a dolphin, this game is for you. I've spent hours on the first level alone, just jumping around and swimming. Levels are difficult as we expected and wanted, and the details are amazing. The movie-like plot keeps the player interested. Five stars, forever.<br /><br />5/08/05 Update:<br /><br />Gosh, I wrote this a long time ago. Would you believe, I still haven't completed this game? I do not think I made myself clear enough, this game has a near vertical learning curve. I've found that I'll play for a couple of days straight, and then put the game aside for a few months (or maybe it's been a year, I can't recall). I like that it's so difficult, however; I don't care for games that can be completed in just a few hours, that really limits the re-playability.<br /><br />Nearly all of the levels here are full immersion, meaning you can go up, down, left, right, EVERYWHERE. At the time, this was quite amazing. These days that's the norm, I suppose. There are still a couple levels though that harken back to the Sega Genesis days, that are flat and side-panning. It was a nice reminder of the old days, I thought.<br /><br />The only major negative I found in this game is the echolocation maps. Ecco, like all dolphins, has the ability to send out sound waves to \\""see\\"" the surrounding terrain as well as its inhabitants. Unlike in the first two games, this sound map does not show fish or, if I remember correctly, air pockets (when you're down in a cave). It only shows the curve of the land, if any is in the level, as well as sharks and dolphins. It also shows what looks like a little flashlight, which always points toward you; this is the exit from the level."
5.0	Grandson loves them. Uses them everyday with his Xbox.
5.0	This game is great! I have only finished Sweet Tooth's storyline, and I am completely freaked out by this game's story. I also like the theme music to it, &quot;Paint it Black&quot;, by the Rolling Stones. The enemy has really good AI and the two bosses are murderous. But do not show this game to the little ones, it has a whole lotta blood, gore, and the game's characters are quite vulgar and may be frightening in appearance. Otherwise, this is a perfect game for (mature) teens(like me), and adults!
5.0	These cables worked perfectly out of the box and are now going on about a year with no issues, excellent product.  It's so much easier connecting to your HDTV with these rather than the component cables.  Highly recommended!
1.0	I can't believe this product was ever released in this state of development.  Trust the negative reviews.  Clearly, the disc version was rushed to release for the holiday season to cash in on shopping dollars.  The game may be great in theory, but if it won't play on your console . . . it is no good.  Seriously.  Skipping.  Freezing.  Stuttering.  I am not kidding when I say it is unplayable.  I'm wondering if there will be some action against the company - it is THAT BAD.  Truly disappointed in Telltale Games.
5.0	This is easily the most entertaining racing game I have played in a while. I played NFS: Hot Pursuit and loved it. I played NFS: The Run and hated it. This one is my favorite, I am also a fan of the Gran Turismo series but lately this game has been taking up all my gaming time. You can be always online and have other players in your game session to race with or race against. You can also utilize other players to take on Police who are trying to bust you. You unlock your cars as you go through the story, which you can then purchase with points you earn from accomplishing different events(Hot Pursuits, Races, Time Trials). The thing I like the most is the upgrade system. If your favorite car is lacking on certain stats you can spend time putting points towards that cars stats(Durability, strength, top speed, acceleration, etc...) Also you can purchase weapons for your cars to use during your open world journey. There is also a completely different experience when you play as the police, who also have their own set of cars to unlock and upgrade. You will spend plenty of time with this game if you have a taste for fast paced racing!!
1.0	this is one to stay away from. the loading time alone is as frustrating as i ever have seen. the storyline wasn't near the others and could not get through the loading breaks...horrible game compared to the others!
5.0	Bought for our son. Love it works great.
5.0	this game rocks and is very addicting. however we had wire trouble after the first year and could no longer play it..i would totally get another one though. ages that played it 3, 5, and 30+
5.0	Epic game.  Had to get a 2nd license code.
5.0	Soul Calibur is back and better folks. If you thought Soul Calibur II was good then you'll love Soul Calibur III. New characters, weapons, and stages are included along with complete story modes for each character all with different endings. You can also choose which path to take leading you to different battles and scenes. <br /> <br />Gameplay: if you played the previous SC games you would know the basic controls. For those new to the series SC III's controls are pretty simple and takes about a half hour to an hour to get used to it but if you really want to master it you have to spend time learning all the various attacks. Its very addictive once you get the hang of it.the graphics are a little better than SC II and are better than any fighting game i've seen.The best fighting game so far for me.oh yeah and you can create your own characters which is really cool(wow i should have mentioned that earlier). <br /> <br />This is without a doubt, the best game in the series. Namco does an excellent job of keeping all the things people liked the same, and finding new content to increase the value. All the old characters are back, and some new ones too. You'll have no trouble remember the old moves if you've played the predecesors, and the new characters fit nicely into the story (if there ever really was one). I found this game to be a bit easier than the others on the hardest difficulty level, but you still need to know what you're doing to beat the hardest missions and single player matches. The new story mode seems a little pointless at first, but I quickly found it very addictive in order to unlock all the secret items and weapons. The story mode takes a long time to beat, with 20 unique chapters and plenty of Ogre Battle-style strategy. The strategy is pretty weak, but it's challenging enough to be fun. The best improvement in this game is the character creation, which allows you to make a very unique and very impressive looking personalized character. The only problem I had with this is that when you get all the cool armor sets and weapons, there's really no reason to play any of the REAL characters. There were some balance issues with the new weapons and characters as well. Watch out for anyone using Kunai, they are unreal. If you really love bashing people w/weapons then this is your game!
1.0	What a let down, after installation I had to endure one game program problem after another.    Game will not respond to commands.  Game will not stay centered on my computer screen thus denying me access to some command selections.  World view stayed blurry,and other visual problems.  Yes my computer has been upgraded with all the max memory etc.  All my other comp. games play well.  I do not recommend purchasing this game !!!!
5.0	Great game. Obviously more of the same gameplay wise, but the last five sequels have been about the same too. The graphics are nice and shiny. The 3D works well. I've never had a problem even when playing for a long time, although I know some people complain about it. Works great for local multiplayer. A good addition to the series.
5.0	This game has met my expectations and they were high after playing Okami.  Having partners really adds some new fun elements to the game.  And playing on the DS is perfect.  I'm playing it on the 3DS and no problems.
5.0	Gears of War is up on the very top of my all time favorite video games list. The graphics rocked, the story is amazing, the game play is super fun. LOVE THIS GAME!
5.0	Good game to play with family. Love it!
5.0	An excellent gift for any kid or adult. I recommend it , is great. It was in a state. Thanks
5.0	First off, let me start by saying I'm a big fan of the Modern Warfare franchise so this was highly anticipated. Pre-ordered it and had it overnighted.. GREATEST MODERN WARFARE so far.. I wish they would have kept it going with an MW4, but I guess COD Ghosts isn't so bad.. could've been alot better though!!
5.0	Good game tbh, way better than destiny.  Honestly already played for a few hours and definitely going to play for hours more.
5.0	"This game is challenging for everyone, but it *is* OK for some kids.  My 5 year old can't get enough of it, and would play all day every day if I let him.  He has only gotten about 1/3 the way through the game, though, and then is perfectly happy starting back at the beginning next time.  Gives him hours of fun.  He's actually developed quite a skill.  I (the 30-something Mom) love playing too, but find lack of help at higher levels frustrating.  I've gotten about 60% through the game, and have gotten \\""stuck\\"" without any further instruction about where to go or what to do.  This is our first Xbox game, and we have all loved it."
5.0	This game is indeed a diamond in the rough. If you are new to Nintendo DS games and their library of games, you would not realize that there is a lot of shovel-ware being throughout out on the shelves of electronic stores. It is inevitable to happen to some systems. If you don't already know what shovel-ware is, let me tell you; shovel-ware refers to horrible soft(ware) that is sold out on the market. Games that nobody would pay to play, but with a nice looking cover, they get tricked into buying. So, now you know that, let me just say...this game is the farthest thing from it. Disgaea DS is originated from the Playstation 2, by the company Atlus. You play as the Prince of Darkness, and complete a set amount of missions. It is very hard to explain this game, due to its depth and creative system of playing. Let me put it this way, it is a funny and awesome turn based role-playing game/strategy game. One you would find hard to put down. The music is a huge improvement from the PS2 version, and the gameplay seems much cleaner and more intuitive. This is a truly hard game to review, due to the depth and creativity of it. I just have to say, it's a definite purchase if you like turn based strategy/RPG games, Disgaea DS is a pure winner for you. Endless ours of fun! I have to give the game a 4.8 out of 5.
5.0	It was what I asked for ...good ._.
5.0	If you have a Wii already, I can't really say much that you don't already know. Having multiple remotes allows you to not have to keep passing a single one around when you have friends over who want to play, and I always have someone coming over any time I turn it on.
5.0	Works fine and perfect!
5.0	Ok this game PSO for Gamecube is an excellent game immersing storyline brilliant hybrid gameplay with a mix between real-time fighting and RPG. Don't get me wrong, this is an extremely fun game but frankly the saving feature is GARBAGE!!! Your files will get corrupted and you will lose ALL of your progress. The saving features are way too complicated. Also, if you buy this game and beat it and hope to trade it in forget it. Once the serial number and access key are entered into your system no trading post will accept the game as a trade in. Once again, good game but with serious flaws.
5.0	I absolutely love this game.  I grew up with the 1978 version of Battlestar Galactica, in my opinion the best version of the show.  Since I was a kid I dreamed of being able to fly a Colonial Viper and thanks to this game I finally can.  Having Richard Hatch and Dirk Benedict lend their voices to the game was a great treat.
5.0	This game is wonderful for the entire family from age four to 55.  We have all enjoyed it very much and have spent some good together laughing and talking and playing.<br />I am not sure that playing with all four players encourages domestic harmony though!
1.0	This is one of the worst games I have ever played.  I can not even begin to fathom how anyone can even remotely like this game.  Worst graphics of any game on xbox360 hand down.  I could only play three missions in single player before I put the game down with my judgment of to horrible to play.  Just one example I sat there for one minute pumping round after round of sniper bullets into this guys head, and he wont die, I soon figure out this is because he hasn't shot of his scripted rpg yet just like very action you do in this game.  I hope THQ goes out of business for releasing something that should have been canceled.
1.0	Well I just received my brand spanking new PS4.I live in Israel and had a friend ship it to me express so that I can get it in time for the holidays.I have to say that as a day one PS console owner this has to be the smoothest and best experience with a Sony console to date.The user interface is extremely fast .Also the games look magnificent in 1080.Not many games out but Resogun is nice for free.<br />Plus my bundle included BF4 so I`m sure I can keep busy with that for the moment until something else catches my interest.Best part of it all no BLOD.I have been worried since the 15th until now.The packaging by Sony and Amazon was quite on the cheap side.I am pretty sure a lot of broken PS4 because of this.Well if you like Sony consoles I can guarantee the PS 4 will not disappoint.*******EDIT***Ok I`m going to edit this review because since yesterday after a week of working fine my ps4 starts shutting of with no warning.I don't get no blue light or red light it just cuts of after 5-10 minutes.<br />First it did it a couple of times than it got progressively worse.As before I shipped my ps4 to Israel.I paid duty ,taxes and a lot on delivery to get this system over here.<br />Amazon gave me a refund instantly all I have to do is ship the unit back.Sony pretty much told me to f-off since the unit is no longer in its region and will not send it to any other service center.I will have to pay shipping there and back again.They actually had the nerve to tell me they didn't sell me the console and that its not there problem take it up with Amazon.Customer service manager was very rude and really didn't care anything about my situation.Well if you think you are in the clear of a faulty console just keep in mind that your console may just die at anytime.
5.0	"I had been looking for a case for my DS that looked grownup and stylish and after much looking I finally found this. It fit my DS Lite, when I upgraded it didn't fit my DSi (It was too long, so I couldn't snap the inside closed) and now fits my 3DS perfectly! It's very pretty as well as being sturdy and well made. The inside has a large pouch for the DS with a snap closure to make sure it wont fall out. It also has inside 3 elastic band to hold extra stylus' and 3 elastic pouches to hold games, I can fit 2 games in each pouch but 1 fits better. I like that it is small enough to fit in my purse without lugging around a big case and I can take a few extra games with me. This is by no means a case to solve your game storage problem, but a great \\""take along\\"" case. I only have one small problem with this case and that is that the button on front that the leather loop goes around to keep it closed has become somewhat loose and I'm concerned that it may fall off soon; but I have had it for 3 years and it still works great, just a bit dirty so I am going to buy a new one!"
1.0	Boring game. Lost interest within minutes.
5.0	The Armory game controller rack functions as promised.  It is easily wall mountable and holds 360 and PS3 controllers quite firmly.  Definitely worth $19.99 plus shipping.  It is the only product of it's kind on the market.
5.0	This game is awesome and solid. Not only does it combine gameplay stratigies from the first two Sonic games(i.e rails, and attacking with Amy), the tag feature adds a whole new dimension. There is the Chao missons that let you get special stage access.My advice: Dont give up. The sound and graphics are pretty good. Game speed also runs about the same as SA 2. It runs fast and furious in some places. Other than that, hardcore Sonic fans, like myself, will be hooked on this game for hours. It might take some time for others, but I garentee that with you, you just might enjoy it.
5.0	POWER A MOGA Pro Mobile Gaming System for Android Smartphones - Retail...<br />POWER APOWER A MOGA Pro Mobile Gaming System for Android Smartphones - Retail...<br />POWER APOWER A MOGA Pro Mobile Gaming System for Android Smartphones - Retail...<br />POWER A
5.0	Got a used one for $40 and it works perfectly. I recommend trying to get a new one or a used on that comes with all the goodies(cords, controller, etc..). Plays good, and hits me right in the nostalgia gland every time I turn it on. Good investment.
5.0	GLAD TO FIND RARE CLASSIC GAME
5.0	My kids, ages 9 & 7 LOVE this game!  They like that it's challenging and takes a long time to play, but not TOO long. (They don't get bored with it.) The game has different chapters.  Within each chapter, there are levels of play that go from easier to harder, and you can skip levels if you want.  You can save your game to play later.
5.0	"I have no problem with my Arcade, It was manufactured on March 16 2009, and It has 512 MB (internal), everything is OK. buy with confident. A friend of my bought the \\""Elite\\"" version that says Halo and Fable, May 2009, it is a LIE!!!, It was manufacturer on July 2008, be aware on this, if you really want a JASPER, buy an ARCADE to be sure."
5.0	Favorite series since PS2 and this allows me to play all the VITA games and PS2 games as well as GOWIII on my PS3.....what's not to love?
5.0	One of the best games of all time, with some extra features and improved graphics. Helps when playing on HD screens. Love it
5.0	I cannot rate the gamepad screen protector since I already had a protector applied prior to purchasing this product so my rating is strictly for the carbon sticker.<br /><br />The carbon sticker is fairly easy to apply (some areas will be exposed).  The main purpose for the carbon sticker is to protect the gamepad from scratches and smudges and that is why I purchased the product.  No more wiping down the gamepad after each gaming session.  No more having to worry about accidentally scratching the glossy surface.  It is simply the best protection for the gamepad, but it is not meant for protection from accidentally dropping the unit, you will need a rubber (or silicon) protector for that.<br /><br />Overall I am very pleased with the product and highly recommend it to anyone who is concerned about getting sratches on the gamepad or those who are annoyed with smudges and fingerprints.
5.0	PS4? Need a dock? just get this, it's awesome. Put your remote on top, push down, click. It's locked in place. Push down, click, it's free for gaming. I love it.
5.0	This game is cooooooooollllll!!!!!!!!!!!!! its exciting and fun. <br />many kids would love this game because the 3-D animation is great and it shows teamwork.
5.0	"I love the game, and I won't be reviewing it so much as the \\""Hunter Edition\\"" package.  The comic is nice, but very small.  The other junk is just that, including the reason I went for the Hunter Package:  The Life-sized facehugger.    I would call this thing life sized for a small baby... maybe.  It's tiny.  Also, mine came broken, in three pieces.  Its only saving grace is that at least the fingers on it came with little metal wires inside, so they can conform to any shape.      In my opinion it should have been 2-3 times larger to be \\""Life-sized.\\"""
5.0	This is a game that any hardcore fan must get.<br />It is one of the original Red / Green games only released in Japan.
5.0	its great makes my daughter happy because its keeping her system from scratches just waiting for a game system carrying case
5.0	Mincraft is the best game. It is difficult and easy.
1.0	It doesn't sync to my wireless controllers and the drivers disk doesn't have compatible drivers for Windows 8. It wasn't  worth the money.
5.0	was so glad to have got this game, i play it all the time and its too bad ass. all the tunes are kickin and its way fun specially when your buzzed
5.0	"Ouya fairly work's, for a cheap version of\\"" a google design ugh analogy of not so.. and fairly well of it's own... I say give it a android gaming mind of thought !!! it is  nearly needless too be push:as nor for a bitching and complaining, in a fairly reasonably wrote-out, of phrasing!"
5.0	Just what I was looking for! Perfect! Just as pictured! Great find, great price! Arrived promptly. Just as advertised. Would definitely recommend.
5.0	AMAZING!!!!!  Did not play on ps3 but was first game I got on ps4......graphics are NICE.....and online multiplayer is intense.......
5.0	I haven't gotten very far in this yet, because i haven't made much time to play it yet, but graphics are great and what I have played looks great. It's a little weird at first playing as a bigdaddy though.
5.0	We have always liked to play angry birds and this game was thought to be like that, but turned out to be comparible to mario party 8 which we really enjoy.Overall a fun game!
5.0	This mouse is a GREAT mouse. As a computer gamer ill let you guys know. For this cheap of a price I really cant tell you how much its worth the money :D<br /><br />- Has BRIGHT lights<br />- Soft Plastic coated feeling (hands dont get sweaty )<br />- 3 modes for your speed<br />- long thin cord<br /><br />THis mouse IS WORTH every penny.
5.0	The kids installed it, so that means it was easy to do! They can now play some of the old xbox games as well, an added bonus when buying the name brand. Yes, it is more expensive than some other I have seen, but sometimes you do get what you pay for.
5.0	FANTASTIC. A must-have for anyone with a big living/gaming room.
1.0	The game is extremely complicated and takes the fun out of using it.  This will take so long to master, only people with a ton of patience, not to mention hours and hours of free time, will enjoy it.  Thumbs down for me.....I was just looking for fun when I bought this, not a technical lesson in submarine sonar deployments!
5.0	This game awesome game it has some parts that the xbox360, ps3, and Pc did not even have I would highly recommend this game
5.0	Ever since this game came out, I've been seeing article after article about why this game's so amazing. I knew it would be good, but I didn't think it was gonna be THAT good. This is hands down, the funniest game I've played in my life! That lemons thing had me in tears laughing! Cam Johnson & Wheatley...The funniest characters in gaming if you ask me. The puzzles are challenging, and you'll feel like a genius for solving them.<br /><br />This game is DEFINITELY worth the money. I think it's roughly $30-40 right now. It's also 2 player online co-op. The co-op mode/story is separate from the single player campaign, so you'll get 2 completely different experiences. The co-op puzzles CAN'T be done by only 1 person, so you know those puzzles aren't in the single player campaign.<br /><br />The first DLC is free, and it's been nominated as the best expansion of 2011. I'm mad that I sold this game before the DLC came out. I hear it's amazing.<br /><br />I'd most definitely recommend this game. A G.O.T.Y. nominee for sure!
5.0	Ah, the classics.  It doesn't get any better.  This is a fun game cartridge with a good variety of classic games.<br />Pros: <BR> - Good selection of fun games.<BR> - Reasonable range of difficulty from so easy you can't loose to fairly challenging.<BR> - Reasonably good graphics.  It is sometimes hard to tell where you have previously shot because of the smoke from a burning ship in the Sink Ships game. The tiles in Mahjong are hard to see without a magnifier, but that can be expected with a game that requires so much small detail.<BR> - Controls are easy and very straight forward.<BR> - Keeps track of your wins and losses even after the power is turned off and the cartridge is removed.<br />Cons:<BR> - MAJOR FLAW! The backgammon game not only allows, but can actually force you to make an illegal move.  This can seriously affect the outcome of the game.<BR> - The music is fuzzy.  Even on low volume settings it sounds like you are over driving the amp., or have an impedance mismatch.  This is kind of annoying. <BR> - The computer takes its turn so quickly in backgammon that you can't even see what the dice roll was let alone follow the game play.<BR> - Backgammon does not have a doubling cube.  This is such an important aspect of the game that it really does detract from the game play.<BR> - It would be nice if you could take back/change a move that was made in error.<BR> - For those primarily interested in the backgammon game - it is pretty easy to win even on the most difficult setting.  It won't be much of a challenge, and tends to make you a sloppy player because you can get away with playing carelessly.<br />All in all, this is a good game cartridge with a lot of fun in store for almost everyone.  I certainly would highly recommend it.
5.0	My expectations for this game were very high, and it did not disappoint. It is the kind of game that makes you hold onto a generator of console just to play that one game.
5.0	Extremely fun and addictive. If you like games like Devil May Cry, the 2nd Ninja Gaiden game released on the XBOX360 this game is for you.
5.0	"Taking the setting of \\""our Zelda\\"" to its origins allows us to create the Legend. A masterful work of endurance and courage. A quest for fulfillment that spawns our own hopes into the sky."
5.0	The product arrived quickly and it is very efficient at its purpose. The product works very well, it does not make the size of the 3DS explode, and it provides good protection.
5.0	My daughter received this as a gift in 2008 and is STILL playing with it on a weekly basis. Never had any problems and has held up great. Even with years of abuse.
1.0	When I got the part in the mail and opened it, I saw that it was very well protected, but when I took it out of the countless layers of packing, I saw that it looked like they smashed the end of it where the ribbon cord sticks into .thank god I kept the original switch cause i easily took it apart and replaced the broken part from the original one with the new one. I advise to not buy from this company.
5.0	The Ps2 has been out for a while now but never lost its charm. It's a great system and has a little something in it for everyone. I have one and it's brought me much joy. The games available for this system is almost endless there are games ranging from final fantasy to pac-man. plus the new design is amazing its so small that you can take it anywere with you on the road, and yet it still retains all the graphics and sound capabilites as the first PS2.
5.0	I don't have the Director's cut ... got it when it first can't out .. I have 17 trophies left ..<br />Best game on the ps3 .
1.0	Bought it and was so excited because I have this psp i wanted to try. Didn't work on the first time, first day, and first second when I plugged it in. I nearly wanted to smash the shit out of it because to see if it was fake because the charger looks low quality. I don't recommend this shit so just buy your charger at a game stop near by you.
5.0	It was a gift for my grand son at Christmas he loved it.  It was what he wanted so ...... ;)
5.0	Spore is a great game. I was hesitant to buy this game after all the complaints about DRM here on Amazon.com, but the depth of play was so great I had to try it out. I am very glad I did.    With all the bad reviews I was very nervous installing Spore, figuring something would go wrong and I'd never get it to work, but it installs like a breeze. Getting to the space stage of Spore is a lot of fun, intense action. I will remember forever the feel of being a little tiny creature chased by a giant monster the size of Godzilla! Quite scary and funny! Or the fun I had using tanks and aircraft to get revenge on those same monsters in the civilization stage.    I feel safe saying that Spore is the biggest game ever made, with infinite replay value. Just zooming out in space stage and looking at the size of the galaxy gives me goose bumps. I can't wait to conquer them all! Even if it does take a few years of my life!    My few complaints, as there is always something someone doesn't like about everything, focus around the style of gameplay in the space stage. You go from commanding tons of units in the civilization stage, to just one ship in the space stage. This makes what is most important to me, combat, into a kind of arcade 2d shooter. It's still fun, but I can't help feeling the game would be more fun if you could somehow switch from one ship to controlling hundreds. Few minor annoyances, automated pirates/biohazards that keep popping up interrupting you, no way to know how much spice (where you get your money) is on a planet without flying to that solar system, and I really wish I could edit other empires on the fly. Kind of feel silly when you have to make an alliance with the bannana shaped people of Bannazam Empire because you're too weak to destroy them right now. Even though it does make it more fun when you do get to finally slaughter those stupid looking lifeforms. :D    Great game, I definately recommend it.
5.0	Offers more newer challenges than typical first person shooter games.
5.0	To this day I still play Zombies from it. Definitely got my moneys worth here. I consider this Zombies to be better than Black Ops II zombies as well.
5.0	Tekken: Dark Resurrection is awesome.  The gameplay is amazing, and it is by far the best fighting game on the PSP. <br /> <br />Graphics: 10/10 <br />There is no blur in the movement, the environments are all 3D and destroyable, and the characters are done crisply and clearly. <br /> <br />Gameplay: 10/10 <br />With an updated story mode from Tekken 5, it makes the game all the more interesting.  There are also different bonus games in addition to story mode, Tekken Bowling is the best.  Also, there is a new Tekken Dojo feature, which is very similar to the arcade version of Tekken 5. <br /> <br />Controls: 9/10 <br />The controls are a little weird at first, especially because it is so hard to hit buttons at the same time for different combos.  However, as the game progresses, it is easy to get used to. <br /> <br />Overall: 10/10 <br />Definitely the best fighting game on PSP, and excellent graphics, Tekken: Dark Resurrection is an excellent addition to the PSP.
5.0	Amazing game bought two. One for my girlfriend and one for me. Online play isn't the best though.
5.0	Was an Xmas gift for my Grandma as she used to play my game boy color when I was a kid.She loved it. And still plays it everyday.
1.0	My son has been showing interest in my old Nintendo64 collection however I didn't have any decent controllers for it. After receiving this controller I still don't. I ordered 2 of these one grey one black. This one, the black ones, cable was a melted solid mass. I managed to pull it apart without totally breaking the wires plugged it in to the adapter I purchased separately for the computer. (I should mention here that I am a computer technician and my knowledge level on how electronics work is high level.) The sensors were jumping all over the place. The buttons were pressing randomly. I thought I might have just broken a wire in the cable when I separated the melted part. So I plugged in the grey one that did not have any melted cable. It did the same thing. After a thourough inspection inside and out. I have determined that these controllers are junk. They probably weren't that good brand new. I can only imagine they must of had these sitting on a back shelf in a hot warehouse since the 90's. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY!
5.0	If you liked the first one, then you are sure to enjoy this sequel.  The storyline is excellent, similar if not quite as deep as Torment.  Additionally, you get to import your character from the original and modify with kits, etc.  Some characters from BG1 were also added, blending a nice sence of history.  Some other aspects which are enjoyable are seeing your characters progress to quite powerful levels as the game progresses, and also to visit some of the legendary sites mentioned in Forgotten Realms lore.  The depth of character develpment is a great addition from BG1 and IWD, with the 3d edition weapon proficiencies and classes (the monk is cool) being a nice touch. A few detractors are on the software side.  Alot of people complain about lags and glitches, but I have seen very few of these.  I have a PII 266 with a vodoo3 and have very few crashes.  Additonally, I have a full install of the game, and experience very little lag.  If you don't have the space for a full install however, you might want to pass this by until you have a larger hard drive. Overall, an excellent RPG.  I can't wait for NWN and BG3.
5.0	The Product is perfect! Very Good game
5.0	shipped quick. just as pictured. good product.
5.0	I love this. Awesome product. I am really happy with this purchase. Definitely can hear people coming up behind me in CODBOP2 ^_^
5.0	Same as other, different attitude
5.0	Love this simulator. Realistically captures both the general boredom while navigating between way-points and the complexity / chaos of sticking a landing ... just like real flying (so I mean it in a good way). My kids like to fly through the St. Louis arch. I was also pleased to see that the Kings helped develop it. I used the King Ground School VHS tapes to prepare for the written test, many years ago.
1.0	I never received this and I'm glad I only spent a couple dollars on it.  I'm not sure why, but I still don't have my memory card.  Feel like I've been robbed, although I'm glad I didn't spend much on it.
5.0	Very highly recommend this game. It is really fun to play.  Got it for my kids for Christmas. Love it.
5.0	If you want a simulation of what it's like to be 'there' in a battle situatiion, in a virtual world that is as real as it gets 2001, this is the one.  I was waiting to be disappointed, I read all the bad reviews to get a feel for what was lacking (most were comments about online play), I was expecting a European production to be half-baked.  I was quite amazed at how well this was put together.  I have an AMD 500 Mhz, 128RAM, 16MB VooDoo 3DFX, and I have no problems with the play at all.  Many programs blow up when you switch between the Desktop and the game, this one I switched back and forth dozens of times (to save games the cheating way) and it caused no problems in Win 98, which is just short of a Miracle.  I now spend my hours of work chomping at the bit to go home to my Battle World and spend my nights dreaming of being in it.  Amazing Game shows us what it can be like, and what we can expect from future attempts at this genre.
1.0	Frankly speaking, Diablo 3 is a 3-star or 2-star mediocre game. I gave it 1 star simply because it bears the name of Diablo. Compared with Diablo 2, which I threw tons of time to, Diablo 3 is some game I've tried once and never touched a second time.<br />1. Boring and not flexible skill trees. In Diablo 2, it's an art to carefully choose the skill and add the stats point to customize your favorite build. But Diablo 3's skill tree leaves you so little space to build your unique char. Everybody's style is pretty much the same. Plus, the stats point is gone now.<br />2. Item drop. It's pretty much the same drop system as Diablo 2, but you don't tell a big difference between legendary items and blue items. You don't feel excited any more about a legendary drop. And, what's the meaning for normal item? In Diablo 2, we can craft items and rune items. But for Diablo 3, where are my runes?<br />3. Boring boss fights. The boss fights are much like WOW style. It has different stages. Nothing new here.<br /><br />Anyway, a big let down for me. I like Skyrim and Dark Souls much better for recent games.
1.0	"Normally, I would not leave a negative review about a product for this reason.  In fact, I would probably trash someone else for doing it.  The camera's cable is as long as it is and there is no promise that it will ever be extendable.  I have to break my own rule here since I think this needs to be said.  Most people (myself included) who may need an extension for their camera didn't even give it a 2nd thought since the PS3 camera is so easily extendable with a standard USB 2.0 extension cable (available everywhere in every length and color imaginable).  Then we come to find out that they changed the connector end and have no official or unofficial statement about how they plan to handle the considerable amount of customers who need an extension for this device.  Many have returned the camera for this reason or have it sitting unused until someone steps up and solves this problem.  Others (like myself) are a little luckier because I can plug my camera into my PS4 BUT I have to plug it in every time I want to use it because all my equipment is inside a cabinet and also have to unplug it when I am done so the door will close.  With an extension, the cable will run behind my TV into the wiring channel that leads to inside the cabinet and I can leave it plugged in all the time.  Anyone who wants to trash me for this, I consider it fair game.  I won't defend myself.  Please note that I waited until a month and a half after the release date to post this.  I wanted to give them some time to address to the issue.  I can excuse the fact that they (Sony) may not have been aware of how many people extended the PS3 camera since they didn't even sell extensions and tracking the sales of any USB extension cables would be silly since they can be used for tons of other reasons.  But they have certainly heard more than enough about this need by now.  How about just a little hope (\\""We are planning on releasing an extension cable for the PS4 camera in the near future\\"").    UPDATE 11/1/2014 - Finally got a cable.  I ordered it from Amazon UK.  Very bizarre, still not available on the US site and while myself (and others, as I can tell by reviews) were able to order it and have it shipped overseas, it is now listed as \\""can not be shipped to the United States\\"".  What the ????? is going on with this stupid cable?  It works.  It works perfectly.  From one review on the UK site, I did find out that you can not string 2 extensions together, so there is a limitation, but the one extension still DOUBLES the length.  In the mean time I found out that Best Buy has them for $20 here in the US.  Also, an FYI to anyone who said that any extension would be too expensive, even the one I got shipped from the UK was only $28 USD including shipping."
5.0	i played the whole game and beat it already. it was the perfect game. i got to play it because my dad is a video game designer and so i get to play all the unrelease games. i'm also playin final fantasy 10 at the moment and man that is a good game too. but when mgs2 comes out you should get it. buy it.
5.0	This is an extremely creative game. My daughter really enjoys the creature creator and my son likes the RTS aspect. It's really amazing what you can easily accomplish once you pick up a few of the tricks with the mouse. Hold down tab in the creator to get more options for adjusting the angel of how things attach. I doubt my daughter will ever play the main part of the game through the RTS stages, but she really enjoys the creator bits.    One other thing that's handy about the creator - and this applies to vehicles, boats, etc. as well as creatures - is that you don't have to be too fussy with placement. In other words, you can put a hand on your creature that's good at attacking, but you don't have to put that hand in a practical location for fighting. It may not seem intuitive, but it allows a significant level of creativity without worrying about whether or not your creature will be able to defend itself.    I just started playing it a few days ago and haven't gotten past the civilization stage. I thought the game might get a little too silly (lots of singing, dancing, etc - that's what I get for being an herbivore), but the civilization age had me running around like Warcraft.    I really enjoy the game so far and appreciate how broad of an appeal it has.    This is a 5 star game. I read a few reviews and they were all coming from people whining about the copy protection. Maybe people have had trouble, but I think they're just massing to make a political point. It'd be sad to see such a creative direction in gaming stunted so early for this reason.
5.0	I love seek and find games by popcap, I received the game just fine, the only problem is that i play them till I beat them and I have beaten this one already
5.0	I must say that Xenogears is by far the best RPG to date.  Sure, the final fantasy series comes close, but no cigar.  In xenogears, you can follow the story without falling asleep or being bored to tears.  In both final  fantasy VII and VIII, a certain point was reached where I had to stop  playing them for a couple months because i became truly bored with them.   This did not happen in xenogears because the story was so involving it  almost bugged me to have to get up and change discs.  It always left you  wondering what was going to happen next.  I had to play through the game  twice to get it completely figured out.  I loved the game because it had  everything you could want.  It has a confusing plot points that keep you  thinking well after that particular plot point is over.  The later parts of  the game onfold events that blow your mind but still make actual sense.   All of the characters have logical and justifiable reasons for joining your  cause which all are tossed out the window when it is realized that not only  pride or vengeance was on the line but a fight for their own existence was  at hand.  Someone once told me that music makes up almost half of the RPG  experience.  This holds true for xenogears as well.  When engaged in a boss  battle, the music changed and reflected that fact.  The same holds true  with the music that accompanied the dreams and flashbacks the various  characters experienced.  On a scale of 1 to 100, I give this game a 95.  It  loses five to my only complaint about the game.  That would be the terrible  job done with the dubbing on the animated cutscenes.  It was a little  dissappointing to see one of the high points of the game marred when you  notice that after the animated characters become silent, you will notice  their lips keep moving for sometimes an obvious 3 or 4 additional seconds.   As far as I am concerned, that is the only downside to an absolutely  terrific game that no role-playing gamer should be without.  To givethis  game 4 stars would be an injustice to this game, so i give it 5 stars.  If  tou like RPG's, then YOU MUST GET THIS GAME!
5.0	I bought this game when it was originally release way back in the day. To this day nothing comes close to what this offers. If you are a fan looking to rekindle the past or new to the series and have not played a RTS game before be ready for some excellent fun.<br /><br />Runs fine on my Mac running bootcamp Windows 7 at the highest settings. Not sure about Windows 8 as I don't have that yet.
5.0	I grew up in the days of Balder's Gate, Morrowind, Oblivion, Diablo 1&2......  Fallout 2 is definitely my most favorite game of that time. If any of you want to take a step back in time to see the history in the Fallout series, this is the best one to take you on that journey. Fallout 1 is hard to play after you've played Fallout 2. Fallout Tactics is a game play style unlike any other Fallout so I never got in to it. The first hour is relatively boring because you're simply learning how to play the game. BUT - as soon as you come out of the cave and hit Arroyo- the game unfolds incredibly. There's plenty of new and awesome games coming out that I will no doubt play however, this one will always remain in my arsenal. I will never forget how this game shaped part of my teen years and some day I will play it again to reminisce. To this day I still view new skills I learn in real life as perks ;) + more and more things I learn in the real world... I'm just gaining experience points! hah hah!
5.0	It got here in about a week - works as advertised. Shame it didn't come with the ps2. That was kind of sneaky on the part of Sony.
1.0	Yeah, the cut scene's looked nice, just like Call of Duty 4. Then it was said that the graphics were done with the Unreal engine, the same used in Gears of War.<br /><br />The game's cut scenes and menu were up to par with the PS3...but gameplay...no sir. I played the game for about 20 mins, then put it up for sale on Facebook. I love shooters, and would rather play the Orange box with all it's glitches and slow frame rates, than spend another second playing Unreal.
5.0	Granddaughter loved playing with the Woody Infinity character.  I would recommend this to anyone who loved Toy Story.
1.0	Arrived broken. Obvious issue with the IR receiver. I'm returning it for an exchange. Maybe round two will go better.
5.0	Works fine. Just like the original
1.0	I have a mixed review about this game, and the title of this review might sound familiar to some of you. But first the good:  1. They improved the graphics quite a bit in this game and the sound is just spectacular.  2. The missions are very fun, and the story really keeps you hooked up. Only bummer is that it's a little on the short side (+/- 4 hours)  3. The way killstreaks now work is pretty cool. You can have different killstreaks with each gun class and the ways in which you can customize these killstreaks is almost endless.  4. New game-modes are also a lot of fun. Hardcore Domination is definitely my favorite but there is also Kill-confirmed and many others which are very enjoyable. Anyways I didn't read the other reviews here but I'm sure many people already described these in detail.  Now the bad:  1. Matchmaking is terrible!! I did some research and apparently IW or Sledgehammer (not sure who is to blame here) decided it would be a good idea to hard-lock the servers so that when you try to search for an online game it will only look for matches in YOUR area. This is so ridiculous, since, if you're unlucky like me, you live in an area where there aren't many MW3 players online on the 360. Matchmaking takes anywhere from 2 - 10 minutes to find a game (even a simple team deathmatch)and sometimes it doesn't find one at all. Apparently IW is aware of the problem and rolled out an update (4MB on the Xbox) but this update did not change a single thing. I've also double checked my router/xbox settings and everything should be properly set up. Any other game I play online does so flawlessly including MW2/MW/BF3/BF2/BO/Halo:3/Halo:Reach/Homefront/FIFA...   2. Hackers!  I really hope this gets changed soon because this game is good, but it's not good enough to keep me interested if I've got to wait so long for a simple online match.
5.0	I enjoy playing all of Phantoms slot games.  They are more like the casino slots.  The challanges are fun to do.
5.0	The Product Came & it was not damaged. I have no dislikes at all. I would recommend this product to anyone.
5.0	it is fun because of all the knew tec. and the differnt knew men that they have in this command and conquer 2: Yuri's Revenge.
5.0	Just like it looks like, except i think the one that came in the mail was made in China and the one that came with my PS2 was made in Japan!
5.0	The original Borderlands was fantastic. I enjoyed playing it so much that it became the first game I earned a platinum trophy in. The mesh of RPG elements with FPS gameplay was done very well and the developers put so much creativity into the characters and story. I've only been playing the sequel for a week and I can see that this game is very much like the original but is more polished.<br /><br />If you liked the original Borderlands, you'll love Borderlands 2. If you never played the original, give this one a shot. You will not be disappointed.
1.0	"This game is a lot of fun, but shame on them for selling a game like this and neglecting to put out an adequate amount of DLC. They released one question pack. It was fun, but after a while the questions start repeating themselves. If they released new questions once in a while, I would play this game all the time. Since they promised DLC on the first game without delivering and only released one question pack for this one, I wouldn't recommend buying this game. If you want an awesome game that will only give you a month or two of enjoyment and leave you with some neat useless buzzers, then this is the game for you. If not, wait for a better trivia game to come out with more questions to download. I'm so disappointed with this that I refuse to buy anything else from \\""Scene it?\\"""
5.0	Just got it shipped today. Everything looks nice; which I'm real happy for. But did anyone else get their 1 month xbox live card? I thought it came with the purchace, or maybe I'm wrong. Can a buyer give me their input? I want to know if there is no card that comes with it, or if I just have to look harder in the box or something. Thanks.
5.0	This is by far the most fun WOW game yet. The quests to 70-80 are extremely fun with a lot of new content, including getting to use siege weapons and in game cinematics. The new pvp area and the new battleground are both extremely fun, focusing on siege weapons and defensive artillery instead of capturing a flag. Overall if you like WOW, have ever heard of WOW, or are alive, buy the Wrath of the Lich King. NOW!
5.0	Definitely does what its supposed to... just have to adjust to the new button layout :) easily inserted into the keyboard set
5.0	I had the original EA Active and enjoyed it.  But this one is even better.  It's clear that whoever set up these exercises knew exactly what they were doing. It's a good workout and it's fun so you are more likely to keep it up.
5.0	An incredibly deep and rich story set in a world that is original and filled with disney classics with a new combat system that outdoes the old one, sign me up!<br /><br />This game is a genuine classic and if you haven't played it you are missing out on one of the best games of all time!
1.0	At first I like the game, then little by little the details or bugs started to get to me.<br />The A.I. will know where you are wherever you go, once spotted. Even if you're not in line of sight and no stealth can save you even in night time once spotted. The other alerted enemies(alerted by your silenced pistol) will then fire incredibly accurate burst fire at range at your sniper who's hiding behind a bush(an obstacle that your sniper cannot counter shoot from even). Camo will not save you(it only seem to work before engagement, once engaged forget about it forever). Armor  repair removed, so it's useless after battles.<br />Your mercs will often not engage an enemy even if they are in guard mode, you have to manually tell them to attack the target,<br />which is a hassle if you got mercs spread across the map.(this is one of the main reason why the stop-and-go system is not very good for this game because you can't be everywhere at the same time to micromanage dumb mercs AI, an optional turn-based mode would have solved these problems).<br />Your merc would run out of stamina while running, enemies don't.<br />Cover works, but only for your enemies.<br />Infinite bullets, but only for your enemies.<br />Magic radar(once spotted), but only for your enemies.<br />Infinite healthkits, but only for your enemies.<br />Telling a merc to fire at a moving enemy could be a hassle.(if moving enemy move behind an obstacle, your order is canceled, even when the enemy show up in the clear again.)
5.0	I will never play my PS3 again without the grip, the sender sent it on time when they said it was gonna be here, I love everything about it, I will definitely be buying more when I get more controllers.
5.0	My wife and I have been playing this game for about eight years.  We STILL can't get enough of it.  The clever background dialogue (yes, it even talks to you) certainly enhances the awesome graphics.  Drawing a picture with a mouse is a bit challenging but some of the results can be downright hysterical!!  Definitely addicting - don't play at night if you have to be up early in the a.m.!!
5.0	This was for my son Scott. And he will be using it as soon as school is out.. come on summer
5.0	Very fun game. We play it all the time. My kids love it. I do to, no guns, hookers or any other bad stuff. Straight up racing only.
5.0	I am a tournament smash bros player and this works perfectly for me.
5.0	This bag looks great and has plenty of space for your ps3, I would recommend this bag to anyone who needs one
5.0	I have always liked the Battlefront series, but I had this game for the PS2.  I decided to get a copy for the Xbox.<br />The load time is next to nothing where the PS2 version took a little bit of time. Amazing game. Good graphic.<br />One of the best games (I think) put out by Lucasarts.
5.0	We had to replace old remotes worked without any problems. Used rechargeable battery from broken remote. Now our child's world is back to normal.
5.0	This device comes with a long cord for the actual charging device, I wished it just had the prongs to plug in directly into the wall.  The cord is the same one that plugs into the AC adapter/charger that comes with the PSP so it really is not a hassle to pack if you are on a trip.  It is an actual Sony product and not an OEM knockoff.  99% of the batteries you find here are cheapo knock offs but this appears to charge those as well.  The battery securely locks into the charger and is easily removed by pressing the tab at the top.
5.0	Half-Life is everything you would want in a game... graphics, control, weapons, not too many boundaries, and AN AWESOME STORYLINE!  I'm not even into Sci-Fi stuff, but I was sucked into this game.  Don't you dare use any  codes or cheats for this game, it'll completely ruin the game for you.  Buy  this game ... it is so worth it!
1.0	I bought this game because the trailer seem fun. I couldn't wait to play it. When I first started playing it was kind of fun. I thought it would get funner through different levels. I got to level 7 or so and the game kept getting boring and boring! You do the same in apart every level! So annoying! It's boring as hell. I want to sell my game but none of my friends want to buy it because when they played it at my house, they said it was the most boring game they've ever played, and literally I think it is. Save your money and don't buy it. But another game that is actually fun!
1.0	The disc was broke when we received it. I couldn't find out how to return it. Everything I found out about returns was for completely unopened products.
5.0	the tak serious of games are awesome; perfect way to get kids into platform games rather than shooters and other typical video games.
5.0	If your a Star Trek fan and enjoy the new series you'll love this game. Even if your not a die hard trekie you will still have fun playing this game. The game designers have created a fun and challenging game to accompany the new series. Great Job!
1.0	Doesn't work with my dongle.
5.0	Daughter absolutely loves it
5.0	If you enjoyed the first Assassin's Creed, you will really enjoy this one.  The plot and characters are interesting and the storyline moves along nicely without being redundant.  The graphics are spectacular.  Lots of optional side missions as well.
5.0	I've had guitar lessons, but felt bored playing crappy sheet music provided for lessons and didn't really feel like I was progressing fast enough.  This is a much more engaging way to learn to play.  This approach makes you feel like you're making music even when you're at the beginner level playing along with the much more simplified version of a song until you get gain enough skills to  automatically level up along the way.  Can't recommend it highly enough.
5.0	Yes, the game is so much fun. I love the story line & caracters, very good game.
5.0	I am a great fan of the Metal Slug series and I think they totally rock! But Metal Slug X surpasses all other titles, I mean can you find anything more fun than mowing down arabs with a machine gun clad camel! I think not! If you are wondering about buying this then wonder no more, buy it! buy it now! I'm sure you wont regret it!!
5.0	as described like new
5.0	Great comfortable mouse works great with no skipping and instant setup. Will turn itself off to save battery life but comes right back on if moved. I am on computer so much I get cramps or sore wrist but this mouse I have had no problems since I started using it.
5.0	This cartidge case or Nintendo  cartridges holds 6 games. You might want to order two. I ordered one and placed all my hidden objects games in one and ordered another one for my card/board games ie Scrabble, Wheel of Fortune, etc. You can see through the plastic to find the game you are looking for with ease. By the way the rating is excellent for this product.
5.0	Kids totally love it and product arrived on time as described!
5.0	Got what was described. What more can i ask for?
5.0	Many people have dissed this game, but after about an hour of playing it turns into a really good game. The graphics aren't up to standards, but they aren't that bad and they are a previous improvement over the previous games. Many things have been changed in this game, and if you just want another MMVIII, then you won't probably won't like it. But in my opinion, this is the best Might and Magic of them all. It is fun, addictive, and worth the money. I definitely recommend this game to a serious RPG player.
5.0	This control is a beauty.... i wish I could give it 10 stars. I really love the camo.
5.0	got it on time, and very great game<br />had lot of fun play with it!<br />this is my first Zelda game, but I truly enjoyed it
5.0	This is just what my grandson wanted for Christmas and he is thrilled with it! Thank you very much, Amazon!
5.0	Its a good console needs an external hard drive but still better than 360 and has better games than ps4
5.0	Even though this game was released way back when the ds was still new it's still one of the best games for the system, just amazing the amount of creativity & style that's put into this little gem is eye popping, if you're a fan of unique quirky games you owe it to your self to check out feel the magic it is excellent.
5.0	this is so awesome I have zero experience on a guitar and now I have sore fingers and I can play chords
5.0	I have watched the show Hell's Kitchen for two seasons now, and all of Gordon Ramsay's shows on BBC America for a while.  He absolutely cracks me up - how he can be mean and nasty, and then a perfect gentlemen who cares for his kids and yucks it up with his friends.  I got this game after the last season of Hell's Kitchen was over.  This game is for people who like to problem solve - it's all a matter of timing.  And for those of us who like to cook in real-life too, there are even recipes that you can cook in your real-life kitchen!
5.0	hubby n my brother loved it!!
5.0	Great price, fast shipping and works great.
5.0	It's new<br />It's exactly what you think it is.<br />And the price is good.<br />Shipping was fast.<br />Works fine.<br />Nice 9' cord.
5.0	He love it ! It was the hit if the party!! I was the cool grandma<br />,
5.0	I got this game as a present and wasn't too impressed with it at first.. But one day I picked it back up and payed attention to the directions of each little mini game and how unlocking more characters is always exciting cause they all have their own brief story. Found myself laughing at the silly humor of it all. Definitely recommend this game! Wanting to try other warioware games now..
5.0	Really helps  Playstation 3 slim prevent itself from easily tipping to either side. Would highly recommended this product to ps3 users
5.0	Can't stop kids from playing this game for hours....too much fun.
5.0	awesome game and honest seller.
5.0	F-Zero is a superb game. There are 4 different starting vehicles, each a different style with different stats and pilots. You can later unlock 6 more vehicles. Then there are the races. 4 cups when you unlock queen and 4 difficulty levels; beginner, advanced, expert, and master when you unlock it. There are 5 levels which you have to get at least third in to keep going. But if you finish that lap (there are 5 laps in total) in a worse position than it shows near the place it shows your place you lose. You have 4 spare machines so thats how many times you can restart. If u get at least third in each of them you win that cup. You can unlock a lot of things by winning races. So you have 1000 different choices of things to do. ... The levels are action packed with simulated computer racers. you have health, speed, place, and place you need. There are bombs, boosts, slow dowm areas, jumps, and healing spots. So you can do practically anything in this game. It is a huge challenge and not just an afternoon game. you will need a lot of comitment because this game is no walk in the part. I am still going and i have had it 2 years! So if racing is your passion this game is good for you. good luck.
5.0	This works perfectly and if you have kids like mine that yank the cord out instead of nicely taking it out the back of the gamepad you are going to need this one soon as well. I liked that it's the original and not some knockoff that may or may not work.
5.0	This game has given me many hours of first person shooter entertainment.  A nice mix of really challenging tasks and medium hard tasks although I did have to resort to a walkthrough guide on gamespot.com for help sometimes.
5.0	This game is so much fun and really gives a non-dancer like me a fun and entertaining workout! I just wish there were even more songs!
5.0	I don't know why there are so many negative reviews for Call of Duty: Ghosts, because this game is awesome! Of course it's similar to the rest of the franchise, but one of the coolest new features is the fact that you can now create your own soldier. Not only can you create your weapon class, but you can now fully customize your player, from body type to equipment.<br /><br />From what I've seen thus far on Multiplayer online, the maps are A LOT bigger than in previous versions. Additionally, there are a slew of new kill streak rewards, and the players run for a longer period of time in this one, and the ability to make your player slide on the ground is pretty cool too.<br /><br />Don't listen to anyone saying this game isn't worth buying. If you're a COD fan, this is the best one yet.
5.0	My nephew loved these headphones
5.0	My daughter downloaded the sample through the Wii onto her Nintendo DS.  She enjoyed it so much that we just had to buy her the extended version.
5.0	Kids wanted to add to their game. Has worked fine for a couple of years now. Got a decent price.
5.0	I rated this product 5 stars because it did not take that long to receive it.Plus,if you are very familiar with &#34;Risk-the board game&#34;growing up then you will not be disappointed what so ever.This brings back childhood memories to me.Very good sound and graphics.
5.0	No problems and shipped fast! Highly recommended for any person buying a charger or any other technology related item you need.
1.0	There's so many things wrong with this game that it's only a small amount of time before you want to pull your own hair out.     Problems aren't exclusive to the PC version. I believe every platform (PC, XBOX, PS) has been compromised. Although the PC version is obviously the worst.     IW gave little control by comparison to what most PC/FPS gamers expected.    A quick trip to any forum reveals countless pages of angry gamers.     It's unbelievable how many problems exist with this game. No amount of patches will fix it. This game will never be right.     It's very obvious this game was not beta tested properly. Naive decisions were made.    The most anticipated yet biggest failure of recent memory.
5.0	Gift for grandson.  He was thrilled, excited and beyond over the moon for this video game.  Again, it was a gift and certainly not one I was comfortable giving.
1.0	"I own this game and it no way a \\""Halo Killer\\"", it is not a \\""Metal of Honor Killer\\"". it is not a \\""Red Faction Killer\\"" it is not a \\""James Bond Killer\\"" it is a an \\""enjoyment Killer\\"".  This is not even in the top ten FPS that have come out period.  I think we all had high hopes but it is total disapointment.  The game is slow, as in the frame rate is bad.  The game is linear and short, the online sucks tons of lag, there really is no story and most of all you feel like you are struggling with the aim and controls.  Rent this before you buy, don't be a complete fool like me.  Thanks Sony."
5.0	The best game purchase i have made this year. Dead Island satisfies all your zombie world infested needs. Super fun with friends online and can almost get spookey playing it alone. I reccomend to anybody who enjoys zombies!
5.0	Good game and lots of fun. Great graphics as well. The only downfall is that you can't install the HD graphics pack on a 4gb slim without a HD.
1.0	Friend bought this game and the product code didn't work. Bioware said there was nothing they could do and after fighting with them for over a week they still wouldn't give him a working code. He tried to get a replacement from Amazon and they wouldn't help him out either. Beware, if you are unlucky don't bother messing with their customer service. They don't help you AT ALL..
5.0	The playstation 2 is my all time favorite game system of all time! And the game GT3 is also great. I can't put the controler down. The game's graphics will make you weepand the gameplay is just as good. The PLaystation can also play DVD's, whitch is great if you don't have a DVD system. the game GT3 does get kind of hard but is still the best game i ever have. so if you like video games buy this pack.<BR>p.s. the magazines are great too.
1.0	I read the reviews before I purchased this item and was very excited to get it for my 5 year old daughter. We played it for over an hour expecting it to get better...it never did.  It was extremely boring (and not just for me). My daughter and I were VERY disappointed!
5.0	This game is some of the best fun i have ever played in a video game,The graphics are the best i have ever seen in a game.you can tell that the developer put a lot of time in this as the facial animations are so lifelike.If you own a PS4 get this now and you will not regret it.
1.0	I'm a African American and purchased this game and was shocked at the racist image of the black character called BT in this game<BR>The character was drawn with big bulging eyes, big pink lips <BR>and drawn to resemble an ape like creature!<BR>I'm am outraged and highly frustrated with sony and anyone else <BR>associated with this game! <BR>maybe it's time for African Americans to stop buying Sony products!
5.0	its a great system. its my third favorite but its amazing. it has the ability to turn off and start up right where you left off if it goes into sleep mode. it downloads updates while in sleep mode like the ps4 but instead of installing when the system starts up this does the job in sleep. its time saving but sort of costly energy wise. if its not your main entertainment its energy save mode saves a good chunk of power. i dont have a box in my room to test its tv capability so i dont know much about that. its great for what i want in an xbox and was at a decent price at the time. i went with kinect for voice controls mostly. the controller interface still needs improvements but voice commands are great and easy to use. id say its a great system with its own good points.
5.0	"Listening to everything about the game leading up to its' release had me anticipating this game but still skeptical (to a certain extent) as games that usually get alot of media attention turn out to be not so good to me. Well, thankfully, Eat Sleep Play delivered a game that far excceds my expectations and then some. All that media attention was justified. This is an event that shouldn't be missed by PS3 owners.<br /><br />Like other games in the series, Twisted Metal is about a competition that takes place by the same name. Twisted Metal is ran by a man named Calypso, who has the power to grant the winner of the competition a single wish. Course, there's a lesson to be learned when dealing with Calypso...Be careful what you wish for. This time, though, Twisted Metal is quite different. This time around, only three competitors compete(which takes place in three chapters of the story mode)...Mr. Grimm, Dollface, and everyone's favorite: Sweet Tooth.<br /><br />Each of the drivers bring along cronies forming three gangs that wage war against one another. All three groups(and a fourth in MP) have access to every vehicle which means that they can drive other vehicles besides the ones they are most well-known for.  Each chapter comes filled with difficult challenges and ends with a boss encounter. Make no mistake, folks, this ain't no cakewalk. Just like Twisted Metal Black, this game increases in difficulty rather quickly and can be hard as nails. The thing I noticed about this game is, unlike past games in the series, the cars handle quite differently. If it is bigger, it moves more slowly and is harder to bring down. whereas if the car is smaller, it moves alot faster and can be brought down quickly.<br /><br />I was particularly blown away by the levels that you play in. Just as in TM:Black, the levels are massive when compared to earlier entries in the series. My favorite level has to be the Killoseum(which is constantly changing on you and is much more dangerous). Everything looks nearly photo-realistic now, graphically, and the TM universe feels more alive now.<br /><br />The single-player campaign is short but sweet and satisfying. Multiplayer is where the game really shines. Taking TM online has a good bit of potential and, once everyone learns the intricacies of the game, we're definitely going to see some real competition take hold. As in any TM game, I had more fun playing against other Twisted Metal fans than with the game's AI.<br /><br />The only fault I had with the game is it takes a little getting used to the new control scheme. Once you've become accustomed with it, it feels pretty natural. I also found the lock-on target system frustrating at times and didn't really care for it all that much.<br /><br />It's hard to believe that Twisted Metal has been around for over 15 years now. It's good to see this series grow, with this installment. I'm glad they took certain risks with this game. It shows. If this game doesn't win \\""Game of the Year\\"" this year(or some type of award, at least), then- we got some pretty shallow gamers out there. Put simply, Twisted Metal is insane fun.

5.0	I bought this console and it worked perfectly, delivery time was as promised. though mine was a 110v, people keep telling me it dual voltage power brick.<br />but the second console i bought was written 110-240v.<br />overall great console!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5.0	This is an amazing system and is a must buy.  The 3D effect works great and it doesn't hurt my eyes or give me headaches when its on.  This is a great deal for all of the pre-installed software like the ar gamesand is an all-around very well made handheld and is very fun.
5.0	This product is very modern looking, holds both Xbox and PS3 controllers, has nice and bright LED lighting to indicate charge status, and detects battery issues (seems to prevent overcharging). What else could I ask for?<br /><br />Well, there is one minor thing... the plug for the wall adapter underneath the charging station is loose enough to cause the plug to fall out if the station is moved around, but who needs to move the station frequently?<br /><br />Great product, would recommend to others.
5.0	The only problem with this game is that you really need to pay attention to the environment to pick up some things, like if you walk past a statue you will have to notice the spade icon comes up and you can use it. It requires a really focussed mind, and you get rewards if you're good. <br /> <br />But, on the other hand, the game makes some things blatantly obvious: eg where to go next, who can see you, who has something for you, where's the goal, etc. It's good, but it is a sort of irony- it makes it easy for you and hard as well. But then the game is not that hard... it makes you make decisions. The story is very well written, and I'm happy with everything else. The graphics are good, music, combat. Although the system gets you more involved than KOTOR. <br /> <br />90%
1.0	As said, this is a 100% rip-off.  You can buy the nunchuck for 20 bucks and the 2000 Wii points card for 20 bucks. That will be 40 bucks.  This package is 48 dollars, I have no idea where the other 8 came from.    It is cheaper to just buy the two individually.
5.0	Well I dont know why people say it blocks out all other sounds, cause it really doesnt. The audio in and out quality is much like the Microsoft name brand wired headset, the mouth piece is pretty good, the inner wires are covered buy a bending metal cover wire bit. The headphones are tight, i mean very tight at first but afer about an hour or t2o my ears got used to it and the headset was fairly comfortable and with time it will fit like a dream. The build is good, and these things may look big in the picture but trust me its pretty small which is very nice. I say need a replacement but want structure at a low prive then buy this. it'll get the job done and it works.
5.0	My son who is 6 and I play often and it is alot of fun.  Basic football game but easy to play for kids.
5.0	This really is a must have if you have a child who likes Disney (and most do).  You can do so much with the Infinity that it's amazing.  They say an infinity 2 might be in the making, but Disney has said that the characters will work with future versions, so it's worth collecting the characters.  Plus the characters make good, inexpensive gifts at under fifteen dollars.  Works great.
5.0	Very fun. Would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a challenge, and good old British humour (the real kind, not the Family Guy kind :P).
5.0	Fun game for all ages, we got an extra steering wheel so we can race each other.  Everyone loves to come race!
1.0	The XBox360 version, of Anniversary, started out pretty well, but quickly went downhill.  First, a key movement required to procure one of the treasures, simply does not work.  Fine.  So, keep on, keepin' on, and go to the next.  So, when the next level comes up, the first thing to happen is an attack by a very large bear.  On the screen, is a help line that comes up (halting the game play), explaining how to do a dodge --and, in turn, an adrenalin head shot.  When the text goes away, I immediately try the key sequence required ...and it, too, does not work!  That being said, I tried playing, several times, the same sequence, as well as a couple others requiring that same sequence ...and in ALL CASES, the required key sequence does not work.  Consequently, the bear bests/dinasaur (or whatever else) best lara ...game over.  Or, if one is persistent --and has a chance-- one can run past the bear and keep on keeping on ...for awhile, at least.  (Not past the dinasaur, however.  One MUST best the dinasaur to continue the game ...so, game TRULY over, in just a short while, with many levels left to play.)<br /><br />Comes a pole, in the next segment, which Lara is supposed to climb.  She first jumps onto the cement base, out of which the pole emerges, and climbs.  Right?  Nope... not gonna happen.  Lara performs the classic 'I'm not supposed to do that' jump, and she goes past the pole, ten or fifteen times.  Finally, she lands on the base, and when the key is pressed for the climb... she does the 'I'm not supposed to do that' jump.<br /><br />Having tried, several times, to get past the first couple segments, I have finally given up.  I have to say that this is the worst Tomb Raider I have ever attempted to play.  The second-worst, is 'Underworld', which begs another scathing review, unfortunately, because of several bugs.<br /><br />Poor programming, apparently, since I have raided since Tomb Raider 2, and had little trouble compared to the latest Xbox releases.  All others, were for PC.  I think that's it, for my brand new Xbox.  I thought it would be less expensive than getting a computer to play these new ones, but I was incorrect.  I sense that it isn't Xbox's fault, since Legend is the ONLY one that works the way it is advertised, to work.  At least, on that one, the only broken sequence is, guess what!?: The dodge/adrenalin head shot.  All else, works.<br /><br />Save your money, and frustration.  It just isn't worth, it.  Rather than pawn it off on some poor unfortunate, I just trashed, it.<br /><br />My two cents.ink that's it, for my brand new Xbox.

5.0	Item was as described actual wii supply cord. It has the Nintendo Wii stamp and all. Plugged it up and so far works great... Would recommend paying a few extra bucks for this original in place of a knock off...
5.0	this game is realy fun,but it is kinda of short. i BEAT IT IN 2 DAYS
1.0	"Fundamentally, SimCity has always been a 'software toy'.  That means that there's no real end state, no way to win.  It's just a thing that you play and experiment with.  You build, and tinker, and mess around.  It's a toy, not a game; it's a sandbox, not baseball.<br /><br />So, in this iteration of the game, you don't even get to buy your toy.  Rather, you rent a toy from EA, who lets you play with it only in very limited, circumscribed ways, only on their servers.  So you have to have a live Internet connection at all times, and their servers have to be up, and have to have space for you.  And the rules for play are draconian.  If you want to, say, build a city, save it, blow it up with something terrible, and then restore from save, you can't do that anymore.  That's an unauthorized usage of their toy. And if you figure out ways of using their toy that they don't like, they'll ban you forever.<br /><br />All third-party modding is shut out.  One of the best parts of SimCity 4 and The Sims is that users can create and share content among themselves for free.  You will no longer be able to do this.  You will be required to run only Official Authorized Content.<br /><br />Further, you're not getting the whole game for your $60 or $80, depending on what version you're buying.  EA's plan is to sell you Simcity 5 over and over and over.  They've directly admitted that they already have it running with larger cities, but they're not releasing that now.  They claim it's because it \\""won't run on Dad's PC\\"", but the real reason is so they can sell it to you again later.  Want subways?  That's gonna be $20.  Want railroads?  Another $20.  Bigger cities?  Oh, that's in the $30 expansion.<br /><br />Right now, if you look at The Sims 3, the game costs $30.  But if also you buy all the DLC for it, it's *four hundred and seventy dollars*.  This is what they are doing with SimCity 5; locking you into their server infrastructure, and then exploiting the heck out of your wallet.<br /><br />This is a lousy deal, and you would be stupid to take it.  Always-on DRM, and a deliberately crippled game, so that they can slowly uncripple it, charging you for every restored feature from prior versions.<br /><br />Simcity 4 still works pretty well.  It's not quite as nice as most current games, and can require you to 'pin' the process to just one processor on a multi-core system (ie, most current machines), but if you want a city builder where you won't have to pay extra to breathe both in AND out, that would be a better option.<br /><br />But buying this game?  In my opinion, you would be wiser to take three twenties out of your wallet, and light them on fire.r /><br />This is a lousy deal, and you would be stupid to take it.

5.0	Everyone from the six year old to the husband with no rhythm loves this game. We love that it's all about fun, no pressure or stress because someone can't make it through a song. The song selection is also great, with some of our favorites and some new songs we've grown to love. Definitely worth it, and so much better than the original Rockband.<br /><br />And four years later....we still love it!
1.0	This game doesn't work,I bought it used...it was packaged very well though...We have a very upset son here....I am letting you know so that you can test the games before you send them to other people...
5.0	noticeble differences in graphics compared the the ps vita and PS3 version. Great hack and slash game. High replay value. It will keep you busy. Highly recommend!
5.0	the product completely meets my expectations in terms of price, comfort and use, it certainly was a good investment for me
5.0	Fast Shipping, 100% Complete, Good addition to le collection, 10/10 Would purchase again.
5.0	I had so much fun using the Pad! It helps burn some fats and helps you stay strong and fast. In fact, I don't think I'd ever want it gone!
5.0	Awesome backpack for Sonic fans - has held up well over the past year.
1.0	The entire game is useless because you cannot move beyond one course if you can't play like Tiger in Championship mode. My children have had this for 3 years and have never been able to play more than the first Halloween course. Big waste of money. Horrible design.
5.0	I bought these a while ago and I still love them.Wireless IS the way to go for me. At first they were a pain to get &#34;paired&#34;. I followed the direction multiple times and after all the frustration I finally was able to pair them. Time to time they become unpaired and I lose game volume, but usually turning the set off and back on will get the sound back. It was a little disappointing that the TB had a 2.5mm Stereo Jack and not a more common 3.5mm for general plugs/pc plug ins. Also the bluetooth was only able to receive phone calls from my phone and not transmit music to the TB. Really these are a great investment if you can get em for under a bill.
5.0	I have to say I was really disappointed by the last splinter cell game conviction. It had its good parts but it had lots And lots of flaws. Very rushed and just didn't seem to great, I was kinda skeptical bout the new one but I wax.surprised. its really really good :) everything that was bad bout conviction they fixed. Black lists storyline is pretty awesome. They're some violent stuff in it but good. Features some of the most realistic explosions in a game I've ever seen. You can customize Sam fishers looks, weapons and even light color. Lol. Cool gameplay and graphics. Id give a 9 out of 10 stars. Pick it up, destroy the terrorists and eliminate the blacklist :)
5.0	I got this for my husband for Christmas, it was a very affordable gift to go along with his game
5.0	love it but got stuck and cant find a walk through to help on line
5.0	Arrived Quickly. Well packaged.<br />Bought as a gift. She loves it.<br />Thanks
5.0	All the LEGO Wii games are a hoot, and the Lego Star Wars game is a lot of fun! The stories are a blast, and we're still enjoying it!
5.0	Up to four players, twelve total players if you choose the internet option, motion steering (I believe the motion does other functions as well) this is a very very fun game for the whole family.  Also, works just as well without the steering wheel.<br /><br />The internet play is so cool.  Rather than compete against the computer where the other drivers drive at a constant speed and hardly ever go off the track, you race against real people whose moves are so unpredictable.  The internet play is just really fun.<br /><br />Well worth the money you spend on the game.  One of the best Wii games out there.
5.0	This game is vital to all Mario-lovers.  The graphics are excellent and the game features all the characters except Luigi.  It is educational and fun for kids age 4 and up, and also becomes challenging and suitable for  older people.  There are 15 main courses, each different and fun to  explore.  I would recommend a guide book be used with this game.  Prima  puts out a detailed one, yet it leaves some things for you to discover on  your own. This is one of the best Nintendo 64 games ever!
5.0	Son loves it.  Says it's a GREAT GAME.  I know nothing of games, but it SURE HAS HIS ATTENTION !!   You must be inspecting your 'used' merchandise carefully because he hasn't had a bit of trouble with it.   Thank you very much.
5.0	My grandchildren and I love the Wii Speak Microphone, we play games and I can talk with two different children in two different cities at the same time and they can talk to each other.  We really enjoy the Wii Speak Microphone with the Animal Crossing game and Endless Ocean.
5.0	I absolutely love this game. This has awesome, fun tunes to not only dance to but to also workout to. You work up a sweat and don't really notice you're working out because you're having so much fun! It is even great to play at any age! I got my parents and grandparents dancing with me! Talk about a little fun family competition!
5.0	It charges your controllers.. Mission accomplished.
5.0	I received the item in expedient timing. It was brand new and works wonderfully. I was very pleased with my purchase. Excellent pricing.
5.0	My son love this game. The effect are good, music and the whole feeling of playing and watching soccer game is there.
5.0	This game can be replayed a bunch of times with different characters and never get old. Especially with the heros and villains DLC. Only thing that they could have improved with this game is adding a point system for stats when you level up like in X-MEN 2 :RISE OF APOCALYPSE. Other than that perfect game and a great gem for all Marvel comic fans.
5.0	I don't want to go into too much detail lest I spoil some of the game, but finally Assassins Creed is getting back to its roots and making great games once again<br /><br />I was a bit concerned about this game after Assassins Creed 3, which I ended up finishing more out of loyalty than anything else. I bought this game hoping that if I gave it a shot, it would pan out, and boy did it.<br /><br />The game play itself is great, and that's not something that was ever really lacking from any games in the series, but this time we finally got our likable players and interesting story lines back! This isn't my favorite game of the series (if you haven't played the games focused around Ezio, I envy you, because I would love to be able to play those games for the first time again, he is of course the protagonist in the Assassins Creed 2 series of titles) but it made me excited for the the next installment<br /><br />The key take aways are:<br />1. If you like Assassins Creed, you'll be happy they're back to making good games<br />2. If you've never played Assassins Creed, it's an amazing series. I would recommend starting at the beginning, especially since that will make parts of the game make a lot more sense, but this game is good enough to stand alone
5.0	Love the Lego Star Wars game, and all the other Lego games as well.  This one and the Lord of the Rings games are my favorites.  A must have for any lego star wars fan!
5.0	When I first saw this game on GBA I knew i had 2 get it because I had hours of fun playing it on Sega. The Pros of the game are: 1. Good, solid Graphics  2. Smooth gameplay  3. Great sound fx and background Music. 4. A simple but challenging game which makes it so you can play it for quite a while. <BR>   The only thing I didn't like was that you could not save your game so you have to start all over if you turn it off or quit. But overall, this game is funny, excitind, and a must have for your Game Boy Advance.
5.0	Excellent surprise for son
5.0	This is an excellent replacement to my wired sensor bar for my wii  I am very happy with this purchase, I actually like this sensor bar  more then the original that i got with the console,   i can stand at a much greater distance then with my other sensor bar.
5.0	This thing is honest with you about your weight, so be ready. It works you out a ton if you let it and it is a great tool to get my kids off the couch and moving. It is also great for old man couch potatoes like me.
5.0	What a great deal!  Awesome product at an unbeatable price.  It is like having noise canceling headphones that double as a microphone.
5.0	Perfect christmas gift and great price lots of fun for all ages!
5.0	Excellent product, I recommend it, the sound quality is second to none and the Outreach wifi system of headphones is excellent.
5.0	I have this wii board and it is worth the money it is easy to sync to the wii system the only bad thing is dont use regular batteries because they die quick so get the rechargeable batteries to go with it.
1.0	The first two classes are kind-of fun, but the third one (Hagrad's hut) is very frustrating. The instructions don't really help at all. You can't even explore the castle because the doors only open when you're on that class.
5.0	absolutely the best MMO game, fantastic star trek world with interesting story. Battle in universe is breathtaking. I recommended this product!
5.0	The video game has great graphics &  mechanics. My son & I have a great time playing this game. I'm more of a FPS gamer but its great father & son time.Can't wait till The Amazing Spiderman 2 comes out in April 2014.
5.0	I hated to see the previous review as the most recent review for AC.  I have been playing the game since October 2000 and have not bought another game since.  Every month Turbine releases updates (free-unlike EQ) which dramatically change the entire stream of gameplay.  Not sure what the last guy was thinking, but I think hie review was a waste of time, so stay away from it!  There are quests to save the world from various opponents!  The are critters that you need more than one person to kill.  There are places where you will not see a soul.  It is a fun experience!
1.0	The pictures on amazon only show the front of the controller...the whole thing isn't green.  And I have the original ps3 controller at my house, the analog sticks were sleeker and easier to play with than the green one that came in the mail.  Not worth the extra money for a bad coat of paint and lower quality
5.0	Bought this for the holidays, the kids absolutely love the Wii!  Great starter pack, plenty of games to keep them busy for a little while before they start wanting more games.
5.0	I'm going to start of by saying that I love robots and mechs.  However, I have developed a discerning taste in my love of these things.  I have played plenty of mech games ranging from Metal Storm on the NES, Armored Core on the PSX, Steel Battalion on the XBox, to Chrome Hounds on the 360 just to name a few.  I am also a very, very, very picky gamer.  I am lucky if I buy more than two games in a year.  That being said, I can barely put down Titanfall.  I am a casual gamer, lucky to get a couple of hours in a week, tops.  I've found myself sneaking up into my office so I can grab a couple of matches.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Great gameplay<br />- Beautiful environments<br />- Casual gamer friendly<br />- Robots/mechs just feel right and are aesthetically pleasing.  Think Maschinen Krieger<br />- Gameplay is familiar but different enough to make it exciting<br />- Controls are intuitive for FPS veterans<br /><br />Cons:<br />- No destructible environments<br />- Cannot name your custom builds<br /><br />I really enjoy this game.  I'd recommend picking this up.  It's well worth the $59.99
5.0	The product was delivered in one piece and on time. Thank you
5.0	Deployed right now and it got here quick with no problems.  Great game from the get go and never really into fight games.  (Not to mention I don't read Japanese.)
1.0	Game would not function properly after installation. My computer more than met the requirements to play this game. The mouse would not move, but very erratically. Every movement requested was performed at such a slow pace and so erratically that I just uninstalled same and dumped on the junk  shelf. Don't waste your money.
1.0	I've been waiting for this package for over a month now and i still don't know when I'm going to receive it. This is my first time and the last time doing business with Brambhai. Should be out of business
5.0	I purchased this for my husband *yes my husband* for Christmas.  The 2 guitar set was a bargain!  I purchased it at less than 1/2 the price on a pre-Christmas sale.  He has had hours of fun with this so far.
5.0	I LOVE this game!!!!  It's excellent for eye control and alertness.!  It keeps one's attention all the time!!  And it is addictive to play..!  I recommend buying it..!!!!
5.0	I am very happy with this buy. I lucked out, its in good condition as stated and for the price I cannot complain one bit.
5.0	awesome.....just awesome  some glitches, but with the wide world bethesda and the amazing gameplay the glitches arent anything at all to gripe about, already made game of the year the first two months it was out.......dont need to say much more
5.0	I have a ps4 and this gadget works very well with my Xbox one controller no lag everything response well. The only bad thing is u can't use your Xbox one headset u have to buy wireless ps4 headset if u want to use this gadget with your Xbox controller and chat with your buddies. This is a gadget if u don't like the ps4 controller and want to use your Xbox or Wii controller to your ps4 console.
1.0	I bought this for the paddles.  But much to my disappointment, they are useless since you have to strike the ball with the edge of the paddle, not the face! The orientation is 90 degrees off.  What were they thinking?!?  I want my money back!    DO NOT BUY THIS GARBAGE!
5.0	This is the best game for bringing you into the heat of battle. I thought that the story was awesome and I really liked how accurate it was to what really happened. The controls take a while to master, but once you do it is really the most percise controls on the wii. I also liked the personalitys of the characters, they were interesting and believeable. To you out there who get bored with predictable gameplay, never fear there are quite a few different actions that are done with the wiimote which include hand-to-hand combat, driving a jeep and a tank (very fun)and even useing mortor in a few instantces. The game is not short by any means, but once you master shooting behind cover it will make near impossible to die.Also for you out there who love to pick of enemy troops one by one with a sniper, you will be be very happy with one of the last levels where it is a sniper's pardise, you are shooting from a house window where you are rarely shot at and you have a lot of targets and over a hundred shots(my favorite level)Well I will end this review by saying that you have got to get this game.
5.0	This game is incredibly fun.  i bought this game for my son and i to play on a rainy day and i have found is has done the trick.  the online download of other players custom creations has given an endless supply of tracks, cars and characters. it reminds me of a new age Mario Cart.
5.0	fun product - timely delivery
5.0	The seller delivered the product in a timely manner.  Product was in good condition and we have not had any problems with it.  I would recommend the seller and product to other consumers.
5.0	Even though Microsoft has come out with the new X-Box One, I still love my machine and see no reason to upgrade - YET. The additional hard drive space has not even come close to filling up. For the price, this is the one.
5.0	I received the PS4 quickly and set it up.  Man is the PS4 AWESOME!  The graphics are beyond comparison and I cant wait to Play MLB the show on it.  If you are a gamer, go ahead and get it!  I was pleased to be able to get here on Amazon because I couldnt find it anywhere else locally.
5.0	they are great for extensions on the triggers and easy to install on the controllers would recommend to the serious gamers
5.0	This game is so much fun I can't put it into words.  I play it all day everyday.  The hardened edition is just that much better!!
5.0	Great product! Now my kids don't need to sit right next to the TV to play their GameCube. I would buy these again.
5.0	I love this game, I would write a longer review but I'd rather go back to playing it. :)
5.0	The dialog is fairly silly at times but the overall plot is good and the game play is really fun.  The 3D effects are kinda fun, but only really effect the UI.  One of the best 3DS games I've played.
5.0	My son loves this game. it keeps him entertained during appointments and long waits without getting bored with it.<br />defiantly worth the money. the graphics are also very good.
1.0	Only buy this game if you have an overwhelming urge to throw 20 bucks away.  Horrible graphics, no sense of speed, car can be tuned but no instructions on what does what.  Buy some Ratbags games for the best deal.
5.0	Great item better than expected
5.0	Arrived timely and I have had no issues with it.  I did not receive the black one - I got the white one.  They are both the same and I enjoy hours playing it.
5.0	My son loved this unique Skylander with his special Easter hat with bunny ears and his colorful Easter egg rocket.
5.0	it is fun and everything that I expected it to be.
5.0	This battery takes about seven hours to fully charge up, but the results are amazing! For my 3DS specs, I keep the brightness on the second highest setting with the Wi-Fi off usually (Pokémon X has changed that now lol):<br /><br />The battery lasted for slightly over 20 hours on one charge until the red light came on. Probably could of squeezed another five hours out of it, but figured that was good enough. I mainly played Pokémon Soul Silver, Mega Man Zero Collection, Star Fox 3DS, and now Pokémon X. I noticed when using the 3D slider, keeping it 1/3 of the way up, the battery started to be drained a tad bit faster, which is to be expected.<br /><br />This product does come with the 5000mAh battery, a black battery cover (which looks great with the black 3DS), and 4 tiny screws.<br /><br />TIP: There have been people who have said the battery cover does not stay on the back of the 3DS. I too was having this problem even after putting the screws in. The back cover seems to not snap directly onto the system on the go. You have to nudge it down some when pushing it on until you hear the top of the cover click into the system. You should be able to flip the system over with the battery cover not flying off before you put the screws in, meaning it did in fact snap in. Hope this help!
1.0	This mission has ruined the game. I am 14% into the game and cannot progress any further due to this mission which requires you to be stealthy in order to complete it. Not only is this mission long but the save points are rare which make you repeat about 5-10 min of game play every time you get detected. I have wasted about 4 hours straight trying to beat this mission, this game is a total s***.
5.0	"It is a happy day, 2 years later my girlfriend's son is now old enough to play the Rock Band / Guitar Hero games.  I no longer have to play alone.  There was an article where a guy was debating whether or not these games actually make you \\""feel\\"" like you are playing guitar.<br /><br />Let me just say that when I am busting out the solo to Pearl Jam's \\""Alive\\"" on Rock Band 2, I \\""feel\\"" more like I am playing guitar than I ever did during the many years I tried to play a real guitar :-)  Unlike a real guitar it only takes a few hours and a good imagination to rock out.  I am not ashamed to admit that I go the full nine yards, making faces and swinging that guitar like Hendrix himself.<br /><br />I have a mic and 2 guitars.  I thought I didn't need the drums, but after a week of having the game I put my order in for the drums yesterday.  I can't wait.  Only 2 things ever make me want to go back and do my youth all over again.  College life and advancements in video games."
5.0	works wonderfully. its a must have for anyone who plays games on PC.
1.0	Want a broken hard drive? Well you've come to the right place! After spending 30 dollars on this, I put it in my xbox only to find it defective. It seriously would't even boot up when I connected it. The console just crashed and gave me an error code. After looking up the error code, I can confirm that it is the hard drive and not my xbox. I would highly discourage anyone from buying this. Find somewhere that actually sells working hard drives.
5.0	Product works amazingly! Lights up perfectly and charges quickly. No scratches or damage to product at all. LED looks amazing when the lights off as well. Very much recommend this product. Thanks a lot for the product!! Can't beat the price :)
5.0	So much fun!  Different from all other games.  My son is 12 and loves it. <br />Usually into more sports and racing games, so this one is different.
5.0	Works great as expected and no problems whatsoever.
1.0	These Nyko brand batteries are junk.  I've had 2 now that absolutely do NOT work with anything.  The other 2 do work, or rather did, but it was a pain in the ass to get them to work.  Now they don't anymore either it seems.  I'll buy Microsoft from now on.
1.0	Do not make the same mistake I did and buy this game. I used to drive race cars. I have played all of the console NASCAR games in the past as well as simracing on the computer (iracing & nascar 2003). iRacing is the best but too big of a time commitment for me right now. I was looking for a casual racer arcade/sim to enjoy for some console fun.      This game is completely unplayable. The game constantly freezes, starts races out with AI cars and player cars randomly crashing. Caution flags do not work. The online matchmaking creates new games first without filling up existing games making it hard to get a full room of racers. Games randomly end out of nowhere and assign you a random position.     I feel completely ripped off that anyone would try to sell this for $9.99 let alone the $59.99 I paid for this.    IF they fix these issues and make the game playable, there is a good game at the core. The graphics are outstanding. The menu system is well done. Online is very fun at Daytona and Talladega but its just impossible to get into a game online and when you do get a game then there is freezing, crashing before the race even starts, or the game randomly ends. I will update my review should everything ever get sorted out, they say they are willing to fix these issues. Although I'm tempted to take my $25 credit I got pre-ordering and trading this game in for $40 or $45 and calling it a wash.     Hopefully this helps someone!
5.0	This is by far the best race wheel I have ever had. It is rock solid, and the motors inside of it create a feeling of actually driving everywhere from Laguna Seca to Indianapolis International Speedway. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a decently priced race wheel, and anyone who wasnts a realistic driving experience without leaving the comfort of your home.
5.0	I have this game for both the Playstation One and Game Boy Color. This game is a true classic. It is one of my favorites. It is hard, but fun. I strongly recomend Q-Bert. You will have a lot of fun with this game. It is a great game for kids too.
5.0	I bought these buttons to black out my controller and I am happy I did they look great and were very easy to install the package includes the proper screw driver and menu button which is just all black (would prefer same inlay symbols as buttons, so did not install). Overall i am happy with the purchase it is worth the money and received them quickly.
5.0	I think this product is definitely worth $15...    I've seen many people of different forums talking about how their pedals broke. Mine hasn't broken yet but every time I played on Hard or Expert I would be worried that it might break. Now thanks to Pedal Metal I don't have to worry as much.    I also have to add that I received it earlier than I expected. I ordered it on Saturday and didn't expect to get it until late this week or early next week and I already received it today.    So to everyone who plays Rock Band, if you want to protect your pedal, this item is definitely worth buying.
5.0	This headset is top notch for gaming if you are wanting the best equipment on the market.<br />razor always puts out products that seem to take two or three generations to finally be up to par when astro's have been doing the same song and dance for just two gen's.<br />i previously owned a40's from the first gen<br />so in comparison its amazing how much more punch is in these plus them being wireless.<br /><br />strongly recommended
1.0	Beware!  Your less than a year old DSi won't play this game.  The cartridges are tabbed so they won't fit.    This may be a great version of Nintendogs but you won't know unless you shell out another $250 for a new 3DS.
1.0	My title pretty much says it all.  I really think they just wanted to cash in on the good name Duke Nukem had.  The load times are awful and gameplay/guns are from a previous decade.  I still find myself killing bots in CoD rather than actually finishing this game...yes it is that bad.
5.0	So far, no problems. I have a 250gb slim xbox 360 and this plugged in and worked with first time.
1.0	A company who has to change their systems performance to try and mach up with competitors that is one big red flag.<br />Kinect= Very Unresponsive. (Has to release Software updates to improve performance)<br />Random Freezes.<br />Too focused on entertainment than Games.<br />Price. i can go buy a PS4 for $100 less and get a better overall satisfaction with my product.<br />and remember you still have to buy Gold to be online and you still need to pay for internet so that $100 can go far. im saving a good 100.<br />I returned my Xbone and bought 2 extra Playstation 4s for the family.
5.0	This game is a instant classic done by Double Fine, lead by Tim Schaefer who once worked for Lucas Arts back when they made funny adventure games like Monkey Island, Grim Fandango, Day of the Tenticle and the list goes on. His newest release was Brutal Legend which has the same humor in it, but with this game it's a lower age so there is a lot more humor and less violence.    The story is about a boy who runs away from the circus to enroll in a camp where they teach you how to use Psychic abilities since he is a psychic. He learns some abilities, but in the process finds himself in a conspiricy too. Definantly a must buy!
5.0	my son loved it great speed get me here for a great price what more can you ask about that !
5.0	My 10 year old grandson connected the XBox 360 Kinect, established my avatar, then provided an overview of each section.  He showed me how to play some games and we proceeded to enjoy the afternoon together.  Loving the XBox 360 Kinect!!  It's for all ages.
5.0	"Test of time was simply an edition of Civ2 that could have been released to current owners as an upgrade.  HOWEVER, if you do not already own the game it is WONDERFUL.  It really has some kick butt upgrades to a nearly-perfect game.<br />I have played Civilization games for nearly 8 years now.  I first began to play in 1996, and have continued on with the latest versions ever since.<br />First note: if you have Civilization 2, the major upgrade here is the ability to play against other humans AND an alien race.<br />Second: this pack also includes some quite impressive scenarios and fantasy settings.  Which force us \\""old-hands\\"" to go back and learn some new tricks.<br />Third: with the trip to Alpha Centauri, you are granted MORE units.  Units are expanded drastically.  This is an AWESOME addition to the originial game.<br />Overall, the beauty of this game is that is is deep, yet easy to learn. It is fun, but not \\""arcade-like\\"". There is strategy, but it is tempered with action.<br />You can be: diplomatic or iron-fisted, peaceful or war-like, science oriented or a land-grabber or even a money grubber.<br />This game has nearly every facet of enjoyment that you could hope for. The most amazing thing is that you learn something new almost everytime you play.<br />The key features to the game are as follows:<BR>1) Build Cities and Improvements (like aqueducts, etc)<BR>2) Build Wonders of the World (which give you special traits)<BR>3) Establish trade routes<BR>4) Conquer Enemies<BR>5) Ally with friends (or those you might betray!)<BR>6) Expand your population<BR>7) Build and send a space ship to Alpha Centauri<BR>8) Once on Alpha Centauri, you build a NEW civilization.<br />Simply put, this game is stunning. You will lose many good hours of your life into it...and never feel an iota of guilt or regret.<br />This game works well on all PCs from a Pentium 90 and up, so if your machine is older, no worries.<br />This is unquestionably the best strategy game I have ever played."
5.0	I got this as a part for the Skylander's game that I had also ordered; it was a Christmas gift for a friend's 12 year old son.  According to my friend, her son loved the game, and the portal worked just fine.
1.0	does not work for slim xbox consoles!! tried on my new one and it didnt work so i put in my bfs old xbox and it worked! im so disappointed in this product
5.0	This game was my childhood. As a 20 year old girl I say this remake lives up to its name. I didnt buy the new c stick 3 ds but this game is fantastic on my 3ds xl New features like the bomers notebook and the &#34;hint&#34; stone have been added.<br /><br />Welcome back to Termina
5.0	Great to display controllers and give them a permanent spot in the house. Batteries charge relatively quickly and last about 5 hrs on one charge.
1.0	I bought this game for my son's birthday.  It was fun and worked fine for three weeks.   Suddenly the game would not work any more but would instead display a list of runtime errors.  I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling the game with the same runtime errors displaying. If I had it to do all over again I would have bought a bicycle.  I will not ever buy another EA game.
5.0	"As a kid, our family owned one of the first IBM PCs, and MS Flight Simulator version 1!  Over the years, I've bought each new version of Flight Simulator and usually I bought a new PC to fly it.  When FS-X came out, I don't think there was a PC on the planet that could fly FS-X with all the settings on max.  (Well, maybe Microsoft had some, and maybe a few people built their own machines that came close, but I'm still not sure that in Oct 2006 when X first came out, that flying the simulator with all settings maxed out was a good experience for anyone).  Almost everyone's review says the same thing, basically, \\""you will need a very powerful PC and a huge/fast graphics card, lots of memory, etc...\\""<br /><br />But the question remained, just how much of a PC do you need if you want a good experience with all the settings maxed out?  A few weeks ago, I took delivery of a new PC with:<br /><br />* Intel Quad Core i7-920 2.66GHz<br />* ATI Radeon HD 5870 graphics card (1GB of memory on the video card)<br />* 12GB tri-channel 1066 memory on the mother board<br />* Windows 7 Pro (64bit)<br />* A 7200rpm 1TB Hard drive<br /><br />And yes, now I can max out all the settings in Flight Sim X and still get 20-30 frames per second, very smooth!  In populated cities (with all the settings on Max, and I do mean all) you will see frame rates at times like 15-20 but the planes are still very flyable, and it's not too jerky).<br /><br />I am not over clocking my CPUs, and even though I know we can get faster CPUs, I do believe the Intel Core i7 920 2.66GHz processor is fast enough for most of us to get FS-X running well -- but only if you also get a very large and fast video card.  In my case, the manufacturer of my PC (the one in Texas) offered a few graphics cards, and I just got the biggest one they had (some of you know you that you can put 2 video cards - connected, in a PC for a lot of money, but I don't think that's needed for this simulator).  I'm guessing that anything smaller or slower than my card would have some impact on some of the settings in FS-X (my card supports DirectX 11, though DirectX 10 might have been enough).  I do know that 12Gigs of Ram is overkill for FS-X; you don't need that much to max out the settings in FS-X (I'd recommend at least 4Gigs of ram, more if you want to run other larger programs at the same time.<br /><br />Win 7 Pro (and Ultimate) let you run older programs in compatibility mode, such as Win XP, or Win 95 mode.  I'm running FS-X in native Win 7 mode.  My Win 7 is 64 bit, which helps the operating system address (support) more than a few Gigs of memory, among other benefits, but it's possible if you had Win7 32bit with 4Gigs of ram and a very fast video card - you would also be pleased with the Flight Sim X performance.<br /><br />As always, your mileage may differ, but I finally have a PC that can flight Slight Sim X really nicely!er or slower than my card would have some impact on some of the settings in FS-X (my card supports DirectX 11, though DirectX 10 might have been enough).

1.0	ok, i wanted to like this game. i almost liked it for about 1 minute, and then it got sooooo boring. i was ready to return it after 5 minutes. PLEASE dont get this game if you dont like boredom.
5.0	I had heard good reviews about this game so you can imagine my excitement when a friend actually gave me a full promotional copy of it! It hasn't left my 360 since that day two weeks ago!  Amazing realism, graphics and fun!
5.0	"This is one of the best Gamecube games released so far. The graphics squeeze out every last bit of power the Gamecube has to offer. The gameplay is excellent and the sound effects are second to none. A couple levels are a bit \\""off course\\"" like the bombing mission and dogfight, but they do not last long. The German and American uniforms & weapons are spot on as is the enemy AI. These guys take cover and stay there. Some of the animation is great, such as the time I tossed a grenade into an enemy machine gun nest and the explosion blew the gunner into a tree....where he hung in the branches. Very cool. As the last wave of games hit the Nintendo, now is the time to see what this little box is capable of. Call Of Duty 2 is about 80% as good looking as the X Box 360 version, and that's an amazing feat!"
5.0	Ok now we can get rid of batteries and save up alot money , i use for 8hours no problem
5.0	I just got this game and was amazed by its graphic nature and subject matter. It's absolutely fantastic! You can cruise around doing whatever or earn some money doing jobs for organized crimes. There plenty of variety and this game just doesn't get boring. Must have for PS2.
5.0	Star Wars the Force Unleashed is a truly underrated Star Wars experience.  Star Killer is a great character to get attached to, and the story takes interesting turns and the plot surely thickens.  A great game, even if you dislike the star wars franchise.
5.0	i got this for my daughter for christmas she loves it she plays it all the time even my youngest knows how to play
5.0	This game is amazing, the gameplay is smooth and simple but if you want more of a challenge you could always change the difficulty. Amazing graphics and intro. Def recommend to gamers and fanatics alike.
5.0	You gotta love this game!<br /><br />This is one of the most hilariously violent games I've played! With goodies like the opponent repulsificator and the solid-granite car, delight and laughter takes me over every time sit down to play Carmageddon 2.<br /><br />Exploding pedestrians, pedestrian flame-throwers, the pedestrian electro-[...] ray... these are power-ups you can get in the game! Whether you turn your opponents into scrap metal or act a fool around the gigantic levels, the fun does not stop.<br /><br />And the game has a way of scaring you. I recall being terrified at so many moments while playing this game.<br /><br />Examples: Is that Hans Abba around the corner? Where is that vicious dump truck? My car is in awful shape and I can't find a repair power-up.<br /><br />You can pop-wheelies and in certain cases go so fast that you can commit suicide. The game has incredible value because you can purchase your trashed opponents cars. If you get into it, you will feel the need to progress.<br /><br />The game is about much more than destroying other cars. Some missions are wacky beyond belief. One I recall involves killing mental patients that have escaped from an asylum. That is one of the harder missions.<br /><br />The game is long, there are plenty of missions, and if you don't feel like killing people, you can always race. This game is off-the wall. It's like combining Grand Theft Auto, Simpsons Road Rage, and Burnout 3. And it's over 5 years old!<br /><br />This game is a classic. Let us not forget the kangraoo bounce power-up. Nor the low gravity mode. Nor the hand-brake... man I love the hand-brake. If you have the time, play this game until you get good enough to appreciate the madness within.<br /><br />Oh yeah - the sound track is by Iron Maiden. This game is awesome!
5.0	The game arrived in great condition!<br /><br />Sadly I cannot play it due to my laptop dying, but the service was great and I can't wait to officially play this for myself!
5.0	Bought this for my college aged son - he is enjoying playing it now that he is on break.  I think  you should watch the Age ratings....younger kids don't need to see these images!
1.0	"I played this game as wizard and barbarian and got to act 3 inferno on both.Inferno needs tuning and it is no fun atm. game is gear dependent to the core and resulting in two type of game plays:<br />1- as a gamer, which you spend countless hours of your precious life playing it to get better gear<br />2- as a money spender, which you spend money to get what first group got from drops.<br />in first case you burn your brain out to finish inferno and in second case you burn your pocket out to get to inferno.<br />in both cases \\""fun\\"" is out of the equation.<br />I believe game designers did a terrible job as they had almost 10 years to create something phenomenal and they didn't.<br />repeating 4 acts 4 times over is terrible. loot drops are terrible. forcing you to upgrade gear and still get your head crushed in inferno because of impossible mechanics is terrible.<br />game play is not skill dependent which is again \\""terrible\\"". creativity is zero in this game and I am sorry for blizzard that made it so. I also feel sorry for myself that I exchanged hours of my precious life for nothing."
5.0	I had this on the PS2 & it is even better on the PS3. Great animation,Looks just like the movie with the PS3! lots of levels to go threw!! FUN,FUN,FUN!
5.0	really like that 2 people can play it on the same screen
5.0	Got the controller, and it works! :) The only thing it needed was to have the thumb joystick replaced, but that was a minor detail that was instantly repaired. Other than that, it's mint!
5.0	I have had this game for many years, It would no longer download I needed to find it again because I love this game.
5.0	excellent very happy purchase
5.0	Thank You very much for your speedy service. It was for a gift and it came so fast and way before the time I needed it. I really appreciate the fast service and the good price! Thank You very much!
5.0	Was a gift for 7 year old nephew and he really loved it.  He plans to try others in the Ratchet Clank family.
5.0	I think I would like the game more if not for the battle system. It's not normal; you fight using a card system and I just don't enjoy it...at all. It makes me not even want to play, to be honest. I would like to play the game through to get the story out of it, but I don't see that happening. I feel like I've wasted my money on this product.
1.0	Let me start off by saying that this isn't a review of the game Dawn of War II, since I could never install it.<br /><br />The problem is this; the seller, BLS Mart, apparently thinks customers in the United States are using European computers that have access to the Steam account system in Europe.  This was bought as a Christmas present, and I failed to notice it was a European version, or to be more precise, a Netherlands version, before wrapping it and placing it under the tree.<br /><br />To my surprise, when it was opened by my son on Christmas morning, he asked me, &#34;Why can't I read anything that's printed on this box inside?&#34;  Needless to say, we couldn't get the product to work.  Nowhere in the product description does it mention that this is a European version.  I did notice in hindsight that the box art has the European rating designation in the lower left corner, but come on, is it really my responsibility to examine the images that closely if it's not in the product description?<br /><br />I called Amazon on Christmas day, and they assured me that they would accept a return for a full refund, even though the software had been opened.  I was also able to purchase the correct version of the software directly from Amazon and was able to download the software without a hitch, although in the end I had to pay $5.00 more.  I guess you get what you pay for.  i wish I could rate the seller and game separately, since my son thoroughly enjoys it and I would give the game itself five stars.  I'm still not a big fan of the Steam thing, but I guess that's what we have to live with these days in the software industry's fight to stop piracy.<br /><br />As for BLS Mart?  Epic fail for deceptive retail practices.  If I could give them a zero, I would.
5.0	We loved the mike because voices come through clear, and it's durable. It worked out great for our karaoke party.
5.0	I bought this game for my son for Christmas on the Wii Platform.  He has the FIFA 09 for PS2 and I have to say that the Wii FIFA 11 is leaps and bounds a head in terms of options, controls, graphics and from what I can see everything else.  My son and I have had many battles so far with him coming out the victor mostly as he's a much better gamer than I but the controls are very simple and very straight forward.  As far as a soccer game goes, this game is pretty awesome and I would recommend it to anyone who is a soccer fan and owes a Wii.
5.0	First I would like to say the the price was VERY competative. On top of that, it arrived days BEFORE estimated. That is ALWAYS a good thing! I would purchase from you again!
5.0	How excited was my son to recieve this for x mas.  He has played it alot and enjoys playing with others around the world.
5.0	All I need now is the rechargeable battery pack. However it works great, just what I expected and it was fun to play 3 people instead of 2.
1.0	"Hello everyone!! I am a 16 year old and I have ALWAYS been a Sony fan, my friend got this same exact controller off amazon, usually all the items on amazon are real and no bootlegs but I have something bad to tell all of you... If you EVER try buying this all I have to say is... IT IS FAKE. The controller is junk, it skips, Start button does not always work, barely holds charge and the MOST noticeable is the \\""P3\\"" symbol instead of the \\""PS3\\"" Home button. It also is made with sharp edges which is not supposed to be made like, Sony always takes the time to round off those sharp edges for better, and less annoying gaming. So if you do not believe me, fine, whatever, go and buy the piece off junk FAKE PS3 Controller and experience it for yourself."
5.0	Fit wiimotes perfectly.  No more hand cramping  while playing super Mario bros or mario kart! Came in original packaging and arrived super fast!
5.0	Item was exactly as described.
5.0	This game is very good. A very true expansion to the original. It continues the story not long after the end of Starcraft 2. Fun and entertaining. Campaign is not as long as Starcraft 2.
5.0	A great way to end this great TG game series. I guess the only flaws are the endings. I kind of agree there should of been another ending where the female version of the main character would have ended up with a different male character. Also I wished the Female Main Character/Kouji ending would have been a lot longer, maybe dealing with marriage, having children, etc.
5.0	Is the Wii U.... No need to say more!! 😀😀😀
1.0	"UPDATE:    FUN: * * * (3 stars)  OVERALL: * * * (3 stars)     Well, below is the review I wrote after a couple of hours of gameplay. As someone else said, it starts out slow and then the story develops. Later in the game you get couple of new guns and new \\""FREAKS\\"" show up!  -It seems someone did not pay a lot of attention to detail for the weapons. If there are 3 rounds left and i push in 5 more rounds to make total of 8 rounds..you don't need to pump the shotgun..a round is already in the muzzle. You pump the shotgun if you completely run out of rounds and feed fresh 8 rounds, now you need to pump one into the chamber before you can fire.   Apparently...this is something simple and should be expected of all FPS by now. ITs little things and attention to detail that make all the difference between a 3 Star and 5 Start FPS     Most importantly,   This game is the most \\""SCARY\\"" game ever. (period)       -----------------------  -----------------------  Overall, this game is weak!  The only good things about this game are the Graphics.   The Game play is bad, same old going through levels and shooting bad guys. Same old guns that make sad sounds. You are playing the whole game is darkness...but if you need a Flash light you need to switch to Flashlight and then switch back to the weapon you were using. \\""what the heck, can I not have my flash light taped to my gun\\"".   and them, you are at a Top notch research facility (Weapons research and what not ) but there are is no Night Vision goggle's. You fire the same old guns...that ofcourse look different but are no better.    Let me put it this way:   Half-Life was better than this game (except the Graphics)  and lets not even start comparing it with HALO, cause this game is not even close to HALO.   oh and did I mention, this game has to RE-PLAY value to it.  Do NOT buy this game, you'll just end up wasting your money. Wait for Half-Life2 and HALO2 to come out, I can bet they will be better than this piece of junk."
1.0	Very flimsy the back buttons get stuck not worth the purchase.
5.0	This thing was cheaper than buying a controller all by itself and it came with a really long cord to charge it AND an HDMI cable. Cant beat that!
5.0	this is a great item. It helped me so much when playing my games and it made it easy to play the wii while i was sick. this is a great buy and i would recomend it to anyone
5.0	The kids have really enjoyed this game.They think the sound effect noises are funny.The graphics are good.
5.0	I am a pretty hardcore gamer and a big fan of competitive online play and i find the sharpshooter a refreshing change from the dualshock.  After a few hours of getting used to the controls i was back to getting Mvps almost every round.  SNiping or just long range shots works so well .  Learning to turn around quickly might take alittle longer but its still definately doable.  I have yet to even turn on my dualshock controller.  Only problem i have is after 3 or so hours my arm starts to get alittle tired. :D
5.0	My 6 year old son loves this game and has played it through twice.  I have played it also and have enjoyed it also.
5.0	These controllers work very well. I have three very minor issues. One, since they are white dirt shows up very easily (makes me realize how disgusting my hands are). Two, the buttons stick just a tiny bit, but not game breaking wise. Three, the cords are slightly shorter than a licensed Nintendo controller (which these are NOT, just to let you know). But I still give it five stars, because they are soooo much cheaper than a Nintendo controller, and really there isn't much difference between the quality of the two, so save your money and get these instead.
5.0	This game offers game play with no end, there is not only mini games where you can win prizes...but you also can play fetch and many other games with your petz.  You can breed mixed dogs or purebred...and can even do selective breeding.    Beyond the game: One of the coolest things about Petz is the online community, there is many sites with custom breeds and petz...as well as online dog shows!  A great experience for all ages and a wonderful way to meet new people.    [...]
5.0	This was a birthday gift for my son who loved these for his games. They work really well and he absolutely loves them.
5.0	Live it fits everything and doesn't loose anything for ur anymore
5.0	These controllers are quite sturdy, and will take some abuse. I have a 3 year old son who has tested this for me. ;-)
1.0	This doesn't sit on your TV correctly I'm not sure if mine was missing something but it didn't have the sticky bottom like the original one did
5.0	I lack a social life.  I'm just thankfull that April's always there to take me on an adventure when I'm bored.  April's my dream date: smart, artistic, funny, and rather attractive...and what's a more romantic date than one that involves saving the world together? Kidding aside, this game seriously rejuvinates the adventure game genre.  I dread the day I finish this adventure because its so engrossing I just don't want it to go away. Pick up a copy and enjoy!
5.0	this game is the best because it has everything you what.
5.0	The game is fun,and I wood give it as a gift! .<br />My grandson loves this game thay play it alot.
5.0	finally, we have a charging station that works. . .all remotes are charged quickly, and the subtle lights produce a nice effect at night
5.0	The Final Fantasy series has always held a special place in my heart.  I love a game that I can obsess upon, spending countless hours playing, internet searching for, and overall thinking about.  This installment is no exception. <br /> <br />The game follows Tidus, a spunky teenager mysteriously transported to another land.  He joins a group of varied allies in order to learn more about the land and find clues to how he got there in the first place. <br /> <br />The game uses a great battle system, and allows the player to switch characters in and out on-the-fly.  Each character has unique abilities that are useful throughout the game.  Battles are usually not hard, if you use the characters properly. <br /> <br />The storyline is what kept me playing the game.  I always wanted to find out what happens next.  Even when the game ended, I wanted to know what was going to happen.  It's very original and avoids most of the RPG cliches from older games. <br /> <br />Yes, the voice acting is, at times, subpar.  Yes, the sphere grid (the method of advancing your characters) gets repetitive and tedious.  But overall, this game has very few of the flaws of RPGs of the past.  There are no cheesy hour long tutorials at the beginning of the game, and it's quite simple to pick up the system. <br /> <br />You may hate a character throughout the game, but you will probably learn to love one of the others.  The characters are all well developed and have clear motives for their actions. <br /> <br />Overall, this is a great game worthy of a few play throughs.  It is a great addition to the Final Fantasy series.
5.0	I've played pokemon ever since Pokemon Yellow came out.  I remember the thrill of finding a new creature I'd never seen before, battling to see its weaknesses and collecting all of the rare (and ultimately the coolest looking) Pokemon.  I got into high school and started thinking I was too cool for pokemon, but secretly I still preordered Pearl.  Then Pokemon Black came out and the Pokemon on the screen ACTUALLY MOVED!  I thought nothing would ever be more cool than that.  Until I played Pokemon Y.  Gone are the days of animated sprites and 2-dimensional motion on a slightly detailed overworld.  Pokemon Y introduces the most intricately designed world Pokemon has seen yet.  Your character can wear a bunch of different outfits and every single Pokemon are 3D models with full animation.<br />A lot of people argue that another generation of pokemon is bad, that all it does is complicate and over-do an almost 20-year-old franchise.  While it is true that there are now &#62;700 Pokemon, don't let that be a factor.  The designs for the Pokemon are more detailed than in previous generations, but in a game that is literally all about evolution, is it too far out of the question to assume the designs themselves will evolve?<br />The multiplayer functionality in this game is done better than any other Pokemon game.  Over WiFi you can battle and trade with perfect strangers (most of which reside in an entirely separate region) and perform completely random trades over the Wonder Trade service.  There's also situations in which you and 3 other people can all do a group battle, which is pretty cool.<br /><br />If you haven't played pokemon in years, get this game.  It's new enough that you'll need to do some catching up, but it isn't so new that first-time players won't know how to get started.<br /><br />This is by far the greatest game in the Pokemon series and it's one that every 3DS owner should own.
5.0	Final Fantasy VII is the best RPG ever created.  In fact, I could quite easily say it's the best game in general ever made. And to think it was made in 1997!  People, shouldn't technoligy towards games be improving?  Guess not, because it's almost 2001 and I still haven't found a better game. And a good thing for you tight-wads is that it only costs $20. With the best storyline, graphics, gameplay, ect. everfoung in an RPG it's worth much more than....  It's good for people with lots of time, 'cause it'll take you 80+ hours to beat it.  Even after you beat it you probally missed out on a lot of things, meaning every time you play it you'll most likely find something new.
5.0	No problems at all with game. Arrived when it was suppose to... Very satisfied.
5.0	Wonderful, very helpful and exactly as advertised!
5.0	A great game!  My kids love playing it and since there are so many objectives, this is one of the few games they didn't beat within two or three weeks of starting!
5.0	Pokémon gale of darkness ; Animal Crossing ; Harvest moon These are a few of my favorite things<br />and a great reason for having a Gamecube!.
5.0	I always purchase these cards for my boyfriend through Amazon. We love to play WoW but I love to spoil him by getting him these cards every once in a while. The shipping is always extremely fast (go, UPS!) & the cards work like a charm.    I guess my one complaint would fall on the lap of UPS. They pack the card in a ginormous box & use the air bag things to fill it up. Why not save packaging & use a much smaller box? No need to waste that much space on this little card.
5.0	Grab one as soon as you can! Original ones from Nintendo, and at this price! Maybe they sold out already, if not, don't wait! You can't buy them in ebay for less than $50!
5.0	This game is one of the best MMORPG's i've ever played (and that's saying something). Great graphics, instanced dungeons for training customized to your level and class. Customizable faces, hundreds of weapons, the list goes on and on. I would recommend this game to anyone interested in MMORPG's.
5.0	real classic, brings back a lot of good gaming days, works perfect. will continue to shop here.
5.0	Simply the best on the market right now.  Level 1 (of 3) is cake. However, Level 2 is pretty intense w/ some extremely nasty monsters (learn to save game ASAP as soon as you sense ANY mantraps because you will be killed almost every time you meet one until you master blanketing them w/ top level spells - which always works - unless you're standing too close or the software lets them beat up on you first, in which case you're still dead). Level 3 rocks. A word to the wise: this software is NOT compatible w/ Windows 2000, even w/ patches, so beware &amp; have fun killing everything that crosses your path.
5.0	Just another great Sims 3 game. I highly recommend it. If you are a fan of the Sims 3 you won't be disappointed.
5.0	this game is a great fighting game  and it is easy to do i recomanded this game for kids 5-99 ignore the rating guide they  dont know violence if it came out of there #####
5.0	I'm quick to not read instructions, but the little signs on the plastic  made it easy for me to get the right piece on the correct area.  Not bad at all, had a few air bubbles but its not affecting my playing.    Great product!
5.0	I am really enjoying this game, already have the first two, the story is great, not great like a work of art, more great like watching a bad movie with friends. me and my wife were in stitches laughing at it and having fun playing/ taking turns dancing the songs. outside the story mode it is also a great party game.
5.0	I have a motion control, navi control, 4 ps3 controllers, and a blutooth. This thing is a space saver. I'll keep two controllers in the living room, and the rest will charge. The lights are bright and pretty and it works great.
5.0	One of my favorite fighting games. Graphics are great, the game is not disappointing if you're a fan of marvel.
5.0	I ordered this item for my six-years-old son and he loved it. He always plays with it, so I recommend it. It came in excellent conditions.
5.0	I waited so long to buy a Wii that they came out with the Wii U and I am very glad I waited, this system is awesome. No issues and I am awaiting my purchases Wii games to test the backward compatibility. My children have a Wii at their father's and like the Wii U a lot more than the Wii, there is more to do...can play multi-player games (Nintendo Land) with one person using the game pad, doing different actions, then the other person(s) using remotes and the tv. This makes it fun to play hide and seek type games (Mario Chase) or playing Pikman with the Captain being on the game pad and using different controls. There is a camera, so, while playing Wii Fit you can use the camera to make sure you are doing yoga poses correctly and probably other things I am not aware of. The Wii U is great and the children enjoy Mario and Nintendo land (although I might enjoy Nintendo Land more than them).
5.0	I keep 2 games in each cartridge slot although I don't push the second one all the way in just in case. 2 Styli on the stylus slot and the microfiber in little pocket. 5/5
5.0	First you place fences ( make sure that you made a big enough enclosure ) , then you place the animal home ( the place where the animal(s) live ) then you place feed ( make sure you hired an Animal Keeper to keep feed in it ) then water, toys, trees ( depending on the specie ) <br />and when your animal feels comfortabble in its enclosure you will hire a vet(for the whole park)  and a play mate if it is smart and intelligent. I will not get in to much detail on the visitors . Well this game wins with me!
5.0	I've played the entire campaign three times and DotA .... ummm .... at least 10,000 matches ... I need a shrink!<br /><br />Nuff Said.<br /><br />PS: Answer to the title = ADDICTIVE!
1.0	This was a rip off and it took advantage of people whose children wanted it for Christmas I was very disappointed at the price and shipping.  I live in a small town and could not find it locally
5.0	"By now, the PS3 has been extensively reviewed and this latest iteration (the \\""slim\\"") has been out in the 120gb format for 2 months now (since September 1st, 2009).    To summarize the benefits:  - Slimmer, lighter, and more energy efficient than the prior \\""fat\\"" PS3  - Blu-ray player built-in  - Netflix streaming (yay!)  - Free online service (vs. subscription based X-box live)    The negatives:  - No backwards compatibility with PS2 games  - Bluetooth remote only (and not included, so need to purchase [[ASIN:B000M17AVO a remote]] to use as a dvd/blu-ray player, no IR (but a number of bluetooth-to-IR solutions like [[ASIN:B00267S7XW Logitech Harmony Adapter]] or [[ASIN:B002AUG6OW Infra-red to Bluetooth Adapter]])  - No more Linux support    With Blu-ray player prices now dropping to the $100-$150 range, the PS3 makes for an expensive option as a Blu-ray player only.  As a home media center player/HTPC device, it really shines and is a great deal (you can't build a HTPC with a blu-ray player for less).  It IS somewhat limited, however, as a HTPC as its browser is not up to par.  Too bad Sony dropped linux support for the PS3.  The addition of Netflix streaming (currently requiring a disc but supposedly becoming native in a future firmware update) just ices this cake.    edit to address the HD upgrade issue:  Yes, you can buy the 120gb for $50 less and, yes, you can install whatever capacity 2.5\\"" hard drive you'd like fairly easily as long as you're willing to pay for a new hard drive.  BUT, considering that (1.) you'd still have to spend extra money (more than the $50 difference), (2.) spend time and effort to upgrade and (3.) you'd then have an extra 120gb hard drive afterwards to go through the hassle of ebaying (unless you turn it into another usb/backup drive--I've got too many as it is).  I find that it is just not worth it.  Spend the extra $50, get the 250gb installed by Sony and warrantied by Sony."
5.0	Best gaming mouse I ever bought...works perfect with Dota...
5.0	I bought this game some time ago and was just reminded I have it. Been busy editing my books.. Haven't been playing many games recently.  However I just wanted to make sure I say this is one of the best games ever.  I'm trying to get the entire Cradle Of series.  They're so much fun and teach you about history too! One of the best match three series out there. Highly recommended!
5.0	Item was just what I wanted. Good transaction.
1.0	Received it yesterday at launch. PS4 was DOA. Flashing blue light and it wouldn't even go into safe mode. Luckily it only took me 2.5 hours on the phone with Sony to start the return process. I am hoping that i will get a replacement faster then sending it back to Amazon.<br /><br />Speaking of Amazon WTF were they thinking when they packaged these? They just threw it in a box with some air padding. The box looked like it had been dropped and thrown around a few dozen times.
5.0	Overall this game is killer and far better than Far Cry 2. If you are concerned the poor quality of Far Cry 2 will follow it does not at all. Far Cry 3 could stand alone as itself as just Far Cry it is by far the best game they have made yet for the series and drives the other two frankly out of memory if you have played like I have. The graphics are deep and rich, gameplay like all games can get slightly repetitive but the immersive storyline more than makes up for it and overall Far Cry 3 is a standout game and one that should definitely be considered one of the best for 2012.
1.0	I would have to say over all Goldeneye is waaaaaaaay better. This game has good graphics but the plot sucks and so do the guns. The multiplayer mode is terrible and there is no AI bots, and the levels are sooooooooooo tiny. This game over all sucks compared to Goldeneye.
1.0	I got it and though it said it was in working condition, the console doesn't work, you can play music, and even copy it, but when it comes to the games, which i have quite a few, the game moves to the right and you can't do anything, I even tried a different controller, nothing same result, you state it's in good working order, and it was a lie. I don't accept that, it wasn't exactly cheap. not pleased at all, I have it in my closet gathering dust, shameful
5.0	Works exactly as intended. Plays your Game Boy games on the SNES. No hunting down batteries when you are on the last boss of Link's Awakening! Remember that full color games will not work on this, only original GB games, or color games that are playable in an original Game Boy console. You can adjust borders and palette colors on the games for some cool effects, though.
5.0	Mi hijo junto con todos sis amigos Han distrust ado mucho de este juego adem&aacute;s de hacerlos hacer ejercicio, el juego es muy divertido
5.0	This headset here is by far the best headset i have ever owned in my life. I have owned the x11's, the x31's and the dpx21's. Some people say they are overpriced, which is true but you get what you pay for. Here is some cons and pros about this headset.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Booming bass<br />Great highs and Mids<br />No crackles or pops<br />Good Battery life<br />Easy to charge<br />Can use at school to listen to music with bluetooth.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Pricy<br />Short range, barely can make it 25 feet and it looses connection<br />Cant hook up to my pc.<br /><br />These are way better than the 3 other turtle beaches i have had. If you got the moolah to afford these then go for it. Some ppl say its not 7.1. Honestly I dont hear a diffrence between 7.1 and 5.1. I think its just preference.
1.0	It does not stay charged. I only had it two weeks and it died. The only way I can use it is by plugging it in with a cord witch eliminated the propose of a wireless.
5.0	This game is even more fun than the previous (Wii and GameCube) versions. Highly, highly recommended as a fun party game for all ages and skill levels.
1.0	see  the comments that accompany wii dance two  no instruction and figure is backward and almost impossible for people to follow
5.0	ONE OF THE BEST GAMES YOU CAN NEVER GET BORED OF. GREAT PRICE FOR SOO MUCH FUN.
5.0	i got the one that was in the picture, with the four pockets. the pockets were just a little snug, but if they weren't then the games would end up falling out. it has some smell, but its not smoke smell. just that weird new smell.
1.0	The Xbox One Manual states clearly that you are NOT to set it on its side! How amazon allows items like this to be sold proves they dont review products they sell. THIS WILL BREAK YOUR XBOX AND DAMAGE ANY DISC YOU INSERT INTO IT! If i could give zero stars i would.
5.0	This unit is far better than its predecessor. It's well-made, easier to hold and use, and offers a much better plaform for interesting games.<br />It really should come with a backlight option, however (are you listening, Nintendo?)
5.0	A must for any Yoshi fan!
5.0	Im very happy with this battery pack, especially when you are forced to buy a single battery/charger for $20.00 in stores. These blue batteries hold a good charge just like the black ones.
5.0	The product came in as beautiful as it was depicted online. Best money that I ever spent. Absolutely loved it!
1.0	This headset is the worst.<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />Looks cool. Sound is sufficient except FULL BLAST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! On PC when you turn it on until you hit your volume button. Once you hit the volume button, the sound goes to where it should have been the whole time.<br /><br />CONS:<br />The headband is TOO TIGHT for everyone. If you have glasses forget about it. This is going to give you a headache. I modified mine by taking out the rinky dink undersized barely stretchy elastic band out and replacing it by sewing in elastic from a pair of boxers. This helps 500% but the ear cups will still destroy your head if you wear glasses and is very uncomfortable to ANYONE.<br /><br />Sound is just barely good enough. When there is no sound playing, prepare to hear all sorts of interference. Walking around a corner of your house 10 feet away? BLEEP BEEEP!!!! Volume changes tone pitch and loudness. It is like it pushing the &#34;change channel&#34; button on old cordless phones.<br /><br />Battery life is ok though.<br /><br />I hate hate hate hate this headset and it is the worst thing I have bought in many years. AVOID THIS HEADSET!
5.0	GREAT for two PS4 controllers
1.0	I had some problems with this product it kept messing up at critical times during game play example I would suddenly run in the wrong direction but unplugging it then plugging it back in would fix the problem I would not buy this product again
5.0	There was a little trouble getting it set up but once that was taken care of it did exactly what I hoped it would.
5.0	I purchased this as a gift for my fiance. We had seen many youtubers play this game and decided to give it a shot.<br />This game is addicting! I love that it is relaxing and offers an entire world to explore. It can be confusing what to do at first so just start chopping wood down and digging. This game will offer you many many hours of entertainment!
1.0	I have been playing AOM the last 10 years. Lately, I bought a MacBook pro and installed parallels in order to continue playing this game. Unfortunately, it doesn't work. It seems it will only run in windows environment and I mean Windows only...not windows on a mac.
1.0	The installer and every game I tried attempted to make unsafe changes to my PC including the windows.ini file and explore.exe. My anti-virus program identified these and did the correct thing when it tried to block them.  Nobody who is not a super PC wiz should get this because changes like these can ruin your PC.    That said, there were no where near 1001 games, more like 100, and the main program's UI seem designed to encourage game purchases and not access to what you thought you already bought.
1.0	I'm with the majority on this one. This is a TERRIBLE program, well below the standards you would normally associate with the Disney brand. My 4 year-old, who is well-versed in children's computer software, lost interest almost immediately. The games are boring, lack depth and replay value, and are difficult to operate--most use the arrow keys to navigate instead of the mouse or track ball which we use. The printing projects lack choices, although they do produce nice output. All in all, a major disappointment.<BR><BR>On the other hand, the Lion King 2 Activity Center program which we bought at the same time is excellent. I think that the reason for the inconsistency is that while these programs are commissioned and marketed by Disney Interactive, they are actually produced by different independent developers who apparently have a great deal of latitute in determining what goes into the finished product. Disney needs to exert more control on product definition and quality control if they want to avoid another black eye like this one.
5.0	Yeaaa! Now I can get HD on my Xbox! This really should be included with Xbox.
5.0	We used these to get our Grandson to love reading this summer.  He earned one for each real book he read.  He now reads above grade level.
5.0	Love my ps4 destiny!<br />Ok so my first one shipped to me had a faulty blue ray drive.<br />Amazon was fast on fixing that problem overnighting a new one (box dinged up a bit but a 100% working console). Hassle free Amazon experience!<br />Ps4 fixes all that was wrong with the ps3 making using the ps4 functions seamless and smooth.
1.0	Did not turn out as what I expected to be. The games instruction were rather confusing and there are no proper guide in the game to teach users how to maneuver and play the game unlike the Caesar IV game software which I also bought concurrently. Though I am used to many similar games like Pharaoh, Cleopatra and others, this game differ very much than the rest and is hard to navigate and to play even for an experienced player like myself. Rather disappointing experience. I quit playing it after few rounds of attempting at it blindly and feeling lost.
5.0	From when Sierra and Jane Jensen first started this series; the first game was slow moving and out of sync characters, their second was a 'real time' set of characters in a acual settings, and now the third installment is OUTSTANDING!  This game is well thought out, good storyline, original Gab from the first series(Tim Curry) as well as some other topline actors lend their voices to create a believable 3-D Adventure Game. Although the game has been out for nearly 2 years now, I, myself, have played the game now 3 different times. There is always something that may have been overlooked and/or undone. I am still awaiting an ever hopeful GK4 from Jane Jensen!!  Not to be missed for all Gabriel Knight fans! If you are a first timer to Adventure games or to Jane Jensen; there is no need to first play the previous two games before playing this game...as it is easy to 'drop-in' on the series. Well worth every penny.
1.0	I have absolutely not desire to play this game, now or ever. I purchased it for my Final Fantasy collection only.
5.0	The game is fantastic, non-stop action, I love it. The servers are a little laggy but overall great gaming experience.
5.0	Tropico is a &#34;build your own island&#34; SimCity-type game with a distinct tongue-in-cheek slant to its delivery. You take charge of a small tropical island as El Presidente, and it's up to you to figure out just how you're going to keep things running smoothly. Will you support the island economy through mining? Farming? Tourism? Will you strive to keep your citizens happy by offering them tax cuts and free housing, or will you just outlaw elections and surround your office with military bases in an attempt to thwart the monthly assassination attempts.<br /><br />The game's visuals are amazing. Every little detail is animated, and a great deal of time can be spent just &#34;flying&#34; over your island watching people go about their day. You can highlight any citizen and see their job, education, family tree, beliefs, and even their thought process. You may find several people upset that there are no luxury stores around, which lets you know to build a shopping mall that caters to high-end customers. You can also, if so desired, mark a random rebel or criminal to be arrested, assassinated or just to &#34;have an accident&#34;.<br /><br />As beautiful as the game is, its real appeal is deep within the mechanics that keeps everything running. Everything in Tropico is connected in one way or another. Building logging camps is a quick way to boost the economy and provide jobs, but angers environmentalists. Shallow displays of patriotism impresses the uneducated, but bothers the intellectuals. Quite a few times, you'll find that your island dwellers need healthcare and education, but the buildings will remain unoccupied until you find qualified staff to run them. Building a solid base early on is essential to a productive island later on.<br /><br />The music is catchy and infectious, but is way too short. The soundtrack is an earworm of the worst kind, and it's gotten to the point where I had to mute the music and start playing my own. I really wish there was additional music available for download, because it'd be a necessary purchase after just a few days of gameplay.
5.0	This is a very fun game for adults & kids both we all love it
5.0	Despite what others say (and my friends, who are obsessed with Heroes of Might &amp; Magic), Tanktics is a fun game.  For those who are tired of Annihilating or Conquering, Tanktics is a fun break.  Yes, it does has some drawbacks (micromanaging required, annoying AI, strange concept), but overall it is pretty fun.  I am not sure where to find this game for sale, but it is worth it.  It has lots of detail, and is fundamentally different from other RTS games.  Here's a brief overview:   You use sheep to run the Part-O-Matic.  When they tire, you must dip them in a liquid called Sheep Dip.  You build custom tanks from parts randomly built by the Part-O-Matic.  There are about 6 different weapon types, and each tank needs an engine for each part (slow=1 weapon, medium=2, fast=4).  Unlike other RTS games, blocking the enemy is bad.  You build parts from enemy tank parts, and gameplay is a constant balance in directing the tanks to your waiting forces.  Enemy tanks constantly search for the shortest route to your Part-O-Matic, by using the differing terrain (that certain tanks can cross and others can't), you can trap them and recycle their parts.  On 5-out-of-6 levels you must destroy the reciever (on the others you must steal the transmitter).  You must always be alert to enemy tanks that will &quot;beam in&quot; and mount sneak attacks.  Overall this game has 24 levels, plus 8 time-trials and several tutorials.   This game is fun, imaginative, and unique.  It is hard-to-find anywhere, but if you do find it I highly recommend it.  Why?  Because it's a really fun game!
5.0	My grandson loves this game... He was so excitied when it arrived and can't wait to play when he comes to nannying house
5.0	This game is hands down, absolutely, positively the best piece of videogame software ever made.<br />The action is just like real NFL football, the players are large and incredibly detailed, and it will change the way  you play console football forever.<br />Anyone that doesn't purchase this game  is missing out BIG TIME!!!!!
5.0	I bought as a gift for my son. He loves it!
5.0	This game is so much fun, a great way to spend the cold days of winter inside, wishing you were outside but this is the next best thing. Great entertainment.
1.0	This game sucks. TS3 and even TS2 where way better upon release.    But you can get your money back within the first 24 hours..  [...]
5.0	Where to begin?  Asheron's Call is incredible.  I won't explain all the MMRPG stuff here (I do that five times a day to my vidiot mom and dad), but I'll tell you it's crazily addictive.  Only play this if you don't mind  spending hours in front of the computer, watching the seasons cycle by  outside your window.  Or you'll be paying attention to the season cycle by  IN THE GAME.  That's a great thing about this game: it's dynamic (I won't  explain that term either).  Day turns into night, every December 16th snow  starts falling, other seasonal changes occur, cooking (yes, cooking) and  other contests begin and end, and the ever-changing story deepens with  every day spent (or even not spent) in Dereth.  The character creation  system, as well as the magic system, are both in-depth, easy, and fun to  use.  I wish I could write more than a thousand words about this game.  My  love for it is beyond description.
5.0	when i first played 2k1 i thought it was the same game as 2k the graphics are pretty much the same to the naked eye but some detail has changed. i love how they made the running game a bit easier to run with now you can have a running threat and passing threat.the receivers are awesome and they jump better and catch better than 2k.the defensive skems are wild the d.bs are harder to shake  they are able to pick balls off a lot easier so q.bs beware! the front line is raw they have specail moves and with big 300lb. lineman who would ever think that they move like ninjas and when the sacks come in you love the new sack dances they made up.they have a g.m mode that is what made me buy the game,i love to play the game but to sit back and play as the owner is the greatest feeling to control a team and make contract offers and trades you control who plays for you its as much fun as actually sitting behind the desk of the team you choose to represent wow all i can say is you must have this game it will make you donate the old 2k to a used game store
5.0	I love this game. The characters and set pieces are amazing. I love the story, and the characters are amazing. I feel connected to these people and aliens and my choices are hard to make at times. I was never interested in this game and simply purchased it because I had nothing to play, and my goodness it is great and I regret not getting into this sooner. Easily one of my favorite games and I have not even played part 3. Great game, must play for gamers.
5.0	this case is just what i needed. install was easy thanks to youtube videos. the supplied screwdrivers also saved me money.
5.0	We are book people so it has been difficult for me to find a game that I approve of for my son, this is fun for him, thank you.
1.0	Disk 1 was corrupted made DVD head just chatter, never would intall, shame it is a great simulator. Maybe I will order another????
5.0	I don't usually write reviews, but I thought I would this time to help people decide if they want to buy the move or not. I was hesitant at first, I wanted to wait for more games and more reviews to come out, but I ended up getting the starter pack this weekend.    First off, let me say, this thing is fun. I worked up a sweat playing Gladiators, and my arm still hurts from the archery. The controls of the Move are awesome! What ever little nuance you put into the controller, is transferred to the game. Turn the control around backwards, and the in game sword does as well. The Playstation eye, along with the Move controller, captures everything you do.    I considered getting a Navigation controller, but for right now it's not needed. I would suggest getting an additional Move controller though. In certain games it helps, but is not necessary. In Gladiators for Instance, one controller is your sword, and the other is your shield. If you only have one though it's not problem. With the push of an easy to access button, you start controlling your shield to block.    I can't wait for all the new games to come out, the Move is incredibly fun. I own a Wii as well, and the Move far surpasses the controls. Everything just feels natural, and it responds incredibly to your inputs.     If your on the fence whether or not to buy the Move starter bundle, I'd say get it. It comes with everything you need, and includes a bonus Blu-Ray disc with some upcoming games.
5.0	Bought this product because i like the 360 controller way better than the ps3 one. The turbo buttons all work great and fell good and tight. The rumble feature is nice and gives good feedback, i havnt seen any lag at all so there is no problem there. When im playing cod or killzone its just like playing on my friends 360. Really good product!!
5.0	excelente la atención muy buenos en el envió atento en todo momento tiene 5 estrellas<br /><br />saludo Sra. Angel Arias A
5.0	For those of you who are wondering if this is a good gift for the big kids in your life, stop now! I bought this for my husband at Christmas and he hasn't put it down yet. He even went out and bought more accessories for it already!
5.0	This item worked fine for me no delay. I've used it for MGS4, Tekken 6 and NBA 2k9. Worked fine for all three. And if it doesn't work on a steering wheel or sword or something, it's because it cost 10 bucks. Not because it's faulty.
5.0	Awesome game, starts off with some intensity right off the bat. Get it while you can!
5.0	I love this game my 7 year old son just beat this game and he is so happy!  The puzzles are hard enough to make kids really think, but it isn't too complicated.
5.0	I recently purchased the red skin but I have the exact same skins in various colors that I purchased over a year ago.  Overall I'm very satisfied.<br />Pros:<br />-Durable - They have stood up to repeated removals (by both kids and drunken adults) for charging, with no tearing or permanent stretching.<br />-Well Fit - They fit snugly. All the holes line up with the buttons.  It doesn't interfere with the nunchuck knob.<br />-Sleek looks - Not as bulky looking at the OEM remote covers.<br />-Grip - The material makes it easier to hold on to.<br />-Clean - Easy to clean.  Soap and water and it's like new (take the remote out first, of course).<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Install/Removal - Takes a bit of wiggling and sliding to put on and remove.  Part of the snug fit thing.  You get used to it after a while<br />-Charging - Removal may add an extra step to charging/battery replacement.  However, I have one of those charging stands that comes with rechargeable battery packs and all I have to do is peel the bottom up about an inch.<br /><br />I would recommend these as a low cost, better looking alternative to the OEM skins.
1.0	It doesnt work i guess. No idea,something doesnt work
5.0	I have a Sony DR-260 headset which I use to record voiceover on videos. The headset has a split cable with two mini-stereo connectors -- one for sound input (red) and one for sound output (black). It works perfectly with the Spectrum Audio Mixer. And the two volume controls make using the Xbox more enjoyable since the game sound and chatter are controlled by two different volume dials. Though you can buy a whole Xbox 360 compatible headset for the price of this mixer, I like having the freedom to  use my favorite, more comfortable, higher quality headset.
5.0	Very good game and shipping time
5.0	Lastimosamente es un juego muy corto, pero la excelencia grafica de la ambientacion infernal es impresionante.  Duramente criticado por su semenjanza a GOW, pero historias totalmente diferentes, basado en la primera parte de la Divina comedia.  1-Infierno.  2-Purgatorio.  3-Cielo.  Las ultimas 2 partes un poco dificil de imaginar en un juego de este tipo.  En esencia un juego excelente, cuenta con un par de contenidos extras descargables.  Violencia, sangre, lujuria, todos los pecados castigados aca.
5.0	This game iz awesum! It is SO much fun! I've spent MANY hours playing this game! It does get pretty hard. Its kinda like chess. And like in chess, wenever u lose 1 of your people in battle, theyre GONE! (well, 4 some u can see L8R and ask 2 come bak, but lets not get there;)And to let ya know, Marth and ROY (from Super Smash Bros. Melee 4 the gamecube)are NOT in this game!I think that they are descendants of Eliwood(Roy look-alike) and Hector(Marth look-alike only w/ a cool 2 sided axe!) this game requires you, like in chess, to make sure that your troops wont die in battle by making a careless mistake. Trust me, if u like ANY RPG on the GBA you will be hooked on this game 4 dayz!
5.0	I had bought a used controller for $45 at Gamestop and I returned it and got this one for $50 brand new with the charge kit! You can't beat that. Very responsive and would definitely recommend to others.
5.0	Love this game! Even its a pretty old one its still fun playing. Too bad there is no Black and White 3 there. I think it has great concept for strategy game! My family enjoys it :)
5.0	Got this for my husband to fix his broken harddrive. He opened it up & after a quick youtube video was able to take apart the old one & put This Shell on it, took him about 5 minutes to put together. Hooked it up & we have been using it ever sense. The price waa Awesome & it arrived super fast
5.0	Very pleased with the cord. Works great and very durable.
1.0	The buttons don't work properly and after the first time I played Tekken ,, the left analog sticks broke..<br />I do not recommend this failed attempt of a ps3 controller
5.0	Ok, you will see plenty of negative reviews for this game, but looking closely you will see that many of these reviews are cases against SecuROM, the DRM software embedded into this game. There are plenty of people complaining, many with reason and some with pure hatred, against SecuROM. Without negating or supporting their views, I would like to steer away the discussion from the DRM issues and focus instead on the game<br /><br />One Word: Amazing. Great game, worthy of all the positive reviews many critics have given it. You see, with time it's easy to grow tired of the same FPS strategy of shooting people over and over by different means or weapons. What Dead Space does is moving FPS into another dimension on genre where is difficult to do any real innovations: What if, instead of shooting people in the head or obliterating them with grenades/explosives, the player will have to dismember its enemies to be more effective? What if we make these enemies one of the most grotesque abominations seen in a game and frame them in a suffocating environment where danger is in every corner and you can never walk easy and unafraid? What if, in top of that, we make you a clumsy, weak and somewhat slow to react and run engineer, not a super-soldier, that would have to make an extra-effort to survive the horrors he is about to face using mostly modified tools and not real weapons? And, to make matters even more interesting, we add a superb soundtrack and all sort of background noises and pain laments that will make you shivers and more often than not jump from your seat and scream Jesus!?<br /><br />Think the original Alien movie and its superb Nostromo environments and story meet the superb mechanics, gameplay and graphics of Half-Life, meet Doom 3 in steroids and meet horror comic books, all in one package. It had been a long time for me that I hadn't enjoyed a game so much, you will see that you can't stop playing it and see how all the conspiracy and the story ends, while enjoying the challenges and increasingly harder-to-kill enemies while perfecting the art of dismembering. I put his game very high on my list of all the FPS games I've played, and I see few difficulties for this game to become a classic and be a strong competitor for game of the year awards. Yes, it's that good<br /><br />If you can live with SecuROM and don't mind much this increasingly DRM inanity in every single PC game out there, buy and play this game, you won't be disappointed. In the other hand, if you can't stand SecuROM or other invasive DRM methods then forget about it, possibly together with every single great upcoming PC game and seriously think on switching to a console. Or play this game on your X-box, if you have one, but don't let it pass!lenges and increasingly harder-to-kill enemies while perfecting the art of dismembering.

5.0	This Game Boy Advance Sp is really amazing and the service offered by Amazon was the best. I think I bought this console for some titles of nintendo that I couldn't find in any other game console some titles like metroid or mario. <br /> <br />
5.0	I love the Just Dance series. The songs are great. There are always some I don't like of course but that's understandable. We have a lot of fun trying to follow the choreography and we always work ourselves into a sweat. It's as much fun to watch others as it is to dance ourselves.
1.0	"I rented this game - thank G!  The dialog is never-ending.  It seems most of the game consists of your character and two others yapping at each other.  And I have no problem with one of them being gay but does he have to mention it every other word, it gets old? Durring this dialog, You have to press \\""x\\"" about 4,000 times to get them to shut up and to find anything to do.  You finally look forward to the idea of fighting to find it the same darn fight all the time.  They don't even have the decency to show you the evil characters as you come upon them you just start walking and whoosh it is is time to fight something.  I made it through about 13% and was so bored I had to stop.  It is sad the the PS3 FINALLY has a game or two and this one stinks.  Don't buy it, don't even rent it."
5.0	I bought this item for my daughter, she was thrilled!  She told me they were really awsome and since they came as a pair, my grandaughter is loving them too.
5.0	"alright. let me tell you a story. once upon a time there was me. i was born in 1998. when my mum got her computer, i saw an opportunity. i was like, im always bored, i should get a computer game. but my problem was that i had no money. long story short, my uncle got it for me, i loved him for it.    When i first got this game, i had no idea how to play it. i was always on sandbox mode, just placing coasters and paths to get the people to the coaster. and let me tell you. it was soooo much fun just doing that. 0% challenge, 100% fun. for a 7 year old kid it was amazing.    now, im 15. i found this game when i was cleaning out my mums OLD computer, for her new one. i literally had to beg her to let me install it on there, and making the switch brought even more opportunity. i used to play this game with  lag. on this brand new, i3 processing power, i got 0% lag. now remember, this game was made in 2004. thats 9 years ago. the game does not look too good. but who cares how the game looks? the game is just soo much fun with all its features, and its signature \\""new\\"" thing, being able to ride the rides.    *If your a parent and you kid wants an xbox 360 or a cell phone or some s*** that they dont need, and you have a decent secondary computer that they could use. buy them this. if they dont want to play it because its \\""old\\"" or \\""not cool\\"" make them play it. it will shut them up. it shut me up. i sat down for hours playing this game. just with all the features in the regular game. you could go and get the other packs, but they are not necessary. i had the \\""soaked\\"" edition for a while... too confusing.    all in all. BUY. THIS. GAME. and for the 10 bucks you will pay for it? i payed 40$ when i first got it. i still have it. its that good."
1.0	Used my prime to get it, it was broken as soon as I opened it.<br />The wires were hanging out. I tried it anyways, the light didn't turn on at all.<br />Waste of my time. waste of life.<br /><br />I just want to play Katamari
5.0	Great game just not too many online, just 1000 to 2000 a day.  I should have brought it earlier.  But it is definitely a must buy. Graphics and gameplay are both spectacular.
5.0	Kids love this game, challenging but fun. Kids are boys 8 & 10
5.0	"This will be my first Hardware review for this year so please bear with me.<br /><br />For those who wants to get the 3DS specially this one, please don't hesitate and grab one! the unit itself is good and I feel contented with it.<br /><br />I owned a 3DS before (black) and I sold it for some reason I did not enjoy it because it is small for my hands and that's it (it's personal reason, yes) so that's why I grabbed the this one and it fits perfectly even when playing kid Icarus doesn't bother me (didn't even used the stand that comes with it)<br /><br />now let me mention some stuff here that this is a \\""Good Buy\\""<br />- Larger screen than it's predecessor<br />- Longer Battery life<br />- the select - home - start buttons \\""Are\\"" really buttons not just a part of the screen.<br />- the D-Pad is clicky (more comfortable to push) and so does the X,Y,A,B buttons.<br /><br />there is no reason for you not to buy this product there's a HUGE library of games including DS games + 3DS games and more coming out this year specially MARCH (3 major titles coming out Monster Hunter, Luigis Mansion and Castlevania all for the 3DS)<br /><br />some people say \\""Vita is better/has better graphics, 2 analog sticks\\"" well I SOLD my PS Vita just to get this one and I'm not really contented with it I bought the First Ed. Bundle and the Assassins Creed bundle. Sold them both.  and I'm happy with it, I'll stick to the 3DS for a while. :D<br /><br />thank you for reading!"
5.0	After a lot of recording with my MacBook's built-in mic, this thing is a godsend.  It's pretty much plug and play (USB), and the price can't be beat.  You should get one.
1.0	The first day I received my 3ds is didn't work. It crashed constantly and wouldn't read any games. I soon found out it was a 3ds from a different country and I couldn't play any US games on it whatsoever.
5.0	Granddaughters Christmas present. She loves it.
1.0	I played this game for one reason and that was it was one of the few post 2000 games with owen hart and british bulldog in it. 2 of my favorite wrestlers. Well at the start they are locked of course.<br /><br />Let's talk about the game. this is easily one of the best rosters of any wrestling game. from bruno to bob backlund to koko b. ware (must have had room left in the game...) to bret hart, the funker himself terry funk, brian pillman, and hulk hogan. their will be someone for everyone to play. The career mode plays like this. you pick a territory and are put in a random storyline. sometimes tagging for someones injured partner, (although this game had weird tag teams like balls mahony and smooth man rocky johnson as the smooth ballz I guess?)<br /><br />This game on paper sounds nice but the gameplay is abysmmal, the reversal system is impossible to work, and the game glitches constantly. I've played this game for 2 hours and have read the manual constantly and still can't figure this game out. (I've learned to play WWF attitude well so It's not me). Also to unlock characters you have a betting system I could not figure out. it's like the wweshop in smackdown games except you bet to win stuff, Well at least it's better then the impactstore...<br /><br />Hands down this is the worse wrestling game I've ever played. If you want your legends fix, I recommend legends of wrestlemania or WWE all-stars. sure It's missing a few people.(thanks Martha) and if you want your attitude era fix pick up WWE 13. It's sad this game couldn't be better.
5.0	I received this pinball game from my brother and sister in law (Hi Mark and Jackie) for Xmas 1999, after having a fantastic time with hours of fun on it's predecessor, Timeshock. Both are outstanding games! While most  pinball games try to do too much (eg. multiple tables) poorly, this game  tries to do one thing very well... on well oiled, awesomely realistic and  utterly challenging game table that is fun, and full of new finds. A ten  ball multiplay challenge, video game intergrated, and loads of lights and  bumpers, combined with totally green-light graphics and sounds (so  realistic, you can even hear the ball hit the glass if you smack it just  right, like the real thing!), I give it 5 stars for playablility and fun  factor. Full customizable play table, key controls (does not use a mouse or  joystick, only keyboard).  It and its predecessor equal, Timeshock, are the  two best software games I have ever owned.  Have a great 2000!
5.0	The picture quality is so much better once we used this cable and switched the Wii to widescreen mode.  Absolutely worth every penny.<br /><br />Hooking this up was a snap, and the color-coded bands make it easy to know which plugs go where.  Bear in mind, the two audio connectors are the ones with the color in the middle, and the grey on the ends.
5.0	Recieved my headset yesterday in the mail, and i cant wait for my husband to recieve it as well as Skyrim for his Christmas in two days. Looks in excellent condition and it had fast shipping.
5.0	This is by far one of the best games I have ever played!  If you like LEGOS, than this is the digital version of it!  Great for kids and adults.  You can play on your own or with others.  My wife and I invite friends over often and we all get together for &#34;Minecraft Dates&#34; and build the world.
5.0	NOTE: I bought this from Walmart, just reviewing here. Anywho, this game is great! The who thing takes place in a huge, open world environment with animals and NPCs to keep you company. Starting out is complicated for a little while, but afterwards you get used to it quickly. Don't be surprised if you run into some overpowered bosses from time to time, for you can always sidetrack and do something else beforehand. If you don't want to do something at the moment, you can just vanish to some other place and level up, do quests and other chores before you go back. Overall, the freedom of this game is nice and the gameplay itself is exciting. The only downside is no multiplayer and the graphics (the graphics are still pretty decent for a New 3DS game though). This is a good all-around game in my opinion.
5.0	Wow this game really surprised me by it's level of depth compared to the latter MCF games. The other games became boring after a while, but this game never gets old because it always sends you on a new quest to complete your objective. Definitely a must buy for anyone tired of the same old MCF.
1.0	No video or sound. it simply did not work at all. Bought for N64 and had no luck using it
5.0	Golden Sun is probably the most popular RPG yet released for the GBA (including GSII: The Lost Age).<br />There is so much psyenergy in this game, even though I've beaten it, I haven't actually used it all yet, and I've owned the game for several months. Compared to the limited LOTR:The Two towers, which offers almost the exact same gameplay for five characters, and the various Pokemon games, which have such a complete lack in plot, this game is a definate plus. If you don't have it, I would definately get a copy.<br />The possibilities for various gameplay are almost endless. With each djinn (small fuzzy creatures with magical powers) set to you, it can change your 'class'. That is, with 28 different djinn to collect in the game, and 7 you can set at once, all the classes are still being discovered and written down.<br />The only problem there is is the shortness of the whole thing. That being said, GSII: The Lost Age should be longer. This game is a great place to start your GBA game collection, and if you've already got a collection, this will be a great addition. Whether you're a hardened RPG player or a newbie to all things RPG, this game is great. Enjoy it.
5.0	Got here early everything as advertised 👍
5.0	I like the way you can build your own tracks and you get cars and stuuf when you win a race.
5.0	Talk about reliving the legitimate arcade experience and then more, many additional features and best of all no quarters haha. No but seriously this game is amazing, the graphics are to resemble the arcade version but they are much smoother than i expected. The additions to the games such as maps life's and so forth are a great plus and many other thing you would never experience during game play at a local arcade. Multiplayer is very fun as well I would recommend getting the wii motion plus controller for better tracking and more pin point accuracy. However the standard controller works just as well if you have  a steady hand. Highly recommend this game as well as it should absolutely be a must buy for any wii system. This represents why the wii was made for this type of at home gaming.
5.0	This was the second game I ever got for PS2 and I just love it. I still go back to it after several years for nothing more than the thrills and good times it has to offer. Bounty Hunter isn't perfect but it is one of the better Star Wars games I've played and its a great third person shooter. I remember how much the graphics, cutscenes, effects, sound, and dialog blew me away a couple years ago and all I can do today is appreciate all these things more. Every time I play the game (I've played it a lot) I find new things to mess around with, whether it be small rodent creatures to blast or secret areas containing heavy weapons. The worlds are immerse with detail and most are actually almost beautiful. The explosions and laser blasts that fill the levels all look great, as do the characters, who's lypsyncing and motions are excellently executed. The action gameplay is fast paced with a very high frame rate. The sound design sounds as though it was taken directly from a Star Wars film. And most of all, the story is very entertaining, from your first encounter with the villanous scum Meeko, to your stealing of Slave 1 from an astroid prision, to meeting Tyranus. The story takes you all around the galaxy and be prepared to meet up with some familiar characters such as Zam Weesel. Many have complained about the game's repetetivness and lousy camera and I will admit that the camera tends to work a little strangly at times, but it certainly can be controled and is not something to get all worked up over. Bounty Hunter's action has never boared me and I find it's controls to be intruative and easy to use. Star Wars Bounty Huter is an excellent game with high production values and many good things going for it, I truely hope Lucas Arts releases a sequel for it because it is one of the best games I have ever played. Thanks for reading.
5.0	As a Star Trek fan I will admit a certain amount of bias in writing a review of this game but I can honestly say it was well worth the wait! I have been waiting for a long time for Playstation to market a Star Trek fighter game and I am very satisfied with Invasion. Manuverability and the realistic detail to ships and hazards are outstanding. Plus the cameos of Patrick Stewart and Michael Dorn (Capt. Picard and Commander Worf) were excellent additions to this game. All of the enimies proved challanging and versitile. I would definetly give this game 4 1/2-5 stars.
5.0	My favorite 360 game used to be Gears of War. Now, there is no question that this game is even better that Gears of War 2. When I think RTS games, I think about games like Starcraft. This game is different all together.    In this game, it's all about real strategy, instead of who can build the biggest army the fastest. Don't get me wrong, speed is still a great thing, but this game is more about planning and execution. You command an army like you really would in real life: no gathering resources, no building structures, and a minimum of micro-management. A highly recomended game!
5.0	since the beginning of PS, COD and MOH has been a battle to dominate the first person shotting game.. we all witness the defeat of MOH as soon as COD4 came out. no doubt that COD will always dominate since the birth of COD4 modern warfare and COD WAW is a reassurance of this statement..     COD WAW - Stunning graphics, Sound effect as realistic as a movie, Scene and settings takes you back to the history of men that had fallen in struggle to defend our freedom to SUCK UP VIDEO GAMES today..
5.0	this one is a good one to get if you like super mario bros.
5.0	Works as advertised with no issues
5.0	Enjoyed the expansion to the game
5.0	Captain Falcon is hard to find, and the Japanese one works identically on the US WiiU
5.0	it is for Christmas so I haven't given it yet.  But it came fast and my son will love it.
5.0	3rd party controllers tend to suck, so buy this one instead. It's light weight, comfortable, symmetrical (great for fighting games), an rather durable. Plus, the blue color is a rather good thing. If you already own four working controllers, there's no need to get this thing. but if you don't, I'd recomend a pickup.
1.0	Why would Rockstar Games not release this to PC at the same they did for consoles? Worst business decision someone could make. You got to cover all corners of a market. Especially when most people believe it or not play videos games on computers.
1.0	My 6 yr old completed all stages in 2 days!  Not really worth the money. He hasn't touched the game since!
5.0	I actually really liked this article, is excellent and is of good quality and I recommend others to buy it.
5.0	Good thing I waited before purchasing the<br />recent MGS game pack. This is definitely<br />worth having for all MGS fans collection!
5.0	So far I only have 2 controllers for my Xbox 360 and this charger does the trick. Maybe later I will love to buy another one so I can use 2 more controllers. Would recommend it to anyone who wants to charge their controllers.
5.0	my daughter really love this game
5.0	Now that Crash Bandicoot is in the toilet, Sly is officially being declared the new Crash. If you like good games, pick up a Sly Cooper game and enjoy. (Hopefully, they won't make a really good kart racer and then be bought by another company and be driven to absolute [...].)
5.0	I wasn't going to type anything and just give stars but the incredible amount of hate forced me to type something.  Yes you have to have the internet to play your account... its 2010 who in the modern developed world doesn't have some sort of internet? Its only required to verify your account, as the game plays from your hard drive. Its convenient for people like me who have several computers, as my achievements go to my account regardless if I'm playing on my pc or laptop. Its also kinda cool that you can talk to your friends across battle.net(i.e. if you have a friend currently playing WoW you guys can chat cross games). As far as install issues, 3 different copies have been loaded onto 6 computers in my house ranging from a 6yr old Amd fx-55 system, a mac, and even a bleeding edge Core i-7 build with no issues at all.  The gameplay stays true to the original and is easy to pick up if your old school or brand new to Blizzard RTS games. Imagine if you will Star Craft but more pretty, a more dynamic storyline, new system for upgrades and mercenaries, and interactive shipside adventures (the arcade machine in the bar was a nice touch). The changes to multiplayer does make life a little more difficult for the old hardcore players like my roommates, but for me, who never really did much SC multiplayer, I find it easy to use and the ladder system is fairly accurate.  As for it being part one of three that is fine with me. Its a 29 mission campaign(optional missions can be played form the other choice from your mission list and there is a secret mission!) which is fairly long and the achievements make several runs of levels inevitable if you want to take them all.  Value is correct for your $60. For all the claims of corporate greed come on guys. Do you have any idea how much money Blizzard rakes in off of WoW? They could careless about stealing money from their fans.  It sort of make sense that the story is going to be in 3 separate stages as it gives the player (especially new players) the skills needed to command their troops with devastating force when it finally moves to the challenging endgame missions. It also helps for story development as you feel an attachment to the characters. All in all for what it is, a faced paced RTS, the game is excellent and a must own (if you have the internet,oh wait you're reading this on amazon.com...). Buy it, expect an enjoyable experience, and if you don't end up liking it, don't buy the sequels. However you probably will like it :)
5.0	The xbox playlink has been very useful as an ethernet link to seamlessly connect my slingbox to my wireless router.  This is an inexpensive work around compared to other connectivity solutions.
5.0	This got me playing the guitar really quickly. I was surprised at how fast I got into the basics. It won't teach you sheet music, tabs or make you as good as a professional guitarist, but it is a very valuable supplement when starting out. Even if you're intermediate it will still help a lot on improving techniques such as hammer-ons, pull-offs, slides, bends, etc.  It's very useful in learning songs too. It's much quicker and easier than looking at tabs.
5.0	thanks for the speedy delivery.<br />everything was mint and the only weird thing I came across was they wanted the second disc installed first (extra content)<br />I wasn't aware of this at the time but it wasn't a big deal.
5.0	Great controller<br />Works great its hard to find a controler for older models. I was pleased to find this one, and have it work perfectly.
5.0	I'ts The BEST GAME I ever playd. The game has meny possybilites, because I can choose if I'am Bad or good and the game depends on it.There are great effects and the game has a intresting story.  (I LIKE IT) There are many skills,weapons,armors,characters     ,quest and I can choose if I make it or not,not like the other games where I MUST COMPLETE the guest to go on. But fev things are unreal,for example when I speak to some one and he needs money to pay someone (200).Then I end the confession and put (100000) in his pocet and I speak to him again. And he says the same thing that he has no money. I think that some one should contact the makers and say FIX IT. I'm 19 years old.
5.0	arrived in excellent condition, very good game and very good price, excellent attention, I recommend it to all those interested have a good time
5.0	What more is there to say?
5.0	I absolutely love it. Came in its original casing wrapped in plastic. Absolutely love it.
5.0	Quick arrival and works great!
5.0	Well, we all know COD...  The game play is very smooth in WiiU.  The graphics looks good in both the HD Tv as it is on the game pad.
5.0	I love this Wiimote! Definitely happy with my purchase.
5.0	actually an entertaining game i played it when i was at my girlfriends parents house at the dinner table while i was playing it my girlfriends father leaned over to see if i was on my phone when he seen me playing star wars on my psp he just high fived me and said respect then fist bumped me, Everyone at the table including my girlfriend just stared soooo kinda awkward but it created an awesome memory for me also like to play it before i go to bed the weapons are sweet and i also like that your power up is you can turn into yoda, obi wan, boba fet, luke or darth vader depending upon the side you choose to be on its a good strategy game and always an entertaining experience glad i bought it.
5.0	For just (price) more, you can save four times as much as the regular GameCube 59 memory card.  What more can you ask for?  For crying out loud, it's only around (price).  This accessory is very essential for GameCube owners.
5.0	I have had Elite Force for years, and I have to say that it is just as fun as it was when I first played the game. You really do feel like you are part of the Voyager crew as the entire cast (minus Kes) returns to reprise their roles we all know and love from the series. The story is sharp and the acting is even sharper. Fighting the Borg face to face is really amazing, talking to the crew is even cooler. Fans of Star Trek should love this game, fans of Voyager WILL loves this game. A must have for all my fellow Trekkies/Trekkers/And fans who don't like the label. Buy this game!! A MustHAVE!!!
5.0	Bought this for my 5yr sons birthday. He enjoys playing it. I'm not very good at games and he's having to teach me all of the little tricks
5.0	"I basically bought my PS2 for this game and the ones schedueled to come.  I never was a big RPG fan until FF7 was introduced to me and I fell in love with the games and now I am always hours into a game of Final Fantasy or other similar RPG's.  This game is by far graphically the best one I have played yet.  The movies andinteractions are visually stunning.  Just watch the first 20 minutes of the game and be blown away.  The downfalls of the game I have noticed thus far are that the dubbing of the english voices has kinda made many of the dialouge sequences drag and seem awkward.  THe characters speak their line and then you have to wait a second or so watching their lips moving until the next character speaks.  FOr a few sequences this got really bad and to the point as that even grunts or sighs were delayed.  Another thing is if you don't like being engulfed in Story or movies then you might be frustrated with the first few hours of the game where basically all it is is STORY STORY STORY and you have little chances to move and interact or fight.  Eventually though you get going and I'd say after about 5-6 hours you reach a point where the story slows down and gives you time to explore manually.  It is kinda funny though how after all those hours of story you and your character still have no clue as to what the heck is going on.  Finally the last thing that can be a minus is that your character is a dweeb.  The first few times you hear him talk after the beginning I thought \\""What a moron!\\""  [...] his character isn't always linear.  Meaning sometimes he is smart and confident and then all of a sudden he is a clueless fool.  THis just doesn't help the character development flow since he changes all the time from one form to another.  But even with my nit picking I still love the game.  It has all the classic qualities of the Final Fantasy series and even though they always change the magic and development system after a short while you will pick it up and feel rightat home when you see how similar it is to the old titles.  If you love Final Fantasy or are just a big RPG fan you cannot miss this game."
5.0	Great pouch, sturdy, looks nice. Holds the Nintendo in place
5.0	Could not ask for more.It fits in the wii and saves game data exactly like its supposed to.  I am satisfied.
1.0	This unit stopped working, heck if I know what to do to fix it.  Kids are jacked and disgusted.  I was told I had to have original box to return and who the heck keeps that?  I have been waiting for this review to come up so I could hopefully get some help.
5.0	Great game. Better than the last version I had from '10.<br /><br />Fully adjustable road to the show feature is the best in this one. You can adjust base running so 90% of your game time is not spent watching other batters take balls and strikes.
5.0	Okay I'm a little late commenting on OFB but I've had this pack for like 2 years and only recently am I starting to take advantage of its features. I was like many people who thought the work aspect of sims life detracted from the gameplay. I mean, how is running a business actually fun? Well, I now realize it just takes the game to a new level. I have all the EPs including FreeTime and I rank OFB second only behind the revolutionary Seasons EP. To take full advantage of OFB you should have all the other EPs, especially Seasons, Nightlife and FreeTime. You can run a home business or purchase a community lot. For example, I have just started a business called The Downtown Dance Studio where the owner trains and teaches visitors music and dance on ballet bars, instructing them, and dancing with them to build skill. For a 35 simoleon fee per hour of course. And she can sell that price to just about any sim because she has a gold talent badge in sales (trust me, that makes sales a whole lot easier). Just pure fun. There are so many possibilities with this EP its incredible. You can sell just about anything, hire employees, and take a vested interest in the business or just take a backseat. You can charge by the hour for entertainment and membership lots, or just sell, sell, sell. With Nightlife you can run a restaurant. Build customer loyalty and the value of your business grows. And that's not easy either. My dance studio has a ranking of 3, making it worth about 15000. You get perks for each ranking achieved, up to ten. So it make the game challenging. Of course if you're not into a challenge this pack is not for you, but if you want to expand and revolutionize your gameplay then OFB is the EP for you!
5.0	I recomend buying this product has a huge game selection. Controls are nice and runs smooth. It weights almost nothing.
5.0	"There's a LOT of game in this box. <br /> <br />There are enough delightful aspects to make it worth a geezer gamer's time and enough light-hearted and simple action to be fun for any kid old enough to enjoy _Treasure Island_.  For the hardcore I imagine it's just a romp. <br /> <br />Pirates! is a beautifully-rendered set of minigames stitched together as a story-construction kit packed with yer basic pirate tall-tale elements, plus an extra or two just for fun. <br /> <br />We got the swordfighting part, the ship-jacking part, the town-pillaging part, the pirate-treasure part (complete with fragmentary clues).  <br /> <br />We got ripe chaos in the colonies, bad men, good women, and you. <br /> <br />Oh.  Did I mention there's dancing? <br /> <br />The action is in sailing, sea battles, sword fights and dancing. The controls in all of them are simple enough that the games are almost instantly immersive, and the acting is never bad, sometimes outstanding, with a lot of rewarding attention to detail.  I'll mention the tavern maid after she whacks a lout with a bottle and the exulting Spaniard captain.  <br /> <br />The pace is fast enough that you start out busy trying to keep up, the controls simple enough that you can definitely learn how, and about the time you do learn, the depth and detail of the game starts seeping in around the edges.   <br /> <br />The Caribbean political and economic situation is constantly changing. Everything about a colony except its existence depends on what comes in or out, by sea.  The ships in the game are merchants and smugglers and immigrants and invasion fleets and raiders and garrison troops and couriers.  And pirates, of course.  You can, ahhh, interfere with this traffic, with consequences. <br /> <br />Another major story element available is getting yourself hooked in to the Caribbean-wide gossip networks of Governor's daughters, tavern maids and mysterious travelers.  The latter two will chat with anyone, but the Governors'daughters are choosy about who they'll talk to.  Who wants to talk to a pirate that lacks charm?  Dance with the ladies, Cap'n. <br /> <br />Dancing, like swordfighting, has a definite rhythm and depends on paying very close attention to your partner.  You get better -- there's a basic common repertoire of simple four-step sequences that you soon learn to recognize -- but the variations as you climb the social ladder (did I mention that aspect of the game?) get increasingly complex and the timing and cues subtler and more varied.  Swordfighting is child's play compared to the dances women invent.   <br /> <br />I've only mentioned some major and minor parts -- sea battles?  assaulting cities? (that one's not an action game)?  marriage?  climbing the social ladder? -- and there are lots of details I won't mention at all.  I'll summarize them all this way: they fit.   <br /> <br />There's nothing like it.  If the minigames themselves were deeper, I suspect you could completely lose yourself in its world.  As it stands, it's just a gloriously good game.  <br /> <br />I played this on a machine with a (low-end) Radeon X200, a gig of RAM and an Athlon 3500+.  I had to crank all the graphics options down to the minimum (although I can run 800x600 rather than 640x480, which matters), set the power-saving CPU speed option to \\""Always On\\"", and go into the advanced display settings to keep it from forcing e.g. antialiasing. I'm pretty sure the real bottleneck is the graphics card, and that if you've got even the least of the gamer graphics cards you've got nothing to worry about; this one is great up to the low-end 3D stuff but quickly runs out of steam after that."
5.0	Yes, it's a ridiculous price for 120gb, but the problem is, the hard drives on the 360 are not compatible with PC interfaces (yes of course that's on purpose to make you spend more money), and my 20gb drive was almost full. Now, if you use your 360 HD for only game saves, of course, 20gb will last forever; game saves run from a few k to 1mb or 2. Just like the original XBOX HD 8gb, I think was plenty of room for just game saves. (That's all I ever used mine for except for a few favorite CD's I ripped to it).    But, with the 360, in my case, though I have a big pile of games, that's not all I use it for. You will find that if you use marketplace at all-downloading demos (from 700mb to over 1gb apiece) trailers, episodes of NCIS you missed, multiplayer map packs, (Halo 3's will be HUGE, I heard);etc, like I do, that 20gb fills up quick; I only had 2gb left. So, I finally decided to spend the money, picked up the drive and read the instructions for file transfer (very easy, in my case with a full drive took about 2 hours, make the connections, and let it do its thing. Now I have all of my files from before,  a bunch of new demos (I keep them for awhile while deciding to spend the money on the games or not), the content it comes loaded with-videos, and a bunch of Arcade trial games;and I still have 100gb free. To me, worth it! If you're a light user of the 360 and just use the HD for game saves though, save your money.    My complaint is, MS should have given us the 120gb to begin with. But then, they couldn't make that extra $170 bucks off us, I guess. One last thing--the transfer supposedly works only once, and only from the smaller drive to the larger. Your 20gb will be wiped of content, but still has the 360 OS on it; if you attach it it will boot up, so bascially you'll have a spare drive, but will have to recover your gamertag, and re download everything, if you use it again.    Summary: Worth it, and highly reocommended, if you're a heavy downloader, like me. Ifyou don't go on line much, or don't use marketplace, you can pass.
5.0	Great game, kids love it.
5.0	Ordered 10/22, delivered 11/15. Has been working fine since day 1. Killzone is a blast and BF4 is fun but waiting for it to be fixed then I will really get into it( Too many issues with the game just after release but it seems to have gotten better) Also picked up COD:Ghosts and Assassin's Creed. Game on!
5.0	Console was a gift for my grandson ---he was one happy boy.
5.0	This game has all the thrills of any pro hockey game in the market because of the games incredible grapics on the xbox it moved me to buy one I would strongly recommend buying this game....
5.0	Ok, so actually PAC-MAN and his wife might actually share that honor with Donkey KONG, RADAR SCOPE and countless others...<br /><br />Bad analogy aside, this EARLY Playstation game flawlessly emulates Raiden and Raiden 2, the immortal Seibu Kaibahatsu (Dear God, I hope I didn't butcher that name) vertically oriented games from the glory days of Shmups. There is an option, just like in the Namco Museums, to flip the game on it's side, so you can do the same with your TV/Monitor. (PLEASE DO THIS SAFELY)<br /><br />Fun for the whole family<br /><br />Plays on Playstation 1-3
5.0	Received order as pictured and stated, works great and now I can play the updated console with it, since the wireless ones provided had no control
5.0	It fits perfect and works fine
5.0	I have seen reviews that are critical of this game because they claim the recievers won't catch the ball. I thought the same thing at first but i done some playing a discovered that you have to give them a fighting chance to catch the ball. Don't drop the QB back 20 yards to pass the ball. Then throw it on the run into triple coverage. I watched others play this game and Madden and they run the QB around forever before they throw it then they throw a catch me if you can pass. Drop back 5 to 7 yards get set watch the pressure and find the open receiver and dont fire the ball 5 yards away. You folks that gripe about this game don't know how to play football. Mix the playcalling up don't throw long every play. One guy said he could destroy OU with Baylor. What was u playing junior varsity with easy play on. Get real i'm good at this game and i can't do that. Anyway a great game for the ones that know how to play football.
1.0	EA's track record of acquiring game design studios who actually make good products and ruining them in the marketing phase continues.  First they saddled Mass Effect with overly intrusive and potentially system-damaging DRM (there are people who have had their DVD drives rendered permanently inoperable because of it), and now they do the same to SPORE.  Both of these games were at the very top of my list of game purchases for 2008, but now, even though I've seen and played both on a friend's computer, neither one will ever touch my hard drive.  EA made certain that Maxis and BioWare, two studios I am more than happy to support, will not see my money after all, and I'm just one of a large number of consumers who are doing the same.  It makes me a bit sad for the studios, but angry with EA.    My advice is to steer clear of this game and any EA product until they wise up and stop violating the Fair Use laws with SecuROM.
5.0	This product is great, I love it. It's a lot smaller than the original Xbox 360 and a lot more quieter than the previous Xbox. The Kinect add on is a crazy piece of technology. I love it. The good thing is that it comes with a Kinect game (Kinect Adventures). The game is pretty fun and gives you a lot of laughs, but it's lack of multiple amount of games leaves you wanting more. If you want to buy this product, you should buy another Kinect game.<br /><br />The cons are that if you want to keep it clean, you'd have to keep it clean a lot. The dust tends to be visible because of the sleek black color. Lastly, you need a lot of room for two people to play with the Kinect.
1.0	Controller gets sticky and the ps4 heats up and bakes 😱😱😱
5.0	Some spoilers in this review.<br />Yes, this game has a learning curve, and the bosses are a challenge. Isn't that the point? As I read over the reviews, it was clear that the negative ones quite often had that whining tone that says, &quot;Mommy, this game is too hard!&quot; ;-) This game will divide the men and the boys. It will make you sweat. It's the only real physical workout you can get sitting down.<br />Some of the levels in this game are breathtaking, with the standouts for me being the Suburbs and the Prison levels. In the latter, the way the ship docks and sequentially opens up more of the level and exposing you to more enemies is a brilliant example of game level design. Abandoned Skyscrapers is also great fun when you finally learn to avoid driving off 100 story ledges. :-) The linear regularity of Downtown is also a hoot. Try launching a gas can at the three spherical tanks in the chemical plant.<br />Some complained about the cars not having individual personalities, but they do if you play long enough. Crazy 8, for example, loves to drop those mines when you chase him.<br />This is coming from someone who favors games like Final Fantasy Tactics and the upcoming Ico. I like moody puzzle games and generally don't get attracted to the fast action titles. I bought TM:B after some rave reviews from sources I trust, and because I was in a rare mood for something action oriented, and I completely love this game. I have unlocked all the vehicles and all the hidden levels.<br />You *can* beat the final boss. Just take a break and let the sweat dry off the controller, and think about what a large gas tank truck can do to a helicopter if you time something just right.
5.0	One of the best introductions I can imagine to world history.  This game tests ones perceptions, stereotype and belief system as they explore the world of civilization development.      One of the most complex games that I have ever played, this includes chess.
5.0	DEFINATELY WORTH THE MONEY.  I AM A 26 YEAR OLD FEMALE, WHO GOT HOOKED ON THIS GAME BY A FRIEND.  WHEN ANOTHER FRIEND OF MINE WAS LAID UP FOR 6 MONTHS AFTER A SPINAL AND HEAD INJURY, I CARRIED THE GAME TO HER HOUSE, AND SHE'S HOOKED TOO (SHE IS 36 YEARS OLD).   THE SOUND IS A LITTLE FUZZY, AND THE GRAPHICS AREN'T STATE OF THE ART, BUT THE GAME IS DEFINATELY ADDICTIVE.  IT IS AN EXCELLENT GAME TO PLAY WITH FRIENDS IF YOU ALL WORK AS A TEAM- JUST BE CAREFUL THAT YOU DON'T PLAY WITH SOMEONE WHO SCOOPS UP ALL THE TREASURES WHILE YOU ARE LOSING HEALTH TO KILL OFF THE ENEMIES. I DON'T REMEMBER EVER PLAYING THE ARCADE VERSION OF THIS GAME, BUT NOW I WISH I HAD!
5.0	This is by far the best gaming experience I have had. The singleplayer has more depth than most any other game out there, and the multiplayer is a really awesome experience. This is not for kids btw as the violence is very realistic. This being said, there is nothing more gratifying than winning by working as a team. If you are looking for a run and gun type game, your life in this game will be very short lived. If you are a calculated player and work well with a team, there is no better game out there.
5.0	I bought this for my 5 year old grandson.  It is very good.  I was surprised that it doesn't close like the others but now that I watch him with it I am very pleased.
5.0	"This game is great overall. Never seems to get old :) Only thing I don't understand is that it is 25 dollars cheaper than the one in the regular case. It really is true when they say \\""you don't pay for the product, you pay for the name\\"""
5.0	EXCELENTE PROC DUCTO  RECOMIENDO  BIEN .... . . . . . . . . . .. . . . . .
5.0	I am always wary when I buy any cheaper 3rd party product.  But this turned out great.  Works spectacular!!!
5.0	Really helps to learn guitar
5.0	I could not be more enthusiastic about this game!  It is by far my favorite Wii game and the only one that has managed to keep my attention for longer periods of time.  This is the reason I bought a Wii system. LOVE IT!
5.0	bought for my son, 11. he loves it.
1.0	Very glitchy game. The cut scenes are ruined by the glitchiness, its like watching a Chinese movie where the words and their lips don't match
1.0	Horrible sound leakage
5.0	my grandson enjoys the game thank you
5.0	Did exactly what it was supposed to do, only wish the games was this affordable
5.0	I bought one of these for my fiancé and myself with Pokemon x & y. 3D hurts my eyes so I went with these, I ended up loving them. It fits in my hands perfectly and feels very solid, the battery lasts a while and it doesn't get hot or even warm after hours of use. There's a lot of great games for these and there's no slimming of the hardware it's all exactly like the 3ds rather than the 3d capability and mono speaker. The performance is better without 3d anyways, pick one up it rocks.
1.0	The left trigger broke after 2 uses. I didn't drop it or anything. I don't own a wii-u, I only use it when I bring it over my brothers to play super smash. I'm pretty disappointed that it sat on a shelf for the past 2 months and then when I bring it down to use it... it's broke.
5.0	Anybody complaining about the controls needs to start checking on various game sites. Almost every review states that the controls are identical to the XBox 360 and that all the buttons are different. Yes, it takes a few games to get used to, but it is actually pretty easy to use once you get used to it. Being so late in the season, and the fact that Madden 08 will be out in about 8 months, it isnt necessarily worth $60. Only reason I even played this game is because NCAA 07 isnt available for PS3. It's still a good game though. If you dont like the controls, get the game for PS2.
5.0	This is an awesome game!<br />I love Turok Dinosaur hunter better.<br />This game is still fun to play.<br />I recommend this for everyone.<br />However, there is blood and animated scenes of death.<br />This may be a problem for children.
5.0	This is a great, educational game that I played as a child and recently repurchased. It's starting to show its age in the graphics department, but that does not by any means diminish its fun and playability. It's also a really nostalgic game to play if you remember the television series of the same name. A lot of the characters from that series, including the chief, are in the game.    There are about eighteen levels set in different time periods and places, including ancient Egypt, Kublai Khan's China, the signing of the Declaration of Independence, and Russia in the space race years. In each level, you meet and interact with famous historical figures who have been kept from doing something pivotal in history by one of Carmen Sandiego's VILE agents. You play an ACME agent sent back in time to capture these criminals and must piece together clues Carmen left behind to find out where they are hiding (the clues always have some historical significance).    It is surprising how much this game taught me about history when I was a kid, and how much it stayed with me. I am a lot more knowledgeable about history now than I would have been had I never played this game. It teaches you a lot of great things about history while still being enjoyable.
5.0	This is realy a good game....and ti looks great on the PSP <br />is much better game than the nintendo 64 game
1.0	Like others, I bought this unaware that an internet connection is required to install and run the game. I should have read the reviews. Shame on Steam and their customer-abuse system of DRM.
5.0	Completely different than what I expected. Perfect refresher, especially if you've played every version (points to self) I really love it and can't wait to sacrifice hours upon hours building my kingdom.... ;)
5.0	Great game. It did have a lot of buggy issues after its initial release, but DICE has worked hard to rectify this and it shows. I love playing this game with my friends (hardcore mode) and the single-player is enjoyable as well (much more so than BF3's).  I highly recommend this game.
1.0	Modern warfare won't let me play multiplayer and freezes, I'm dissapointed I was really hoping to play this game after so long
5.0	Took me a bit to figure out getting the controller apart but the video they listed was very helpful! These paired with a green skin, gorgeous. Plus the rubber grip is better than the grips that I had to purchase to cover the originals!
1.0	It was delivered on time but when the kids opened and plugged it in the blue light never changed to white. Therefore the system never truly powered up. After calling Sony They explained that Amazon has many pre-ordered systems that still have the bugs in them and have not returned them to Sony to get the fixed ones. Sony is sending out a box for us to return the system in an will send out a new one which will take another week. I would be careful about buying any of the launch day products from anyone.
5.0	I loved Shadow of the Colossus when it first came out, and it's nice to see it released again as a double package with Ico for a great price. Highly recommend it if you haven't played either before.
5.0	My childhood game , It's addicting and really awesome to play, i enjoy this game and hope many others do too .C:
5.0	Great game! Critics say it's a 9 out of 10 on other gaming devices and not as good on the 3ds, but I say it's great no matter what device it's played on!
1.0	This PS2-specific cable offers many improvements over a standard Ethernet cable.  It comes in a stylish blister pack.  But what's that you say?  Almost all Ethernet cables come in blister packs?  Well, here's something you can't say about just any Cat-5E cable--it's blue.  That'll match your PS2, right?  Oh.  Well, um, at least this cable still costs several dollars more than its less-elaborately-branded competition.  That's got to count for something.
1.0	Not in the box. Came with food smudges. None of the accessories it says it comes with, not Tetris, and the screen doesn't work when turned on.
5.0	Awesome! One of my favorite games of all time. I played this back when it was on the Nintendo 64. I'm glad they remade this with much better graphics.
1.0	I tried to charge them but many times the charger can not find them contact.. it is so bad because I was trying to replace them with the original... I decide to buy other brand and they are working perfectly...
5.0	When I was a Blockbuster at home subscriber a few years ago I rented this game and absolutely loved it! I played it for over a week before I returned it. I can't say that for most games. I always wanted to own it but it was still expensive but not here at Amazon. Just like everything else it is very affordable.<br />This is the darker side of Mickey with his friend Oswald. The world is so fantastic so vivid and colorful and the sound and music are fantastic!<br />Each level is challenging but not impossible and you can achieve your goal different ways. There are magic carpet rides, boat rides that could land you into a whirlpool, you get to ride clouds,  jump and leap and climb and battle little demons which vary and each level is so unique and you collect Mickey tickets. And fun games in between the levels. And you go through these worlds with your paint brush using either paint or thinner.<br />This game is for children and adults and a game that will be used quite a lot.
5.0	I read a lot of the reviews for the Tiger Woods PGA Tour titles '10, '11 and '12 and finally decided on this one.  So far it has been a real blast to play.  I tried the others in demo mode at a local video game store (buy local when you can!) but they didn't have this one in stock.  Fast shipping was also a real plus.
5.0	this game is very fun. It is my favorite baseball game of all time. the graphics are great the feilding ability is great and when you bat you feel like your there swinging and they have all new complete pitching control. overall I would reccomend this game to anyone who has a neck for baseball.
5.0	I love this game because I have always wanted to play as Riden and they give you other chances to play different things throughout the game. I was only disappointed because I played the game non-stop and beat it within 3 days. It has a great story and is really fun! A must have game if you like Riden!
5.0	Love this game! One of my all time favorites. Its like playing a movie. The amount of detail, humor, and story that went into this game deserves a nod.
5.0	I don't know why this game isn't more popular! All the rhythm games are fun and the game soundtrack is fantastic. I'm a musician and although I almost always get A's on the rhythm games they are still challenging enough to keep you on your toes. The story line is also captivating (although it does get a little corny) but I still have yet to finish the game and see where it goes, and I am definitely invested enough to want to see how it all ends.<br /><br />Definitely jump on the chance to get this game because it isn't always available since it is out of print. It's so worth it.
1.0	"I purchased this game on December 20th and now I plan to unsubscribe<BR>before the end of the month.<br />After two months of play I can honesly say this is nothing short of a glorified chat program, as many have stated.   At first its fun but then it quickly becomes horribly tedious and repetitive. Keeping your Sims needs up is not exactly the most fun thing to do and theres little to do to keep you inspired to go on. <br />You can't walk around to explore. You can't even walk to visit your neighbor. Teleporting from house to house in the designated so called cities is  not what I would call creating a \\""true world\\"". Its more like visiting chatrooms. But now, saavy users have created programs that enable them to be away from the keyboard while their Sim builds up a skill so at times there are very few people to talk to.<br />And I've experienced teleportation in some of the 3D Virtual Chat sites on the Net so this is nothing new to me. <br />There are so many limits to this game that it has become creatively uninspiring  so its no wonder alot of people have unsubscribed.<BR>Its almost as if The game developers when developing this game forgot what made The Sims so much fun.<br />I know I can speak for alot of players by saying, I'm not interested in becoming the wealthiest or most popular player.<br /> I just wanted to play the regular version of The Sims with my friends. Was that so difficult to create?<br />Its mildly ironic that just when I'm deciding to unsubscribe, that more content is introduced in the game but unfortunately its a little to late. This game has wore me out to the point where I don't care anymore."
5.0	this is one fun packed title.  the graphics (which don't mean anything to me) were amazing, but graphics don't sway my decision in liking a game.  the missions and the opportunities in this game were absolutely incredible.  if you are looking for one game this year, this is it.  the game starts  off with fairly easy (not difficult) parts of missions, but as the game  goes on, it just gets harder and harder.  i played it for about 10 days and i didn't beat it, so unless you are the kind of kid that  plays so much that your playstation overheats, this should last you pretty  long.  the germans are extremely smart and almost funny.  if you throw a  grenade at one, he'll either throw it back, kick it away, get blown up  (obviously), or jump on top of it to save the other germans. GO GET IT!
5.0	And they did it again! Amazing and exciting game, I can't wait for the next GTA, I hope be soon.
1.0	Horrible game! Enough said -.-
5.0	"The game so far is just incredible. I haven't even beat the story yet, I'm just taking it slow and soaking in the awe of this masterpiece, it expands upon the last game with colossal success. I'm immensely at \\""wow\\"" with the new create tools (I don't think I can grasp how much is possible with creation now), and they all add a more friendly approach to the daunting task of building. The game also has a boost in the polished look on its graphics, it looks slightly better than LBP1. Along with new gadgets that make the game more and more enjoyable, I don't see how this game could get boring.     The only issues I find that are a real thorn in my side is the connection issues with multiplayer. Everyone on my friend's list has experienced the random loading screen always popping up, and eventually keeping the player at a standstill, I don't know if its a server issue, or just a launch day bug, but I hope MM notices this connection issue so everyone can game with more than two people.    As for the Collector's Edition portion, I'm overall satisfied with it. The bookends seem sturdy and have a unique look to them, the costumes and avatars are a nice addition, and as for the Sackboy plushie (which nearly everyone is disappointed in) it has its flaws, its just as people before described it... a darker color, an awkward shaped mouth, and its not completely flexible but hey, I'm satisfied with it. And of course, your very own LBP2! :D    Overall, I'd tell anybody who owns a Playstation to get this game. It's just a \\""must play\\"" game. To miss it, is to miss out on one of the biggest outlets to plug your imagination into!"
5.0	Great xbox remote packs! they last a long time and charge time doesnt take very long. Trust these for the long game session with friends.
1.0	I hated it  loads for 20 minutes and after that it still loads for ever it's slow and it just doesn't work. My kid calls it a rip off
5.0	Works absolutely perfect. Not only is this a phenomenal game, but it really brought back memories for me. I bought this in celebration of Wind Waker HD (as my old copy has long since been missing) and then proceeded to grab myself a Zelda WW Wii U. :) Works perfect, got here on time, and I have played it at least twice through since recieving it! No problems at all! (: There was a little glitchiness the first time around during the first battle with Jalhalla, but on the second play through, and during the repeated battle in Ganon's Tower, it worked fine! (:
5.0	The archery one is my favorite, personally. A great addition to the Wii Sports line and lots of fun to play with friends.
5.0	"I bought this because it seemed like a fun little toy to play around with on my DS.  It was not until I opened the box and played around with it for a while that I realized how deep of a product it really is.  One word: Wow.    This is not really something you can just pick up and expect to crank out music for day one if you don't know what you're doing.  You really have to have at least a fundamental understanding of analog synthesizers, low-frequency oscillation (sine/sawtooth/square wave etc.), sequencing, and musical scales.  While beginners can play around with it and squeak out simple patterns and drum beats, people who have used analog synthesizers or synthesizer software like Reason will hit the ground running and have an absolute ball with this right out of the box.      I also need to mention that the user-interface is solid.  They managed to roll a ton of complexity into a really easy to use interface.  The switch screen interface is ingenious.    While the DS-10 is not going to replace anyone's Moog or even Reason for that matter it's an incredibly fun and useful tool.  I can absolutely see this being used in clubs by just plugging the DS into the mixing board.  I am pretty excited to see what people are going to do with it and I keep checking YouTube for a daily dose.   It a product limited only by the \\""player's\\"" creativity."
5.0	I love this game, been a huge fan since the first Homeworld came out.<br /><br />I do wish this game had a longer of story mode, the campaign was just too short for me.  Online play is fine, but other player ruin it for me personally.  I also wish they made bigger maps for the Player vs. CPU, I would like the challenge of managing a truly massive battle field! (I suppose I've been spoiled by EVE)
5.0	Excellent game and extremly easy to play. You can play against the computer or against your family and/or friends or even both.
5.0	This is the best game.  The graphics are great.  If you like Donkey Kong you will love Rayman.  The only way it could get any better was if they made the characters talk.
5.0	My daughter wanted this for christmas , so instead of buying it at a regular game store I bought it on ebay .
5.0	to all you sceptics: no, i didnt get paid to write this. this is my personal opinion. i run a pentium 4 2.4 ghz machine (windows xp 256 mb ram 80 gb in the hard drive- bout 67 left) and so all my programs are quite fast. for me, (call me a loser if you want) chess is an obsession. the promo vs larry christiansen didnt attract me, its the other stuff that i heard about. cons: the online play sucks. ive only gotten it to work once on my old computer and even then there were only like 7 people online... the database sort of sucks too. when was this game played? doesnt tell you. where? doesnt tell you. although its very large, the layout is horrid and i can find all the games i want on chesslab.com. another major con is that its missing a few of my favorite personalities :( cm 9000 does NOT have kasparov!! but for 22 bucks american its pretty damn good. comes with about 50 gm personalities (with 150 in total. 175 after ive been messing with test personalities. you guessed it. bored on a saturday) another major con is the analysis. i own both a junior 8 (chessbase) and cm 9000 (ubi soft). and although it isnt quite accurate... (&quot;white now uses an outflanking maneuver in order to exploit the bishops position&quot; sigh) junior does quite a good job. cm SUCKS for &quot;full analysis of a game&quot; the reason i have given 5(five) stars for this review is what it CAN do. the engine itself is so bloody human. its increadible. how does they do it. cm is great for preperation and analysis because i can simply set up a position, set a time control and play a grandmaster personality (or custom) to get the idea of my theories. the classrom is okay but lord i think i know enough already. good for beginners but mehhh... the library has some great games as well. you can even create your own opening books! chessbase seems to be the largest producer (and best... i havent seen one spot on ssdf top 10 for years that isnt chessbase computer) of chess stuff, and so its hard to decidereally which is better my junior or cm... the analysis that junior has is much better... then again you get about 60+ true 3d boards in cm... the engine in cm is better (not stronger) and much more human like. i am not sure which is better in the way of strength. cm seems to KNOW more. it plays moves like a human. and the personalities really do play like the real players (although a bit of time was wasted. larry evans? kashdan i have never even heard of.) and a few times i have looked up famous games involving one of the cm personalities. i play the losing side and it duplicates all the moves. not sure if this is book or not! <br />Conclusion: cm is the best engine for preperation because of all that you can customize. junior (when i refer to junior i am talking about all the engines... tiger shredder hiarcs fritz nimzo etc) has better analysis for clarity but if you are using mentor lines and thinking lines in cm i think it is slightly better. i have used as many as 33 personalities on a given position! the choice is yours. personally i would buy cm. if you have a good graphics card the 3d boards are amazing. also it costs like 20 dollars less in american so............ you can experiment. if you are super rich it doesnt matter. good luck with your shopping
5.0	Soo great! Wonderful sound! So many options there no way I could use them all! But amazing sound and very helpful when gaming!
5.0	This machine is a very fun system. And the games that it has for it are very fun.
5.0	Every aspect of the game is the best amoung other football games. The franchise id the greatest around, and the others modes are very good as well. The game is perfect except for the difficulty of passing when playing on pro or higher. When you play on those levels, you can only expect to complete about 35-45% of your passes if your'e lucky. And you could expect to average at least 1 interception a game. I'm playing a season right now and I know that Brad Johnson's rating will be very low for the next season. If you want to have the perfect QB, play on ROOKIE!
5.0	The last Metroid games I had played was [[ASIN:B00002SVEM Metroid II: The Return of Samus]] on my old GameBoy and the absolutely exceptional [[ASIN:B00002SVFV Super Metroid]] on a borrowed SNES. I still have the music from when crossing the Red Soil in Brinstar as a ringtone in my cellphone. So, buying this trilogy was more of a compulsion for me however, it turned out to be a very smart idea.<br /><br />For the price of a new game you get the three latest METROID PRIME games: [[ASIN:B00006IJJK Metroid Prime I]], [[ASIN:B0002ILS1U II: Echoes]], & [[ASIN:B000FQBPDU III: Corruption]]. METROID PRIME I and METROID PRIME II: ECHOES have been ported from the GameCube, with improved graphics and controls adapted to the Wii. METROID PRIME III: CORRUPTION is one of the best games ever designed for the Wii!<br /><br />You can access any of the three games from the Menu and play any one of them interchangeably. I found I and III to be beautiful games, offering endless hours of fun whereas II was a bit darker but still a not-to-be-missed experience. It took me a while to master the controls (I am a seasoned PC gamer yet new to consoles) but once I started feeling comfortable with them I had to tear myself away from the game.<br /><br />Since all of my previous Metroid experience was limited to side-scrolling games, stepping into the space boots (and sticky-ball) of Samus was a blast! Don't miss out on it.<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
5.0	The only way to sum up this masterpiece is by saying to go purchase it now. I am 45 years old and grew up with video games and have played what is considered all the great games. This is by far the best video game of all time for me. Naughty Dog is a developer truly at the top of their game. They used a perfect combination of story, great voice acting, and a beautiful environment in a world with no hope. The game puts relentless pressure in you emotionally and mentally and you never feel safe in this dystopia.<br /><br />This game earns a 11 out of 10. It is possible because the game is greater than the sum of its parts and the parts are all perfect.<br /><br />I recommend this to all gamers that qare at least 18 years are older. This game is for more mature audiences and only parents will be able to completely appreciate the complex relationship between Joel and Ellie.<br /><br />However, there is much more to this game and something for anyone togo enjoy. This is truly a interactive movie that took mmy 20 hours to complete. It is nearly impossible to put this game down.
1.0	It does not work and the clips to hook up to the Xbox 360 are broken this is pure garbage not worth buying
5.0	It works for a PS1 power cord. There is not a lot else to say about it. Do you like PS1? Do you like power? THEN BUY THIS CORD!!!
5.0	WOOWWO BEAT IT TWICE. LOVE THE ONLINE PART OF IT. SO GOOD ON THE STORY END OF IT. WOW GET IT.
5.0	THANKS BRO NOW I CAN WAVESHINE LIKE MELEE JESUS
5.0	great look, awsome extra usb, a twin collong fan, and a charge stand all in one what else do you need
5.0	A somewhat exciting time-traveling experience. The setting and the AI is the best real-time test of your strategies and manipulation of keyboard-and-mouse. Same story, same characters, different genre, making the game more fun.
1.0	Title says it all -- would not operate on previous computer, either.  Some graphics are clear, the rest is a jumble of lines and colors. (Companion game Civil War:  Secret Missions, has had no problems.)
5.0	this game isbetter then FFXIII you can do more things is 100% better and geting the collectors edition is better then buying the game you yost pay like 20 dollas more to get 5 disc
5.0	Happy with my purchase
5.0	this item prevents batteries from being dumped into a landfill. it is worthwhile even in the short run. a good investment
1.0	Ordered this item on December 9th.....as of the 24th never got it...it now is supposed to get here on Jan.4. What am I supposed to do with this after Christmas. How can it take so long to ship??? I had to get to Game Stop to get them.
5.0	well its the first time i have played a battle field game but i think its really great .the graphics are great the game play is great(even though it took me a while to get used to it )over all i like how realistic this game can be and i have recommended to many friends already .i gave this game 5 stars but it has some bugs to fix witch would make it an even better experience
5.0	Not much to say........ they are just stylus's but.... I can keep playing my games... And the shipping was unbelievably fast.
5.0	The GameCube adapter works flawlessly.  Just plug in and enjoy Super Smash Bros the way it was meant to be enjoyed!
5.0	Bought as a gift for my boyfriend and he loves it!  Arrived quickly too!  I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys basketball!
5.0	My boy loves this game it has really good game play and is a game that will take him a while to get all the extra guys.
5.0	My grandson loves it!!!
5.0	"I originally bought an aftermarket cable, and it turned out to be junk.  It was worth a few dollars more to go ahead and buy the Sony brand in this case.<br /><br />This cable works excellently.  I've hooked it up to a 58\\"" Samsung plasma,  a 32\\"" LG LCD, and a 32\\"" Samsung tube television, all with no problems.<br /><br />You should be aware of a few things, though:<br /><br />1) Your games are designed for the little PSP screen--when you blow them up to a big size, you're going to see blocky pixellations, on some games worse than others.  It's just like digital photography: enlarging an image drops its quality.  I enjoy Daxter, but the EA Classics Collection is just awful.<br /><br />2) Depending on what you're running--and your TV's settings--the picture may not fit perfectly.  For example, my HDTV's resolution goes higher than the PSP is capable of putting out.  So the picture size is slightly reduced and I have a thick black border around it representing the extra resolution of my TV.  My TV has the option to stretch a picture to fit, and a tap of the \\""Picture Size\\"" button does so quite nicely...yours might not.  Check your TV's manual.<br /><br />3) Tube televisions simply won't look as good as a flat-panel:  they lack the color depth, for example.<br /><br />4) This is a COMPONENT cable.  That means you have 3 video plugs and 2 audio plugs.  Red, Green, and Blue are separated into their COMPONENT plugs, one for each color.  A COMPOSITE cable is 1 video plug:  all 3 colors in one plug.  Check the back of your TV if you're not certain of which input you can use.<br /><br />The only con to this cable is that if your PSP is inside a protective case, you'll need to take some extra care to plug it in."
5.0	This Hard Drive is a Gray Hard Drive (for arcade) and was cheaper than Microsoft will sell a 250 GB Hard Drive. This hard drive doesn't have the drive size on it, but I don't think that matters. If you want a cheap 250 GB hard drive, get this one.
5.0	My children love this after playing the first one and this one has even better songs so it was a hit in our house
5.0	I had another shoulder style bag for the xbox that just didn't hold enough.  This backpack is the perfect solution.  It has enough storage space to hold everything.  I carry a 48CD case, and RF adapter, a 50ft. LAN cable and the basic xbox stuff (console, power brick, 2 controllers, 2 headsets etc.).  This fits it all comfortably and is comfotable on my back.<br /><br />The only drawback is that I am a business professional that happens to like games and I feel uncomfortable having my Co-Workers see me with such a colorful backpack checking into a hotel.  I would rather have it been all black.<br /><br />Can't say anything negative regarding the storage space however.<br /><br />*EDIT* 1 Year later this backpack is still in perfect condition and had enough storage to fit my Kinect at the bottom.  I am still 100% pleased with this item (except the bright green colors, they still bug me)
5.0	If you are a  RPG fan this is a must have game for PS Vita. Tons of hours of game-play. Great story. Fun concept in character's and friendships' development and growth. Addicting fusion in creating personas. And tons of side missions. High comments from the other players pretty much says it all.
1.0	As both a video gamer and huge James Bond fan, I am thoroughly disgusted with this game. After less than three total hours of gameplay, I had completed it. And what horrible gameplay it was, too. Choppy camera work, an unreliable targeting system, awkward controls, and voice acting that  makes Ed Wood look like Shakespeare all contribute to an experience similar  to 989's Syphon Filter with a swift kick to the crotch thrown in. The plot  was even weaker and harder to follow than the rehashed You Only Live  Twice/Spy Who Loved Me film's was. Without having seen the film, gamers  would have no idea where they were or why they were there. The game's only  redeeming factor (the source of this review's lone star) are the full  motion video clips straight from the film interjected between levels,  including the full gunbarrel and opening credits sequences, but if that's  all I wanted, I would have just bought the video.
5.0	GOT MY PS4 LAUNCH DAY BEST CONSOLE EVER BEST PURCHASE EVER ALL THESE PROBLEMS ARE BEING BLOWN OUT OF PROPORTION BECAUSE OF XBOX FANBOYS POSTING BOGUS REVIEWS.
5.0	Game works perfectly not a scratch even though used took only three days to arrive. recommend buying this game it is great.
5.0	What a life-saver. I have a Wii U and when my friends come over it gets pretty boring because we would either have to play outside or on my computer. Once I found this on Amazon and purchased, I was more than happy. Now my friends can come over and we can play up to 4-players on some classic games such as Super Smash Bros. You should definitely buy this if your looking for some multiplayer fun on the Wii U.
1.0	I received a fake/knockoff item even though the official Microsoft item was shown and described.  I already have one official Microsoft play and charge kit, but I needed one for an additional controller.  I ordered the item sold from Bluemall(through Amazon's product page) for $9.99, and I received a cheap Chinese knockoff.  I cannot measure the battery's capacity, but it is less than half of the weight of the official Microsoft battery.  I guess finding one of these brand new for under ten dollars really is too good to be true.
5.0	You must pick this one up! I've read a few reviews for it and decided that I had to own it. It's all I expected and much more. In an age where all that's considerable in terms of gaming are first person shooters, Klonoa is a breath of fresh air being the awesome 2.5D platformer that it is. seriously, if you like fun, look no further than Klonoa. It's incredible.
5.0	all the postal awesomeness in one package.
5.0	This is an excellent game. My kids play it for hours. It was shipped in great condition and in a very timely manner. Will definately order from here again.
5.0	my 7 year old loves this game
5.0	It has been awhile since we got one of these games, but we always look forward to the time working/playing together! These games are interesting and fun for young and old computer game players alike! The games could be a little scary for very young children.
5.0	If you like the Souls games, you probably already bought it and know what all the fuss is about.  Otherwise, you probably already know that this series carries a reputation for being difficult, but that's only half the story.  The moment to moment game-play rewards patient, calculated progress, learning to read your enemies moves and using their openings against them, or paying the price.  The combat pace is kicked up a lot from the Souls series, so although a lot of the overall mechanics are the same, the pace is much more heart-pounding and reflex oriented.  It almost reminds me of a combination of the Souls games with a touch of Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance or even Mike Tyson's Punch-out.  The whole game is beautiful like an impressionist painting with tones of H.R. Giger or H.P. Lovecraft thrown in.  The world and the fragments of lore hidden within in are so tightly built that sometimes it feels like it would all still exist without you being there to observe it.  The load times are still an issue, although we're promised a patch soon, and there are instances of frame-rate stuttering in a few spots where there is a lot of background effects going on, but usually brief.  I can't recommend it enough if you have a PS4.  The sense of wide-eyed discovery, haunting wonder, and adrenaline-soaked accomplishment make every minute of this game feel like a gift.
5.0	I bought this for my son as a gift. He loves it and has even stayed up all night playing it. Has three different farming simulator games and loves them all.
5.0	"This game's story is so epic, that at times, it seems that the story was wasted on a game designed with a focus on battles, although at other times, the format of the game seems to suit the story perfectly, as when the characters speak during mid-battle. The plot of this game has the theme of \\""exploring history in search of truth,\\"" and demonstrates, through allegory, the biases of the societal forces which allow for the recording of history, and the tendency of historians to attribute heroic characteristics to the victors of any scenario, regardless of their true alignment, or intentions. At many points in the plot, unexpected events occur, with the attentive player having received just enough information to speculate on the motivations of the characters involved, and playing through the game, there were many such moments at which I speculated improbably twisted scenarios, only to be shocked when future events actually confirmed my dark suspicions, or clarified the scenario to be even more depraved than I had imagined. This is not an incredibly violent game, nor is it atmospherically dark, in the film noir sense. But it is a deeply philisophical game, which doesn't under-represent the magnitude of human suffering, the tendency of humans to abuse power, or the unreliability one's personal allies in societies conducive to individual scheming. The character of Delita, who comes across as contradictorily skeptical and idealistic, is too much of a master-moralist, in the Nietzschean sense, to qualify as a hero, but is too difficult for a player, sensitive towards his motivations, to villainize. Even the abberant supernatural elements of this mostly human and political story work well from a literary standpoint, as the relationship between Ajora, the Lucavi, and those who seek the Zodiac stones is represented with style and subtlety, adding Faustian intrigue to the plot. <br /> <br />The gameplay of Tactics is reasonably balanced, in the sense that there are not many situations in which one overly powerful and convenient approach to winning battles makes every other possible strategy obsolete. Like other job-system games, the player can create these situations himself, by overcommitting to the equipment and abilities for a particular job for certain characters, thereby forcing himself to use the same strategy for every battle, or sacrifice the majority of his characters' power, but the game itself offers many different feasable play possibilities. Different sections of the game will present different challenges depending on how the player's party is configured, such as Ramza's one-on-one battle with Gafgarion, the \\""outnumbered\\"" battle at Golgorand execution site, or the rooftop \\""save Rafa\\"" battle, and unless the player's party is so ridiculously overpowered as to allow for massively inefficient gameplay, the tactical perameters of each battle require a rethinking of the player's strategy, as elements such as attack strength, attack range, and character mobility must be alternately prioritized. <br /> <br />The ability to review story scenes and look up public information about the characters adds to the immersive element of the game, and the player's ability to appreciate the plot. This game is superb because its many innovations are effectively implemented, its visual design effectively portrays compelling, medieval-style fantasy, some characters are incredibly well-developed, and even the lesser characters are given enough development to fully serve their role within the incredibly literary plot."
5.0	A legitimately good RPG with a South Park wrapper on it. I got hooked quick and burned through the entire game in a weekend (approximately 12 hours for a thorough playthrough). I'll likely play it again, and I'm rarely compelled to give a game a second spin.
1.0	The gameplay is rubbish and the fun is absolute zero. Mildy cute graphics that were dated at the time and totally redundant now. It does not show off what the Genesis was capable of and is surely one of the worst platformers ever. Don't even buy out of morbid curiousity.
5.0	I own is game on PC and loved it, I bought this version for a friend that likes the show.
5.0	This is a really great series of games to play,I got this a present for my dad(and I have also played it)and he loves.I would recommend this game to anyone.It got to me right on time with no problems what so ever.
1.0	guys after connect ps3 superslim to Samsung LED tv I pressed on/off the light gose from red to green then nothing happen. the ps3 turn off, there's nothing on tv, I've tried to hold capture on/off as the manual says, put nothing change.
1.0	Download code for the game is busted, who else wants compensation for this cluster?    UPDATE: Well, code worked at 9PM Pacific (Midnight East Coast), so looks like Microsoft DID NOT give us the Zero Day edition with the bundle, just the standard edition, what a joke!
5.0	I love the game to death, very happy that I could play the old rocksmith songs and it be more accurate, the only issue I have with it is it's still not able to read everything I do on the guitar, but it's still a major upgrade from the first one.
5.0	I have no idea what this is. I got it for my boy and he loves it. I hope it has a lot of chicks in it?
1.0	I swore I wouldn't purchase another COD game after the miserable disappointment of MW2 but I thought I'd give them one more chance.This game is even worse.I hope somebody files a class action suit against these rip offs.I'm done for sure now.
5.0	Great sellr item is as describe, great game, I love the artworks and the graphics of the game lol lol
5.0	Okay, when I first saw the game, I thought my brothers were just experienting a girl game to check out there bod, or judge their looks, but I found out, &quot;Hey, this isn't so bad.&quot; I know a lot of people think it's stupid, and yeah, I understand why many of you think it's just another Charlies Angel thing, but it's not.<BR>I hate that people assume things before even trying it out. FFX2 is one of the best games I've ever played. The clothes are really creative and cute, (although I did notice that some of them needed more coverage) and I like how the girls (Yuna, Paine, and Rikku) are the main characters, and for once the girls actually show more power instead of having really low attack and health points. I've played about 6 FF games, and I can clearly say, this was my favorite. I mean come on, have you ever played a game with multiple endings depending on how you played? And don't worry, if you get a bad ending you can always go play it over, trust me, I've played it over 2 times, and I'm starting on my 3rd. Although it's is a very good game and all, I have to admit, I didn't really like the voice over. I actually have the japanese version also, (although I can't understand anything) and it is way better! In the begining of that big perfomance, Yuna (or ????) was unbelievable! If you ever get the chance to, you should get the jap. version just to see how muck better it is. Even if you aren't a fan of the FF games, you should give it a chance.
5.0	My expectations are fulfilled completely<br />I recomend this product!<br />Nothing to complain abou<br />I will rate this product, good in all its aspects
5.0	Like many others, I bought this game without having played ME1 or ME2. However, I soon appreciated all this game had to offer.<br /><br />The gameplay is addictive and dynamic, the story is engaging throughout, and I ensure you it will be hard to put down the controller once you start.<br /><br />You will read several other reviews about how the ending ruined the franchise. It's hard for me to understand their mindset as I haven't been with the franchise that long. Coming into the ending of the game I played out every possible scenario that could unfold for this game to receive reviews such as this, but after I finished the game I didn't get that feeling whatsoever. In fact, I thought the ending was clever and seemed to fall in line with the general theme the game was presenting all along.<br /><br />One final point. As other people have stated, the ending of the game is literally 10 minutes long. This game alone can take 35 plus hours to beat, if not more. Don't let less than 1% of the game influence your decision.<br /><br />If you love RPGs and are debating if ME3 is worth the money, I'll give you your answer. YES!!!
5.0	this was the perfect gift for someone who has almosty everything it was so kewl when it arrived which was very quickly thanks
5.0	The controller arrived very promptly and as described. Works great with any SNES emulator on the PC and allows you to simply plug it in a begin gaming.
5.0	Love the game. I play every day. It has its bugs but the developers are always trying to improve the game. All new maps are free to my understanding
5.0	Fast delivery and perfect product
5.0	Man coverage is WAY too effective, as are pass rushing defensive tackles, but if you can find ways around those 2 flaws (I play zone every play) and find some good AI settings, then this is a really good game.
5.0	Good product, fast delivery.
5.0	This was a xmas present, arrived on time and he says it's a fun game. Woop woop!
5.0	Its basically Megaman in a pokemon RPG format.  I am not a big fan of these kind of games, but my brother loves it so I gave it a good review.
5.0	"I have only logged about 18 hours on this game SO FAR but I love it!  If you played the first one all the reviews that say this one is much improved are correct.  It's not an easier game but access to everything is easier...a much better system for managing your items, monsters, equipment, etc.  Sure there's a lot of grinding involved but that just goes with these types of games, doesn't it?  I have thoroughly enjoyed online wi-fi play as well.  I'd recommend this game to people who like the \\""collecting\\"" games or dungeon crawlers...I think it would appeal to people of all ages that are statistic oriented collectors.  This game seems to have tons of hours of play and friend codes and wi-fi make it a really great bang for your buck.  I abandoned DQM Joker after about 30 hours but when I began it the online play had already been discontinued.  This game is a good price for the many hours you can play."
5.0	A must have game to your PS3 game collection. I have not been so emotionally engaged in a story in such a long time, but this game's story grabbed me in just the first 20 minutes of game play. I'd rather not get into the story and spoil anything, so I am going to keep this review quite simple. I have very few complaints about this particular game. There were very few minor glitches once in a while that did not hinder game play, but was noticeable. Combat was smooth and clever. Some situations required actual strategic thought and provoked the use of various weapons, not just firearms. Grade A story. You'll go through an emotional roller coaster with this game; sadness, anger, frustration, fear, astonishment, disappointment, etc.  I cannot comment on the multi-player, since I have not played enough of it. Pick this game up!
5.0	We all like it. I was just fun.<br />The best gaming console we have ever owned. Hope more exciting games are coming on the way...
5.0	"I'll start with my background when these first came out I really didn't know much nor did I trust them. But I bought them and they take some getting use to but in about a GOOD month you can't play without them. The first design was the best (My Opinion)it had six connectors instead of the new three because of controllers activity but, this one man A++++ So much better improved on the grip, better wear on the controller, the small dots on the surface sticks when you sweat. And it DOES improve your accuracy most of all! I went from K/D Ratio 1.63 to 2.38 in about two months, now that's results. I've heard of people only using one FPS FREEK for that accuracy or just the speed you need.<br /><br />*PROS<br />- 40% Better accuracy (your results may vary)<br />- Better range of motion from your controller sticks.<br />- Better Grip (for all you sweaty thumbs out there)<br />- Can increase your sensitivity ( 5 ~ 10 insane on COD)<br />- Comes in all different shapes and sizes.<br />- It's VERY cheap A+<br />- They also have Speed freeks for racing and sphere ones for retro gaming as well as sport ones.<br /><br />*CONS<br />- Takes some getting used to (about a month of solid gameplay my experience, your results may vary)<br />- Sometimes the sticks pop off because it only has three connectors (Solution : Don't press so hard on controller when playing)<br />- These last for about 2~3 years starts to loose grip after constant use. (Normal wear and tear)<br />- It chafe's the controller afterwhile (really doesn't bother me)<br /><br />At the end of day this is a no brainier if you want to get better, or just need that \\""edge\\"" to improve your gameplay I highly recommend the FPS FREEK CQC by KontrolFreek."
5.0	"ALL Skylanders figures retail for 7.99. Paying anything more is insane! These retailers are not listed by Activision as retial points for Skylander's figures... therefore they are hunting them down at their local Gamestop (where I found a shelf FULL of Hex, Wrecking Ball, and Dino-Rang), Best Buy, Target (who carries the exclusive Whirlwind), or Walmart (who carries the exclusive Drill Sergeant), and then jacking them up by 3... 4... 5 times the price!   Don't reward this kind of behavior... just make the rounds and you will turn them up. And don't think these \\""rare\\"" figures are any better... the game is a load of fun, but not exactly challenging and all you need to get everything on each level is a little patience and one figure of each element. Just to get to the end and beat the final boss requires nothing more than the figures that came with the game.  I do recommend however getting Skylanders for your console and, if you are a prefectionist, being prepared to pick up one of each element. The different characters do different things, true, but really there are very few spots in the game where your choice of characters will make a difference in the final outcome."
5.0	If you own a PS3 and don't have this game yet, get it. It isn't just a traditional zombie game, it's not just repetitive combat, every scene feels different and important. And yes I said scene because it feels like you are in a movie. The beginning scene dragged on a little bit but once you finish it, it is definitely worth continuing. Please do yourself a favor and get this game.
5.0	My son decided to peel away the rubber on the thumstick for unknown reasons.  I was looking for a quick cheap,fix, and here it is.  Easy to install.  Works great.  Includes the tool needed to change the piece.
5.0	this are amazing and good and  i like it and it come on time too that great that all i say
5.0	Wheatly!!!! Come back in Portal 3! There better be a Portal 3!!!!!
5.0	So far I have had a pleasant experience with my wii u. Sure it's not as powerful as the Ps4 and X1 but it still beats them in terms of flexibility and game quality<br /><br />cons<br />Console is not as technologically advanced as it's competitors but the great games on this system make up for it.<br /><br />pros<br />-Free Online<br />-Backwards Compatibility<br />-Great lineup of exclusive games<br />-King of local co-op games<br />-Stunning graphics, almost every game runs at 1080p 60fps and manages to look breathtaking, from Windwaker HD to Mario Kart 8.<br /><br />If you're the type of person who loves to invite friends over to play games then this is best console out there. (Plus it works with Wii games). It will also let you move your wii game data to the Wii U which is incredibly convenient.<br /><br />9.0/10
5.0	I am loving this game! So fun.
5.0	If you are a WoW fan this is the set to get. Great deal at a very reasonable price. The enclosed book is a little cheesy but might help someone who hasn't played before.
5.0	Case is awesome protects well and keeps the ps vita safe and secure and helps prevent damage from any drops
5.0	Awsome game just like samrui warroirs
5.0	so far so good, came fully packaged with no issues, hooked right up n began charging.  Oh and mine does turn green when the battery is full and I'm playing one to see how long it takes til the battery dies so i'll post more soon
5.0	"I'm the father of 2 teen aged sons. I was a lead singer in a rock band decades ago. We all have a blast with this game. Even though I've got professional experience with singing, since the game has various levels of difficulty, I keep my ego in check, and there are times where I am the \\""low man\\"" so to speak, in scoring. That makes it a game that could last forever as far as appeal to us all. The songs available are a good mix. All 3 instruments have precise action. I have nothing but praise for the creators of this game. Thanks a lot!"
5.0	So, for this kind of price, you can't go wrong!   I'm going to buy enough to cover the  whole wall.  I originally bought it for guitar hero.... So, my buddies and I throw this party at our frat house, which is a regular thing for us. But, this time, we plugged in the hexolight tower and boom...people were showing up from other houses.    Love this! Really adds atmosphere to just plain music.    Two Thumbs up!    I noticed  a previous reviewer slamming the product for being plastic. ha! if this were metal, it would be super-heavy, and, WAY expensive. As it is, I can take it with me fairly easily, and, it's easy to assemble and rearrange.
5.0	I liked the game, I don't see any issues with it. It's fun, yes there are going to be campers in any multi player, but, get over it and switch lobbies...
5.0	Tired of all the high school kids blindly raving about generic flash-in-the-pan games like Call of Duty? Me too. Luckily for those of us with standards, there's Unreal Tournament 2004: a game with the kind of shelf life those games could only dream of having. The customization options are nearly endless and the amount of sheer content is impressive even by today's standards. Don't feel like playing online yet? Just turn on your own custom game in instant action and get some practice while getting all the intense white knuckle action the multiplayer offers. No matter what your taste in shooters, Unreal 2k4 caters to it with a banquet.
5.0	Amazing game. They took everything good from City and made it tens times bigger and better. New moves, gadgets. It's a great prequel. Still the same great Batman you know and love just improved upon from the last. I own all the Batman games. This is my new favorite. Worth every penny.
5.0	I wanted to get this for a long time!The product was brand new well packed and received it quickly.The mics work perfectly and the game too.There is aproximatly 15-17 and are mostly very popular(and 3-4 of them really suck and I never heard of).Of course you will have to purchase more songs on their singstar store...every extra song is around 1.50$ or soo they have a pretty big selection of most played songs out there.I think its a great purchase if your willing to invest on it for super fun nights at your house with some friends.
5.0	This is the best RPG for N64. It's a different kind of game.. you live on a farm! You grow crops, chase women, raise animals, become friends with villagers, add extensions to your house, get married, have a kid, and there is soo much more you do in the game.  It is definitely a must buy! Addictive gameplay will have you playing it for hours!  The graphics are great and the animals are so cute! Have fun playing it :D
1.0	I played it for and hour pushing myself to believe it was worth investing time, but not for this game. I wish you luck if you plan to buy this game - it did not work out for me.
5.0	The seller was so nice when i had i problem  and it looks amazing
5.0	Good deal for this game, I also bought others for a good price.  Would suggest you bundle the games as you do others.
5.0	Awesome product and exactly as described. I have been using it on daily basis without any problems. I would recommend this highly.
5.0	awsome game lots to explore and great interaction with ai characters never gets boring and hard to put down. a must have.
1.0	Horrible...kept saying error to my son when he played it...
5.0	So far I am pretty pleased with this. I knew it's limitations before buying it. Half the bad reviews here are from people with no sense to research a product before it's release. Whining about lack of Netflix and other streaming services when they were never advertised. As well as limited compatibility with Vita handheld games. I knew what I was buying. I do hope they will bring more applications to the unit though, but I will not lower my rating because they didn't come on it.<br /><br />I have used the remote play at home on a wired LAN, and it worked PERFECTLY  I have played MANY MANY hours of Dragon Age, and Defense Grid locally, and over wifi on my work network. (Both are comcast) My work network is Wifi, and the results are varied, note I also share that Wifi with 50-80 other people. So some times the streaming worked great, and other times not so good. Vita TV fault or too many people hogging my stream? But for the most part my experience has been positive!<br /><br />I don't have a lot of Vita games, but the included Lego game looked good. I sold the PS3 controller to a friend, and am using a PS4 controller.<br /><br />My main reason for getting this was using remote play at home, which works fine for me so far. And perhaps the occasional streaming session to work. Anything beyond this is just cake to me.
5.0	I love this game! You can build your own cars, and win more piezes! I also like the SECRET SHORT CUTS!!!! By hitting sertain objecs, you can open up doors that the computer wount take! (time races are an exeptien) some times, they are open, but hard to see. Thier are even cheet codes! unforchently, this is can not be used to open cars, and the computer can use them to, here are two codes, flyskyhi and nowheels.
5.0	This was fun, easy to use, and helps to develop stability and balance.  It was very easy to install as well.
5.0	Title says it all. Product is sturdy and does exactly what you'd expect from it. Looks cool too. One word of caution, if you are buying this product new, the battery packs may be tough to get into the wii remote. New plastic items usually have some resistance.
5.0	I got this pair during gold box event for a great price, would pay amazon regular price for these headphones, I've had them now over a month without any issues just a few cables to deal with, thanks amazon...
1.0	Worked perfect with my old Labtec collar mic.  Then for some reason it started just transmitting static and now nothing at all.
5.0	From the picture, it might look small .. however, the size is just right ..I love the material and the build quality<br />The rope thought is not tightened by default. You have to do it manually.
5.0	Okay, so it's a port. A genius port. And, yes, there are slightly rounded out, SLIGHTLY better graphics. Let's be serious, Capcom tried to cash in on this, but I think it came out for a good reason. Who wants to play a PS2 anyway with a PSX game? Haha. Anyway, the only way for you to get the complete RE series is with the Nintendo Gamecube because of the RE remake and RE0. It's worth it, people. Yes, it's the same game. THE SAME GREAT GAME. And, if you get your hands on this rare, pricy gem, get RE3 Nemesis as well, pick up the others for a mere few bucks apeice (RE:$10, RE0: $12, RE4: $14, RECVX: $25 [rare.]) Why all the complaining? Buy if you're a Nintendo, RE, or just plain zombie fan.
5.0	This is awesome, I got my package early and right when I got it I replaced the shell on my ds lite. Now it's better looking than before. It even fit perfectly and this was my first time replacing a shell on a ds. I think I did pretty good, took an hour and 30 minutes. I'm going to buy another one soon for my brother's ds.
5.0	I gave this to a 9 year old boy for his birthday and he absolutely loves it. Great product and it gets you mov'n.
5.0	This is a great strategy game. If you ever wondered what empire-building during the Napoleonic era was like, this is the game for you. The game is thoroughly researched down to the level of the uniforms and weaponry, and the military units manouver in the precise manner described in military history books. For naval warfare buffs, it brings new realism to naval strategy games, allowing for the wind factor and the accuracy of the guns. <br />Be warned, however, this is a game for hard-core strategists, not for the shoot-em up crowd. If you consider yourself a cognoscenti of military strategy games with more than a passing taste for history, give this one a try, you won't regret it
5.0	Boring co op mode and boring online unless you have friends. If my friends aren't on, I don't even touch it.
5.0	First I bought this for fun, then when i had to buy an additional new controller I saw the need for a charger. This charger is quite cool, shows red when it is charging but as soon as controller is charged it shows green, however this doesn't work for fake controllers unfortunately.
1.0	my daughter loves this but it frustrates her that she doesn't understand most of it its more for older kids who can spell and such
5.0	If you're a fan of Sandbox RPG's, then this is the game for you. I play it all the time now and it was worth the money spent. I recommend getting both DLC's with this game to better the gaming experience. I hope you all enjoy this game as much as I do.<br />The shipping was excellent and nothing was damaged. Truly an excellent buy
5.0	Great service and great product...
5.0	"Besides the book \\""Mark of the Dragon\\"", this was the best thing under the tree this year. The PSP has mini discs and plays full movies. The color, sound are excellent. The graphics are excellent."
5.0	I got 2 of these bundles because they came with the wireless arcade sticks. I am not a big Tekken fan but the wireless arcade sticks are amazing. it is worth betting this bundles just for the wireless arcade sticks.
5.0	Anyone who doesent like this game is wrong. Yes its hard but its nfun when you learn. The fun isent just in completeing the quests but in building your charactor and gathering new items to power up your hero.  The game is fun, addictive,and worth your buck...and 50 bucks for Diablo, D2 and LOD are included for a price that I paid for Just D2 when it came out. worth the price.
1.0	"I agree with most of the other people that posted. This game is a straight run and gun game with no planing or strategy. Hell most of the time your team seems to be there to serve as another target for your enemy. The AI sucks badly most \\""breach bang and clear\\"" strategies seem to fail most of the time. Also you only get one squad instead of 3, no mission planning and the weapon selections blows. They probably took out the mission planning since they want the game to be a run gun style game. I would probably given this game a higher score if they named it something other than R6 for the reason when I think of a Tom Clancy game I think of strategy, Teamwork and patience ,you don't need any of that here. Don't get me wrong its a mediocre game at best but doesn't deserve the R6 title."
5.0	I bought this DSi as a gift for my boyfriend a year ago, and he loves it! Works great even till this day! The color of the DSi we got was Matte Blue and it looks and feels awesome. Definitely a 5/5 for the appearance. Big fan for all Nintendo s, and definitely looking forward to the new models when they come out.
5.0	Good game on any system.  Story is good, visuals are great, action is non-stop.  Would highly recommend.  A worthy edition in this series.
5.0	Use to play Nintindo years ago. Made a game room for grandchildren of which this worked out great. Brings back many memories. Thank you!
5.0	Is the best game I can play, Thanks!
1.0	I tried the X-box controller on one of the demo units in an electronics store.  I plan to buy an X-box, but the first thing I intend to do is replace the controller.  I have big hands, but I still found the Microsoft controller VERY uncomfortable to hold.  Also, the black and white buttons are impossible to hit without changing your grip.  Microsoft says that this controller is the result of hundreds of hours of playing testing.  I just don't see how that can be true.  Try the Gamecube for a controller with a perfect grip.
5.0	I love this game! I have had it ever since it came out and it is truly a fun adventure!<br />I think the best part is all the Arcade games that people make! You can play all these games for free and they are really entertaining. I also bought D3 and that became a table coaster after a month (Such a horrbile game).But since you have so much to do in this game it just keeps you coming back for more!
5.0	I bought this game as a gift for my husband (he is in his 30's) and he loves this game. He said it is the best hockey game he's ever owned. The first night, he played 9 games and he didnt recieve the game till 830pm. I highly recommend this game for anyone who loves hockey.
5.0	never used them but they looked like they would be nice
5.0	Everything my kids hoped for. Play as the lead character and unlock other heroes, all works as advertised. Classic Lego Wii game.
1.0	There is really no valid reason to require a single player game to maintain a constant internet connection. I don't care about auctioning items, I don't want to hack my game or character, I just want to be able to play the game I paid for when & where I want to play it.
5.0	wwf raw is the best wrestling game out there is great entrances there is tons of wrestlers match modes 2 words BUY IT!!
5.0	I had played ME3 before buying this title, but had to start at the very beginning.  The series is so much more fun when you can start from the beginning.
1.0	OK, I bought this at Bestbuy with a gift card. It took over an hour to get it installed and runninng. Multiple retries on the downloads and installation. Had to set up accounts with passwords, email addresses, etc. Had to restart the computer a couple of times also to get changes to take effect. I have a pretty beefy PC with Windows 7. When I finally got it to run, it wouldn't recognize the audio signal from the guitar and I had to restart the computer again. Finally reached the point where it would hear my guitar and started the program. The online instructions were not helpful. Then, after looking at the interface the notes come down what looks like a train track instead of normal tabs or music notation, I decided to uninstall the program and throw the junk in the trash. It looks nothing like the music in books or online tabs.  Good luck, others seem to like it, but I lost enthusiasm after the install problems and then seeing the interface.
5.0	This is basically what you see is what you get. This is indeed a great game if you love tear your enemies arms off and chopping heads. What red blooded male doesn't like that in his video games? This game isn't for kids, it doesn't have just tons of blood but tons of naked ladies. Yes, I've never seen so much bare flesh in a video game.<br /><br />The story is pretty cool, but very forgettable. What keeps this game going is the awesome sword combos and blood splattered by your sword. Many times I forgot what the actually storyline was about. Didn't care. Another cool thing about this game is that Conan is played by Hellboy himself, Ron Perlman. Overall, if ya wanna get your grove on by chopping up the baddies and saving naked women, this game is made for you. If you don't like the sound of that, then you won't like this game. Simple as that
5.0	Got this for my teenager for Christmas.  He was so excited when he opened the box.  Great sound quality and easy to use.
5.0	I was really scared about this. First, my headset is a Bose QuietComfort 15, so the Beats compatibility was still to be seen. Then, I didn't see anywhere that the new adapter was included. I had to send it to Spain so it was a bit risky. Anyway, at last everything went great, I'm now enjoying some Battlefied 3 and Dead Island online playing while talking to my friends. I highly recommend this for the specific purpose (to use a regular headset with microphone as a ps3 headset).
5.0	That's a good deal.  Tnx
5.0	I love this game.  It is unlike any other game I've ever played.  It's a defense attorney game and also kind of a mystery game where you have to find evidence and interview people.  I can't tell you how much it will be worth your while to buy this game.
5.0	Not since FFX have I been so excited about a game.  Great plot and game play.  Can't wait for Episode II.  I much better game than .Hack.<br />The music is also fantasic and is along the quality of FFX.<br />Purchase the book. It adds a lot to the game because it lists all of the charactors skills, tech attacks, and ether.
5.0	This game is highly addictive, beware!  There are many ways to play (strategies to use), tons of map setup options, the ship customization is simple yet very flexible, and the graphics and menus are streamlined and pretty.  Initial learning curve may be moderate for some but with even a short websearch you will find an easy read to help you grasp the few not-so-obvious points in the game.  After playing a couple times the play will come naturally and you will have a hard time tearing yourself away from the game.  Additionally, the product support, update system, and overall care the developers have put and continue to place in this game is top-notch in the industry.  Enjoy!
5.0	This game marries a light hearted presentation to mind bending puzzles. The difficulty has been overstated in most of the reviews; I was expecting to get frustrated but so far I've only had to consult online FAQs a few times, and have enjoyed the game thoroughly, even when stuck. The character designs and animations are very cute and amusing. Despite being a single player game, the game is fun for spectators because they can help solve the puzzles. Highly recommended for those looking for something offbeat.
5.0	Awesome graphics!!! Love the game!!
5.0	good game. it is hard, and very interesting. my girl is very complished with this. i will buy others. f
5.0	Was just as described and plays great so it earns a thumbs up from me.
5.0	I bought this for a friend's son for his birthday and the kid loves it. He has wanted an X Box for a long time and he was very happy to receive this gift.
1.0	We received this today, and were shocked to find not even an Instruction Booklet included with the game.  Feeling disappointed.<br /><br />I originally posted the above sentence and was called every name in the book by morons because I wanted even a simple Instruction Booklet included.<br /><br />Now that being said, after a month of trying to play and enjoy this game, I am still disappointed.  We had hoped for more.<br /><br />The game controls are awkward and not conducive to enjoyment.  The story line is fragmented and makes it hard to become enamored enough with the plot that MAY encourage one to get beyond the cumbersome controls.<br /><br />This game sucks....and I regret ever ordering it.
5.0	I've seen crossbows on the trailers for both of the previous games , but your character can't use one. Glad to see you can in this game. The story line is awesome as usual , and multi player isn't that bad. The graphics and interface has been improved , but at the beginning of the game , you start off from where you stopped in AC2 , but your character has different armor and an odd number of money. Overall , the game is addictive and fun.
5.0	BEST GTA GAME EVER!! Everything off it is worth the money. GAMEPLAY IS NICE AND ALSO THE FREEDOM YOU GET
5.0	This will fit the new 3DS games, has 1 slot that will only fit an SD card, the rest will fit 3DS games. Great price, solid container.
5.0	My grandson absolutely loves it!
1.0	I live for games and this one was disapointing. I acutally returned it. Animations, though impressive, were very slow and cumbersome - so much so that I was loath pick things up or open doors. The camera is irritating when you are in a hallway and can not manuever it to see whats in front of you. I was very unhappy with this game and returned it to the store from which it came.
5.0	I repeat, who ever gives this game a 1 or 2 stars SUKS!!! THIS IS GAME IS SWEET... LOOK I HAVE PLAYED EVERY AND I MEAN EVERY  GAME TITLE FOR B-BALL ... WHEATER IT BE NBA STREET... NBA LIVE OR ANY OTHER WORKING TITLE FO B-BALL THIS GAME IS PROBABLY THE BEST ONE SO FAR! THE GRAPHICS ARE AMAZING... WHEN I SAW VINCE CARTER, I THOUGHT  THAT I WAS WATCHIN TV!! IT IS SO LIFE LIKE... THIS GAME IS CHALLANGING.. AND FUN ALL AT THE SAME TIME.. U CANT GET ANY BETTER THEN THIS ... I CANNOT BELIVE ANYONE COULD GIVE THIS A 1 OR 2 STARS... I CANNOT BELIVE IT.... WHEN THIS GAME COMES OUT FO THE PSP (WHICH I HAVE) I AM DEFINATLY GETTIN IT...
5.0	I bought this for my boyfriend and he loves it!<br />It made a perfect Valentine's day gift for my gamer.
5.0	Our 7 year old grandson asked for the Gameboy, Racing GBA 4 Pack: GT Advance Championship Racing, GT Advance 2 Rally Racing, GT Advance 2 Rally Racing, GT Advance 3 Pro Colncept Racing, and Moto GP and I found it on Amazon.com less than 2 weeks before Christmas! I was concerned that it wouldn't arrive in time for Christmas but decided to give it a try anyway! Thanks to Amazon.com and their supplier, RelaxTime (Rebecca) we recieved this game only 5 days after I ordered it!!! It arrived by USPS on Dec. 14th...plenty of time...a full 10 days before Christmas!!!! I am very happy with the game and even more happy with the speed with which it was delivered! (after all, I don't know anything about this game...I'm too old...our grandson tells us!) I am SURE that our grandson will enjoy this gift! Special thanks to Rebecca at RelaxTime for sending to us on the very same day that she received the request!!!!!    Thanks Again! I'll be back!  One Happy Grandma
5.0	Really great game that is a blast to play. I would recommend ever one try it just to have a good laugh.
5.0	shaolin monks is the highlight of this collection I would recommend to any mortal kombat fan Armageddon is also a fun game
5.0	This is for some odd reason my favorite game. It may be because it's a game I can beat all my friends at, or because it's a truly challenging, amazing game. I rate it 4 stars for fun because at time, when the levels get higher and higher, I start hating the game and myself for not being able to beat it. But, if you want a great game to play with friends that enjoy video games, GET THIS!
5.0	It's the biggest on the market, it's worth the amount! You never have to worry for a good while when it comes to downloading all the goodness you'll get from this 64GB Vita Memory card!
1.0	DO NOT BUY.<br /><br />DO NOT INSTALL.<br /><br />Will not run properly!  No patches or updates or customer support, my machine more than meets minimum running requirements too.
5.0	Old gamecube controllers were sticky. Pleasent surprise that cord is longer than original.
5.0	Im here to clear up all the bs reviews both good and bad from people who never bought it, its an amazing system that is lighting fast compared to ps3, the 500 mb download update.took a matter of seconds, taking longer to install than download, shows their servers are amazing, you get what you pay for, you cant compare the servers to ps3 since ita free, but its worth the required.ps plu s to play multiplayer for this reason, almost no loading screens, killzone booted up almost instantly and i could message my friend without waiting when i pressed ps button, thank you gpu, and to these false reviews about peoples system not working, there are 2 problems so far on a very small percentage of ps4, with either the hdmi port not fitting correctly and the system bricking. Unfortunately that happened to my friend, i was like bs.no way and it turned.out.to be true, you cant expect sony to not have any problems with the extreme number of consoles pumped out on launch day, compared  to ps2 and ps3 the only problem i have is it was not made in japan like previous 2 launch consoles, but if it was it would be.more expensive and less of them and you would not have it right now, back to my friend he was very unlucky but both amazon and sony was quick to respond and he is sending it to sony with amazon offering a credit of 30 bucks, he was just upset they didn't have replacements available for this problem, he was extremely unlucky and i know a lot of ppl who got the pa4 and he is the only person I KNOW with thia problem, stop reading stuff on the internet and act like it happened to you when you didnt buy it, and if you say you bought it somewhere else qrite the review there, cause you have no standing when tou write a review and it doesnt say you had bought it from amazon, again this is more to disclaim the false reviews more than about how good the ps4 is,  cause everyone who played it knows the ps4 is amazing, id be upset too if my system  didnt work but thats the risk you take with buying day one, compared to 360 messing up for years because of using a cheap metallic.instead of silver paste shows microsoft usually goes the cheap rout, buy in confidence
5.0	controller arrived in 2 days (prime member) easy to set up works awesome!!
5.0	I personally think Halo: Combat Evolved is a bit better than Halo 2, but this game is still amazing. The graphics are really good, but sometimes they are a bit choppy. The new guns though are powerful, the story mode is really fun also. I wouldn't know what online play on Live would be, but from what I've heard from others its awesome. One of my friends faced two people from Bungie and they kicked my friends' ass. A must buy for Xbox gamers.
5.0	I am 33 years old man , I use to play Super Mario Brothers back in the day , when I was 10-11 years old<br />When I started to play this new super Mario Brothers , I got Hooked .<br />Be carfull when you buy this game you will get hooked .<br /><br />Good luck and have fun with it.
1.0	I bought this game to play on my macbook but I only installed it and never played it.  I saw many review that it doesn't play very well on the macbook.  My is new and hope when i play it will be good.  But also saw reviews where there is no evolution going on that u can change ur creature anytime and it will not have an effect on how u create it.  Thats dumb.  But with so many 1-star rating for the DRM I agree with many of the users opinions.
1.0	Ok, well...saw this one at the video store and said to myself...Hmm, looks good to me. So I decided to give it a go. I was in dismay as I looked at the number of events there were. Six...SIX EVENTS! To me this is simply not enough. What happened to the good ole days of many events on an olympic game that required you to do button taps until your fingers bled. I miss those days. But we are given this, hideous excuse for an Olympic Sim. Do yourself a favor and go get Dance Dance Revolution and do some actual physical exercise. And its fun too.
5.0	Dont ask questions , just get the game.
5.0	very fun racing wheel. My 8 year old is thrilled!
1.0	I've played my fair share of strategy games, sports games, and fantasy RPGs. I love Warcraft and remember the board game Blood Bowl fondly from my college years.    This video game is terrible. It has ugly graphics, the worst Tutorial imaginable (particularly inexcusable since it's based on an existing board game), and it is, simply, no fun to play. The gameplay is slow, the controls are unintuitive and frustrating, and the learning curve is WAY too long to be worth it.    Want to know why a game less than a year old originally priced at $50 is going for $17 on Amazon and $30 at Best Buy? Hint: it's not because they're trying to build up the online community. It's because the game sucks. Consider yourselves warned.
5.0	This is a great stand! completely adjustable and sturdy. My G27 assembly went on smoothly.<br /><br />The only improvements I can think of would be:<br />1. allow the shifter to be mounted at a lower level then the wheel. But to be honest it is working great in the current position; but I am not sure how many users would like it;<br />2. Add some wheels to easy movement. I (and my wife) like to keep it out of the way, so right now I have to carry it around. While it is not heavy, it would be nice not to have to raise it to reduce the noise and not wake the kids. I will likely be modding it soon to add some wheels;<br />3. Maybe having some guides to the wheel wires? But that can be easily addressed with some tape or other products.<br /><br />Perhaps selling 1 and 2 as add-on would be nice, but I won't remove any star from the review since the base does its job very well.<br /><br />Also, a new set of instructions is included with the stand with color photos now. I saw some review a while back that complained about it and it has been addressed. Nothing better than a seller that cares!
5.0	We are having a blast with this game.  Age-appropriate for our four-year-old son. And a popcorn gun to boot.  Would definitely recommend.
5.0	These take a while to get used to, and at first I was skeptical. The only downfall is that they occasionally pop off, but you could always superglue them on If u like. It makes it difficult to push the menu button to check your score without taking the left analog stick with it. That all being said, once you are completely used to these, it gives you quite an edge over the opponent. My kill death ratio went from 1.6 to 2.3 over the last couple months.
1.0	full ***t. wors racing game on ps3 i have ever seen.    don't buy this game.  i steel not understand why i pay so much monay for this ***t game.    i will never buy NFS.
5.0	This game is fun and easy to play. I love these type of games, I even got my friend to start playing it.
5.0	has new songs, and we had a good time for hours. we used it for additional party activities. The kids and adults loved it!
1.0	As other have stated playing Jeremy McGrath's Supercross World is like playing a PS1 title. It's terrible in every way possible. From the graphics to the physics of the game. It looks absolutely silly and laughable. If you're into supercross [[ASIN:B0000ZG4A0 MX Unleashed]] or [[ASIN:B0006JMLMK MX vs ATV Unleashed]] is the way to go for the PS2.
1.0	Too small, and big enough to wrap around a Rockstar energy can. but if you have less than 10 inches of mouse space is ok.
5.0	It was very easy to install and it continues to defy gravity by holding my Kinect far above the ground.
5.0	Purchased this as a gift for my wife but the whole family benefits from it.  Great fun for the money.
5.0	Very happy with this game!
5.0	was as stated and arrived in plenty of time for gift giving
5.0	I am not an easy one to scare, but this game is the scariest thing I have ever witnessed. It is extremely demented and disturbing, and sails high above the other horror games I've played. I actually Screamed at some parts! I was even afraid to walk in my house at night.
1.0	I notice that there's no mention of Al Lowe anywhere from Sierra.  Here's the simple truth - if the genius creator of LSL's 1 - 6 is missing, then this isn't an LSL game at all - just a cheap rip off. <br /> <br />Message to pointy-haired bosses at Sierra: You can buy the LSL concept.  You can buy Larry's image.  But if you don't have Al Lowe, you don't have anything.
5.0	Someone gave me a Sega Saturn with no cords, so I picked this one up on the cheap. Works fine, and there's no issues. Recommended.
5.0	it was my first dq game and i will ply others a definite must buy for any rpg and video game lovers.
5.0	I bought this console after having 3 of the original (white) Xbox's break on me. Microsoft replaced the first 2 but my most recent one was out of warranty. I had the money so I bought the new console, and I have to say I'm impressed; no problems so far, does what it's meant to do, runs more quietly, and the touch-sensitive buttons make me feel fancy. Also, the controller it comes with is sexy looking. My advice for someone who needs a new Xbox: Buy this 4GB console for the best price you can find it for ($180 new on Amazon/Ebay) and then buy a 3rd party 250GB hard drive for $40-50. It's essentially the same thing as a Microsoft hard drive; a regular laptop HDD inside of a plastic case.
1.0	This game is nothing like the Just Dance style games, its difficult for younger children to navigate and the music quality is poor.
5.0	The comfort of the headset are phenomenal and the Sound quality is the best I have gotten from any other gaming headset defintely a great choice when looking for a gaming headset.
5.0	This is the Game...The game for everyone, the best game ever. What do you wanna do in this game? you wanna go slow-mo and still be able to aim your guns a shoot up bad guys? You wanna be able to touch anything in the souroundings? &quot;why put somthing in a game that you can't enteract with?&quot;,do it all. Buy this right now, its the best Action game you will ever see. Maybe forever.
5.0	LK was one of the best expansions in WOW. Played since vanilla release LK had amazing story line and was a lot of fun. I would also recommend the book for this expansion it was a good read.
5.0	Here's a really quick review. MLBTS11 uses the same formula as MLBTS10, with a just a few (but MAJOR) updates. Of course, we have purely analog options for hitting, pitching, and fielding. My personal preference is to use analog control for hitting (which makes hitting infinitely more possible but also more fun and intuitive/engaging) and pitching (which is more fun, but also more challenging than simple button pitching) while leaving the fielding option as button control only. To me, this makes the game 100% stronger than its immediate predecessor. They also modified some of the in-game physics so a baseball hitting the outfield wall doesn't go bouncing away like its made of rubber. There are still frustratingly slow field-to-throw transitions for fielders, but this is minor really. Some of the Cooperstown and Minor League options are no longer available (very limited selection of Minor League fields to play at), but again these are minor. My biggest complaint is that, like previous iterations, almost every game has this inexplicable feeling of predetermination to it...like the outcome is already set and the computer adjusts its own play to achieve said outcome. Whether this means the computer giving you too many opportunities to win or breaking out of a scoreless rut to hit 4 HRs in the 9th, I'm often left wondering whether (like pro wrestling) each match is fixed. Who knows. All in all, this is the game I'd hoped MLBTS10 would have been.
5.0	If you're a fan of previous Monster Hunter titles, you'll be glad that this iteration does nothing but build on a good thing. The two new weapon classes (the Insect Glave and the Charge Blade) are a lot of fun, as are the new climbing and mounting mechanics.<br /><br />The Insect Glaive (or, as I call it, the Pogo Stick) lets you pole vault into the air and onto the monsters' backs (more on that later), and comes with a giant bug that you use like a falconer's falcon to attack the monsters with, dealing damage and granting yourself buffs. The Charge Blade is basically a Sword 'n' Shield that can turn into a Switch Axe in Axe mode, but is much more complicated and takes a bit of time to learn. With each hit of the Blade in Sword 'n' Shield mode, the Charge Blade builds energy, which can be released when the weapon is in Axe mode. Switching between the two modes is fun and adds a bit of strategy to combat.<br /><br />Swimming is gone from the Monster Hunter formula, and while I personally will miss it, it has been replaced by something much better: the ability to mount monsters! Mounting monsters is an absolute no-brainer, from the time I started playing the original Monster Hunter I've always said to myself, &#34;Wouldn't it add to the immersion if you could climb on the monsters?&#34; And it's tons of fun, too! At times, however, the fights seem to devolve into seeing how many times you can mount a monster, which makes it feel kind of cheap, but it doesn't happen all that often.<br /><br />Another improvement is that we don't have to put up with Cha-Cha or Kayamba anymore! Instead, Capcom has realized that Felyne companions were always much more amusing and has brought them back and made them more useful than ever. I still miss the Monster Hunter Freedom Unite system, but this is way better than what MH3 gave us.<br /><br />Lastly, there is much more of a plot in this new game. It's still just an excuse to get you to hunt monsters, but the writing is very amusing and funny, so I always eagerly await talking to everyone when I get back from each quest.<br /><br />This has been just a quick review, so I'm not really going into anything too deeply. If I have any complaints, it's that I feel they've upped the difficulty a little bit too much. The game is still tons of fun and it's not TOO hard, but I have to say I've never gotten frustrated with a Monster Hunter game before now. I mean, Frenzied Deviljho? And I'm not even in G-Rank yet? C'mon Capcom, I'm just one guy.
5.0	Loves everything about this game!!!
5.0	Very fun. Can be used with multiple players, uses balance board or dance mat. I found the dance mat to work the best. Great game.
5.0	Its Minecraft on the PS3. Works great.
5.0	Playing Curse of Monkey Island is like going on a hilarious trip to the Past! The engaging plot, entertaining music, unique characters and witty repartee make this a must-play for young and adult gamesters alike. It is  such a feel-good game, you would love to play it over and over again!
1.0	This game was HORRIBLE.  Do yourself a favor and do not buy this.  However, if you insist on buying, please contact me and I will pay you to take it from my possession.  Yes, it is THAT bad.
5.0	This is a must own if you have a ps vita! I love playing online and the arcade mode was fun! Emmett Graves is my favorite character!
5.0	Cool and easy. Too bad i lost it 2 months ago but i think it is the best game on gameboy. easy and fun, unlike the red/blue/yellow/green versions. I wished it was on n64 instead so i won't loose it. waste your money on this  instead of real cards is better. i like it anyways.
5.0	A must have for a game freak
1.0	I just wanted to give everyone a heads up. I thought it was weird that the controller pictures was wired so i went to Mad Catz website and this is not a wireless controller. Only the PS3 version is wireless so if that is a dealbreaker for you do not purchase this.
5.0	I loved playing Hakuoki: Demon Of The Fleeting Blossom. As a fan of Japanese games and artwork, this game caught my attention right away and I have spent countless hours playing this game.
5.0	I bought this for my son to play - and it is perfect.  He is very into Star Wars right now and Legos Star Wars is perfect.  My 5 year old can easily navigate the system and absolutely loves it.  The only negative is that first thing in the morning he wants to play Star Wars...
5.0	The follow-up to Just Dance has an even better variety of music and dances.  It's a fun way to keep moving.
5.0	Simplemente excelente producto y funcional. Muy bueno sinceramente, cumplió todas mis expectativas y funciona perfectamente. Totalmente recomendable para todas las personas. Muchas gracias
5.0	I bought this as a Christmas present for my son who has thoroughly enjoyed playing it and still continues to do so. It was in immaculate condition when I received it. It seemed the only difference between a brand new game and the one I received was the absence of plastic.
5.0	I like dis lil' pokeball skin case here,it looks real cool, I will look at a pokeball every time I play pokemon.
5.0	I play a lot of games on both the PS3 and the Xbox 360 and I have to say that Uncharted 2 is my favorite out of all of them.  Other games, like Mass Effect and Assassin's Creed 2, come close, but no other game combines the overall polish, playability and fun quite so perfectly as Uncharted 2: Among Thieves.  If you read my review of the original Uncharted: Drake's Fortune you will see that I had very high praise for that game as well.  What's amazing, though, is that despite how incredible the first Uncharted was, the sequel betters it in nearly every way.  The gameplay is even more dynamic, with enhanced stealth and traversal mechanics, which gives you more options about how to approach a given combat scenario.  I've had fun trying to beat some sections of the game using nothing but stealth.  Another neat addition to Uncharted 2 is the way so many of the environments you find yourself fighting in are actually dynamically moving under your feet--from moving trains and trucks to crubling buildings--which actually affects your character's movement, as well as your aim.  Many games would handle scenerios like this through cut scenes, but getting to actually play through such moments is exhilarating.   The narrative that weaves through Uncharted 2 is of Hollywood movie caliber.  No, strike that, it's actually better than many Hollywood movies.  The characters have dimension and are entirely believable.  The main characters are so likeable and you can't help but root for Nathan and his friends.  The pacing, both in terms of storytelling and gameplay, is nearly flawless.  It is very hard to put down the controller once you start.    The graphics are also outstanding and are probably the most impressive I have ever seen in a video game.  There is such an amazing attention to detail and the textures, lighting and post-processing effects come together to create an extremely believable world.  The art direction and level design are so great and you find yourself in these immense, beautiful locations that just take your breath away sometimes.  On top of all this, Uncharted 2 brings a full suite of multiplayer modes that were not present in the first game.  And they are really good.  I am a high ranking Uncharted 2 player online and I play the multiplayer modes almost every day.  I've played online with Killzone 2, Gears of War 2, Halo 3, etc, etc and I can honestly say that I find the multi-player portion of Uncharted 2 to be more refined and enjoyable than any of them.  The way you can climb and jump around the levels makes the gameplay very dynamic and fluid--Gears of War 2, for example, feels very clunky and slow in comparison.  Another thing I really like about Uncharted 2 online is the fact that I actually use nearly every weapon in the game, whereas in many online games I mainly stick to one or two weapons.  All of the weapons in Uncharted 2 are really well balanced and they all have their strengths and weaknesses which allow for different strategies.  In a given match I usually find myself switching between about 5 different weapons.  Amazing all around!  In conclusion, Uncharted 2: Among Thieves is the full package.  The single player campaign by itself is among the best experiences I have ever had.  The characters, the narrative, the gameplay and the presentation are all a notch above and exude a sense of polish and attention to detail that is simply amazing.  Add on top of that one of the most well-designed multiplayer offerings and you simply can't go wrong with this game.  Naughty Dog, the developer, should be commended.  Uncharted and Uncharted 2 are both in my top 5 favorite games of all time and I can't wait to see what the talented guys and gals at Naughty Dog come up with next.
5.0	Excellent quality, pretty much the stock version and worked perfectly! I've seen others that are very poor and this one is perfect if you need a replacement.
5.0	Super game fanatic, possible future game developer. She loves this game, but she knows this before it arrives, as she does lots of research.
5.0	This is one of the greatest RPG's in the history of gaming and way ahead of its time.<br /><br />Why I think it's one of the best:<br />- Music<br />- Time travel<br />- Gameplay mechanics (ability to combine abilities other party members<br />- Story<br />- Characters (Personality and each character is very different with different abilities/powers)<br />- High replay value (many different endings)
5.0	The power and play charging system is a quick and easy way to recharge your PS3 controllers.The cable that comes with the system is way to short,unless you like to play sitting on the floor  right in front of your TV. Just 2 hours to fully charge. Worth the money.
5.0	Pros:<br /><br />It does what it says it does and works with BOP2 and MW3, as well as ME3, BF3 and DS3.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Battery life does suffer from LED light usage, but it is extremely cool to look at and ultimately<br />I only use it for FPS anyways, So the 8 hours I get is ample enough.<br /><br />Overall worth the money!
1.0	1.It is less powerful than Xbox, so you won't have too worry about your games becoming too realistic.  It also doesn't support Dolby Digital Sound.<BR>2.It has a whopping 5 games at launch, so you won't have to think too hard on which bad game to buy.  By the way, Xbox has 30 great games at launch.<BR>3.It comes in cool colors like purple<BR>4.It doesn't play DVD, unlike the Xbox, so you won't be forced to watch movies.  You wouldn't want anything to interfere with  you and Pikachu's friendship, now would you?<BR>5.The controller will blend in with the rest of your fisher price toys.<BR>6. The game discs can fit less information than Xbox games, so the games won't have too many extra features.  They will also be shorter (then again, for gamecube games, that's probably a good thing.  <BR>7.There is no hard drive, so you'll get to spend excessive amounts of money on extra memory cards.  Everyone loves wasting money.<BR>8.You can't download your own music into the game (which you can do on Xbox).  You wouldn't want to replace that wonderful music included in many of Nintendo's games, such as hit japanese spiritual music and the pokemon theme song.<BR>9.You wouldn't want to have any of your friends to hog it, and this won't be a problem with the gamecube.  They'll all be laughing at you, because you bought an electronic piece of plastic, so you can play by yourself.<BR>10.To compete with Microsoft's voice recognition headset for the Xbox, Nintendo will probably introduce a headset for Gamecube, for talking to Pikachu.
5.0	Great Peoduct, easy to use and understand, A+++ all the way.
1.0	It's remake after remake, port after port, DLC after DLC. This is not the same company responsible for gems like Okami, Resident Evil 4, and Devil May Cry. The people who created those games quit the company, and for good reason. Originality is not encouraged. It's not about the player. It's only about the money.     The Mercenaries 3D is nothing but a recycled $40 mini-game. As if that weren't bad in and of itself, Capcom wants to encourage people to buy it NEW with the controversial save scheme. Buying the game new means Capcom earns more money. It's not about your experience, it's about how full their pockets are. Vote with your dollar and let this shell of a former great company die.
5.0	Awesome game. I thought it was good for the PS3, it's even better for the PS4.
1.0	When you have something as small as a Game Cube, you would think you need a small case... Wrong! I have a large case about three times the size of this one and it's still hard to fit the Game Cube, all the cords, the screen, and not to mention the controlers and the games! It's worth the extra cash to get a larger case if it means your stuff wont get droped and you have to buy a new one.
5.0	The more you play this game the more you'll like it.  Its tough but when you fall into the groove, wow, what a blast!  The new maps they released makes this game top notch!  It was fun before but it was missing something and these extra maps were it.  If you buy the game new you'll get them for free.  Free is always good!  Play on!
5.0	Actually I used to own this before so my review might be biased. This game came out right when flight sims started gaining popularity and it had so many planes / weapons to choose from it was a blast to play back in the day. It's highly customizable and there are a lot of mods for it. If you like flight sims, this is a great option. Windows 8 runs it pretty well, but Windows 7 has graphics issues with it. Either use Windows 8 or XP to play it.
5.0	I bought this prdt as ax-mas gift for my child . I did not expect that this will be a family fun . Music were music frm my time and my child cld enjoy the music and can interact w/ it . This game really rock.
5.0	Has a big forehead but is still beautiful the sender also was very nice and gave me a peice of his favorite japanese &#34;sweets&#34; it was awesome
5.0	I have'nt tried it yet, but I'm trusting that I won't have any problems with it when I do play it, looks to being alright to me other wise!
5.0	Amazing gift idea!!!!
5.0	This game is very very addicting. There is nothing else like it. How many Navy/water games have you seen? <br />This is one of my all-time FAVORITES now. My only complaint is that you can not see through the periscope. It is strictly an attack sub profile...shooting at other underwater targets. The few surface targets can only be attacked on the surface with rockets, NOT torpedos.<br />As long as you realize this is an attack sub scenario and that 90% of your targets are other submerged targets, you'll have a BLAST!! Also this has arcade type graphics. Don't be expecting true realism.
5.0	Another great buy I got on CYBER Monday! For only 35 bucks, I got this extremely fun racing game, I love it and it's so fun and easy even my video game challenged sister, who is the very essence of a clueless gamer, plays this and enjoys it. She even beat me, a hard core garmer, in a couple of rounds!
5.0	My family is having a great time playing this game.  It is not my type of game but I have fun watching them play!
5.0	AWESOME!  Loved this game.  It was great to have an open map like the elder scroll games, but to also have a innovative political system which you were partially control of.  the main quest story line was epic.  I love the lore of the JRR Tolkien books,even if this story doesn't match up with the timeline of books it almost appeared to have been part of the story.
1.0	"The title of my reveiw may be just a bit harsh, but boy is it true.  Big Rigs is so bad I can't even call it a game.  Remember Superman 64, this game makes that one look like Half-Life 2.<br /><br />Oh where shall I begin.  Big Rigs claims to be a racing game but you don't race anybody.  Your opponent is there at the beginning, but he never moves.  I actually sat there for two hours waiting for him to start.  There isn't even any multiplayer, so you can't race anybody at all.<br /><br />This should be enough to make this the worst game ever, butwait there's more.  There's the extremely cheasy graphics.  All four of the tracks you can race on are incredibly blocky and look as though it has been raining mud.  Mud or steaming piles of horse s***.  There also isn't any variety in the cars.  You always play the same truck every race.  Then there's the clipping.  Your car will drive through anything and everything.  I don't mean crash through I mean it seemlessly passes through houses and bridges and anything else.  To all of you who gave this game a five make a note, when your truck goes through a bridge, it is not a feature.  cIt's a bug, a horrible bug that the developers were to lazy to fix.<br /><br />The box says and I quote, \\""Get ready for some...CB talking action.\\""  But there's no CB or any sound for that matter.  No engine noises, no music, no tire sounds, no ANYTHING!  Even the annoying guy yelling at you in Collin McCray Rally is better then the silence of a crappy game.<br /><br />But the final straw is what happened after 2 days of playing.  I realized after climbing up a veritcal hill you could actually drive off into nothingness.  There are no barriers you just drive off into a blank and empty world.  The very words that came out of my mouth next were, \\""What the F***!\\""  There is nothing decent about this game no matter what that s***head POOP tells you.  Avoid at all costs."
5.0	The game unit was in much better shape than I thought. Very pleased with the Game boy.
1.0	I've been eagerly anticipating this game, however I will not buy it due to the DRM and allowing only 3 installs.  It's a shame, but if I spend $49.99 for a game, I want to own it, not rent it.  I upgrade my computer often, and have reinstalled my favorite games over and over again.  If I'm ask to enter a code, or use the disk to play, I will do so.  It seems the industry no longer wants to support PC games, or honest customers.
1.0	I understand if you're starting to phase out the Wii, but if you're going to remove online multiplayer mode -- one of the primary reasons many people are going to buy the game -- then you should clearly say so, since for numerous people, including me and my friends, that is the only reason we buy the game. Seriously, my brother dropped $150 to get me, himself and our best friend this game. We live in Boston, Denver and Virginia Beach, respectively. The whole point was to play online together. EA Sports blows.
5.0	The 160GB PS3 system is a wonderful buy.  It is very easy to install and offers a full multimedia experience.  A very good buy!
1.0	It wont play on windows 7 or windows 8. It will only play on an ancient windows XP system. Bummer.
5.0	Best superhero game ever!  This is one game that is worth multiple play throughs just to try to get everything!
5.0	Incredible game and amazing story, insane graphics!!! The glory of Wolfenstein brought back in HD!!
5.0	I hate basketball games because I suck at them, but this is fun to play, has great graphics, they really put a lot of time into this game. i like it better than the ea sports games.
5.0	THis is a very good pokemon game in N64, I can chuse 250 pokemon <BR>on the game is so much attack is very cool so I very like this game
5.0	"You know, I passed on this game. I loved Assassins Creed, Assassins Creed II and Brotherhood and was excited when I saw this was coming out - but - I read other reviews and thought, \\""why spend the $59+ for an 'alright' game?\\"" And, believe me, at that time I was desperate for a new game to play but I was tired of the structured plots and action of CoD and the rest and a little disappointed with the games I had picked up recently (Fallout New Vegas being the exception). I wanted a sandbox to play in. But still, I passed on Revelations. And then, my lovely wife saw it in the store, knew I loved the Assassins Creed series and gave it to me as a present. Hallelujah! I love it! I don't know what these other reviewers are expecting, maybe everyone it just pretty jaded at this point, but I absolutely love it. This is a beautiful game. It's colorful, it's wide open, it's Assassins Creed the next evolution.<br />I try to play all of the game: the side missions, developing new assassins, completing the skill requirements for the guilds, Desmond's memory blocks, whatever I can find. Man, I've been drilling this thing hard for over a week and still don't see the end in sight. My wife is sorry she gave it to me, calls herself a PS3 widow, but I thank her for it every time I hit the ON button.<br />I have a hard suspicion that some of the negatives come from other game developers which is a tactic I consider to be lower than whale feces, and that's on the bottom of the Pacific, jack. You know, there's enough demand for GOOD games out there for everyone and if you can't do as well or better then get off the f*****g merry-go-round. And that goes for regular reviewers also. If it is totally bad, say so, but if you just want to nitpick the thing to death then come up with something better or shut your pie hole and get a life. Stop ruining it for others just because you can.<br />OK, I've had my rant. Fat lot of good it will do, but it's said.<br />If you haven't picked up Revelations, do so. You won't be sorry unless you're one of these other bung holes that whine about everything. It is a great game.<br />Thank you, Sweetie.do so. You won't be sorry unless you're one of these other bung holes that whine about everything. It is a great game.<br />Thank you, Sweetie."
1.0	Do Not Buy product doesn't work and built cheap so it didn't suprise me.  Waste of money and too much of a hassle to send back.
1.0	This game requires a constant internet connection to a UBISoft Server to play.  If you don't have a connection, or it drops, you can't play.    You also can't play if/when UBIsoft decides to take down the required server in the future.    You have been warned.
5.0	one of my personal favorite games
5.0	I bought this soley to game with the guys from work but I am terrible at the online stuff. Then I gotta listen to the 5 year old with the elf voice cuss about the profession my mother chose.
5.0	Took a little bit of work to get it up and running but once it is, it works like a charm.
5.0	First of all, let me start by saying I haven't played any previous versions of Madden on the DS.  I hear this one is identical to 08, so you probably should save your money if you already have that.  Now on to the review:    This game to me is almost perfect for a handheld version of Madden.  It's packed with gameplay options, from mini camps to franchise mode (haven't played a whole season yet so I'm not sure how the offseason is) to DS exclusive games using the stylus.  There is a ton crammed into the cartridge.      Gameplay is actually really excellent as well.  I can swear that I see similar cutscenes to Madden 2001 for the PC (which I think is a crazily fun game) so I think it's using a similar engine.  At times you will throw a pass to a receiver that will just miss by a mile, but it seems like the QBs with better accuracy ratings actually miss less of the time, and generally you won't miss if you throw the pass at the right time in the receiver's route, so QB pressure actually seems to mean something in this game (which is less than I can say for almost any other Madden I've played).  Running is pretty good.  Against bad defenses, the middle will open up, even on draw plays, but try it against the Steelers and you will have much less luck...  The only negative I have seen on offense so far is that the Strong I formation, quick toss play is literally undefendable, no matter the difficulty setting.  I've had to remedy it by choosing a playbook that doesn't have the play, and that seems to have made a difference.    Defense is really tough, especially on Pro setting.  If you don't drop 4 defensive backs into deep coverage, it's almost a sure bet that the qb will throw deep and connect on you, but it's honestly one of the first Madden games I've played where I'm not a sure bet to be #1 in total defense year after year by several hundred yards.      Graphics have never been that important to me, but I think these suffice just fine.  Anyway, if you have a DS and want a somewhat realistic football experience on the go, do yourself a favor and pick this up. I recently played it a ton on a long trip, and I'm still really satisfied with it.
5.0	Very good product. For the money they work really good. My son is very happy with them.  I would recommend them to any one
5.0	I play several of the garden farm animal games and enjoy them. I got bored with the Younda variety pack games quickly tho.
5.0	red faction is cool new First Person Shooter with a fully changable invironment where you can blast you way through anything makes this game a must buy<br />Buy This Game Now
1.0	"I've been playing games since I was in grade school.  We are talking trs-80's, vic's Pet's C-64's.... atari consoles... etc. etc.<br />  I play violent games.  Quake series, Doom series... all of them, many current ones also.<br /><br />But seeing my friends teen age son playing a game where he is a kid on a skateboard with a teddy bear strapped to his back machine gunning attractive women who are \\""the enemy gang\\"" and dressed in Bikini's.... turned my stomach.  Researching the game a bit, I came across an image from the game of a giant Bunny rabbit holding a bloody baseball bat.  In the background someone was stomping (bloodily) someone into the ground.<br /><br />If you are an adult who wants to experience this kind of thing, thats fine.  But Parents, please go by the ESRB ratings.  This game is a good<br />way to poison your teen even worse than the drivel that tv and hollywood churn  out.<br /><br />Remember the golden addage of computing...<br />Garbage IN, Garbage OUT.<br /><br />In fact I'm appalled that Amazon would put this peice of trash on their top ten digital list.  Its apparently all about profits for them.<br />Pass this thing by and get something better."
5.0	I remember this game at the ARCADE and the Laundry mat, I could play for hrs on just one quarter it would seem. Then when  Igot my first NENTENDO system it was ON!!!LOL. Great game and lots of fun!
5.0	Fantastic game mine didn't come with a code so I sent it back for a refund but I picked one up on ebay and it was really great. well worth a look if you like open world fast paced games.
5.0	Good game, my son really enjoys playing this game and better priced than stores. A lot of violence, make sure your teens are mentally well adjusted.
1.0	"Okay, like every other game fanatic in American, I recently purchased a Sony Playstation Portable, and, just like many other people in the country, I am also having what's called, \\""Pixel Problems\\"" which are dots in the middle of the screen, which permenantly burn their image into the screen. Mine started after I played Medal Gear Solid Acid, and right after I played a couple of levels, I noticed that small red dots started appearing on my screen. I thought that maybe it was the game so, I turned off the system overnight and waited until this morning. I turned the system back on, and guess what, the dots are still there. <br /> <br />I call up Sony about the problem, and they tell me that thousands of systems have the same problems and that they would replace my system free, but that it would take a couple of weeks to replentish. <br /> <br />Now, right after I spend a lot of money on both the console and the same, I expect, after all the hype, for this system, to actually work, but, no, Sony, rushes production, just like they did on the Playstation 2, and now, most people are running into serious problems. <br /> <br />My friend's PSP won't scan the games properly any more. <br /> <br />That's it, I'm getting my money back. I mean for the price of this portable, I could buy two home consoles, with better graphics. <br /> <br />I own a Nintendo DS, and I can safely tell you, that after owning it for several months, I havn't had any problems, yet, the only downside, is that there hasn't been a big selection of games for the DS, so, I'm sceptical of the system. <br /> <br />My advice, don't buy either system at this time, wait until Nintendo gets more games out, and wait at least a year, for Sony to work out the bugs in the PSP. It's too expensive a system, to have this many problems, months after it's Japanese launch. <br /> <br />Sony knew about these problems in Japan, but instead of delaying it, they sold shoddy systems in order to meet demand. I think that choicewill come back to haunt them. <br /> <br />My advice, pick up a Gameboy Advance, with their large selection of games, and with it's great performance. <br /> <br />I don't have anything personal against Sony, I love my Playstation two, but this is inexcusable. <br /> <br />WAIT AT LEAST A YEAR, WHEN MORE GAMES WILL BE AVAILABLE, THE COST WILL BE CHEAPER, AND MOST OF ALL, SONY WILL WORK OUT THE SERIOUS BUGS IN THIS SYSTEM. <br /> <br />I'm getting a refund for this system, two weeks is too long to wait for a replacement."
5.0	This product is great. Everything works perfectly and we needed extra controllers pretty badly.<br /><br />Not all games require the nunchuck, but for games that DO require it, it wont even let you p0lay until its connected, so they are a must-have as well.
5.0	I purchased this Skylander set for my 6 year old grandson. He had played the game at a friend's house, but I had no idea whether the game would be worth the $55 it cost. After sitting with him and watching him play for hours I can honestly say that I am impressed, he loves it.
5.0	Great game I didn't even know existed!
1.0	The game wasn't playable....an old out dated game.<br />Rather disappointed the game didn't work.  Hey, maybe, next time.<br />Regards,<br />Anthony Schwarz
5.0	I love Boggle and UpWords so when I saw this collection I snapped it up. I'm now completely addicted to UpWords and it's worth the money just for that game. I have tried Hangman and Word Hunt and they can be a nice change of pace.    My one problem with these games is that none of them save high scores, which I do find pretty annoying. But that's a minor thing and certainly shouldn't stop anyone who likes Boggle or UpWords in particular.
5.0	I purchased this for my channel and it has been awesome! I did a full unboxing review and a few gameplay videos. The review video is on my main electronics channel while the gameplays are on my gaming channel. I’ve had a handful of people purchase the system after watching these, so I hope you enjoy them as well.<br /><br />Unboxing Review with Sonic 2, Vectorman, and Lion King Gameplay:<br />https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6RD_WmWECU&index=8&list=PLnt5poeQK0CzPedr8hBJH1YLkRPY9vUP0<br /><br />Micro Machines and Power Rangers Gamplay:<br />https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lz6dZ2eTWNs<br /><br />Streets of Rage, Ecco the Dolphin, and Golden Axe Gameplay:<br />https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wdbge8Msohc
5.0	a platform game for the ps2 that is so much fun that you will play through the hole game befor you know it cus. you just have to see what is on the next screen.
1.0	Ordered product under the assumption that I would get the wireless guitar as well a the full game pack, what I received was a guitar with a wire that hooks to the XBOX 360 and a demo version of the game.  I will never order from this company again
1.0	I got this and both of the world codes were apparently already in use, thanks EA for never responding to my problem. I paid good money for nothing basically, im sticking with the electronic download, im never getting the cd again.
1.0	Did not fix the 3d xl as stated in description.
5.0	"The entire family has been devoured by Animal Crossing/City Folk for Wii...and because of the ability to visit other towns-so is our extended family. we visit several nights a week and fish together, share turnip prices, and show off all our \\""Stuff.\\"" We love it! It is nonviolent and peaceful activity that we are all hooked on."
5.0	Great sound and works well with gaming systems and my TV.
5.0	Best fighting game on the sega saturn
5.0	Bought this game for my daughter as they love playing Sims games.<br />I find this game to be a good entertainment and educational tool as it helps to enhance a kid creativity.<br />Recommended.
5.0	Sound quality is great for the price! If you are a low budget/college student gamer then I recommend this product.
1.0	It's three days in and there are 2600+ one star reviews out of 2800.  The game is almost always down and when you do play, there are some serious bugs.  WORST! LAUNCH! EVER!!!!
5.0	was very thrilled to find this game finally! i used to play it way back in the day, my son loves watching my play as well a great game
1.0	I love the Wii fit and I was so excited to get this game but it is absolutely horrible.  I don't even know where to begin listing the problems.  I honestly could've lived with the bad graphics and bad music if it only worked.  But it doesn't!  I used it with and without the balance board and it does not recognize my movements like the Wii fit does.  It feels like no one ever tested this.
1.0	I still have to return mine. I hooked it up follow all the steps which I was able to get it to work, But the delay between turning the wheel and the game seeing it is horrible. I turned up the sensitivity as far as I could and was still very bad. I can see it being a nice piece for some games but games like forza 5 and any kind of racing sim it is horiible.
5.0	Wonderful deal, great sale! I think the price for xbox live is a bit excessive so when the cards are on sale its a wonderful thing!
5.0	Son loved it and worked well!  Still playing WOW and raked in top 10 in US 25 man team currently.
5.0	Lots of fun for both my six year old son and myself. Can be a decent workout!
5.0	I have a Wii U and just bought Mario Kart and a Wii Wheel.  This is the best thing ever, I do not know what other people are talking about with the wheel not performing correctly.  It performs great.  Maybe its your controller?  I have the Wii U Motion Plus controller that I put in the wheel.  It really sucks there are not too many games that take advantage of the wheel.  But I'm sure in time there will be (I am referring to Wii U games right not, as there are none that I know of that use the Wii Wheel).<br /><br />PS I just ordered a 2nd Wii Wheel and a second Wii U motion plus controller yesterday.
5.0	GREAT GAME AT GREAT PRICE
5.0	Solid remastery for a nostalgic experience; doesn't get much better than this we remastered games. Overall, awesome; so far so good
5.0	I really liked how fast I received the game. I love playing it. My wife and I are getting linked up so we can play it together. I love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1.0	once i received this wiimote i unpackaged it and set it up for game play, in the middle of my game it started ghosting moves even after being set down for several minutes. now that was just the first day out. three days later it died... it was never miss handeled never dropped and just died. once i called their tech support i was disturbed even further about how rude they were and the fact i could not understand what the lady was saying through her accent.
5.0	"SPOILER-FREE REVIEW: Okay, let's just get this out of the way: I wasn't very confident that this game could even compare to Zelda games like Ocarina of Time or the Wind Waker. It just looked too much like A Link to the Past, and the innovations didn't look that impressive. Even after it got hugely positive reviews, I still wasn't fully convinced (but it sure did make me more excited). But after the first 10- 15 minutes, I was already hooked! It wasn't the average, \\""You're a normal boy who has to go through a bunch of long side quests before you can do anything important.\\"" Instead, you are almost immediately thrown into the action (not into sword play exactly, but that comes in pretty quick too).<br /><br />  Besides the pacing, one of the most surprisingly great things about this game was the graphics. The frame-rate is very smooth and the retro feel was a refreshing burst of color to me.<br /><br />  Another impressive aspect was the music. If you aren't listening to a great rendition of a classic Zelda song, you're listening to a new, epic-sounding song exclusive to this game.<br /><br />  Of course, being as I'm reviewing a video game, I need to go into the gameplay. Again, I was really impressed! The concept of renting (and eventually buying) weapons instead of unlocking them in a dungeon was really good. I find it much more enjoyable than going through a dungeon, seeing several different places you could use a hookshot (or any other Zelda tool), and thinking, \\""Ugh! I know what to do, but I don't know where that tool is!\\"" This game is much more fast paced than other Zelda games (and shorter). I really felt like I was making progress every time I played it, while other Zelda games I'd find myself wandering aimlessly without a clue as to what I should do. Now, that doesn't mean this game is easy. The puzzles are still very clever, and I have found myself stumped on more than one occasion, but I still managed to beat it without a strategy guide.<br /><br />  When it comes to story, it's not as grand as other games, but there are some pretty big plot points around the end of the game, so I was still pretty satisfied with the story.<br /><br />  I don't really know what else to say. Everything about this game is great! I'd put this as the best Zelda game since Ocarina of Time. Highly recommended!"
5.0	Buenos gr&aacute;fico y Diversi&oacute;n Garantizada, realmente vale la pena la inversi&oacute;n. Me gusta este tipo de juegos y mejor aun en alta definicion
5.0	i think this the best wireless controller,when i use it to play game,i want to say that's great ,amazing ,wow...
1.0	That's about it...it requires broadband and I didn't know it...(it wasn't listed as needed).  Anyway, to their defense, they DID list the system requirements.    Just not broadband.  Now I  can't run it...so that's that.
5.0	I have never liked fishing, much prefer sitting on a boat and drinking a beer.  Don't like to eat them, so why waste a few hours trying to catch them.  Bought this game for my 4-year old and we both are addicted.  It is great fun catching the fish and picking the lures to use.  I recommend it for anyone who just wants to waste some time and have fun...it is not brain surgery, so if you want a challenge look elsewhere.
1.0	"I ordered this \\""Xbox 360 Wireless N Network Adapter\\"" from CE Compass on September 15, 2011.<br />The product I received was a non-Microsoft product and may be a counterfeit which does not connect to any wireless network.<br /><br />The images associated with this product depict Microsoft retail packaging and the \\""Xbox 360\\"" ID on the front of the adapter. The product I received has neither the retail packaging nor the embossed Xbox 360 label.<br /><br />The adapter came in \\""bulk\\"" packaging (an anti-static bag, those of you who purchase computer components will be familiar with the packaging I speak of) and was of flimsy construction.<br /><br />I have contacted CE Compass asking for a refund for a non-functioning product.<br /><br />I recommend purchasing the guaranteed authentic Microsoft Wireless N Networking Adapter from another seller instead of this one."
5.0	The reason for 5 stars is that product in my eyes was in excellent condition and seller was very prompt in delivery. Last but not least you made my childs day when he opened that gift along with the other skylanders accessories. All I can say is &#34;THANKS&#34;!
5.0	Yup I am 38 and love these games on my DSI when traveling. Fast shipping and in great condition thank you<br />Play this as a family and we have a great time!
5.0	This collection of games includes some great ones with lots of variation.  Well worth the purchase price.
5.0	I love tthis condition. reallly nice cover page and booklet.<br />Disk condition is great than I thought. it works well
5.0	Very happy with product.
5.0	By boyfriend loved it and that's all that matters! He has been eagerly awaiting it's release so I bought it as a XMAS gift.
5.0	I like this game awesome to play and lots of fun i bought it for my nephew and he and i are hooked
5.0	Works good, the person that received it was thoroughly happy
5.0	I'm not sure if many of you Diablo players are basketball fans like I am, but NBA2k11 had these same types of problems when it first came out. It was a nightmare and everyone was complaining that nothing was working properly. But then the issues were fixed, and it is now considered the best basketball video game (some even consider it the best sports game period) of all time. I really do believe that Diablo 3 is a game that will go down as one of the greatest games of all time once all of the fixes and expansion packs come. The issues will be fixed, and who knows, they may even add offline play in the future. Please be patient.
1.0	So far I'm very disapointed with the konquest on this game...the character is almost impossible to control accurately and the graphics are pretty lame. <br />Try another MK game but forget this one....Armageddon and S'Monks are way way better. <br /> <br />
5.0	This one along with 2 other were gifts for my wife's bday, and they were the sensation to the family when everyone got to play on them during the party!
5.0	I couldn't even find one of these at gamestop! The long cable is the perfect length, and I can keep my pro controller plugged in constantly now and play far away from my tv. I was pretty upset about how hard these were to find in my area, and almost resorted to buying a new 50$ controller. Thanks to this seller, I have no longer have to!
5.0	fun game. Not too complicated for kids to follow.
5.0	I hate the violence in the game, but my son is 13 and he LOVES it. What else can you say?
5.0	Everything as expected. I would recommend to friends. I am glad I ordered it.<br />Thank You Very Much! :-) ...
5.0	my son love it he just wish it was a black
1.0	I received the item with a burned out pixels all over the screen so it makes using this useless with a black smear over parts of the screen. Hopefully it can be returned.
1.0	Piece of junk. Doesn't work.
5.0	jeep thrills is so fun you get to choose which jeep you want to race with and it is really fun
1.0	This item was horrible.  It arrived in a dirty zip lock bag and the battery connection to the back that slides into the Wii remotes were too big and would not fit.  It also does not plug into a wall outlet to charge, it has to be plugged into a USB connection.  Overall this product was poor and I returned it immediately.
5.0	It's a fun game of played  with a partner. The story dialogue it cheese dick but the game is challenging specially when you put extra zombies in the levels.
1.0	I only played the demo and about an hour was enough to realize that this game is worse than the original.  There are things that the first one got right, and that is great music, funny satire, and good game play.  The decent things about the Haemimont Games version are all shamelessly ripped off from Tropico 1.  The descriptions could have been done by a third grader, I mean seriously, no imagination.  The only thing that is a slight improvement is the graphics, but everything looks the same, no real creative changes except for an annoying menu and unbearable announcer.  Do not waste your time with this game.  At least the original Tropico had a latin style that was authentic and not insulting.  This game doesn't get it right and is offensive and shamelessly targets the latino demographic without the fun...  Skip this one and play the original, which has much better music also.
5.0	Works just as expected, glad I purchased it from Amazon rather than the store.
5.0	This game is so innocent and so additive and so fun!  It is definitely a nice break from shooters, rpgs, and racing for me.  Warning though..it's very addictive! lol My wife and I got hooked on it! =)  It's a very long game though and pretty typical of the past HM titles...farming, fishing, mining, getting married, etc...  I won't post any spoilers here except that you don't have to acquire all 100 notes to beat the storyline.  If you are like me and don't want to play for umpteen hours, then you will more than likely stop after the main storyline is over b/c by that time you will have played so many hours already! lol  But if you are hardcore and want 100%, you will be there for quite a while and definitely get your money's worth.  Graphic-wise this game is so cute! Defintely a nice break from Far Cry and Halo and such.  Just a nice, easy-going, do what you want at your own pace type of game.  I highly recommend this title to exiting HM fans and to newcomers as well.  Enjoy! =)
5.0	Stellar console, and a great family game to boot! Knack might look old-school and not innovative enough for next-gen. But what Sony succeeded in what they intended to do.
5.0	The best deal you're going to find on this console.  It's the same cost as the base bundle with no games....so it's essentially getting two games free.
5.0	excellent work 100 =)
5.0	I held out for the HDMI Premiums in order to avoid getting the Elite. I wanted to hook my 360 to my computer monitor which has a DVI input (For those unfamiliar with this input, it's usually a white jack on newer monitors that accepts a digital video signal. DVI and HDMI VIDEO signals are identical so all you need to hook a 360 to a monitor is an HDMI to DVI cable which aren't necessarily expensive. DVI is video only whereas HDMI carries both video and audio, which is convenient for those who have a receiver with HDMI-in). I wanted to hook my audio output into an RCA (traditional red and white jacks) speaker system. However, I discovered this wasn't possible without buying a $50 HDMI and Speaker cable kit sold separately, but is included in the ELITE box, so I made the jump to the Elite console. IN SHORT, if you do not/can not use HDMI-only for video and audio, the real price break down is $400 for the Premium (white, 20GB hard drive) and $450 for the Elite (black, 120GB hard drive, and also includes added bragging rights).
5.0	I'll start out by saying, if you are easily frustrated...do not play this game, you will wind up breaking your psp and angry the rest of the day.    Yes the game is easy in most areas once you learn how or what the monsters do......But when you get to the G level quests it really doesn't matter how well you know what they will do, it really matters on skill and patience, for one hit can kill you.     What the game will do is set you up for failure, for instance:  You come into a zone with a monster and it see's you; you cower in fear, which could very well result in you getting hit.... I would like to call this combo number 1. There are other such combos in the game that will surely anger you so be sure to be prepared.    All and all this game is a very challenging game.
5.0	MY GRANDSON WAS VERY HAPPY WHEN I GAVE HIM THIS GAME...HE SAID IT LOOKED BAND NEW...THANK YOU...I WILL BUY FROM YOU AGAIN.
5.0	"A fantastic follow-up to [[ASIN:B000H229BE Echoes of Faydwer]] (EoF).  Now you can explore the long awaited continent of Kunark, straight from EQ1 lore.  I was so excited with this announcement that I participated in the beta, though purposely didn't explore very deeply until after release when I had the ability to have more friends along for the journey.<br /><br />The newbie area is, like Darklight Woods in EoF, quite well thought-out and wonderfully progressive and more expansive than it first appears (and getting from one area to the next isn't always completely apparent).  The Sarnaks are a glorious race, almost as large as the tallest trolls (and better looking that the Iksar, if you ask me).<br /><br />However, this expansion is (purposely) missing mid-level content.  So once you hit level 65 again, you can return to Kunark through the Kylong Plains (a short boat ride from the Commonlands or from Antonica) to see what this new continent REALLY has to offer.  The quests there, once again, are wonderfully thought out and easily soloable through the mid-70s, at least.  The areas are jam-packed with plenty of new creatures (many of old) to make exploration exciting. Fans of the old Dreadlands zone in EQ1 will recognize many landmarks and monsters roaming around... however, you may not want to step foot inside Karnor's Castle (not to mention a few other places) without a fairly sturdy group.  The zones I've explored thus far are HUGE - many cover multiple mapping windows and, some of the ones that don't, SHOULD be simply because of their size.  Luckily, there are also \\""griffins\\"" or other faster transports in many of the zones and you CAN jump off of them (I'll leave that spoiler OUT of this review, though).<br /><br />This expansion also raises the level cap to 80 (you need Echoes of Faydwer to make it to level 70, though) and raises veteran rewards to four years, now.  It also adds a \\""character development\\"" pane to your achievement windows (press \\""L\\"") which makes it easy to not only select which traits you want, but see what you're going to get in the future as you level-up.  The map pane is also zoom'able, now (and quite slick if you ask me); folks using UI enhancements like EQ2Maps will want to stay on top of patches for a while, though.  They've also added adaptive combat music, though I've yet to turn mine back on (ie. the music changes depending on both the pace of the fight and \\""how well\\"" you're doing).  Additionally, things such as the persona window have nicely changed along with a few other things that I'd not want to spoil for anyone.<br /><br />Overall, SOE has shown that they can release exciting and worthwhile content with two consecutive hits.  My only real critique is the lack of the mid-level content, though they've claimed to have balanced out the levels between 20 and 80, now (and certainly leveling through 70 to 71 was NOT difficult, even running solo and without adventure vitality (ie. experience bonus)).  At this rate, I can hardly wait to see Velious in some future release! (*crosses fingers*)ect which traits you want, but see what you're going to get in the future as you level-up.

5.0	I bought Tringo as I like puzzle games like tetris and the best part is that it is a Game Boy Advance game. It is the only GBA game I have so I keep it in my DS all the time and when I am tired with whatever DS game is in there, I can always switch over. It is challenging and doesn't require the stylus so gives your hand a break! As an adult and educator, I see this also has a great learning but fun game to help build math skills especially for geometry!
5.0	These decals are cheap and look super sweet! What more could you want to make your PS4 control look fly?!
5.0	love it excellent  this is an excellent item it is a must have<br />you will play it all day long
5.0	It's Pokemon red all over again nuff said. Words that describe the game : Immersive, Entertaining, Epic, Gym leaders, Full Restore aghhhh!!!
1.0	This game is good for someone that doesnt know how to dance.  It is too confusing to watch a waltz and do the watsusi with the hand controls??? What were they thinking?
1.0	Just stop, scalpers. This is utterly ridiculous
5.0	this game is prolly the best game that has been made. it has everything, everything is better, the theme of the throw back era is great. only one thing i really don't like is that it is hard to score runs, and easy to shut your oppent down, but all in all this is a purchase you will not regret.
5.0	This game might be better than Wrestlemania 2000 and that's tough to do. Great game and loads of fun. Really brought back the memories. Recommend to any fan of the attitude era.
5.0	I haven't used this remote for anything other than my 360.  I don't have cable or a DVD player, so there isn't any need for other uses.
5.0	classic sega genesis 6button controllre it work very good i play with it everyday  thank you
5.0	Love this type of games should have more am waiting for more new ones to come out like this, great
5.0	This game is one of the funnest ive ever played.  If you've never played this game before then starting off may be a little difficult, but after that you get addicted really easily.  The game starts off with songs like Shout At The Devil by Motely Crue and Mother by Danzig and ends with songs like Beast and The Harlot by Avenged Sevenfold and Free Bird by Lynyrd Skynyrd.  Anyway this is a great game to buy and if you like this game you'll like Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock even better.
5.0	Product quality is good. Length is also good.<br />Strong cable fits properly<br />I will buy one more as I have one mire controller
5.0	Great game, no probelms under windows 98, radeon 8500 and an amd xp 1800, got noticably slower in 1600x1200 though,<BR>and whats the deal with the mp3 player, i thought we would get to make radio stations not just one mp3 station that randomly plays mp3's you put in the folder
1.0	This game requires a monthly fee to play it. I did not see that anywhere in the description. It has to be played online.
5.0	"There are a couple of things that need to be covered with this adapter. You plug it in and it is instantly recognized as a 2-axis 8 button controller. I first tested it with a Super Mario World rom (I own the real cartridge) and the controls were no different from playing the real thing. Even though it was through an emulator, it felt exactly like I was playing it on my SNES. Hands down, you can't find a better device for playing emulated games.<br /><br />One quick note - I plugged in the Super Link (5 player adapter) just to see if it would work, and it obviously didn't. Since it only recognizes 8 buttons, the first player worked but no other players could work, so in the product features where it says \\""Two players can play simultaneously\\"" I'm assuming it means with two of these devices. This is the only way this product could be improved. Even when you hold it in your hand it doesn't feel cheap. It's a great product. Buy this over the other alternatives. I've tried them all.<br /><br />Works just fine on Windows 7 x64 as well."
5.0	This game is great! I love to play tomb raider,and this game do's not disapoint.It has all the puzzles I've come to expect and a great ending.
5.0	The boss battles are epic. This game does a great job of making you feel like you are really Batman.
5.0	Lots of hours of fun in this unique style gamepad
5.0	These are incredible! The sound is clear and crisp ... they give you a totally immersive experience. Not only that, they are comfortable and easy to set up! Make certain to buy them on Amazon though, because they seem to be running $99 everywhere else.
5.0	I use this product everyday, its very useful for me, i liked it because of the low price and i really needed it.
5.0	Hell I'm an autistic adult gamer.<br /><br />This is my review on Baby Life ds.<br /><br />I bought this game off ebay & absolutely love it besides from the My Baby series the unlockables in baby life are literally endless plus the whole ds game is in 3D graphic's extremely cool baby ds game.  Oh the game does not have an ending but if you try to play past 100 day's your game profile will corode you I know because this already happened to me in the game.  Overall very life like & cute get's five star's from me.  Try this ds game if you like baby ds games you might really enjoy it.  I know I do!<br /><br />Happy Gaming Everyone!
5.0	one of my favorite games of all time and ive played it 5 times over and still cant get enough. im definitely holding on to this one square enix out does themselves with this one
5.0	I bought this for my 4 year old who plays it on my DS. He loves it and it is a great game for younger kids who use a DS.
5.0	Gold anything is awesome!!!! Playstation 3 controllers have always been solid built controllers. The gold makes it like your Playstation 3 is king of consoles!!!
5.0	Loved it im a street fighter fan and the gameplay is great.
5.0	To be short and sweet, NG2 is a must have for all gamers. NG2 can be a challenge and a walk in the park. The first time I played it i was hooked in 5 mins. i still cant get enough of Ryu! Cant wait for NG3!
5.0	I thought this is the best game I've played in the last 2 years.  It's open world like GTA (maybe not quite as in-depth, but good enough), and it has great hand-to-hand combat controls like Batman.  There are weapons and some customization items, but the real stars are the characters, story, and combat.  With more emphasis on hand-to-hand and less on guns it felt a lot better and smoother than GTA combat.  I thought the voice acting was top-notch and made it even better.<br /><br />NOTE: there was a Halloween add-on DLC where you fight spirits a la Big Trouble in Little China.  It was a little overpriced at the time, but added another fun hour or two to the game.
5.0	This game was pretty fun and it was entertaining. This Game was alot of fun.<br /><br />if you liked this game then check out the other versions.
5.0	It's a plastic case. It snaps onto your 3DS. The case is simple and intuitive.<br /><br />It adds just a minimal amount of bulk to your 3DS, and it looks stylish in its own way.<br />The only minor problem with this case is that you can't use the charging cradle while the case is on the 3DS, but who cares? I personally haven't used the cradle in the 2 years that I've owned my 3DS.<br /><br />I've used this case for 2 years or so on my main 3DS, and I love this case so much that when I purchased a second 3DS a couple months ago, I bought the case again for the new unit. The case will get minor scratches on it over time, but it's better to scratch a case than the handheld itself. I strongly recommend this product.
5.0	My son is a boy's boy, where games are concerned. All combat, all the time. This game was perfect for him, and I'm pretty sure the tactical side of things was intellectually stimulating for him as well. He found the same problem as another reviewer with losing Pokemon he had gained when he finished the game, but he loved the game enough simply to start over!
5.0	The price was great and it works just as it should. This is a great controller at a great price
5.0	I bought this after I accidentally cut the wire on my original one.  I plugged this in and it works great.
5.0	The control scheme is a bit different from what I'm used to, but it's still going strong. You play again as Big Boss; except now you're in South America. Engaging and interactive as always.
5.0	We lost our original Wii Sports game and found a like new one here. It came as described and works exceptionally well. No problems whatsoever. Thank you.
5.0	"I will keep it simple and short:    Same thing, different color. If you love obnoxious colors, then you would ADORE this shade of red. It's vibrant, obnoxious, flamboyant,glossy and in just the right shade too. It's the most beautiful shade of red I have ever seen. This is what \\""red\\"" should look like!"
5.0	This is great release from Activision/HighMoon and while not all people will get it the other 90% will. The comedic skits and one liners are standard Deadpool humor and you will let out a chuckle or laugh at some of what he says and does throughout the game. Nolan North was a great pick as the voice of Deadpool he really brings out the sarcastic witty humor and sometimes dark side of Deadpool,also his interactions with some of the other Marvel universe casts are great in the game as well.<br /><br />The gameplay controls are pretty easy to use and if there is any complaint it's just that we have to wait until they release another game just as fun as this to play.
5.0	this is a awesome game like all lego games. this game is tons of fun. you can spend hours playing these lego games and don't realize it. that's how much fun they are. this one is a little different from the others but not by much. in some parts of the game you actually have to find pieces and collect pieces to build things. and the characters are sweet. this is probably the third or fourth best one so far. if you have not played this game then I recommend you do
5.0	My son loves his Vita games. I know he was very happy to receive this one.<br />I don't suppose I am qualified to review the ins and outs of it, but maybe when he gets done playing it, I will know a bit more about it.<br />It looks like something I would like to play if I were gifted in that way.<br />I love the title of it.
5.0	I have not completed Trails in the Sky yet. In fact I've only put in a fraction of the time required to beat it, but I wanted to share my thoughts.    - Localization is excellent. Really. The characters have charm and many lines are funny. XSEED deserves a LOT of credit because this game has a large amount of text.    - Loading: Maximum 1.5sec transition between zones. Usually shorter. Similarly, the UI is very easy to navigate and there's no noticeable menu lag, which absolutely drives me nuts in some PSP games. It's obvious the developers made sure that loading was kept to a minimum and does not obstruct gameplay. This is all without any sort of memory-stick install, too. No complaints.    - The menu system in this game feels as if a PC RPG was stuffed into a PSP package (in Japan the game was on the PC so this shouldn't be surprising!). This is a good thing, because it works. The menus are quick, incredibly detailed, and useful. Similarly, a vast amount of information and reference is packed into the various logs you acquire. Quest logs, recipe lists, bestiary, and an in-game manual of sorts are all easily accessible. Plus, YOU CAN SAVE ANYWHERE (outside of battle).    - Gameplay is a standard turn-based JRPG affair with a few additions. Your characters move around on a field and have a per-turn move limit, so physical attacks require you to be somewhat near your target. There are also additional systems such as crafting (special moves that consume a resource that builds up as you deal/receive damage) and S-Breaks (very powerful attacks that you can initiate regardless of turn order).    Trails in the Sky is an incredible RPG. The depth and amount of content of this game sets it apart from other RPGs on the system.
5.0	My grandson was thrilled with the gloves and the game! He will have many hours of fun with them!
5.0	I was kinda worried when buying it at first as It looked a little cheap.. but I give it credit the card work's perfectly in my wii working as a gamecube memory card.   Fits kinda tight, not sure if all memory cards are like this but once it's in there it work's like a charm. Can't beat the price.  (note: the picture show's a white memory card I got mine in black)
5.0	I have played the other 3 sports games for Kinect and this one is by far the best. The reason why it's the best is because of the interface. It's easy to navigate the game. The other ones have horrible menu navigation. My kids (5 & 9) have trouble navigating the other games. Also the sports you play in this one are perfect. Bowling is by far my favorite.  I'm curious to see how well the Brunswick Bowling game will be when it comes out in March 2011.
1.0	PC  GigaByte GA-Z68A-D3H-B3   i5-2500k@4.2GHz  EVGA Superclocked 1.5GB  8GB DDR3/1600MHz Dual Channel  win7 pro 64-bit  I have audio skipping during all intro screens and cgi intro when loading the game...stops when i begin playing (and by playing i mean waiting to be able to move)  I have not run fraps to be certain but gameplay is feeling around 10-15 fps, enough for me to not want to go past doing the look around check  do not buy til its patched  thanks for the crap console port id, i might be ok with a port if it ran well on hardware twice as powerful  as seen on crysis 2, i guess ground breaking hardware for pcs doesnt exist anymore...we just get bad ports like consoles used to and get horrible launches with 'patch coming'
1.0	"Let me start off by saying that I did play this game for several hours in hope that it would get better, but after seeing the manual and all the other crap i had to go through to get the game to work in the first place, I was severely disappointed. This game is awful. THe graphics may be amazing the the engine is not efficient, there's no reason why these visuals couldn't run on slower machines like cards from the Geforce 7 series. The games Antipiracy protection did little to prevent anything but people being able to enjoy their legitimate copy of the game. I had to delete my Adapti system file after editing registry files for an hour and disabling my virtual drives, no game should be this restrictive on your computer's hardware, or software for that matter, what was the point of the registration code in the box if it still didn't let me play after i entered it. It took me 6 hours to get this game to run and the average user wouldn't have known how to fix this. Any game that has an entire forum full of \\""HELP TAGES SAYS MY DISK IS NOT ORIGINAL\\"" and topics like \\""My friends pirated copy of the game is running\\"" should not even be bothered with, It's tedious and unenjoyable to begin with having to go through all this trouble just to play it is ridiculous. I'm glad I only paid 8 dollars for it, if you were one of the few unfortunate enough to spend 50 dollars on this pile of crap I mourn for your loss. If you like overly tedious combat systems with poor animations this is a good game for you, otherwise steer clear. I've heard people praising this game for it's depth, but honestly the only depth is has is the alchemy system which takes a degree in Chemistry to even begin to understand immediately."
5.0	Perfect game and great price.
5.0	this is one of the best games ever if you liked papermario for n64 then this game will be even funner you have got to bye this game it is one of the best games ever.
5.0	I got my money's worth!
5.0	If your favorite color is blue, and you love it as much as I do, then you'll obviously love this. It will be your favorite PS2 controller for sure. Third party controllers may be cheaper, but it's always risky to buy them. You can always count on the official ones being top quality with the chances of getting a defect extremely slim.
5.0	great figure like the movie
5.0	This is with no doubt the best strategy game I played so far. Since 1999 I started playing starcraft instead of chess. Look like a realtime chess player, the game in unbelivably balanced, robust. The units, their properties, capabilities and their usage of resources are so balanced that you can not find a way around to cheat with the computer or win so easly. I have tried most of the strategy games, however this one has the best Artificial Inteligence I have seen so far. Games created after Starcraft can not be compared to Starcrafts clever and smart AI. To ask &quot;Am I still playing?&quot;, simply &quot;Yes&quot; and so are my friends. I strongly recommend Starcraft, it is even better than other Blizzard Strategy games so far. Enjoy!
5.0	One of the best RTS games EVER!! It is a lot of fun. Hours of fun!! If you enjoy War RTS games, this is for you. This is the best of all of the Command and Conquer series.
5.0	Nice, works like a charm
5.0	I just recentely bought a PSOne with the 5&quot; LCD Screen with the intention of going mobile with my video gaming experience.  I also bought the bag.  The price was good and it fits everything perfectly.  I have the PSOne with the 5&quot; LCD Screen attached, 8 games, 2 controllers, the AC adapter, a couple of memory cards, and the car adapter in it, and everything fits nice.  One thing to mention is that the bag comes with two CD cases that hold 4 games each, so that's how you can get 8 games into it.  I have no problems taking the system and accessories out of the bag and putting them back in.  I purchased the SONY 5&quot; screen, and like I said, everything fits perfect.  By reading other reviews about things not fitting right, I am wondering if it is a different story if a third party screen is purchased.
5.0	If you've played any of the previous installments, be sure to pick this up! Definitely lots to enjoy about from addictive gameplay to hilarious references.  Characters look visually improved with added glow effects and such.  Fans will not regret for sure!
5.0	get to daa chopaaa!! aughhhh aughhh!! Great game, wish they have 64 player support on ps3 other than that I love it
1.0	Broke 2 days after i bought it and the ear cover broke off
5.0	"Our little seven year old has been playing this game all day today.  It has some very creative elements in it.  She often gets frustrated with some of her other games, but hasn't had too many difficult moments with this one.  She even made up some songs \\""sung\\"" by some of the Littlest Pet Shop friends.    We ordered this a little late as a last-minute gift from her grandma, so were very relieved when it showed up in time for Christmas."
5.0	I have been a fan of the previous RCT series.  I have seen the screenshots that are available, along with the previews of some of the rides on the new Coaster Cam.  After looking at those, I think this version will be even better than the other two versions since there will be more features, and will be able to full cameral motion, and be able to have fireworks.<br />I think this game will cause me to spend many hours of fun playing this.  I can't wait until November 3, 2004.
5.0	I bought Animal Crossing: New Leaf on a whim, seeing it on sale for just about half off. I figured even if the game was bad or boring, it wouldn't be a huge loss. Color me surprised when two weeks later, I can't go a day without playing the game. It's a game that is very casual and very relaxed. In fact, I like to play for less than an hour a day, as I've built a routine of collecting my fruit, digging up fossils, and watering my flowers.<br /><br />It sounds insane if you've never played this or any other Animal Crossing title. But for 3DS owners, you owe it to yourself to get this game. It is the killer app thus far, and the experience is wonderful.<br /><br />No regrets, Amazon, no regrets.
5.0	Great silicone cases that feel better than other I have tried and you get four? Can't beat that thank you.
5.0	received on time and just what I wanted. great game
5.0	I cannot say enough about this game.  So i will keep it short.<br /><br />I originally beat Titanic: Adventure back in Time back in 1996 and recently beat it again. It still holds up as my favorite game of all time.<br /><br />From the Music to the story everything is perfect. Music is suspenseful and sorrow full and is composed beautifully.<br /><br />To make it run on XP just right click on it, go to properties and change compatibility to windows 95. Theres no need to use Virtual PC.<br /><br />NOW GET THIS GAME AND GO ON AN<br />ADVENTURE OUT OF TIME!!<br />ENJOY
1.0	I think its very sad that you advertise this item and its sold out (of course) at all the stores and online the first day, but all is available seperately.  This really stinks.
5.0	just as I expected! good fun for the whole family... and good luck taking your TV back from the kids<br />easy to install and user friendly! Excellent X-mas present!
5.0	This is by far one of the best games for the 360!!! not only can you play coop on the same counsel... but over the net as well!!!    I recommend that you have a friend take you through the entire game on casual first so you get the hang of it. Also buy or borrow the game guide!
5.0	Any Knight Rider fan's dream! Drive kitt. Excitement,  levels take times as you go further.  Thankx 2 makers
5.0	I LOVE TO DRIVE IN MAKE BELIEVE LAND IMAGINATION I PRETEND IM ROCKY BALBOA  DRIVIN TO A VIDEO MONTAGE PREPARING FOR MR.T AND PAULY AND APOLLO WANT TO STOP FOR BEER
5.0	If you want to take a break from Quake and Quake engines, waste your time in some fruitful, exciting, tactical, option filled, spy, espionage, stealth, covert, logical to an extent game, you got it. Although, it does not have as many alternatives as of Hitman Series for a single game compeltion, but it's a thumb's up. You have to maintain your physical secrecy extremely in some mission while some has ease and freedom not to do so. Shadows and stealth help you get hold of guards, mission objective completion without knowledge of elements in the mission, avoidance of alarm, unnecessary altert in the enemy territory, while choosing alternative way is to expose yourself highly, shooting every inch and bit outta your way and compeleting your way out. Turining off the lights, knocking out guards from back, grappling down and making way through windows, leaning and ghosting in shadows, deviating guards patrol and attention by throwing objects in the other direction, coerceing for information, forcing for their retina scan to open doors, unlocking locked doors and pressing codes, carrying unconcious bodies and hiding, time managing to eacape surveillance cameras, shooting them, turing off the lights and breaking them, stealing docs are some key features.
5.0	The system was packaged well and arrived well ahead of schedule.  The system was as described.  I was impressed with the quality of the controls and the cords.  Everything is functional and works well.  Great seller.  Highly recommended.
5.0	Just like everyone else has said, this game IS hard, but NOT impossible.  I have completed the game on Hard difficulty setting and nearly all of the challenges.  In my opinion, the level of difficulty is the best part of the game.  It is very challenging, but rest assured that with persistence and some skill, you can beat this game and the challenges.  However, I would not recommend this game for the novice gamer.<br /><br />The game has 3 difficulty settings, easy/normal/hard.  The first of which leaves out the last 2 levels.  Playing on easy is still difficult but you get the advantage of fully upgraded weapons with just one weapon pickup. It requires 2 pickups on normal and hard.  Beating the game on any difficulty setting unlocks the challenges.  Beating the challenges unlocks additional content which includes the first 2 contra games (Contra on NES and Super C) as well as different characters to play as and misc. other things such as a contra museum and comics.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- The level design is very good with full utilization of the 2 screens.<br />- Bosses are quite impressive and span both screens.<br />- Good graffics (for the DS, we aren't talkin HD here)<br />- Excellent gameplay.<br />- Very challenging.<br />- The grappling hook adds alot to the game play.<br />- Cool weapons and upgrades.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Lags slightly in multiplayer which can lead to deaths<br />- Very hard, not for the novice gamer<br /><br />I put the difficulty as both a pro and con since it could be either depending on what you seek in a game.  All things considered, I enjoy this game more than Contra and Super C.  But since both those games are unlockable, you get to enjoy them all in one package!
5.0	I Love The Game, And Spartan History, The Movie 300 Was And Is My Favorite. Just The Fact That Leonidas Is In This Game Is Awesome, However The Depth And Detail Of The Storyline Is Good Too
1.0	This Game promised a campaign like the console versions, but this game failed to deliver. If any of you here have ever played special ops on MW2 or MW3, that is almost what the campaign is like in this game. Its just individual missions you go on, and they left out recruit.Their isn't even a story line. I don't see how this is supposed to be a bridge between Black Ops 1 and 2. And the biggest mess-up is the multiplayer, It barely works. It finds some players but shortly after they disappear,you can sit there waiting for 30 minutes waiting for it to find you a good game. And once you finally get a game you have to hope it doesn't crash or kick you out. This still happens even after a 300 MB patch was put out. And the sound effects are horrible, every now and then you will hear a pop or crack. So if you are one of the people who are considering this game because of the name Call of duty Black ops declassified, Dont wast you time and money. Spend it on something better!!!! Dot fall into the same trap I did.
1.0	It's like EA made this game for the sole purpose of money. They put no effort or care into it and that's easily noticeable from the start. Don't buy this game, please! Play an older simcity game or get Tropico or something, just please don't spend money on this piece of garbage
5.0	excellent product recommended. thank you very much.
5.0	Excellent game!!! great graphics, the story is great, the characters, the weapons, the accesories, Mako (kind of pathfinder), travelling to distant galaxies. It deserves at least a 5!!
5.0	this game has awesome graphics and is alot more fun than the first version. the stunts are also state of the art and are fun to pull off.
5.0	Just Dance 4 is so much fun and also a great workout! I definitely recommend it if you want a fun easy to follow cardio workout.
1.0	This headset sounds absolutely amazing dont let the 1 star rating fool you in the sound quality department as far as that is concerned but the reason this headset has a 1 star is all in the build quality department, this headset falls hard in this category I purchased this headset in early October and in one month the headset broke on the band that extends due to it being about half a centimeter in thickness leaving it extremely vulnerable to snapping if you have a larger than normal head I want to love this headset but it is extremely fragile and not worth $130 plain and simple.
5.0	My buddy bought me Darkest of Days for christmas, I returned the favor with this little gem. I'd say we're even.
5.0	Great Game! I´ve been playing Fifa since 1998 and I love this game.
5.0	YOU NEED TIS TO PLAY RELOAD. YOU WOULD THINK THIS WOULD COME WITH THE GAME. YOU CAN'T PLAY THIS GAME WITH OUT THIS.
5.0	I wasn't expecting much out of this game. Then I was a couple of gameplay videos. It looked like fun so I took a chance. This game is awesome. The combat is great. it feels a lot like the other elder scrolls games', but mixed with an mmo. it's not pefect as it just launched, but it blows wow, twtor and tera out of the water in terms of enjoyment. So far, knock on wood, the community is decent enough. I'm only at level 8 and taking my time questing. I think people who rush through to get to 50 are really missing out. There are some great story-line's and voice-acting here. I've already convinced three other people to buy the game. The subscription fee is necessary, in my opinion, to keep the game thriving. If it was f2p, I wouldn't even bother played it. You get what you pay for.
1.0	This was the worst set of head phones. they broke the second day, the wire at the conection that plugs in to the controller was not fasten properly so the wires inside was broken.
1.0	"This game is total disgrace to Playstation 2. First of all the graphic. Don't be fooled by the picture-shot in the backcover or anywhere else, once you start the game, you'll notice the blurry and horrible graphics. The graphic in this game is Akklaim graphic style. Remember blurry graphic in Burnout (also by Akklaim), this game worst. In the cover, it said \\""converted by Akklaim\\"" which mean Sega made this game and Akklaim convert it to horrible game. I should avoid it at the first time.<br />Second, the road length is very short. No, it very very short. And it almost impossible to finish. What the point of all of this? Very short track and very difficult. <BR>I give this game 1 star because it don't have negative star. In the scale of 0 to 10, I will give this game (negative)-5 star. I purchased this game this afternoon and now I'm ready to sell it back."
1.0	i recieved this disc and it was not the expansion pack i ordered but disc one fron the  original doom 3 game i was very disappointed i tried to load and it was already loaded because it was dico 1 from doom
5.0	"I purchased this for my grandson.  He love's it.  In his words, \\""it's awesome\\"".  He gave it 2 thumbs up."
5.0	A great representation of what the game creator of Devil May Cry envisioned for the sequel. Instead of a guy demon hunter, Kamiya, game director who also worked on other classic Capcom games like Biohazard 2 and the original Devil May Cry, goes in a different direction with a witch versus sages but with the same style and flash of Devil May Cry & Devil May Cry 4. Platinum Games show you why they shine like Platinum with great level of difficulty, classic styled gaming, extreme replay value that unlocks as you play and earn Platinum, in-game medals. You can even plug in codes to unlock rare weapons. Love to punch enemies in the face? Look no further.
5.0	excellent product fulfilled my expectations and the delivery was on time
5.0	This game is pretty difficult at times, you will die... a lot.  I really enjoyed playing as Luigi as he is controlled differently than mario.  He jumps higher but has a much harder time with traction.  It was well worth the price, the only complaint I have is that the map and boss battles were the same as NSMBU.  I never really had a problem with the 100 second time limit, you certainly need to move quickly but I never really felt rushed. I'd give this game an 8.5/10
1.0	With 2 new consoles out this year, this one slowly loses its value and it starts to get older. Sure, it has finally seen some good games at the end of 2001: Metal Gear Solid 2, Grand Theft Auto 3, and Final Fantasy X; but it took almost one and a half years for the PS2 to see at least a few games that are really worth getting the console for. <br />Right now, with two more gaming consoles released: Gamecube and Xbox, PS2 is going to get weaker and weaker after every new hit strikes any of the new systems. More game developers will be looking forward to make their games for the newer consoles because of their hardware capabilities, especially those of the Xbox's. Eventually, the great titles like Grand Theft Auto 3 and Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty for the PS2 will be ported to either GC or Xbox, maybe even both. The Xbox version of GTA3 is already scheduled for release in early 2002, and later that year, Metal Gear X, an improved MGS2, will also be released for Xbox. So the only good titles that are left exclusive for PS2 are the Final Fantasy series. <br />Xbox seems to beat PS2 in almost every way that counts. See why: Playstation 2 will have a 40GB hard drive, and additional [amt], while Xbox already has one built-in. It will soon have a broadband adapter for an additional cost, but Xbox already has one. Xbox also has 4 built-in controller ports - PS2 needs a separate multitap (around [amt]) accessory to get 2 more ports (it only has 2 built in). Playstation 2 REQUIRES a memory card (about [amt]) to save games, when the Xbox memory card is optional because the system already has the hard drive of its own to save games and to much more. Xbox though needs DVD Pack ([amt]) to play movies. PS2 can do it with the controller, but it is very uncomfortable. <BR>Anyway, check out the total costs of fully equipped consoles... <BR>Xbox: $330 <BR>PS2: [amt]<br />and if you want a remote for your PS2's DVD capabilities, that's another [amt]...OUCH!<br />Xbox is also 3 times more powerful than PS2.<br />Xbox already had some excellent titles at its launch, November 15th. Dead or Alive 3, Halo, Project Gotham, Amped, NFL Fever, Oddworld, the list goes on... There are more groundbreaking titles coming early in 2002. PS2, on the other hand, had much worse titles at its launch, ALL of them were pathetic.<br />As you might have noticed, I am not comparing PS2 with Gamecube. There is one good reason: Nintendo Gamecube was made for little kids, people under 12 years of age. It does have some games for the older audiences, but you will not see many realistic games for Gamecube, most of the games you can expect to see on the cube are going to be Mario games, Zelda, all of them will have cartoony graphics and gameplay only a die-hard Nintendo fan will like. By the way, GC does not have any significant technological advances, but a pretty good price - about [amt].<br />In conclusion, I would recommend the Xbox out of the three systems I have talked about in this review. Research any more info you find necessary on this Microsoft system. You will be convinced.<br />It is too late to buy the PlayStation2 Starter Pack because of its horrible value, aging tecnology, and a questionable future, and don't even think that Sony or ... are going to significantly lower the price.<br />P.S. - the rules at amazon.com do not allow the public to view some prices in my review, they were changed to [amt]
5.0	I just enjoyed the game play. Easy controls, zoom, trip bobby trap, tag enemy. Breath of fresh air for FPS. I have play game through normal and elite and found it to be easy to challenging. My son and I have played with each other on line playing the campaign and over-watch missions. Great co-op game as well. I highly recommend this game if you like FPS and snipers. Make sure you read the different types of controls to fast zoom, long distance zoom etc. to fully enjoy this game. I still think the WWII time period make the best games. Enjoy!
5.0	What can I say? It worked as advertised and allowed me to spend my entire 12 hour flight playing Little Big planet!
5.0	Fast Shipping, Great Product, 5 Stars all the Way!!!@@!!!
5.0	It is hard to find a good co-op two person game for younger kids, but this one is great.  My kids ages 4 and 6 have been playing this game together for months now.  Some of the challenges have required a little help from me, but the extensive free play opportunities have them exploring on their own when I can't help.
5.0	God damn hilarious game! Well worth the $60 I paid to it when it came out. If you like south park and video games this is worth it. Its like watching a south park episode except for the game aspect of it. Hilarious. I laughed way to much during this game. And I never laugh at games. A must have if you like south park.
5.0	"This game is similar to Sonic 2 with the graphics and scenery, but this time, Tails is playable. You have to go against Nack, Knuckles, and Eggman (hence the name \\""Triple Trouble\\"") as either Sonic or Tails to restore peace to South Island. This title for the Game Gear has an abundance of action with Sonic's new moves and Tails' ability to fly. This is also one of two games on Game Gear to feature Nack the Weasel, which shouldn't be restricted to the Archie Sonic the Hedgehog Comic Books. Nack the Weasel was also included in the arcade game Sonic the Fighters (which I only have in Sonic Gems Collection for the Gamecube because the arcade machine is impossible to find)as Fang the Sniper, and Sonic Drift 2 for the Game Gear as a racer. But this game shows how Nack can give Sonic hell as one of three bosses. This is truly a classic."
5.0	"First let me start by saying that no next generation system has reached its full potential yet. It takes time before developers learn the system. I believe that Microsoft put us into this next generation race. They just one day decided to stop making games for the original X box. Nintendo has criticized Microsoft in the past for always looking ahead and not developing for its current system. Sony probably could have waited before releasing a new system because of the PS2 being the leading console. So its going to be 2 to 3 years after these systems are out before we have games that are distinguished for the last generation.    We all know games are what is going to make the best system and the PS3 has a reputation for not having any good games. That just isn't true. The new releases offer many great titles. For example, \\""WarHawk\\"" is one of the among the best multiplier games ever. The games will come it is just going to take time. Recall that \\""Gears of War\\"" wasn't released till the 360 had been out 1 year.    Price is the second thing that the PS3 has a bad reputation for. The fact is you get more system for the price. With the 360 you have to buy a HD player, a memory card reader, online account, wireless adapter, etc. All that considering the 360 doesn't have very good backwards capability which just wastes all that money spent building a game collection.    As for Nintendo it is a big surprise. How can a system with little improved hardware over the Game Cube with a fancy controller out sell everything? I am not impressed with that controller. It does not have true 3D motion because your need motion sensing cameras to do that. The Wii just isn't for me, but so many people love the Wii. The PS3 has 6-axis tilt in the controller. It really isn't intended for an answer to the Wii remote, but it does have some good functionality. In WarHawk you can use it for steering the plane. I did a barrel roll and flew left and right - up and down all while aiming my weapons. That is a feat difficult if not impossible for a controller.    One thing that Microsoft did that I think distinguished there system is creating the XNA mod community. I have yet to  try it, but I hope Sony will follow the same direction. But the killer app for Sony (not considering WarHawk) since the beginning of its release have been that it has a fully functional Linux distro: \\""Yellow Dog Linux.\\"" That is why I first got interested in the system. Sony intended the PS3 to be a computer as well as a game system. At first you think why do I need to have my game system be a computer? Then you realize that since the Sega DreamCast people have been modding there systems to but an OS on it. We've always wanted it and now it is fully supported. This is what elevates the fun factor for me. I get a chance to learn Linux with fully packaged applications for everything from word processing to programming and I get to dream that I can program for the Cell processor.    So you see that the PS3 is an outstanding system. And the hardware is well worth the price. I saw on Gamasutra's website that a organization the forecasts business predicts that although the PS3 is in the last place at this time, next time this year they won't be. (That is based on business an not video game trends.) It will be fun to see which system wins. Also check out my review of the Wii and 360."
5.0	"I was a little critical when I researched this \\""Let's Yoga\\"" game for Nintendo DS. I was thinking that it might be difficult to have this platform to handle this type of program especially for someone who has practiced yoga before, but I was pleasantly surprised. Everyone can benefit from this great tool: beginners can learn about yoga and see detailed position descriptions and advanced yogi(ni) can have the DS create random workouts in the desired length. Great tool!"
5.0	Fast delivery and working great! Recommended!
5.0	My son was able to absorb himself into this exciting and fascinating adventure and this game is definitely one of hie favorites...
1.0	Didn't fit right. Unhappy about purchase
1.0	This controller was horrible. It was intended for call of duty but you couldn't sprint because the controller didn't work with the L3  function, making it impossible to sprint. Is only aPS3 in sight, not in functionality
5.0	It was very inexpensive, $15 to start before shipping. Its got adjustable dpi settings, which is excellent, because I like my dpi setting higher than a standard mouse but not extremely high like very expensive razor mice often are. It is extremely comfortable to use and the buttons are easy to reach and use. I can't complain that the instructions are in Chinese since I bet these were from a lot that were built for a different market, but I was able to look at the pictures and figure out what the buttons do, and plugging it in, it was ready to go and I've been using it ever since.
5.0	All he does is play this game. Good for him... Bad for me (:
5.0	MAN THIS GAME IS SO MUCH FUN! You first spawn with a pistol and 2 grenades. You can pick up weapons by just looking at what color code they are in! There are Jeeps, Tanks, APCs(Broken Mirror Booster Pack), Dropships(Omega Dawn Booster Pack), and to be yet to be comfirmed, Jetpacks! xD Alot of maps and vehicles too! 5 Words: Get ready to get PWNED!
5.0	I had no idea that micro-managing would ever be so much fun.  I love the co-op side.  Thanks my darling for getting this.
5.0	Fun fun game.  Brilliant colors, fun action sequences.  Just a fun game and you can't beat the price.
5.0	I'm not all that far into the game , but this already might be my favorite RPG of all time . What happens if you combine the active battle system of Tales and the creature raising of Pokemon , you get this . The music is top notch ,  the art is amazing , and to top it off the story is one of the most engaging I've ever experienced .<br /><br />Now Tales of  Symphonia 2 , dawn of the new world had a creature system too , but it was very bad  since you ended up brorowing characters from the original game only to have them leave when needed . This game does creature raising right. I'm not going to say anything else about the gameplay aside from one thing wish I really REALLY wish other RPGs would do... Ever get stuck right before a boss battle , only to basically be screwed since you have no items and no way to get past said boss ? The developers here added a few tricks to make sure that doesn't happen . Everything is very straight forward , no more getting lost trying to figure out what to do next . At the same time theirs more than enough side quest to stretch things out if you so wish .<br /><br />At 20 it's a no brainer , if you life JRPGS buy this now .
5.0	Very nice mouse and great bargain. For the price I'm extremely satisfied with this device. The weights were a nice touch that i didn't realize came with.
5.0	Very happy. Responds well.
5.0	This game is just as good as all the Medal of Honor games. Non stop action makes you feel like you are on the battle flelds of the deserts of kuwait and Iraq and the city of Baghdad. I like the fact that you can command a squad of 3 other soldiers all at the same time or 1 or 2 soldiers. This is a true game you can team fight to kill the enemy from the front,back or from the left and right sides. You can call in air strikes, use C-4 charges, tank mines, anti-tank rocket launcher just to name a few. You can also drive jeeps and tanks. All the soldiers under your command can get promotions and go up in rank if they perform exceptionally well in each mission. I can't wait until Gotham Games comes out with another war game. This game is great and is a must for everyone.
5.0	Yes silent hill is back and rocking. This game is sweet. The story is sick. I was hesitant after homecoming but this new team did a good job with this game. I hope book of memories turns out better than what I have seen but at least this game came out well.
5.0	Charges controllers well, charges fast. And I no longer have to keep my PS4 powered in to charge the controllers!
5.0	Came as I read thanks
5.0	When i first put this game into my Xbox, i thought it was just going to be another Japanese games filled with cliches. The game starts off a bit weird and the storyline leading to the first boss is pretty weak, so i thought i would give it a few more days and if it didn't become interesting, i would give it up. Well quickly after this happens, it gets really detailed and in depth. The storyline is very very unique and the grapics are absolutely amazing.       The fighting is a bit simplistic and sometimes you die somewhat often, but it just adds to the excitement of gameplay- watching out for things that'll kill you. However, you can connect with other party members to perform special attacks, and with around 16 computer plays that you can put into your group (4 at a time) the possabilities are seemingly endless. The only other con I can think of is that they didn't adjust movements of the mouth when transfering it to English, so the mouths never match up with what they're saying. There is such a great storyline though, sometimes you don't even realize it.      Overall, Infinie Undiscovery is definately a game you should look into.
5.0	This is a great game. So much fun and being coop just makes it that much better. I great family game to get some of your frustrations out. lol Overall i give it a A.
5.0	Great product, Great service and Super fast shipping.    This is a MUST HAVE for any expert drum player. I was one of those who thought my flimsy plastic pedal would never break on me, and after 4 months it finally snapped. This is a great investment and it does not break your wallet at all.    why wait 3-6 weeks for a new pedal from EA when you can wait less then a week to rock out again.
5.0	While this may not be the very best Mario Party it is still a Mario game, and therefore the gameplay is excellent. Great for a adults and kids.
5.0	Since weather does not permit, FSX is a great substitute, though it's still easier to fly the real thing.  FSX installed into Vista HP without tweaks,setting resolutions and mapping switches on the Logitech E3DPro joystick without problems.  Rod Machado's flight lessons and the Missions are great!  Since I've flown actual training in the Reno-Tahoe area, the soaring tutorial mission at Minden was outstanding, except that I couldn't get breakast at the cafe.  The additional $ for the deluxe edition is worthwhile, and even at low-res, I have been able to recognize the terrain features from earlier travels through the real landscapes.  Dell Inspiron 1501, AMD Turion 64x2 TL56, 2GB RAM with Logitech Extreme 3D Pro joystick.  The money I saved over the Saitek X52 and pedals is going toward avgas.  (Flour bombing seems easier from an actual airplane, too;>)  I'm still working at it, which explains why only four stars on the fun; training is fun, but also a lot of work.
5.0	I purchased two of these - initially, there was an overlook with the quantity of my order and I only received one. However, MightySkins was quick to oblige me with the shipment of another, I am quite pleased with the consideration and communication of this merchant. The item itself is a great way to add some flare to your PS4 controller - the application needs to be done precisely and with care to ensure proper alignment, I recommend using a thin tool or instrument of sorts to assist you (using just your fingers may make things difficult/more time consuming). With that said, once the vinyl is in place it looks great!
5.0	Very simply Red Alert 3 is a wonderfully colorful game.  You can tell the amount of money and effort put into the game.  If you are looking for the familiar elements (over the top B-movie acting, the familiar Cold War alternate history [albeit with the Japanese...er, Rising Sun thrown in this time], skirmish/campaign/online games, and the build a base/collect/mass/attack format).  The unit veterancy system remains similar to RA2.  However, units now have alternate abilities.  Especially the Rising Sun units which tend to be in the Robotech/Transformers vein.<br /><br />A major addition to this series in RA3 is the amphibious aspect.  Structures, vehicles, and personnel take to the sea and add to the overall battle.  Units are pretty balanced and the three factions have unique properties.  At times the amphibious side throws you off a bit when you see an engineer on a jet ski, in a zodiac, or on a segway looking thing going after a building capture.<br /><br />I am not so sure why there is are so many reviews that target the anti-piracy aspects of the game.  I have had zero issues with SecuROM.  Red Alert 3 installed without any problems on my lap top.  Good to have the RA series back after a 7-year hiatus.
5.0	Kids love to see themselves on the tv. The interaction is done very well. The replay value with this game is very high though. There are no variables with it. Each time you play a mini game its the same outcome no matter what you do.
5.0	I really liked this game, the quality was the same as if you bought it the store..  Great game to play.
5.0	If you enjoy puzzle games, check this game out! its very fun, and its original! a must have for your DS collection!!!
5.0	First off, let's get this out of the way: this is not Final Fantasy Tactics or its Advance counterpart. I do not understand why people like to compare these two titles. Final Fantasy Tactics did not event the tactical rpg genre; I believe that belongs to the Fire Emblem series (they've been around in Japan since the late 80's). Also, I had more of a fun time playing this game than I did with Final Fantasy Tactics Advance. Another thing is, when this game was released back in August, the only tactical rpg for the ds at the time was Hoshigami Remix (which isn't too bad either). It's not going to be sometime till next year before we get a hold of Final Fantasy Tactics Advance 2 here in the US. Now with that out of the way, let's talk about Luminous Arc.<br />Like I said before, this game is great. Not the best, but great nonetheless. Let's talk about the story first. Don't worry, I'm not giving away spoilers, but this isn't the best or most original story in the genre (then again, most stories in the rpg genre aren't, so that's not saying much). It comes off hilarious, though not necessarily in a good way. Even though, the characters, their development, and their dialogs are all pretty good, and can be funny a lot of the times. In fact, I found this to be more of the reason to keep going on in the game, just to see what would become of them. Though one thing about the dialoges I don't like is the redundent speaches they give. In fact, I don't think I've ever played the game with so much talking, with alot of it pointless and repetitive.<br />Anyway, then there is the gameplay. I like it a lot. It's easy to learn and use (especially if you love these types of games). Even though their is no class system in the game, it doesn't really hurt the game, as it gives the characters a more distinct personallity. Even though it's an easy game to control for the most part, using the stylus can be a problem every now and again because for some strang reason you can't select certian targets that are within range. This isn't a bad problem as it doesn't happen often. But when it does come up, just switch to the directional pad controls (which is cool, because you can do this on the fly, even during battle).<br />Finally, there are the graphics and music/sound. This is some of the best 2-D graphics that I've seen, and it's also a bright game too. My only complaint is why the designers didn't make the battle stages in rotatable 3-D. This isn't real bad, because the 2-D stages never affect the gameplay. Also, their is a cool animated intro to the game. As for the music, it's great, and one of the best things of the game. Another cool thing is the voice acting. The acting can be a tad melodramatic at times, but it does add personality to the characters. I was suprised that VO was even in the game.<br />So, is this game for you? Well, if you want to get into the tactical rpg genre, then yes. If you are a veteran of the aforementioned genre, yes again. If you think that Final Fantasy Tactics and it's Advance counterpart are the be all and end all of the genre, and nothing can even come close to them, then no, you won't like this game at all. It's not the most original or the best in the genre, but it's good, darn good. Definitely the money it's worth.s that are within range. This isn't a bad problem as it doesn't happen often. But when it does come up, just switch to the directional pad controls (which is cool, because you can do this on the fly, even during battle).  Finally, there are the graphics and music/sound.

5.0	This is an excellent exercise video.  It requires you to be active. It is easy to catch on. It has many different versions so in one year I have not learned all the sessions. I love it. It is very motivating.
1.0	Didn't realise that it was for Wii U.<br />Please ensure that you double check when you make the final order.
1.0	I've spent about 5 hours hacking and slashing through the first chapter of this game, and while ultimately somewhat fun, it just further reinforces my decision. This product makes me feel like:<br /><br />1: A potential criminal, not a valued customer.<br />2: Former WoW player, not a former Diablo 2 player.<br /><br />Major problems I have are:<br /><br />1: Lame online-only DRM scheme, which they 'claimed' was to provide key features, most of which don't really matter.<br />2: I don't actually own the game, I'm just borrowing it from them for $60 (Big surprise these days)<br />3: I'm alone, unless I wish to play with real friends. Somehow, despite the online-only approach, Its actually more difficult to enjoy the game multiplayer. In their attempt to fix all the quirks of closed battle.net Diablo 2 and prevent cheating (Quirks which the majority of us LOVED by the way), they've just made the game feel too restrictive and clunky.<br />4: I can't let my wife or kids play, because of shared Stash/gold/achievements/questlines/storyprogress/etc (You think we're going to shell out $240 for this game? They all happily went back to Skyrim and Kirby)<br /><br />The list goes on. I will get some portion of my $60 investment back by going through this game with a few friends, and I'm sure I'll have fun. But make no mistake, I will not be purchasing Diablo 4, Starcraft 3 (Didn't buy 2 either), WoW 2, Warcraft 4, or any other game this company creates. I spent the later portion of my childhood enjoying the heck out of Warcraft 2, Diablo and Starcraft, and the creative minds behind those games have long since departed us. There are enough really fun games coming out these days that I don't have to waste future time and money on the next WoW-inspired Blizzard/Activision attempt to fool me.
5.0	This came very quickly, my grandson and I have a great time playing the Skylander Giants game. He has one at his house and I have mine at my house to when he comes over he can beat me (he gets more practice)
5.0	This is one of those games you just simply don't wish to stop playing , you truly want the story to keep going.<br />I was surprised and excited to see the level of emotion and surreal graphics involved in the making of the sequel to one of my favorite games.<br />The first was good but the second  will grab you and keep you involved .<br />I have played easy then normal then  hard and next difficult or uber.<br />you will enjoy the story and the level of involvement you find of the main character in this game will grab you right away .<br />be ready for a thrill ride all the way to the end.<br />you want this game .
1.0	Is not wireless i have to keep it plugged in so that i can use it.
5.0	For a console action RPG I couldn't find anything wrong with this game. Never encountered any bugs. Lots of exploration. Combat is fun. Plenty of humor. Only thing I didn't care for was blacksmithing and bartending. Tedious but I needed the money (sounds like several jobs I've had). Fable 2 for me was a winner.
5.0	i really enjoyed this game as it is very for all of you karaoke go'ers, LOL. the songs like, everywhere and dust in the wind are fun to sing along as is what i like about you, and here i go again, trust me buy this game and you'll be very happy...
5.0	I bought this game based off the reviews here in Amazon.  My 7-year-old and my 3-year-old love playing this together.  It's great that they can battle the enemy aliens together and promote their teamwork.  I love watching them and hearing them discuss their attack strategies and what alien they plan on being.  Great buy.
1.0	I bought this hoping to use it with my Mac. Nowhere does the packaging say that you need to install a driver which is unavailable for Macs online and comes with a mini disc that you can't insert into an Apple computer. This was a giant pain and waste of shipping cost.
5.0	This game is great, except for one thing.  Once you have begun a season or franchise, it is imposible to control any team except the one you have chosen.  In next year's version, players MUST be able to control ALL teams during a season.  With all the trades, injuries, etc. that go on during the season, the teams are constantly changing line-ups.  For example, my season is no fun now, because I have to face players like Randy Johnson, Curt Schilling, and others that haven't even played most of the year.  If you want to change this, you have to start the season completely over.  And once you do this, there will just be another trade or injury in real life, causing the vicious circle.  PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE, we must be able to control ALL teams during a season or franchise mode.  Have I made this clear???  One more thing...  Where the heck is Damian Miller???  He's not even listed as a free agent.  Final suggestion - make an UPDATED version later in the year, with the teams reflecting real life.  I would buy an updated version right now, so I don't always have to risk losing the players that I had to create.
5.0	I'm not a big football fan, but I saw this at a local thrift store for only $2.50 and I had to buy it. The game has great graphics and you can play preseason and season games. You can even choose which team you want to be. I picked the Kansas City Chiefs as that is only way they are ever going to win a season.
5.0	This was an awesome addition to the Baldur's Gate saga. More creatures, battles, and abilities are never a bad thing when talking about one of the best computer rpg's of all time.    The only thing that I didn't care for was how this expansion had a more linear feel to it than the previous three games, but it wasn't enough of a deterrent to cause me to lower the score.    If you are one of the five people that hasn't played this game, I recommend you get your hands on it any way you can.
